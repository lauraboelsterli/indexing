    "text": "May 25 (Reuters) - Stock futures on Friday pointed to a higher opening for Canada's main stock index that has recorded three consecutive days of losses, mainly due to drop in oil prices hurting energy shares. However, gold prices steadied after breaking above $1,300 an ounce in the previous session. June futures on the S&P/TSX index were up 0.08 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. Data on Canada's budget balance for March is due today. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX fell 20.18 points, or 0.13 percent, to 16,113.62, registering a third straight day of losses.
