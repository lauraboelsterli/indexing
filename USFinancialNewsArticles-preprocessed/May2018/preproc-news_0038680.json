    "text": "57 COMMENTS UNITED NATIONS—The U.S. mounted a lone defense of Israel at the United Nations Security Council, as other countries condemned the Jewish state for failing to restrain its security forces, which shot and killed some 60 people and injured more than 1,000 during protests on Monday.\nFourteen members of the Security Council on Tuesday criticized what they called an “excessive use of force against unarmed civilians” and called on Israel to defend its border with a more proportionate response. No Israeli soldier was killed during the violence.\n“Israel has a responsibility to calibrate its use of force,” said Nickolay Mladenov, U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace. “It must protect its borders, but must do so proportionately.”\nTuesday’s Security Council meeting began with diplomats standing to observe a moment of silence both for the victims of Monday’s violence and for all Palestinian and Israeli victims of the decadeslong conflict.\nThousands of protesters were injured at the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel ahead of the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Kuwait said it planned to circulate a resolution on Wednesday condemning the violence and calling for international protection of Palestinians because Israel as “the occupying power failed its responsibilities” to protect Palestinian civilians.\nKuwait had also drafted a proposed Council presidential statement that condemned the violence and called for Israel to restrain its forces.\nThe draft resolution also calls for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres to set up an independent investigative committee to determine what led to the increased level of violence and who was to blame, diplomats said. The U.N. Human Rights Council will meet on Friday in Geneva on the topic.\nThe U.S., which has defended Israel’s right to protect its borders by using live ammunition, blocked the presidential statement and is expected to veto the pending resolution. The Trump administration’s position at the U.N. has been to consistently defend Israel on issues including settlement expansion, the status of Jerusalem and the use of force against Palestinians.\nU.S. officials maintain that the U.N. and the Security Council is biased against Israel. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, since arriving in January 2017, has sought to shift a monthly Council debate from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to broader regional issues, such as the role of Iran and the militant Hezbollah movement.\nMs. Haley adhered to that stance on Tuesday, criticizing the Council for holding a meeting on Gaza but not one on Iran’s destabilizing role in the region.\n“Who among us would accept this type of activity on your border? No one would. No country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has,” Ms. Haley said. She walked out of the chamber when Palestinian Ambassador to the U.N. Riyad Mansour started to speak.\nMs. Haley’s comments put her at odds with just about every other member of the Council and drew sharp criticism from European allies, who said it was the Council’s rightful place to discuss the violence.\nMr. Mansour later told reporters: “Enough is enough.…Security Council continues to be paralyzed and this is unacceptable and outrageous. Fourteen members were on one side and one member of the Security Council [the U.S.] is still not getting it.”\nIsrael maintains that Hamas, the political and militant group that controls Gaza, is responsible for provoking the violence and that Israel has the right to protect its borders .\nIsrael’s ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, told reporters ahead of the meeting that the U.S. Embassy opening in Jerusalem on Monday was part of “Palestinian excuses for violence against Israel.”\nPalestinian protesters wave as they stand next to a large Palestinian flag with tear-gas canisters falling above them, during a demonstration near the border with Israel east of Jabalia in the central Gaza Strip on May 15.

Palestinians said since the protests at the Gaza crossing began in March nearly 100 have been killed and 11,000 injured.\nAfter the Council meeting ended, representatives of the European Union and U.N.’s Arab group took part in a press briefing with the Palestinians in a show of solidarity. Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally of Mr. Trump, called for an independent U.N. investigation and for peace talks to resume.\n“The violence in Gaza yesterday was appalling and shocking,” U.K. Ambassador Karen Pierce told the Council.\nFrance said the U.N. had warned that U.S.’s decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem would spark violence and unrest.\n“I believe the U.S. decision on Jerusalem and the retreat from the [Iran nuclear agreement] are the best illustrations of the Jacksonian moment the U.S. is going through: a mix of unilateralism and isolationism, or ‘uni-solationism,’ ” said France’s U.N. ambassador, François Delattre.\nWrite to Farnaz Fassihi at farnaz.fassihi@wsj.com",
