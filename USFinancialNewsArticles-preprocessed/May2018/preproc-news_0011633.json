    "text": "BELLEVUE, Wash., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Esterline Corporation (NYSE:ESL) ( www.esterline.com ), a leading specialty manufacturer serving global aerospace and defense markets, today announced that Donald Walther will join Esterline as Executive Vice President & General Counsel, succeeding Marcia Mason who will retire from the company after a career spanning 35 years, 25 of which were spent with Esterline.\nDonald Walther, Executive Vice President & General Counsel\nEsterline Chief Executive Officer Curtis Reusser said, “Marcia has been a core member of the Esterline leadership team for more than two decades, heading our legal team for the past five years and as HR executive prior to that. Her vast knowledge and experience with the law combined with her natural inclination to put people first has bolstered our culture of trust and respect and positively informed many of our key business decisions.

Previously, Walther served as Deputy General Counsel for ITT Corporation and Counsel for The Boeing Company. He was also a partner with Perkins Coie LLP. Throughout his career, he has held a number of governance roles with community organizations.\nWalther graduated from Duke University and went on to earn a JD and MBA from the University of Chicago. He is the recipient of several industry and leadership awards and is a Six Sigma Green Belt with extensive experience in Strategic Goal Deployment.\nAbout Esterline:\nEsterline Corporation is a leading worldwide supplier to the aerospace and defense industry specializing in three core business segments: Advanced Materials; Avionics & Controls; and Sensors & Systems. With annual sales of approximately $2 billion, Esterline employs roughly 13,000 people worldwide and is headquartered in Bellevue, Wash.\nOperations within the Advanced Materials segment focus on technologies including high-temperature-resistant materials and components used for a wide range of military and commercial aerospace purposes, and combustible ordnance and electronic warfare countermeasure products.\nOperations within the Avionics & Controls segment focus on technology interface systems for commercial and military aircraft and similar devices for land- and sea-based military vehicles, integrated cockpit systems, display technologies for avionics, training and simulation markets, secure communications systems, specialized medical equipment, and other high-end industrial applications.\nThe Sensors & Systems segment includes operations that produce high-precision temperature and pressure sensors, specialized harsh-environment connectors, electrical power distribution equipment, and other related systems principally for aerospace and defense customers.\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
