Currently a doctoral candidate in American History at the American University in Washington, D.C., Kitterman is uniquely qualified to help research and share Utah women’s history in creative ways. Most recently, Kitterman was a research assistant at Leavitt Partners and adjunct professor for the Church History and Doctrine Department at Brigham Young University.\n“Better Days 2020 is thrilled to welcome Katherine to our team as Historical Director,” said Better Days 2020 CEO Neylan McBaine. “With her subject matter expertise in Utah women’s history from her dissertation at American University and her experience at the Smithsonian Institution, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and other historical destinations, we feel like Katherine will be an exceptional resource as we highlight the unique and diverse stories of historical Utah women and their leadership. She is clearly a historian who can synthesize all of the details of names, dates and places, and bring them to life and make them applicable to a mainstream audience.”\nThe Better Days 2020 campaign is comprised of strategic educational, legislative and creative initiatives, including the development of a Utah women’s history curriculum for 4 th , 5 th , 7 th and 11 th grades; a historic downtown suffrage experience and walking tour of significant suffragist sites; and management efforts with Utah’s federal delegation to pass a bipartisan resolution giving Salt Lake City, Utah, its rightful claim as a major player in the suffrage movement; among other key projects.\nAbout Better Days 2020\nBetter Days 2020 is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to popularizing Utah women’s history. The year 2020 commemorates women’s history in Utah, celebrating the Utah Territory women’s first vote in 1870, as well as the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted all U.S. women the right to vote. Recently, Better Days 2020 was named 2018 Best of State winner in the Education/Advocacy Organization category.
