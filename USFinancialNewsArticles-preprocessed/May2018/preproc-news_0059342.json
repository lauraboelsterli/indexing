(www.htafc.com)\n“The relationship Christoph, Andy and I have with (chairman) Dean (Hoyle), the rest of the board, the staff and the supporters is special.\n“We’ve achieved some incredible things together in two and a half years and now I’m excited about the future.”\nWagner, who joined the club from Borussia Dortmund II in 2015, kept Huddersfield in the Championship (second tier) before securing their top flight return through the playoffs in 2017 after a 45-year absence.\nAll three still had a year to run on their existing contracts with the club, who finished 16th in the Premier League last season, four points clear of the drop zone.
