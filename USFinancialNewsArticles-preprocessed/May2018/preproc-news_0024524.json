The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young\nDennis Muilenburg, who spoke at a luncheon for the Economic Club in Washington, D.C., also said the company continues to make progress in its talks to buy Brazil’s Embraer ( EMBR3.SA ), adding the deal is not something Boeing “must do.” Reporting by Mike Stone; Editing by Marguerita Choy",
