Myriad has been notified of a commercial coverage decision from a top-20, mid-Atlantic payer. Presented data from the largest-ever pharmacogenomics clinical study in patients with moderate-to-very severe depression at the American Psychiatric Association annual meeting in New York City, demonstrating that patients were 50 percent more likely to achieve remission and 30 percent more likely to respond to treatment when their medication selection was guided by the GeneSight Psychotropic genetic test. Submitted the randomized controlled trial study manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal and anticipate publication around the end of fiscal year 2018. Submitted manuscripts for the IMPACT study and a second major health economic study utilizing the Optum Healthcare Solutions dataset.\n• Vectra DA ®\nRevenue increased 34 percent year-over-year in the quarter with volumes growing in the double-digits on a sequential basis. Initiated plans to move the Vectra DA customer service group and commercial laboratory to our Salt Lake City headquarters with plans to complete both moves by the end of fiscal year 2019.\n• Prolaris ®\nRevenue in the quarter increased 91 percent year-over-year to $6.5 million and test volumes grew 10 percent sequentially. NCCN issued new guidelines supporting Prolaris as standard of care for treatment decisions in patients with low and favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer. The guidelines also support the broad use of hereditary cancer testing in 40,000 specific prostate cancer patients diagnosed every year in the United States and support the use of biomarkers such as myChoice ® HRD Plus to identify prostate cancer patients for targeted therapies. American Association of Clinical Urology and the Large Urology Group Practice Association, that represent 70 percent of urologists in the country, issued a position paper supporting the new NCCN guidelines. Received positive medical policy recommendations for Prolaris in the quarter from 14 Medicaid states, first Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and several regional payers.\n• EndoPredict ®\nReported $2.3 million in the quarter an increase of 15 percent sequentially. Received final Medicare local coverage decision from Noridian which became effective on January 30 increasing total coverage to approximately 90 percent of the United States market. One of the largest private insurers in the United States has expanded its coverage policy on EndoPredict to aid in the clinical decision of whether or not to extend adjuvant hormonal therapy beyond five years of treatment.\n• Companion Diagnostics\nReceived Food and Drug Administration approval for BRACAnalysis ® CDx as a companion diagnostic in conjunction with AstraZeneca’s Lynparza (olaparib) for HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Launched BRACAnalysis CDx to approximately 3,000 oncologists who treat greater than two-thirds of metastatic breast cancer and saw a 70 percent increase in metastatic breast cancer testing in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.\n• International\nReceived a revised draft guidance document from the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) which includes EndoPredict as one of three approved breast cancer prognostic tests. Initiated a restructuring to shift all laboratory developed testing to United States laboratories which will lead to closing the laboratory in Munich Germany and the sale of the German Clinic. Received pre-market approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare for our BRACAnalysis CDx test for HER2- metastatic breast cancer.\nFiscal Year 2018 Financial Guidance\nBelow is a table summarizing Myriad’s fiscal year 2018 financial guidance:\nRevenue GAAP Diluted\nEarnings Per\nShare Adjusted Earnings\nPer Share Fiscal Year 2018 $771-$773\nmillion $1.87-$1.89 $1.19-$1.21 These projections are forward-looking statements and are subject to the risks summarized in the safe harbor statement at the end of this press release.

Management believes that presentation of operating results using non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company’s core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and to manage the Company’s business. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached schedules.\nFollowing is a description of the adjustments made to GAAP financial measures:\nAcquisition – amortization of intangible assets: Represents recurring amortization charges resulting from the acquisition of intangible assets, including developed technology and database rights. Acquisition – integration related costs: Costs related to closing and integration of acquired companies Tax impact related to equity compensation: Changes in effective tax rate based upon ASU 2016-09 Potential future consideration related to acquisitions: Non-cash expenses related to valuation adjustments of earn-out and milestone payments tied to recent acquisitions Impairment of Raindance Investment: One-time impairment charge associated with Myriad’s investment in Raindance Technologies One-time debt restructuring costs: Charges related to the restructuring of the company’s debt from a one-year term loan to a revolving credit facility One-time non-deductible costs: One-time non-deductible tax items Tax reform impact on deferred taxes: One-time non-cash charges associated with change in value of our deferred tax assets due to tax reform Elevate 2020 costs: Expenses tied to Elevate 2020 program\nThe Company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Non-GAAP financial results are reported in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the Three and Nine Months ended March 31, 2018 (Unaudited data in millions, except per share amount) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Mar 31, 2018 Mar 31, 2017 Mar 31, 2018 Mar 31, 2017 Revenue $ 193.5 $ 196.9 $ 577.7 $ 570.9 GAAP Cost of molecular diagnostic testing $ 36.8 $ 37.9 $ 110.7 $ 109.5 GAAP Cost of pharmaceutical and clinical services 7.3 6.4 20.7 19.1 Elevate 2020 costs (0.2 ) - (0.2 ) - Non-GAAP COGS $ 43.9 $ 44.3 $ 131.2 $ 128.6 Non-GAAP Gross Margin 77 % 78 % 77 % 77 % GAAP Research and Development $ 18.5 $ 17.6 $ 53.1 $ 55.6 Acquisition - Integration related costs (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Acquisition - amortization of intangible assets - - (0.3 ) (0.2 ) Elevate 2020 costs (1.0 ) - (1.1 ) - Non-GAAP R&D $ 17.4 $ 17.5 $ 51.6 $ 55.2 GAAP Contingent Consideration $ (1.2 ) $ 5.2 $ (61.3 ) $ 2.0 Potential future consideration related to acquisitions 1.2 (5.2 ) 61.3 (2.0 ) Non-GAAP Contingent Consideration $ - $ - $ - $ - GAAP Selling, General and Administrative $ 115.1 $ 122.1 $ 345.5 $ 354.3 Acquisition - Integration related costs (0.3 ) (1.8 ) (0.3 ) (12.8 ) Acquisition - amortization of intangible assets (9.2 ) (9.2 ) (27.5 ) (23.6 ) Elevate 2020 costs (2.0 ) - (4.7 ) - Non-GAAP SG&A $ 103.6 $ 111.1 $ 313.0 $ 317.9 GAAP Operating Income $ 17.0 $ 7.7 $ 109.0 $ 30.4 Acquisition - Integration related costs 0.4 1.9 0.4 13.0 Acquisition - amortization of intangible assets 9.2 # 9.2 27.8 23.8 Elevate 2020 costs 3.2 - 6.0 - Potential future consideration related to acquisitions (1.2 ) 5.2 (61.3 ) 2.0 Non-GAAP Operating Income $ 28.6 $ 24.0 $ 81.9 $ 69.2 Non-GAAP Operating Margin 15 % 12 % 14 % 12 % GAAP Net Income Attributable to Myriad Genetics, Inc.
