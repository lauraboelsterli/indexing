Indivior said it planned to share sales data from the second quarter this year.\n“We expect the early promise of the launch to translate into accelerating prescription trends in the coming quarters and our confidence that Sublocade will achieve at least $1 billion in peak annual net revenue has been further strengthened,” Chief Executive Shaun Thaxter said.
