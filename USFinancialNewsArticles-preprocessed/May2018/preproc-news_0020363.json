    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Essential Energy Services Ltd. (TSX:ESN) (“Essential” or the “Company”) announces first quarter results.\nSELECTED INFORMATION Three months ended (in thousands of dollars except per share, March 31, percentages, hours and fleet data) 2018 2017 Revenue $ 60,134 $ 56,250 Gross margin 12,470 14,394 Gross margin % 21 % 26% EBITDAS (1) from continuing operations 9,145 10,206 Net income from continuing operations 5,053 3,480 Per share – basic and diluted 0.04 0.02 Net income 5,053 3,150 Per share – basic and diluted 0.04 0.02 Operating hours Coil tubing rigs 16,170 16,420 Pumpers 20,439 18,653 As at March 31, 2018 2017 Total assets $ 241,472 $ 227,646 Long-term debt 31,943 18,169 Equipment fleet (i) Coil tubing rigs 30 31 Pumpers 26 32 (i) Fleet data represents the number of units at the end of the period. 1 Refer to “Non-IFRS Measures” section for further information. HIGHLIGHTS\nManagement is pleased with first quarter 2018 revenue and EBITDAS (1) . Revenue was $60.1 million, a 7% increase compared to the first quarter 2017, with strong activity experienced by Essential Coil Well Service (“ECWS”) and Tryton. EBITDAS (1) was $9.1 million, $1.1 million lower than the first quarter 2017 due primarily to margin compression in ECWS.\nKey operating highlights include:\nECWS revenue increased $3.9 million compared to the first quarter 2017. The revenue gains were offset by increased operating costs, specifically labour, fuel and repairs and maintenance costs, which could not be recovered through customer prices resulting in margin compression. Operating hours from the Generation III coil tubing rigs, quintuplex fluid pumpers and nitrogen pumpers increased compared to the first quarter 2017. ECWS gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 19%, a significant improvement compared to the sequential fourth quarter 2017. Tryton continued to experience strong demand for its conventional tools and Multi-Stage Fracturing System ® (“MSFS ® ”). Conventional tools revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 exceeded the same prior year period due to maintenance work on existing producing wells and well abandonments as customers look for ways to reduce costs and improve cash flow. Tryton’s Hybrid MSFS ® was used to complete the deepest well drilled to-date in western Canada. The well, located in the Montney region of Alberta, had a measured depth of 7,848 metres including a 5,000 metre horizontal section.\nAt March 31, 2018, Essential’s debt outstanding was $31.9 million and funded debt (1) to bank EBITDA (1) was 1.8x. Debt increased $14.0 million from December 31, 2017 to fund working capital (1) , primarily an increase in accounts receivable due to higher first quarter activity. Debt is expected to decline through the second quarter as customers pay their accounts. Working capital (1) was $70.0 million on March 31, 2018, exceeding debt by $38.1 million. On May 8, 2018, there was $28.9 million of debt outstanding.\nINDUSTRY OVERVIEW\nFirst quarter 2018 activity in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry was similar to the first quarter 2017 even though the price of oil averaged approximately U.S. $63 per barrel (West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”)) for the first quarter 2018, an increase from U.S. $52 per barrel WTI for the first quarter 2017. Many Canadian exploration and production (“E&P”) companies did not fully realize this increase due to transportation constraints to move heavy oil to market. Canadian natural gas prices were also lower than the first quarter 2017 due to market access constraints. Well completions and wells drilled, key indicators of industry activity in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (“WCSB”) increased 9% and declined 2%, respectively, compared to the first quarter 2017.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSegment Results – Essential Coil Well Service (in thousands of dollars, Three months ended March 31, except percentages, hours and fleet data) 2018 2017 Revenue $ 32,574 $ 28,719 Operating expenses 26,351 21,354 Gross margin $ 6,223 $ 7,365 Gross margin % 19 % 26% Operating hours Coil tubing rigs 16,170 16,420 Pumpers 20,439 18,653 Equipment fleet (i) Coil tubing rigs 30 31 Fluid pumpers 19 21 Nitrogen pumpers 7 11 (i) Fleet data represents the number of units at the end of the period. ECWS revenue was $32.6 million, a 13% increase compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Increased revenue was due to higher revenue per hour and increased fluid pumping and nitrogen activity. Revenue per hour varies from period to period based on the type of equipment used and work being performed. Pricing for coil tubing rigs and pumpers has remained stable following price increases implemented during the first quarter 2017.\nCoil tubing rig operating hours were strong and consistent with the prior year period as Generation III coil tubing rigs continued to experience high demand, with activity weighted towards long-reach horizontal well completions in the Duvernay and Montney regions. Pumper activity increased due to demand for quintuplex fluid pumpers, which were often paired with the Generation III coil tubing rigs. Increased nitrogen pumper activity was due to supporting coil tubing rigs on customer completions where well conditions required more nitrogen to enhance well performance.\nGross margin was 19% for the first quarter 2018 compared to 26% for the first quarter 2017. Gross margin compression was due to the inability to increase customer pricing to offset higher labour, fuel and repairs and maintenance costs. Higher labour costs were due to wage increases implemented during 2017 to retain employees and an increase in the number of employees to meet customer demand. Increased fuel prices and consumption resulted in higher fuel costs. Prior year gross margin was higher due to lower operating costs at a time when industry activity began to improve from the lows reached in 2016.\nFirst quarter 2018 gross margin showed significant improvement from the sequential fourth quarter 2017 as ECWS was well prepared for first quarter activity following the investment made during the fourth quarter 2017 to re-activate equipment and recruit and train a larger workforce.\nSegment Results – Tryton Three months ended March 31, (in thousands of dollars, except percentages) 2018 2017 Revenue $ 27,560 $ 27,531 Operating expenses 20,713 20,055 Gross margin $ 6,847 $ 7,476 Gross margin % 25 % 27% Tryton revenue – % of revenue Tryton MSFS ® 47 % 59% Conventional Tools & Rentals 53 % 41% Tryton experienced strong demand in its Canadian and U.S. operations in the first quarter 2018. Revenue was $27.6 million, consistent with the same period in 2017. In Canada, conventional tools revenue increased compared to the first quarter 2017 as Tryton’s customers increased spending on producing wells and well abandonment activities. MSFS ® activity continued to be strong during the first quarter 2018; however, MSFS ® revenue was lower compared to 2017 due to the nature of the MSFS ® work completed during the quarter. During the first quarter 2018, Tryton successfully used its Hybrid MSFS ® (Ball & Seat at the toe of the wellbore and composite bridge plugs closer to the heel of the horizontal well) to complete two 90-stage MSFS ® jobs in the Montney region including completing the deepest well ever drilled in western Canada, with a measured depth of 7,848 metres and a 5,000 metre horizontal section. In addition, Tryton used its V-Sleeve system to complete a 53-stage job in a single tool run in the Cardium region. Tryton U.S. revenue doubled compared to the first quarter 2017 and continued to show higher quarter-over-quarter activity, particularly in Texas, with a broader customer base. Tryton Rentals revenue was lower than the first quarter 2017 primarily due to lower activity from a key customer.\nTryton continued to generate strong margins with gross margin of 25% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decline in gross margin percentage from the first quarter 2017 was due to lower activity for the higher margin rentals business in the first quarter 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nEquipment Expenditures Three months ended March 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2018 2017 Essential Coil Well Service $ 3,624 $ 4,288 Tryton 657 1,514 Corporate 181 35 Total equipment expenditures 4,462 5,837 Less proceeds on disposal of property and equipment (1,816 ) (306 ) Net equipment expenditures (1) $ 2,646 $ 5,531 Essential classifies its equipment expenditures as growth capital (1) and maintenance capital (1) : Three months ended March 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2018 2017 Growth capital (1) $ 1,929 $ 3,854 Maintenance capital (1) 2,533 1,983 Total equipment expenditures $ 4,462 $ 5,837 Essential’s 2018 capital forecast is $15 million, comprised of $5 million of growth capital and $10 million of maintenance capital. Growth capital consists of costs to retrofit one Generation IV coil tubing rig, the addition of one nitrogen pumper, coil support equipment and costs to complete the two quintuplex fluid pumpers started in 2017.\nOUTLOOK\nThe price of oil continued to improve averaging approximately U.S. $63 per barrel (WTI) for the first quarter and has remained above this level to date in the second quarter 2018. Activity in the second half of 2018 will depend on E&P spending and activity is generally expected to be similar to 2017. Above average moisture in the WCSB during the winter may extend spring breakup conditions.\nThe Canadian oil and natural gas industry is challenged by political and regulatory uncertainty. The inability to build pipelines and liquefied natural gas facilities to access markets is impacting industry cash flow and investor confidence. As a result, heavy oil and natural gas prices are heavily discounted compared to U.S. prices, limiting improvement in E&P cash flows and increased oilfield service activity.\nECWS expects activity to remain strong in the second half of 2018 for its Generation III coil tubing rigs and quintuplex fluid pumpers used for long-reach horizontal well completions in the Montney and Duvernay regions. Limited improvement in industry activity and excess equipment is expected to continue to restrict the ability to increase prices and cover higher operating costs.\nTryton activity is also expected to be strong for the second half of 2018 as customer spending on well completion, maintenance and abandonment work is expected to continue. Through its expanded MSFS ® service offering, Tryton remains well positioned to meet customer demand for cost effective solutions for increased stage counts when completing longer reach horizontal wells.\nEssential’s 2018 capital forecast is $15 million, comprised of $5 million of growth capital and $10 million of maintenance capital. One quintuplex fluid pumper was delivered in the first quarter, and a second quintuplex fluid pumper and the retrofitted Generation IV coil tubing rig will be delivered in the second and third quarters 2018, respectively.\nWith long-term debt at May 8, 2018 of $28.9 million, Essential believes it is financially well-positioned to meet its working capital (1) and capital spending requirements. Essential expects its debt to decline through to the end of the second quarter 2018 as customer payments are received for work completed in the first quarter.\nThe Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and Financial Statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 are available on Essential’s website at www.essentialenergy.ca and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\n(1) Non-IFRS Measures\nThroughout this news release, certain terms that are not specifically defined in IFRS are used to analyze Essential’s operations. In addition to the primary measures of net income and net income per share in accordance with IFRS, Essential believes that certain measures not recognized under IFRS assist both Essential and the reader in assessing performance and understanding Essential’s results. Each of these measures provides the reader with additional insight into Essential’s ability to fund principal debt repayments and capital programs. As a result, the method of calculation may not be comparable with other companies. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income and net income per share as calculated in accordance with IFRS.\nBank EBITDA – Bank EBITDA is generally defined in Essential’s Credit Facility as EBITDAS from continuing operations, including the equity cure, excluding onerous lease contract expense and severance costs.\nEBITDAS (Earnings before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, transaction costs, losses or gains on disposal of equipment, write-down of assets, impairment loss, foreign exchange gains or losses, and share-based compensation, which includes both equity-settled and cash-settled transactions) – These adjustments are relevant as they provide another measure which is considered an indicator of Essential’s results from its principal business activities.\nFunded debt – Funded debt is generally defined in Essential’s credit facility as long-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt plus deferred financing costs and bank indebtedness, net of cash.\nGrowth capital – Growth capital is capital spending which is intended to result in incremental revenue. Growth capital is considered to be a key measure as it represents the total expenditures on equipment expected to add incremental revenue to Essential.\nMaintenance capital – Equipment additions that are incurred in order to refurbish, replace or extend the life of previously acquired equipment. Such additions do not provide incremental revenue.\nNet equipment expenditures – This measure is equipment expenditures less proceeds on the disposal of equipment. Essential uses net equipment expenditures to describe net cash outflows related to the financing of Essential’s capital program.\nWorking capital – Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nESSENTIAL ENERGY SERVICES LTD.
