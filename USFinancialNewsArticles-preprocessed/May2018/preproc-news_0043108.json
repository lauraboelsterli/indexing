    "text": "Published: May 21, 2018 8:21 a.m. ET Share\nAllegations emerge that the Mexican charter airline had previously been warned about safety violations Reuters A firefighter works in the wreckage of a Boeing 737 plane that crashed in the agricultural area of Boyeros, near Havana, Cuba, on Friday.\nBy Santiago Perez Anthony Harrup\nU.S. and Mexican aviation experts are joining an investigation of the crash of a Boeing 737 charter flight outside Havana that killed more than 100 people, Cuban authorities said, as allegations emerged that the airline had previously been warned about safety violations.\nCuban authorities have identified the remains of 20 of the 110 victims of Friday’s crash while a team of local and foreign investigators focused on the possible causes of the disaster and the operations of the Mexican company that owned the plane, which crashed shortly after takeoff on a flight to the eastern Cuban city of Holguín.\nThe only survivors of Friday’s crash, three women passengers, are in critical condition at the Calixto García Hospital in central Havana, while the remains of the first identified victims were being delivered to relatives in Holguín, authorities said.\nThe Boeing 737-200 crashed in a field and burst into flames shortly after taking off from the Havana airport on Friday. Cuba’s transport minister, Adel Yzquierdo, said 110 of the 113 passengers and crew were killed. Authorities said five children were among the victims identified over the weekend, and that identification of the dead could take days.\nCuban officials said that following a request from U.S. authorities, a team from Boeing Co. BA, +2.06% would be permitted to join the investigation. Boeing has said a technical team stood ready to assist at the direction of U.S. and Cuban authorities. ",
