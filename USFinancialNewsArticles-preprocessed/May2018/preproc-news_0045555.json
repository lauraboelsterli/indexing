REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n“After the incredible stratospheric polar vortex split during the late winter, the pattern reversal this spring has been rather striking, with low pressure dominating the pattern in the far North Atlantic,” said Dr. Todd Crawford, chief meteorologist with The Weather Company.\n“The dominant summer pattern over the past decade has been for higher pressures over the North Atlantic and lower pressures over northwest Europe, resulting in cool, wet summers with the hotter and drier pattern across SE Europe.\n“However, this pattern may not materialise until later in the summer this year, resulting in a nice start to the season across northwest Europe.”\nThe Weather Company, owned by IBM, provides weather forecasts aimed at the commodities and energy sectors.
