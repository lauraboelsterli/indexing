    "text": "President Donald Trump said Friday that the new addition to his legal team, Rudy Giuliani , will \"get his facts straight.\"\nTrump, speaking to reporters, suggested that Giuliani had misspoken about reimbursements to the president's personal lawyer , Michael Cohen , for payments to porn star Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement.\nTrump said Giuliani \"is a great guy, but he just started a day ago.\" He said the former New York City mayor is \"learning the subject matter.\"\nThe president added that \"virtually everything\" reported about the payments were wrong. He did not elaborate.\nGiuliani said this week that Trump knew about Cohen's 2016 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels and that Trump had repaid Cohen through monthly retainers.\nTrump had previously denied knowing about the payments.",
