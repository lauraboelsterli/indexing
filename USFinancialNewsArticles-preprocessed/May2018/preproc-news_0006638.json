It also said it made a net loss of 43.89 billion yuan versus a profit of 491.6 million yuan in 2016.\nOperating profit for 2017 was 12.22 billion yuan, up from 3.79 billion yuan a year ago.\nAlongside smartphones, Xiaomi makes dozens of internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, including scooters, air purifiers and rice cookers, although it derives most of its profits from internet services.\nIn the smartphone market its relatively cheap handsets pose a rising challenge to market leaders Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc.\nXiaomi's IPO will be one of the first in Hong Kong under new rules which began on Monday in an effort to attract more tech listings, as competition for major tech deals heats up between Hong Kong, New York and the Chinese mainland.\nThe exchange is eyeing several tech listings that are expected in the coming two years from Chinese firms with a combined market cap of $500 billion. CLSA, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are sponsoring Xiaomi's IPO.
