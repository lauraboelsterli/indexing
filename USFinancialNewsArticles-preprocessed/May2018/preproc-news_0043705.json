    "text": "35 COMMENTS ATLANTA—Georgia Democrats, long underdogs in this red state, hoped to present a unified front this year as they pushed to elect a governor, a post they haven’t held since 2003.\nInstead, they have the Battle of the Two Staceys: Tuesday’s primary showdown between Stacey Abrams, an African-American former state House minority leader who lives in Atlanta, and Stacey Evans, a white former state representative from the city’s northern suburbs.\nGeorgia has never elected a woman or an African-American as governor. And though the Democratic Party once dominated Georgia politics, its power has eroded since the early 2000s. Today, the GOP controls every major statewide office, as well as both chambers of the General Assembly.\nBut Democratic and Republican strategists here speculate that in the near future a growing minority population, combined with an influx of younger professionals from the North, will turn this red state purple, giving Democrats a chance.\nMs. Abrams and Ms. Evans both style themselves progressives, running on a platform of improving education, health care and transit. But Ms. Abrams aims to bring in new voters, including young people and minorities, to forge a coalition to defeat the GOP. Ms. Evans has said that is important, but to win Georgia, candidates must also appeal to independents and moderates in the suburbs, areas like the one where she was elected as a state representative.\nMs. Abrams, a 44-year-old lawyer who has written romance novels in her spare time, spent years in the state party leadership. She has key endorsements from national liberal leaders Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) and former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.).\nFrom the Archives Republican Karen Handel won a hotly contested House race in Georgia on Tuesday, beating Democrat Jon Ossoff. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib looks at what the Democrats need to do to regroup after the disappointing loss. Photo: AP Ms. Abrams has argued that her financial status makes her more sensitive to the needs of working people. In her most recent disclosure filed with the state, she listed her net worth at about $110,000. She also reported about $174,000 in credit-card and student-loan debt, and about $54,000 in back taxes and penalties to the Internal Revenue Service.\nMs. Evans, also a lawyer, stresses education as a major theme of her campaign, saying she escaped a childhood of poverty thanks in part to state scholarships to the University of Georgia. The 40-year-old, who according to her financial disclosure report is worth about $5.3 million, lives in Smyrna, a well-to-do suburb of Atlanta. She has secured endorsements from numerous state Democrats, including former state Sen. Vincent Fort, who is African-American.\nAndra Gillespie, a political-science professor at Emory University, said the contest between the two Democrats—one white and suburban, and one black and urban—captures “a larger debate that is going on within the Democratic Party as a whole” over how to win in Republican-dominated states like Georgia . One group is pushing for “breakthrough candidates,” such as minority and nontraditional candidates, while others “are risk averse and will say the time is not right,” she said.\nOn the other side, the crowded GOP field is focusing on gun rights to appeal to conservative primary voters. In February, front-runner Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle drew national attention when he helped kill a bill that would have provided tax breaks on jetfuel that benefited Delta Air Lines Inc., metro Atlanta’s largest employer, after it ended discounts for National Rifle Association members following February’s mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla .\nDemocrats are hoping Mr. Cagle won’t secure 50% of the primary vote and will have to spend much of the summer in a runoff. He is leading the GOP primary race, with 41% of Republicans backing him, according to a recent poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and WSB-TV. Several other Republican candidates got 10% or less, while 33% of the Republicans polled said they were undecided.\nIn the Democratic race, Ms. Abrams is leading, with about 33% of Democrats polled supporting her and about 15% backing Ms. Evans; about 52% were undecided.\nRelated The Battle for the Senate Runs Through Tennessee (May 9) Capital Journal: Nation’s Wild Political Currents Race Through Kansas (April 30) Democratic Victory in Alabama Stirs GOP Anxiety Over Midterm Elections (Dec. 13) GOP’s Karen Handel Beats Democrat Jon Ossoff in Georgia (June 21, 2017) The Georgia Special Election in 4 Charts (June 21, 2017) African-American voters, who in recent years have made up the majority of Georgia’s Democratic primary voters, likely will decide who the party puts forth in this year’s general election.\nBoth candidates are trying to appeal to black voters. Ms. Abrams is courting and touting the backing of African-American leaders; Civil Rights icon U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.) has endorsed her. Ms. Evans is running a campaign commercial featuring a black high-school girl questioning Ms. Abrams’s vote supporting a 2011 GOP-led plan to reconfigure financing for the state’s popular college scholarship program, stating changes to the program hurt black students.\nMs. Abrams has said a compromise had to be made to keep the program fiscally viable after the recession and accused Ms. Evans of spreading falsehoods about the scholarship changes to frighten people into voting for her.\n“I am deeply ashamed that we are in a campaign for Democrats where a single Democrat is trying to scare families,” Ms. Abrams said.\nLynrita Farmer, a 64-year-old office assistant at a state technical college who lives in the Atlanta suburb of East Point, said she hasn’t made up her mind about who she will support in the primary, but she was leaning toward Ms. Evans. Ms. Farmer, who is black, said she wants a governor who will focus on increasing wages for state employees while keeping the state fiscally sound.\n“I’m tired of being working poor,” she said.\nChris Grant, chair of Mercer University’s political-science department in Macon, Ga., said rank-and-file Democrats are more energized to defeat the GOP this year because of their opposition to President Donald Trump. “A Democrat has a better shot this time than they have had in the last 16 years,” he said.",
