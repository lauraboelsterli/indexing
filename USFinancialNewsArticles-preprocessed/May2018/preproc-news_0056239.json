    "text": "80 COMMENTS President Donald Trump on Saturday praised an Indiana middle-school teacher as a hero for tackling a student who opened fire in a classroom Friday, leaving one student in critical condition.\n“Thanks to very brave Teacher & Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville, Indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!” President Trump tweeted Saturday morning.\nThe shooting occurred just after 9 a.m. Friday at the Noblesville West Middle School, in Noblesville, Ind., according to local police.\nMr. Seaman, a 29-year-old science teacher, stopped a student who entered his classroom with two guns and started firing, by first throwing a basketball at the student and then tackling him, according to the Associated Press.\nMr. Seaman was shot in the confrontation and taken to a local hospital, where he was treated and released in good condition. A female student who was also shot was in critical condition, according to the Noblesville Police Department.\nIn a statement published by local media outlets, Mr. Seaman said that he was injured but “doing great” and thanked students for their support. “To all students, you are all wonderful and I thank you for your support. You are the reason I teach.”\nThe shooter, whose name wasn’t immediately released by authorities, was taken into custody. Police didn’t identify a motive for the attack.\nIn a letter to parents and staff, Beth Niedermeyer, superintendent of the Noblesville Schools, said events throughout the school district had been canceled for the weekend and that schools would reopen on Tuesday, except at the affected school, which would be open part of the day for counseling sessions.\n“I am still processing my emotions about today’s terrible tragedy and I know you must all be as well,” she wrote to parents and staff.\nA prayer vigil was scheduled for Saturday night in Noblesville for those affected by the shooting.\nThe attack follows other school shootings, including the shooting earlier this month in Santa Fe, Texas , in which eight students and two teachers were killed.\nThe Associated Press identified Mr. Seaman as a former defensive end for Southern Illinois University’s football team.\nVice President Mike Pence, a former Indiana governor, also recognized Mr. Seaman with a tweet Saturday morning, in which he called the teacher “an American (and Hoosier!) Hero.”\n“His courageous action saved lives during Friday’s school shooting in Noblesville. We’re all proud of you Jason and are praying for you and those impacted and recovering from injuries,” Mr. Pence’s tweet read.\nWrite to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com",
