    "text": "(In paragraph one, corrects number jailed to six, not five)\nLONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - Britain’s National Crime Agency is conducting a wider review into fraud allegations at lender HBOS that have already led to the jailing of six people in a scam that pushed struggling business owners to employ a costly turnaround consultancy.\nThe NCA said on Monday it is following up a request from Thames Valley police, who conducted the investigation that led to those original convictions, with a view to a wider probe involving allegations of fraud and money laundering.\nThe sums of money involved could run to many millions of pounds, the NCA said in a statement, and the review will determine whether a full criminal investigation needs to be launched.\nHBOS is now owned by Britain’s Lloyds Banking Group . The initial investigation and prosecution was completed in January 2017 and related to a scam conducted between 2003 to 2008.\nLloyds did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
