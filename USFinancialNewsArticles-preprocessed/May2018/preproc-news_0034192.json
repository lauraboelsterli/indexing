    "text": "May 15, 2018 / 8:59 AM / Updated 21 minutes ago South Korea orders arrest of Samsung official over union sabotage claim Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nSEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court issued an arrest warrant on Tuesday for a senior official of a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd as prosecutors investigate whether the conglomerate sabotaged workers’ efforts to strengthen labor unions. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen at its office building in Seoul, South Korea, March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\nThe tech giant’s unions tend to be small and weak, and it has often drawn fire from politicians and civic groups for not engaging with organized labor, but it recently agreed to hire temporary workers as regular staff and recognize their union.\nIn a statement, the Seoul Central District Court said it granted the warrant for the official, identified only by the surname Choi, because of concerns over destruction of evidence.\nProsecutors are investigating Samsung’s repair service unit over suspected sabotage of labor union activities by company management, prosecution officials have said.\nA spokeswoman for Samsung Electronics declined to comment on the investigation.\nProsecutors investigated similar accusations after a lawmaker disclosed a document in 2013 that she said contained Samsung’s guidelines on how to stop employees from organizing unions.\nBut the case was dropped as prosecutors could not verify the source of the document.
