Lightning strikes behind Las Vegas Strip casinos as a thunderstorm passes through Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. September 13, 2017. REUTERS/Steve Marcus\nOn Monday, the NFL club took out a full-page ad in the Las Vegas Review-Journal wishing the Vegas Golden Knights in a very Raider way.\n“Just win baby,” the ad simply read, the words sandwiched beneath a photo of Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury and above the Raiders logo.\nThe phrase was coined by longtime Raiders owner Al Davis.\nThe Raiders are scheduled to move to Las Vegas in 2020. The Golden Knights, in their inaugural NHL season and the first major professional sports franchise headquartered in Las Vegas, open Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final at home Monday night against the Washington Capitals.\n—Field Level Media",
