But we will never lose sight of the fact that the objective is a high return,” CEO Yngve Slyngstad said.\nIn 2017, the government raised its target for the fund’s equity portfolio to 70 percent of assets from 62.5 percent, while cutting back on investments in fixed income securities.\nThe fund, managed by a unit of the central bank, should thus boost its returns, Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen told the parliamentary hearing, while reiterating earlier statements that the value of investments was likely to fluctuate.\n“Based on historical experience, it can be assumed that equities will make substantial contributions to returns over time. At the same time, we must be prepared to deal with volatility in the fund’s value in the coming years,” he added.\nFinance Minister Siv Jensen repeated her view that the fund should refrain from investing in unlisted shares, except for companies that have presented plans to list in the near future.
