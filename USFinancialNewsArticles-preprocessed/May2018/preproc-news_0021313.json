Today, she's the chief operating officer at Starbucks.\nShe's learning a new corporate culture at the coffee giant, one she says suits her well. \"This culture matches who I am as an individual â€” it's amazing to bring my head and heart to work,\" she says.\nBrewer is also on one of the most diverse boards in corporate America at Starbucks, and believes diversity is key to corporate success. Different voices at the table, she says, mean richer conversations and faster solutions.\nShe has one piece of advice for women looking to climb the corporate ladder: Stay the course.\n\"Stay steadfast,\" she says, \"the opportunities are great.
