    "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Prosecutors in the Netherlands said on Friday they have opened a criminal investigation into seven Dutch companies and their directors for allegedly breaching European Union sanctions against Moscow, by helping Russia build a bridge to Crimea.\nFILE PHOTO: A general view shows a road-and-rail bridge, which is constructed to connect the Russian mainland with the Crimean peninsula, with a fisherman seen in the foreground, in the Kerch Strait, Crimea April 14, 2018. REUTERS/Pavel Rebrov/File Photo The companies involved are alleged to have supplied machines, machine parts and other services for the construction of the 19 kilometer (11.8 mile) long bridge spanning the Strait of Kerch, the prosecutor’s office said.\nThis represented a violation of sanctions imposed by the European Union after the annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia in 2014, the prosecutors said, as they explicitly ruled out the sale of machines and related services for use in Crimea.\n“This is a serious offence, undermining the EU sanction regime”, the prosecutors said in a statement.\nFILE PHOTO: A general view shows a road-and-rail bridge, which is constructed to connect the Russian mainland with the Crimean Peninsula, in the Kerch Strait, Crimea April 25, 2018. Picture taken April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Pavel Rebrov/File Photo Individuals found to have breached sanctions can be sentenced to up to six years in prison or a maximum fine of 82,000 euros ($97,818), a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office said, while companies can be fined up to 820,000 euros.\nThe prosecutors did not name the companies involved, but said the transactions under investigation took place between November 2015 and the latter part of 2017.\nThe spokeswoman declined to give any further details.\n($1 = 0.8383 euros)\nReporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Alexander Smith\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
