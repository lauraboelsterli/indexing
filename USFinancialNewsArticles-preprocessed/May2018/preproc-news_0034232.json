The year-over-year change in gross margin was driven by strong Advanced Energy sales, offset by lower margins in the Company’s OEM and Core segments.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 1.8% year-over-year, to $5.9 million, compared to $6.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year change in operating expenses was primarily driven by a $0.3 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $0.1 million increase in professional services expense, offset by a $0.3 million decrease in salaries and related expense and a $0.1 million decrease in research and development expenses.\nLoss from operations for first quarter 2018 was $0.9 million, compared to a loss from operations of $1.7 million for the comparable period last year.\nNet loss attributed to common shareholders for first quarter 2018 was $0.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $1.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and equivalents of $9.4 million as compared to $10.7 million as of December 31, 2017.
