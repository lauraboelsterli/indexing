    "text": "Private equity firm TPG Capital nearing a deal to take a minority stake in skincare brand Rodan + Fields, sources familiar with the situation tell CNBC.\nThe business, which sells its products exclusively through a network of consultants, rather than through retailers, was founded in 2000 by Dr. Katie Rodan and Dr. Kathy Fields. It generated 2017 net revenue of more than $1.5 billion and grew at a rate of 40 percent.\nIts sells skincare and products under names like Redefine and Unblemish to treat skin through \"dermatology-inspired skincare.\" Rodan and Fields are Stanford-trained dermatologists.\nA valuation of the company could not be immediately determined.\nThe sources, who cautioned a deal could still fall apart, requested anonymity because the information is confidential. TPG declined to comment. Rodan + Fields did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTPG's stake is one more affirmation of investors' increased confidence in direct sales business models. Today's iteration distinguishes itself from its predecessors like Avon Products , by extensive use of social media and infomercials.\nYounique, a direct sales cosmetic company with a heavy social media following, was acquired by Covergirl-owner Coty in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion.\nThe direct-sales model has taken a new power as skincare and cosmetic brands look for ways to sidestep the department stores they traditionally relied on, but which are losing foot traffic.\nRodan + Fields was acquired by Estée Lauder in 2003 and, at that time, its products sold in high-end department stores. In 2007, Drs. Rodan and Fields bought the company back from Estee Lauder. It relaunched as a consultant-based direct seller.\nIt has a network of more than 200,000 consultants and more than 2 million customers in the United States, Canada and Australia.\nWith TPG's investment, it expects to grow both domestically and internationally.",
