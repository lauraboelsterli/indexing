    "text": "SALEM, Ore., May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Willamette Valley Vineyards (NASDAQ:WVVI), a leading Oregon producer of Pinot Noir, generated income applicable to common shareholders of $75,561, or $0.02 cents per share, for the first quarter of 2018, down from $183,297, or $0.04 cents per share, for the corresponding prior year period, representing a $107,736 or 58.8% decrease in income applicable to common shareholders compared to first quarter 2017. Items affecting the reduction in income applicable to common shareholders include increased preferred stock accrued dividends when compared to first quarter 2017.\nThe Company produced revenues of $4,532,619 and $4,450,545 in first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $82,074 or 1.8%. The primary reasons for this increase are an increase in direct sales of $61,036 and an increase in sales through distributors of $21,038 in the current year three month period over the prior year period. Gross profit margin was 63.8% and 61.6% for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $2,417,900 and $2,239,738 for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $178,162 or 8.0%. Increases in selling, general and administrative costs were partially the result of increases in sales staffing and incentives.\nIncome from operations was $472,344 and $503,127 for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $30,783 or 6.1%.\nJim Bernau, Founder and President of the winery, said \"Our net results will show the new dividend expense until we are able to deploy the large amount of new invested cash in business development. Our new construction is in the permitting process, so buckle-up, big things are on their way.\"\nWillamette Valley Vineyards, Inc. is headquartered at its Estate Vineyard near Salem, Oregon.
