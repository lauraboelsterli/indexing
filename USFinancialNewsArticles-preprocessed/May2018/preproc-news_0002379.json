    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn., May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Tennessee Valley Authority today reported $5.3 billion in operating revenues through the six-month period ended March 31, 2018, a five percent increase from the same period a year ago. The higher revenues were driven by a six percent increase in electricity sales, primarily due to weather conditions.\nDuring the same six-month period, total operating expenses decreased four percent, as compared to the same period last year, primarily due to decreased fuel expense driven by higher hydro and natural gas generation and lower market prices for natural gas.\n\"Power demand has been higher so far in 2018 compared to last year's record warm winter, but our customers are paying less,\" said Bill Johnson, TVA president and chief executive officer.\n\"Higher output from hydro, nuclear and natural gas-fired generation helped keep the Valley warm during cold weather in January while our diversified fleet kept prices lower for TVA's customers during more moderate temperatures.\"\nOperating and maintenance expense was down $34 million, or two percent lower, for the first six months of this fiscal year, compared to the same period last year, mostly driven by a decrease in planned nuclear outage days and an increase in workforce efficiencies.\n\"Higher revenues from the more normal weather this year, and lower operating expenses along with lower interest on debt, contributed to a stronger bottom line,\" said John Thomas, TVA chief financial officer.\n\"These results are helping TVA realize its strategic objectives to keep rates low while prudently managing debt and investing in a cleaner, more diverse power system.\"\nAdditional highlights of TVA's second quarter fiscal year 2018 results include:\nNet income for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was $750 million, up 140 percent from net income of $313 million for the same period of fiscal year 2017. TVA's cash position was temporarily higher, at $1.2 billion, at March 31, 2018, due to the timing of financing activities related to maturing long-term debt. Colder-than-normal weather during January 2018 led to TVA setting an all-time record for energy demand in a 24-hour period, delivering 706 million kilowatt-hours of energy to the Tennessee Valley. TVA set three of its top-12 winter peak demand records in January 2018. TVA retired Allen Fossil Plant Units 1-3 in March 2018. With these retirements, TVA has completed the requirements related to retiring or installing controls on coal-fired units imposed by the 2011 Environmental Agreements with the EPA, Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and three environmental advocacy groups. The Allen Combined Cycle Plant began operational testing in September 2017 and officially entered commercial operation on April 30. TVA completed its first extended power uprate at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Unit 3, which will result in an additional 155 megawatts of carbon-free energy. The unit was returned to service in April 2018 and power ascension testing is in progress. Extended power uprates at Browns Ferry Units 1 and 2 will be completed by spring 2019. TVA continued to update its Integrated Resource Plan to determine the best way to meet future power demand while evaluating the optimal mix of resources and the evolving role of distributed energy resources.\n\"These actions taken during the first six months of fiscal year 2018 have enabled our diversified generating fleet to produce more than half of our power from carbon-free sources and reduce our carbon emissions almost 50 percent below 2005 levels,\" said Johnson.\n\"Moving forward, we will remain focused on making the right decisions that allow us to build on these results and provide cleaner, reliable energy at the lowest costs feasible to those we serve.\"\nSelected Financial Data\nSix Months Ended March 31\nSales, Revenues & Expenses\n2018\n2017\nSales (millions of kWh)\n76,916\n72,735\nOperating Revenues ($ millions)\n$\n5,341\n$\n5,093\nFuel & Purchased Power Expense\n1,463\n1,557\nOperating & Maintenance Expense\n1,406\n1,440\nNet Interest Expense\n636\n677\nNet Income\n$\n750\n$\n313\nNet Cash Provided by / (Used in) ($ millions)\n2018\n2017\nOperating Activities\n$\n1,842\n$\n1,516\nInvesting Activities\n(1,141)\n(1,302)\nFinancing Activities\n192\n(214)\nNet Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n893\n-\nTVA executive management will host a conference call to discuss second quarter fiscal year 2018 results at 9:30 a.m. EDT, on Friday, May 4, 2018.
