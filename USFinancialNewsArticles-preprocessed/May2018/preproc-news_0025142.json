    "text": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s biggest ride-sharing company apologized on Thursday over the killing of a passenger, apparently by her driver, and said it had to win back the trust of users after the “tragedy”.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Didi Chuxing is seen at its headquarters in Beijing, China, May 18, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo The young woman passenger was killed in Zhengzhou city last week, turning a spotlight on passenger safety as ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing, which is valued at $50 billion, looks to make a big push outside China’s borders.\nDidi was “deeply saddened by and sorry about the tragedy”, the company said in a statement, adding that it had apologized to the family of the 21-year-old flight attendant killed en route from the city’s airport hotel to downtown.\n“We need to step up to win the trust of our users. Our responsibilities in this case are undeniable,” Didi said in a statement to Reuters.\nDidi Chuxing Technology Co is the world’s largest ride-hailing firm by number of rides, thanks to its commanding market share in China, where it has 450 million users.\nIt completed more than 7.4 billion rides last year, not quite double Uber’s count.\nUber learned the hard way about Didi’s brawn. After waging a campaign to crack the Chinese market, Uber in 2016 sold its operation to Didi in exchange for a 17.5 percent stake in the Chinese firm, which also made a $1 billion investment in Uber.\nDidi said police were looking for the person suspected to have killed the woman and it would work closely with law enforcement authorities on the case.\nZhengzhou police did not comment on the killing but urged customers to exercise caution.\n“Do not engage in disputes with drivers,” police said in n advice posted on social media, adding: “be accompanied when taking rides at night”.\nThe killing of the woman has been discussed extensively on social media platforms in China with many expressing fears for their safety.\n“Didi really needs to step up internal supervision; who is going to ensure our safety?” said one user of the Weibo platform.\nDidi is on a push to expand globally after sealing its dominance in China.\nIt has made a foray into other businesses including a recent cash-burning experiment in food delivery that pitted it against Meituan-Dianping, China’s largest provider of on-demand online services.\n(This story has been corrected to say the killing raises, not compounds, safety fears in headline and second paragraph)\nReporting by Pei Li and Adam Jourdan; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ",
