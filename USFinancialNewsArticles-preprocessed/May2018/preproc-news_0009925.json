    "text": "US needs a say in Europe's plans to tax firms like Google, Luxembourg finance chief says Silvia Amaro Reblog The European Commission proposed in late March changes to how digital businesses are taxed in the 28 member states of the EU. The Commission — the EU's executive body — said at the time that digital companies pay on average an effective tax rate of 9.5 percent — compared to 23.2 percent for traditional businesses, which it said was not fair. It then went on to suggest that even an added digital tax of 3 percent could generate about 5 billion euros ($5.99 billion) in revenues per year.",
