    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, May 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN) today announced that its board of directors approved an increase to its previously authorized share repurchase program to $1 billion. This represents a $550 million increase to the existing $450 million authorization, to be supported by the Company's free cash flow generation and by the monetization of Venator shares. Repurchases may be made through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, and repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. Shares of common stock acquired through the repurchase program are to be held in treasury at cost.\nAdditionally, Huntsman Corporation today announced that it has entered into a new five year $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in 2023 with a current applicable rate of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. The new credit facility will replace the Company's previous $650 million senior secured revolving credit facility expiring in 2021 that held an applicable rate of LIBOR plus 250 basis points.\nPeter Huntsman, Chairman, President and CEO commented:\n\"We are committed to maintaining a balanced approach to capital deployment to create further shareholder value. The increased share repurchase authorization is a reflection of the Company's confidence in generating consistent, strong annual free cash flow and its desire to return capital to shareholders through an overall balanced approach. Furthermore, our new $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility further enhances our investment grade profile. Each of these announcements is fundamental to our core focus to create shareholder value as we grow our downstream businesses and work towards our 2020 targets of generating more than $1.6 billion of EBITDA and greater than $650 million in free cash flow.\"\nSean Douglas, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer added:\n\"This is a long awaited and well-intended moment to have an investment grade credit facility. As demonstrated by this new $1.2 billion unsecured revolver, major financial institutions clearly see Huntsman solidly within investment grade land.\"\nAbout Huntsman:\nHuntsman Corporation is a publicly traded global manufacturer and marketer of differentiated and specialty chemicals with 2017 revenues more than $8 billion. Our chemical products number in the thousands and are sold worldwide to manufacturers serving a broad and diverse range of consumer and industrial end markets.
