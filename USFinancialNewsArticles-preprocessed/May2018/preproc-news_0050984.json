That is the longest such stretch since 1969, according to the Labor Department. 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent.\nThe Tightening\nU.S. financial markets were little moved by the claims data.\n at 4.1 percent for six straight months.\nShrinking labor market slack bolsters economists' expectations that wage growth will accelerate in the second half of the year.
