    "text": "GDP outlook Canada announces retaliatory tariffs on steel and aluminum Canada will retaliate against new U.S. tariffs by imposing its own trade barriers on U.S. steel, aluminum and other products. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada plans to slap dollar-for-dollar tariffs on the U.S. Drew Angerer | Getty Images Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\nCanada will retaliate against new U.S. tariffs by imposing its own trade barriers on U.S. steel, aluminum and other products, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Thursday.\nFreeland said Canada plans to slap dollar-for-dollar tariffs on the U.S. The Nafta partner's proposed import taxes would also cover whiskey, orange juice and other food products alongside the steel and aluminum tariffs.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the tariffs, announced Thursday by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , are an affront to the security partnership between the U.S. and Canada.\nTrudeau warned that the import taxes — of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports — will harm both countries' economies.\nThe trump administration is also saddling Mexico and the European Union with the tariffs.\nThis story is developing.
