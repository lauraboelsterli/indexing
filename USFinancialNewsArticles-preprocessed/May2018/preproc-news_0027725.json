In arriving at these determinations and consistent with the Fund’s valuation procedures, and ASC 820 (formerly FAS 157), the Valuation Committee took into account many factors, including the performance of the portfolio companies, recent transactions in the companies’ securities, as well as the impact of changes in market multiples within certain sectors.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Fund earned approximately $0.60 million in investment income. The Fund reported a net investment loss of approximately $2.75 million. The Fund reported net realized and unrealized gains on investments of approximately $8.32 million for the quarter.\nThroughout the quarter, the Fund continued its efforts to manage its portfolio prudently, including working with its portfolio companies and their management teams to seek to enhance performance and uncover potential exit opportunities.\nThe Fund's repurchase plan closed at the end of March, at which time the Fund had repurchased and retired 128,551 shares of stock at a total cost of approximately $1.1 million. Purchases under the plan were restricted in recent months in order to comply with SEC rules regarding material nonpublic information.\nAbout Firsthand Technology Value Fund\nFirsthand Technology Value Fund, Inc. is a publicly traded venture capital fund that invests in technology and cleantech companies.
