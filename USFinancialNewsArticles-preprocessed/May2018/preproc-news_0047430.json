Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: www.bgandg.com/ppg .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) PPG's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the quarterly financial statements of 2017 contained improper accounting entries and could no longer be relied upon; (2) PPG failed to maintain adequate internal controls; and (3) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn May 10, 2018, post-market, PPG disclosed that the Company's Audit Committee had found evidence that improper accounting entries were made by certain employees at the direction of its former vice president and controller.
