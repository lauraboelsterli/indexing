    "text": "Exceeds Financial Expectations, Raises Full Year Guidance\nRICHARDSON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RealPage, Inc. (NASDAQ:RP), a leading global provider of software and data analytics to the real estate industry, today announced financial results ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue of $201.3 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year; Net income of $10.9 million, or $0.13 in net income per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 33% and 30%, respectively; Non-GAAP total revenue of $201.6 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year; Adjusted EBITDA of $54.2 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year; and Non-GAAP net income of $31.1 million, or $0.37 in non-GAAP net income per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 77% and 68%, respectively.\nComments on the News\n“In 2017 we established innovation and simplification as our ‘North Star,’ a key element of an operational strategy to grow toward and beyond our 2020 target of $1 billion in revenue and $300 million in Adjusted EBITDA,” said Steve Winn, Chairman and CEO of RealPage. “We are ahead of the trajectory needed to achieve this target, demonstrating very strong financial performance in 2017 that continued into 2018. Organic innovation is driving continued adoption of our solutions, with particular emphasis on suite sales that combine multiple product solutions into a unified suite. Strong new sales bookings for new and existing clients during the quarter are evidence of this, and we expect to build on new sales momentum to drive deeper client adoption across our platform. Our M&A program is another major factor driving innovation over the long term, and is a critical piece of our capital allocation strategy directed at maximizing shareholder returns. The recent acquisition of ClickPay is directly in-line with both of these capital and operational strategies.”\n“Our first quarter financial performance was impressive,” said Bryan Hill, CFO and Treasurer of RealPage. “Compared to last year, Non-GAAP total revenue grew 31%, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 270 basis points, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 68% and operating cash flow grew 51%. This performance not only supports our strategic focus, but validates the financial and capital discipline we have maintained. As a result of all of these factors, combined with the acquisition of ClickPay, we are significantly raising our full-year guidance expectations for revenue and profit growth.”\n2018 Financial Outlook\nRealPage management expects to achieve the following results during the second quarter ending June 30, 2018:\nGAAP total revenue is expected to be in the range of $213.9 million to $215.9 million; GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.11; GAAP weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 86.9 million; Non-GAAP total revenue is expected to be in the range of $214.0 million to $216.0 million; Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $55.5 million to $57.0 million; Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.38; Non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 85.3 million.\nRealPage management expects to achieve the following results during the calendar year ending December 31, 2018:\nGAAP total revenue is expected to be in the range of $859.3 million to $867.5 million; GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.44; GAAP weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 87.3 million; Non-GAAP total revenue is expected to be in the range of $860.0 million to $868.0 million; Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $223.0 million to $228.0 million; Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.51; Non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 85.6 million.\nConference Call Information; Presentation Slides\nThe Company will host a conference call at 5 p.m. ET today to discuss its financial results.

These forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by terms such as “expects,” “believes,” “plans,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Those forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The company may be required to revise its results contained herein upon finalizing its review of quarterly and full-year results and completion of the annual audit, which could cause or contribute to such differences. Additional factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) the possibility that general economic conditions, including leasing velocity or uncertainty, could cause information technology spending, particularly in the rental housing industry, to be reduced or purchasing decisions to be delayed; (b) an increase in insurance claims; (c) an increase in client cancellations; (d) the inability to increase sales to existing clients and to attract new clients; (e) RealPage’s failure to integrate acquired businesses and any recent or future acquisitions successfully or to achieve expected synergies, including the recently completed acquisition of ClickPay; (f) the timing and success of new product introductions by RealPage or its competitors; (g) changes in RealPage’s pricing policies or those of its competitors; (h) legal or regulatory proceedings; (i) the inability to achieve revenue growth or to enable margin expansion; (j) changes in RealPage’s estimates with respect to its long-term corporate tax rate or any other impact from the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and (k) such other described more fully in documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) by RealPage, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018. All information provided in this release is as of the date hereof and RealPage undertakes no duty to update this information except as required by law.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. However, the company believes that, in order to properly understand its short-term and long-term financial, operational and strategic trends, it may be helpful for investors to exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring items when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These non-cash or non-recurring items result from facts and circumstances that vary in both frequency and impact on continuing operations. The company also uses results of operations excluding such items to evaluate the operating performance of RealPage and compare it against prior periods, make operating decisions, determine executive compensation, and serve as a basis for long-term strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide the company with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in its ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that RealPage believes might otherwise make comparisons of its ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts, or obscure the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of certain business strategies and management incentive structures. In addition, the company also believes that investors and financial analysts find this information to be helpful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Total Revenue” as total revenue plus acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments. The company believes it is useful to include deferred revenue written down for GAAP purposes under purchase accounting rules and revenue deferred due to a lack of historical experience determining the settlement of the contractual obligation in order to appropriately measure the underlying performance of its business operations in the period of activity and associated expense. Further, the company believes this measure is useful to investors as a way to evaluate the company’s ongoing performance because it provides a more accurate depiction of on demand revenue arising from our strategic acquisitions.\nThe company defines “Adjusted Gross Profit” as gross profit, plus (1) acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments, (2) depreciation, (3) amortization of intangible assets, and (4) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nThe company defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income (loss), plus (1) acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments, (2) depreciation, asset impairment, and the loss on disposal of assets, (3) amortization of intangible assets, (4) acquisition-related expense, (5) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, (6) interest expense, net, (7) income tax (benefit) expense, and (8) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Product Development Expense” as product development expense, excluding stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ongoing expenditures related to product innovation.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Sales and Marketing Expense” as sales and marketing expense, excluding (1) amortization of intangible assets, and (2) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ongoing expenditures related to its sales and marketing strategies.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP General and Administrative Expense” as general and administrative expense, excluding (1) loss on disposal of assets, (2) acquisition-related expense, (3) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, and (4) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s underlying expense structure to support corporate activities and processes.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Operating Expense” as operating expense, excluding (1) asset impairment and loss on disposal of assets, (2) amortization of intangible assets, (3) acquisition-related expense, (4) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, and (5) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s underlying expense structure to support ongoing operations.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Operating Income” as operating income, plus (1) acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments, (2) asset impairment and loss on disposal of assets, (3) amortization of intangible assets, (4) acquisition-related expense, (5) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, and (6) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Net Income” as net income (loss), plus (1) income tax (benefit) expense, (2) acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments, (3) asset impairment and loss on disposal of assets, (4) amortization of intangible assets, (5) acquisition-related expense, (6) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, (7) amortization of convertible note discount, (8) stock-based expense, and (9) provision for income tax expense based on an assumed rate in order to approximate the company’s long-term effective corporate tax rate; and the company defines “Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share” as Non-GAAP Net Income divided by Non-GAAP weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP On Demand Revenue” as total on demand revenue plus acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments. The company believes it is useful to include deferred revenue written down for GAAP purposes under purchase accounting rules and revenue deferred due to a lack of historical experience determining the settlement of the contractual obligation in order to appropriately measure the underlying performance of the company’s business operations in the period of activity and associated expense. Further, the company believes that investors and financial analysts find this measure to be useful in evaluating the company’s ongoing performance because it provides a more accurate depiction of on demand revenue arising from our strategic acquisitions.\nThe company defines “Ending On Demand Units” as the number of rental housing units managed by our clients with one or more of our on demand software solutions at the end of the period. We use ending on demand units to measure the success of our strategy of increasing the number of rental housing units managed with our on demand software solutions. Property unit counts are provided to us by our customers as new sales orders are processed. Property unit counts may be adjusted periodically as information related to our clients’ properties is updated or supplemented, which could result in adjustments to the number of units previously reported.\nThe company defines “Average On Demand Units” as the average of the beginning and ending on demand units for each quarter in the period presented. The company’s management monitors this metric to measure its success in increasing the number of on demand software solutions utilized by our clients to manage their rental housing units, our overall revenue, and profitability.\nThe company defines “ACV,” or Annual Client Value, as management’s estimate of the annual value of the company’s on demand revenue contracts. The company’s management monitors this metric to measure its success in increasing the number of on demand units, and the amount of software solutions utilized by its clients to manage their rental housing units.\nThe company defines “RPU,” or Revenue Per Unit, as ACV divided by ending on demand units. The company monitors this metric to measure its success in increasing the penetration of on demand software solutions utilized by its clients to manage their rental housing units.\nThe company excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each excluded item:\nNon-GAAP tax rate – In 2017, the company used a 40.0% tax rate in order to approximate the company’s long-term effective corporate tax rate. The GAAP tax rate includes certain tax items which may include, but are not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to ongoing business operations in the current year; unusual or infrequently occurring items; benefits from stock compensation deductions for tax purposes that exceed the stock compensation expense recognized for GAAP; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency re-measurement; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and liabilities; and changes in tax law. For 2018 guidance purposes, the company uses a Non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%, as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation, to approximate the company’s long-term effective corporate tax rate. We believe excluding these items assists investors and analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. Acquisition-related and other deferred revenue – These items are included to reflect deferred revenue written down for GAAP purposes under purchase accounting rules and revenue deferred due to a lack of historical experience determining the settlement of the contractual obligation in order to appropriately measure the underlying performance of the company’s business operations in the period of activity and associated expense. Asset impairment and loss on disposal of assets – These items comprise gains (losses) on the disposal and impairment of long-lived assets, which are not reflective of the company’s ongoing operations. We believe exclusion of these items facilitates a more accurate comparison of the company’s results of operations between periods. Amortization of intangible assets – These items are amortized over their estimated useful lives and generally cannot be changed or influenced by the company after acquisition. Accordingly, these items are not considered by the company in making operating decisions. The company does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of its ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred. Acquisition-related expense – These items consist of direct costs incurred in our business acquisition transactions and the impact of changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations. We believe exclusion of these items facilitates a more accurate comparison of the results of the company’s ongoing operations across periods and eliminates volatility related to changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations. Costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process – This item relates to the company's Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act review process regarding the recently completed acquisitions of On-Site and LRO. The company believes that these significant legal costs are not reflective of its ongoing operations. Amortization of the convertible note discount – This items consists of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount recognized on the convertible notes issued in May 2017. Management excludes this item as it is not indicative of the company’s ongoing operating performance. Stock-based expense – This item is excluded because these are non-cash expenditures that the company does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expenditure is partially outside of its control because it is based on factors such as stock price, volatility, and interest rates, which may be unrelated to the company’s performance during the period in which the expenses are incurred.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands, except share data) March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (unaudited) Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 101,646 $ 69,343 Restricted cash 112,478 96,002 Accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts of $7,821 and $3,951 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively 101,005 124,505 Prepaid expenses 15,400 12,107 Other current assets 9,838 6,622 Total current assets 340,367 308,579 Property, equipment, and software, net 145,522 148,428 Goodwill 751,017 751,052 Identified intangible assets, net 238,704 252,337 Deferred tax assets, net 45,205 44,887 Other assets 19,533 11,010 Total assets $ 1,540,348 $ 1,516,293 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 29,020 $ 26,733 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 76,284 79,379 Current portion of deferred revenue 109,965 116,622 Current portion of term loans 16,133 14,116 Customer deposits held in restricted accounts 112,334 96,057 343,736 332,907 Deferred revenue 5,457 5,538 Revolving facility 50,000 50,000 Term loans, net 299,343 303,261 Convertible notes, net 284,046 281,199 Other long-term liabilities 35,739 41,513 Total liabilities 1,018,321 1,014,418 Stockholders’ equity: Common stock, $0.001 par value: 125,000,000 shares authorized, 87,160,085 and 87,153,085 shares issued and 84,507,545 and 83,180,401 shares outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively 87 87 Additional paid-in capital 651,996 637,851 Treasury stock, at cost: 2,652,540 and 3,972,684 shares at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively (68,407 ) (61,260 ) Accumulated deficit (61,924 ) (75,046 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income 275 243 Total stockholders’ equity 522,027 501,875 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 1,540,348 $ 1,516,293\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenue: On demand $ 193,300 $ 146,213 Professional and other 8,001 6,706 Total revenue 201,301 152,919 Cost of revenue (1) 76,660 63,042 Gross profit 124,641 89,877 Operating expenses: Product development (1) 29,040 20,387 Sales and marketing (1) 50,241 35,147 General and administrative (1) 27,090 24,251 Total operating expenses 106,371 79,785 Operating income 18,270 10,092 Interest expense and other, net (7,670 ) (1,086 ) Income before income taxes 10,600 9,006 Income tax (benefit) expense (301 ) 811 Net income $ 10,901 $ 8,195 Net income per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic $ 0.13 $ 0.10 Diluted $ 0.13 $ 0.10 Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic 81,166 78,263 Diluted 84,817 81,386 (1) Includes stock-based expense as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cost of revenue $ 835 $ 853 Product development 2,163 1,879 Sales and marketing 3,541 3,128 General and administrative 3,779 4,232 $ 10,318 $ 10,092\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands) (unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cash flows from operating activities: Net income $ 10,901 $ 8,195 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization 23,260 14,440 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 3,012 89 Deferred taxes (1,154 ) 243 Stock-based expense 10,318 10,092 Loss on disposal and impairment of other long-lived assets 942 24 Acquisition-related consideration 402 121 Customer deposits 16,277 12,723 Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations 6,813 1,056 Net cash provided by operating activities 70,771 46,983 Cash flows from investing activities: Purchases of property, equipment, and software (12,660 ) (9,925 ) Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired -

An explanation of these measures is also included under the heading “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nWhile the company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of our business operations, investors are reminded to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and the company may utilize other measures to illustrate performance in the future. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP Total Revenue\nSet forth below is a presentation of the company’s “Non-GAAP total revenue.” Please reference the “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.

Please reference the “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section. (2) It is the current intent of the Company to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock. We exclude these shares that are issuable upon conversions of our convertible notes because we expect that the dilution from such shares will be offset by the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in May 2017 in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes.\n(3) Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
