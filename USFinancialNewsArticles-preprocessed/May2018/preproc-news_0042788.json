The contractor reported last week a net profit attributable to shareholders of 16.2 million dirhams ($4.4 million) for the first quarter, swinging from a net loss of 722.5 million dirhams in the corresponding period last year.\nIn Abu Dhabi, where trading volumes were very low and the index down 0.3 percent, Eshraq Properties was among the most traded stock and was up 1.4 percent after announcing last week it had swung to profit in the first quarter.\n($1 = 3.6728 UAE dirham)",
