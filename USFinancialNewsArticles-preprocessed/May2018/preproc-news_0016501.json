    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cinedigm today announced the acquisition of feature documentary LOGAN’S SYNDROME , the fascinating journey of a painter with a rare genetic disorder coming to terms ​with his disability through art. The film is set to launch on DVD and digital platforms in October.\nLogan Madsen is one in a billion. Literally. Shot over five years, LOGAN’S SYNDROME delves into the life of an extraordinary artist. Both he and sister, Heather, share a life-threatening lung disease and Miller syndrome – a rare genetic disorder affecting fewer than thirty people in the world. Despite malformed arms and hands, Logan paints hyper-realistic pictures boldly depicting his body and his struggles with autism.\nWhen a local gallery commits to exhibiting his audacious paintings, Logan is challenged to finish each piece before the show’s opening. As he paints, the story of his unique life unfolds – from the breakup of his \"perfect\" Mormon family, to his eternal search for romantic love, and his struggle to come to terms with his conditions. Through the unwavering devotion of his mother, Debbie, and support from Heather, Logan is able to rise above his disabilities in pursuit of becoming a great artist.\n“People with disabilities are often marginalized,” says director/producer Nathan Meier. “They are overlooked, forgotten or ignored. LOGAN’S SYNDROME is a film that seeks to give a voice to an issue that many do not want or know how to address. Logan's paintings are confrontational and challenging, but they also open an important dialogue.”\nLOGAN’S SYNDROME marks Nathan Meier’s feature film debut. A filmmaker, fine-art painter and graduate of CalArts, he has been friends with Logan Madsen since childhood and the two have been collaborating on the project for years. The film is produced by Meier, Madsen, Brian O’Hare and Azadeh Navai. Navai also served as editor, in conjunction with editing consultant William Haugse, the Academy Award nominated editor of Hoop Dreams . Executive producers are Stephen Nemeth, Justin Hogan, Eric Lane and Terry Madsen, with music by Tree Laboratory and The Blasting Company Quintet.\nThe deal was negotiated by Josh Thomashow, Director of Acquisitions for Cinedigm.\nRelease Details Genre: Documentary Prod.
