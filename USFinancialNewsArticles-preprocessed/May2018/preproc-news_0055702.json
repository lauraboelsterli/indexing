    "text": "110 COMMENTS BEULAVILLE, N.C.—The linchpin of 500 legal complaints against Chinese-owned pork giant Smithfield Foods Inc., is headed to federal court Tuesday, part of a historic challenge to North Carolina’s $2.9 billion hog industry.\nA Raleigh-based jury will determine whether a 4,700-hog farm run by a Smithfield contractor, with open pools of manure, emits enough odor and sprayed liquid waste to be considered a nuisance to a neighboring couple.\nLawyers representing Beulaville residents Elvis and Vonnie Williams said in court filings that Smithfield is “a large enterprise with the ability to reduce and end the nuisance.” They said the smell has hurt the couple’s “ability to enjoy family gatherings, barbeques, outdoor chores, playing with children outside, and doing yardwork.”\n“When I’m in the house, when I come outside and I smell the foul odor, it makes me, at times, sneeze, cough, vomit, watery red eyes,” Mr. Williams said in a 2016 deposition.\nSmithfield, the Smithfield, Va.-based subsidiary of Chinese pork producer WH Group Ltd., said its farm complies with local, state and federal environmental regulations. Chief Executive Ken Sullivan said it is wrong to penalize owners for things like noise and smell, which go hand in hand with running a farm.\n“Today it’s hog farms, what about chicken farms? The turkey guys? Grain farmers?” Mr. Sullivan said in an interview. “We’ve got to decide as a society how food is produced.”\nLawyers for the Williamses declined to comment.\nSmithfields Foods said the future of its operations in North Carolina hinges on the outcome of the lawsuits. Photo: Valerie Bauerlein/The Wall Street Journal North Carolina has been hog country since the early 1990s, when a company that is now a Smithfield subsidiary popularized the system of housing hogs indoors and managing the breakdown of manure in lagoons. In Beulaville, as in other eastern North Carolina communities, hogs replaced tobacco as an economic anchor, with state production growing from 2 million hogs annually in 1990 to 8.9 million hogs now.\nState regulators originally blessed the storing of manure and urine in open lagoons and spraying liquid waste as fertilizer on farmland. But the industry grew quickly and some lagoons failed, sending waste into rivers and streams during storms. A moratorium on new farms using lagoons has been in place since 1997, but the farm in the lawsuit—and hundreds like it—are grandfathered in, since nearly all hog farms in the state legally installed lagoons in the 1980s and ’90s.\nSmithfield uses its hogs for fresh pork sold to distributors, packaged foods like Nathan’s Famous hot dogs, and exports of stomachs and snouts to Asian markets. WH Group bought Smithfield in 2013 , in part to meet increased demand for pork among China’s growing middle class. Lawyers for the Williamses said in court documents they are concerned WH Group may pressure Smithfield to produce more pigs for China, which would increase the nuisance to neighbors.\nThe litigation has major implications both for North Carolina, which produces more hogs than any other state except Iowa, and for Smithfield, which owns the vast majority of the hogs produced here, both on company-owned farms and farms run by contractors, like the one in Beulaville.\nThe plaintiffs said in court filings that they want to apply “sufficient pressure” to force the company to embrace newer, but costlier, methods of handling waste, such as converting it to energy. Smithfield said those types of changes would undermine its business.\n“It’s an existential threat to us in North Carolina,” Mr. Sullivan said. Smithfield already has a narrow margin in the state compared with its operations in the Midwest, he said, partly because the company has to import most of the grain it uses there.\nIf the lawsuits succeed, he said, “we will have to revisit whether we can continue doing business in North Carolina.”\nThe Williamses’ case is one of a handful of bellwether trials that will help determine how hundreds of other complaints against Smithfield will be handled.\nIn the first trial last month , a Raleigh jury in U.S. District Court awarded $50 million to 10 families living near a Smithfield contract farm in neighboring Bladen County. The judge subsequently lowered the settlement to $3 million, to comply with a state statute capping punitive damages.\nA team of plaintiffs’ lawyers had chosen the case as their best argument against Smithfield. The verdict was cheered by environmental advocates, who thanked jurors for taking actions they said the government had failed to.\n“It’s about time somebody held them accountable for all the damage they have done to people,” said Naeema Muhammad, co-director of the North Carolina Environmental Justice Network.\nThis week, the defense has its turn with the plaintiff or plaintiffs and the farm that it believes represents the company’s best case. Smithfield chose to have one couple, the Williams, in the courtroom, instead of multiple families telling versions of the same story.\nMr. Williams bought the house on a rural two-lane highway in 1989, after part of the hog farm was initially constructed. Smithfield said he bought his home knowing it was in the middle of farmland. The company also said the Williamses and other plaintiffs, who also live near the farm, signed on to a lawsuit only when solicited by lawyers.\nMs. Muhammad, the environmental activist, said she helped organize informational meetings with the lawyers for local residents. “You didn’t have to recruit,” she said. “Set up a meeting place, and they’d show up by the hundreds.”\nThe suits focus on whether the swine farms, with their open pools of manure, emit enough odor to be considered a nuisance to neighbors. Photo: Gerry Broome/Associated Press On a recent warm afternoon, the rural road where Mr. and Mrs. Williams live was sparsely traveled, with little noticeable odor.\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs said the farm has been scrubbed clean in advance of the trial. Smithfield has said cleaning is a routine part of business at contract farms, which it doesn’t control. The company has asked that jurors be taken to the farm, a request the federal judge denied.\nNeighbor Calvin Kenan, who isn’t involved in the lawsuit, said the odor varies depending on the temperature, wind and whether manure is being sprayed. “Sometimes it smells like burnt hair,” he said.\nPeople answering the door at a half-dozen neighboring houses identified in court documents as being owned by other plaintiffs declined to comment.\nRelated Bringing Home the Bacon Gets Costly for Chinese Firms With U.S. Units (April 11) Trade Wars Are A Pig of An Issue for WH Group (March 26) U.S. Shows China How the Sausage Is Made (April 4, 2017) Government Scientists Try to Take the Stink Out of Pig Manure (Sep. 18, 2014) The Smithfield cases, which are being closely watched by agriculture companies, show a growing divide between the rural people who produce food and the urban people who consume it, said Gary H. Baise, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer and farmer.\nJurors in the first trial lived within 50 miles of the courthouse in downtown Raleigh, center of a metropolitan area of nearly a million people. The farms involved are about 100 miles away, in sparsely populated rural areas.\nMr. Baise said many urban dwellers are skeptical of industrialized farming because they haven’t been on a farm in years, if ever. “There is a real cleavage between people who have no understanding of agriculture and those who have invested their lives in agriculture,” he said. “It is a clash of values.”",
