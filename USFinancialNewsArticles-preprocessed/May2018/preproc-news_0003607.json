    "text": "UNCASVILLE, Conn., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment, or MGE, the owner and operator of Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut, and Mohegan Sun Pocono in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, announced today the operating results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We are pleased with our fiscal second quarter revenues and earnings performance, as our properties performed admirably despite a combination of challenging comparisons, the imposition of additional gaming taxes in Pennsylvania and several weather disruptions at all of our Northeastern properties in the quarter,\" said Mario Kontomerkos, Chief Executive Officer of MGE. \"Also during the quarter, we reached an amicable agreement to purchase our South Korean partner's stake in Project Inspire, thereby bringing MGE's ownership in the project to 100% and furthering our diversification efforts in Asia, the world's fastest-growing major gaming and entertainment market. Here in Connecticut, we look forward to the addition of the Mohegan Sun Exposition and Convention Center, slated to open this summer, which will continue to position Mohegan Sun as the premier gaming and entertainment destination in the Northeast for years to come.\"\nConsolidated operating results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2018 (unaudited):\nNet revenues of $332.0 million, a 1.4% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Gaming revenues of $288.7 million, a 1.7% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Gross slot revenues of $197.6 million, relatively flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Table game revenues of $92.3 million, a 2.5% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Non-gaming revenues of $66.0 million, relatively flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Income from operations of $56.1 million, a 5.6% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Net income attributable to MGE of $28.6 million, a 9.1% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure described below, of $79.9 million, a 6.3% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2017\nLower gaming revenues at both Mohegan Sun and Mohegan Sun Pocono were driven principally by a combination of lower overall hold and more difficult hold comparisons to the prior period. Collectively, these were the primary contributors to the year-over-year declines in Adjusted EBITDA, net income attributable to MGE and income from operations. Results at Mohegan Sun Pocono were also negatively impacted by an increase in slot taxes assessed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nMohegan Sun\nOperating results (in thousands, unaudited):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\n2018\n2017\nVariance\nVariance\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 77,746\n$ 81,988\n$ (4,242)\n(5.2%)\nIncome from operations\n$ 57,779\n$ 66,485\n$ (8,706)\n(13.1%)\nOperating costs and expenses\n$ 202,575\n$ 198,509\n$ 4,066\n2.0%\nNet revenues\n$ 260,354\n$ 264,994\n$ (4,640)\n(1.8%)\nGaming revenues\n$ 226,131\n$ 229,912\n$ (3,781)\n(1.6%)\nNon-gaming revenues\n$ 52,714\n$ 53,467\n$ (753)\n(1.4%)\nDespite strong overall gaming volumes, Mohegan Sun experienced declines in Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations primarily due to lower gaming revenues resulting from decreases in year-over-year hold percentages for both slots and table games. The declines in Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations also reflected higher medical insurance costs, partially offset by lower casino marketing and promotional expenses. Overall results for the quarter were somewhat impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior period and a weaker entertainment calendar featuring fewer headliner shows. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined slightly to 29.9% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 30.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nSelected gaming data (in thousands, except where noted, unaudited):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\n2018\n2017\nVariance\nVariance\nSlots:\nHandle\n$ 1,823,811\n$ 1,794,537\n$ 29,274\n1.6%\nGross revenues\n$ 146,653\n$ 147,464\n$ (811)\n(0.5%)\nNet revenues\n$ 140,205\n$ 142,213\n$ (2,008)\n(1.4%)\nFree promotional slot plays (1)\n$ 14,961\n$ 14,593\n$ 368\n2.5%\nWeighted average number of machines (in units)\n4,830\n5,009\n(179)\n(3.6%)\nHold percentage (gross)\n8.0%\n8.2%\n(0.2%)\n(2.4%)\nWin per unit per day (gross) (in dollars)\n$ 337\n$ 327\n$ 10\n3.1%\nTable games:\nDrop\n$ 475,461\n$ 468,837\n$ 6,624\n1.4%\nRevenues\n$ 82,745\n$ 84,516\n$ (1,771)\n(2.1%)\nWeighted average number of games (in units)\n275\n274\n1\n0.4%\nHold percentage (2)\n17.4%\n18.0%\n(0.6%)\n(3.3%)\nWin per unit per day (in dollars)\n$ 3,348\n$ 3,432\n$ (84)\n(2.4%)\nPoker:\nRevenues\n$ 2,266\n$ 2,363\n$ (97)\n(4.1%)\nWeighted average number of tables (in units)\n42\n42\n-\n-\nRevenue per unit per day (in dollars)\n$ 600\n$ 625\n$ (25)\n(4.0%)\n(1) Free promotional slot plays are included in slot handle, but not reflected in slot revenues.\n(2) Table game hold percentage is relatively predictable over longer periods of time, but can significantly fluctuate over shorter periods.\nNon-gaming data (in thousands, except where noted, unaudited):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\n2018\n2017\nVariance\nVariance\nFood and beverage:\nRevenues\n$ 15,643\n$ 15,613\n$ 30\n0.2%\nMeals served\n708\n721\n(13)\n(1.8%)\nAverage price per meal served (in dollars)\n$ 15.92\n$ 15.62\n$ 0.30\n1.9%\nHotel:\nRevenues\n$ 13,723\n$ 13,794\n$ (71)\n(0.5%)\nRooms occupied\n133\n135\n(2)\n(1.5%)\nOccupancy rate\n94.4%\n96.5%\n(2.1%)\n(2.2%)\nAverage daily room rate (in dollars)\n$ 100\n$ 99\n$ 1\n1.0%\nRevenue per available room (in dollars)\n$ 94\n$ 95\n$ (1)\n(1.1%)\nRetail, entertainment and other:\nRevenues\n$ 23,348\n$ 24,060\n$ (712)\n(3.0%)\nArena events (in events)\n30\n30\n-\n-\nArena tickets\n178\n184\n(6)\n(3.3%)\nAverage price per Arena ticket (in dollars)\n$ 33.56\n$ 38.84\n$ (5.28)\n(13.6%)\nMohegan Sun Pocono\nOperating results (in thousands, unaudited):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\n2018\n2017\nVariance\nVariance\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 12,230\n$ 12,657\n$ (427)\n(3.4%)\nIncome from operations\n$ 8,872\n$ 9,691\n$ (819)\n(8.5%)\nOperating costs and expenses\n$ 58,258\n$ 58,612\n$ (354)\n(0.6%)\nNet revenues\n$ 67,130\n$ 68,303\n$ (1,173)\n(1.7%)\nGaming revenues\n$ 62,604\n$ 63,824\n$ (1,220)\n(1.9%)\nNon-gaming revenues\n$ 8,698\n$ 9,133\n$ (435)\n(4.8%)\nThe declines in Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations primarily resulted from higher slot taxes driven, in part, by a 1% increase in slot taxes assessed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which went into effect on January 1, 2018. The declines in Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations were also driven by lower overall gaming revenues. In general, the decreases in gaming and non-gaming revenues reflected lower overall business volumes driven, in part, by a repositioning of our promotional offers. These results were partially offset by lower payroll costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined slightly to 18.2% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 18.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nSelected gaming data (in thousands, except where noted, unaudited):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\n2018\n2017\nVariance\nVariance\nSlots:\nHandle\n$ 606,051\n$ 626,828\n$ (20,777)\n(3.3%)\nGross revenues\n$ 50,904\n$ 51,091\n$ (187)\n(0.4%)\nNet revenues\n$ 50,831\n$ 51,276\n$ (445)\n(0.9%)\nFree promotional slot plays (1)\n$ 9,653\n$ 10,860\n$ (1,207)\n(11.1%)\nWeighted average number of machines (in units)\n2,331\n2,235\n96\n4.3%\nHold percentage (gross)\n8.4%\n8.2%\n0.2%\n2.4%\nWin per unit per day (gross) (in dollars)\n$ 242\n$ 255\n$ (13)\n(5.1%)\nTable games:\nDrop\n$ 48,342\n$ 47,923\n$ 419\n0.9%\nRevenues\n$ 9,512\n$ 10,129\n$ (617)\n(6.1%)\nWeighted average number of games (in units)\n73\n73\n-\n-\nHold percentage (2)\n19.7%\n21.1%\n(1.4%)\n(6.6%)\nWin per unit per day (in dollars)\n$ 1,448\n$ 1,542\n$ (94)\n(6.1%)\nPoker:\nRevenues\n$ 566\n$ 655\n$ (89)\n(13.6%)\nWeighted average number of tables (in units)\n18\n18\n-\n-\nRevenue per unit per day (in dollars)\n$ 376\n$ 404\n$ (28)\n(6.9%)\n(1) Free promotional slot plays are included in slot handle, but not reflected in slot revenues.\n(2) Table game hold percentage is relatively predictable over longer periods of time, but can significantly fluctuate over shorter periods.\nNon-gaming revenues (in thousands, except where noted, unaudited):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\n2018\n2017\nVariance\nVariance\nFood and beverage:\nRevenues\n$ 5,527\n$ 6,118\n$ (591)\n(9.7%)\nMeals served\n107\n121\n(14)\n(11.6%)\nAverage price per meal served (in dollars)\n$ 20.74\n$ 21.42\n$ (0.68)\n(3.2%)\nHotel:\nRevenues\n$ 1,234\n$ 1,125\n$ 109\n9.7%\nRooms occupied\n18\n19\n(1)\n(5.3%)\nOccupancy rate\n82.6%\n90.9%\n(8.3%)\n(9.1%)\nAverage daily room rate (in dollars)\n$ 62\n$ 55\n$ 7\n12.7%\nRevenue per available room (in dollars)\n$ 52\n$ 50\n$ 2\n4.0%\nRetail, entertainment and other:\nRevenues\n$ 1,937\n$ 1,890\n$ 47\n2.5%\nCorporate\nOperating results (in thousands, unaudited):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\n2018\n2017\nVariance\nVariance\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ (10,122)\n$ (9,439)\n$ (683)\n(7.2%)\nLoss from operations\n$ (10,579)\n$ (16,752)\n$ 6,173\n36.8%\nOperating costs and expenses\n$ 15,172\n$ 20,339\n$ (5,167)\n(25.4%)\nNet revenues\n$ 4,593\n$ 3,587\n$ 1,006\n28.0%\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 reflect increased development costs associated with our various diversification initiatives, largely driven by Project Inspire and overall development efforts in Asia.

The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by management fees earned in connection with our management contract with ilani Casino Resort, which opened in April 2017.\nMGE Property Information\nNet Revenues\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands, unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nFor the Three Months Ended\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nMohegan Sun\n$ 260,354\n$ 264,994\n$ 57,779\n$ 66,485\n$ 77,746\n$ 81,988\nMohegan Sun Pocono\n67,130\n68,303\n8,872\n9,691\n12,230\n12,657\nCorporate\n4,593\n3,587\n(10,579)\n(16,752)\n(10,122)\n(9,439)\nInter-segment revenues\n(60)\n(60)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 332,017\n$ 336,824\n$ 56,072\n$ 59,424\n$ 79,854\n$ 85,206\nNet Revenues\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor the Six Months Ended\nFor the Six Months Ended\nFor the Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nMohegan Sun\n$ 523,291\n$ 524,197\n$ 114,172\n$ 115,834\n$ 151,280\n$ 147,162\nMohegan Sun Pocono\n131,934\n136,721\n16,547\n17,601\n23,247\n23,616\nCorporate\n8,396\n7,018\n(19,647)\n(24,591)\n(18,688)\n(16,429)\nInter-segment revenues\n(120)\n(120)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 663,501\n$ 667,816\n$ 111,072\n$ 108,844\n$ 155,839\n$ 154,349\nOther Information\nLiquidity As of March 31, 2018, MGE held cash and cash equivalents of $­101.1 million compared to $89.0 million as of September 30, 2017.

154,349\nAdjusted EBITDA Explanation:\nNet income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is a commonly used measure of performance in the casino and hospitality industry. EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. MGE historically has evaluated its operating performance with the non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA, which as used in this press release, represents net income before interest, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, gain or loss on disposition of assets, workforce reduction severance, pre-opening costs and expenses, accretion of discounts, loss on modification and early extinguishment of debt, loss from unconsolidated affiliates, other non-operating income and expense and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests.\nAdjusted EBITDA provides an additional way to evaluate MGE's operations and, when viewed with both MGE's GAAP results and the reconciliations provided, MGE believes that it provides a more complete understanding of its business than could be otherwise obtained absent this disclosure. Adjusted EBITDA is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because: (1) MGE believes it enhances an overall understanding of MGE's past and current financial performance; (2) MGE believes it is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of the business in comparison to other operators within the casino and hospitality industry since Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that may not be indicative of MGE's operating results; (3) measures that are comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are often used as an important basis for the valuation of casino and hospitality companies; and (4) MGE uses Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the performance of its operating personnel and management and as a benchmark to evaluate its operating performance in comparison to its competitors.\nThe use of Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, any GAAP financial measure including net income (as an indicator of MGE's performance) or cash flows provided by operating activities (as an indicator of MGE's liquidity), nor should it be considered as an indicator of MGE's overall financial performance. MGE's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be different from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA or other similarly titled measurements used by other casino and hospitality companies, and therefore, comparability may be limited. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates certain items from net income, such as interest and depreciation and amortization. Each of these items has been incurred in the past, will continue to be incurred in the future and should be considered in the overall evaluation of MGE's results. MGE compensates for these limitations by providing relevant disclosures of items excluded in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, both in its reconciliations to the GAAP financial measure of net income and in its consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating its results. MGE strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nContact:\nMario C.
