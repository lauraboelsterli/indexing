In February, investors relation head João Dantas said the bank was seeking loan growth.\nInflux of investors’ money into BTG funds continued positive, with nearly 20 billion reais in the first quarter. Assets under management reached 264 billion reais in March, according to the filing.\nSão Paulo-based BTG posted a recurring return on equity of 14.2 percent, more than 2 percentage points lower from the previous quarter. The bank targets a 20 percent return on equity in the medium term.\nManagement, led by chief executive officer Roberto Sallouti, will discuss results on a conference call on Thursday.\n$1 = 3.5511 reais Reporting by Carolina Mandl\n ",
