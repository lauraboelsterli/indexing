    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - For Donna Werner, an American, traveling more than seven hours and 3,000 miles will all have been worth it if she just gets a look and a wave from Britain’s newly-married royal couple on Saturday.\nDonna Werner from the U.S., who is a super-fan of Britain's Royal Family, poses outside Windsor Castle ahead of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, in Windsor, May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Marko Djurica Werner, 66, from New Fairfield, Connecticut, has joined thousands of others who will camp out for several nights in the streets of Windsor in the hope of catching a glimpse of Prince Harry and U.S. actress Meghan Markle on their wedding day.\n“I want them to come through those gates. I want them to look at me, wave and smile,” Werner said outside Windsor Castle, dressed head to toe in a mix of British and U.S. flag-themed attire, including a shirt that read “Prince Harry, I’m still available. Last chance!”\n“That will make it all worthwhile. It really will.”\nA self-proclaimed “royal super-fan”, Werner, a married, stay-at-home mom, has made the trip across the Atlantic for several royal occasions in Britain, including the weddings of Prince Andrew in 1986 and Prince William in 2011 and Queen Elizabeth’s 90th birthday celebration in 2016.\nFor her, it’s all about being part of a love story.\n“This is a real life fairytale. It has come true for one little girl... I’m so happy for her and I’m so happy for Harry,” said Werner, who planned to spend her first night under the stars in a sleeping bag on Wednesday.\nDonna Werner from the U.S., who is a super-fan of Britain's Royal Family, poses outside Windsor Castle ahead of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, in Windsor, May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Marko Djurica Armed also with hand warmer heat packets, she will camp there till Saturday to ensure she gets a good view of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s carriage procession after they have tied the knot in a ceremony at St George’s Chapel in the castle.\n“It is such an experience. People think it would be fun to do, but to actually buy a plane ticket and then to sleep on the streets for three to four nights,” she said.\n“At my age most people are, like, ‘give me a hotel’.”\nIn recent days, headlines around the royal wedding have been dominated by news that Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle, will not attend his daughter’s wedding following reports that he staged paparazzi photos and suffered a heart attack.\nWerner, who has described her penchant for the royal family as “a little obsession,” had strong words about the drama.\nDonna Werner from the U.S., who is a super-fan of Britain's Royal Family, arranges flags and decorations near the spot she has chosen outside Windsor Castle from which to witness Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's carriage procession after their wedding, in Windsor, May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Marko Djurica “I really think it stinks,” she said.\n“I just still think you have to be there for your daughter. Just suck it up.”\nReporting by Alex Fraser; Writing by Cassandra Garrison; Editing by Gareth Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
