    "text": "Brian Dozier drove in three runs with a pair of doubles, Lance Lynn tossed 6 2/3 scoreless innings, and the Minnesota Twins downed the slumping Detroit Tigers 6-0 on Tuesday night.\nEhire Adrianza also hit a pair of run-scoring doubles and he scored twice, while Byron Buxton also scored two runs and drove in another. Lynn (2-4) allowed five hits and a walk while striking out four. A trio of relievers completed the shutout.\nThe Twins have won three straight following a three-game losing streak. They have given up just three runs during the upswing.\nNicholas Castellanos, James McCann and JaCoby Jones had two hits apiece for the Tigers, who have lost five straight.\nDetroit starter Matthew Boyd (2-4) was taken out after four-plus innings with a left oblique spasm. He allowed two runs on one hit and four walks without a strikeout.\nDetroit was blanked for the sixth time this season. The Tigers have scored two or fewer runs in five of their last seven games.\nThe Tigers had runners in scoring position in the second when McCann rapped a two-out single and Jones followed with a double. But Lynn responded by retiring Jose Iglesias on a flyout.\nBoyd was removed after issuing walks to Mitch Garver and Logan Morrison in the fifth. Warwick Saupold replaced him and got an out before Adrianza broke the scoreless deadlock with a double to right to knock in Garver. Following a fielder’s choice, Dozier smacked a two-run double to right for a 3-0 Twins lead.\nLynn came out after two batters reached with two outs in the seventh. Ryan Pressly struck out pinch-hitter Mikie Mahtook to end that threat.\nMinnesota then put the game away with three runs in the bottom of the inning.\nMax Kepler and Adrianza hit back-to-back one-out doubles off Buck Farmer. Buxton drove home Adrianza with a single and Dozier drilled another double to make it 6-0.\nThe teams close out the three-game series with a day game on Wednesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
