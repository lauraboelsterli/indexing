Market participants are not making aggressive bets after the week we’ve had, heading into the weekend,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. “We’re in a holding pattern today, digesting the strong gains of the week that we’ve seen.”\nThe Nasdaq biotech index rose 1.1 percent, while the S&P healthcare index rose 0.4 percent ahead of a speech by Trump about controlling prescription drug prices.\nThe president is expected to address high drug prices and barriers to negotiating lower prices for seniors in the Medicare program.\nHowever, the policy proposals will have a relatively modest impact on the healthcare system, health industry sources briefed on the plans told Reuters.\nAt 2:53 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.17 percent at 24,781.06 points, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.02 percent to 2,723.72.\nThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25 percent to 7,386.80.\nThe Dow edged above 100-day moving average for the first time since April 18, following the S&P&rsquo;s similar move a day earlier, suggesting that the market may move higher.\nBoosting the Dow was Verizon, which rose 3 percent after JPMorgan upgraded the wireless carrier to “overweight”, saying 5G opportunity will start to crystallize in the next few months.\nSymantec slumped 32 percent after the Norton Antivirus maker said it was investigating concerns raised by a former employee.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.00-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 121 new highs and 45 new lows.
