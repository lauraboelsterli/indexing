    "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Railway Minister Piyush Goyal will temporarily take additional charge of the finance ministry until Finance Minister Arun Jaitley recovers after undergoing a kidney transplant, the country’s president said in statement on Monday.\nPiyush Goyal, Minister of Railways and Coal of India, gestures as he speaks during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Jaitley, who largely worked from home over the past month, was admitted to the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the Indian capital on Saturday.\n“The surgery has been successful. Both the recipient and donor are stable and recovering well,” the hospital said in a statement on Monday, adding that Jaitley is stable.\nJaitley could be out of action for about a month following surgery, a finance ministry official said.\nJaitley, 65, is a prominent member of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. In 2014, Jaitley had gastric bypass surgery to keep his diabetes in check.\nLast month, he canceled trips to London and Washington due to ill-health.\nGoyal will also handle the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which is overseen by Jaitley.\nAs part of a broader cabinet reshuffle, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore also replaced Smriti Irani as minister of broadcasting and information.\nThe move comes weeks after the broadcasting ministry said India would deny government access to journalists who publish fake news.\nThe decision, taken when Irani was the minister, was heavily criticized and labeled as an attack on the freedom of the press in the world’s largest democracy.\nIrani will remain India’s minister of textiles.\nS.S. Ahluwalia has also been made junior minister in charge of the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology. He will be relieved of his duty as junior minister of the Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation.\n(This version of the story corrects headline and first paragraph to say railway minister, not power minister)\nReporting by Aditi Shah, Manoj Kumar and David Lalmalsawma; Editing by Euan Rocha and Clarence Fernandez\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
