    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Never mind Russia’s state of the art World Cup stadiums, Reuters photographers have been capturing the eclectic settings of communities’ spartan goalposts and pitches.\nHay fills a goalpost during the traditional Cossack games outside the village of Arkhonskaya in the Republic of North Ossetia, Alania, Russia, March 18, 2017. REUTERS/Eduard Korniyenko/Files The sometimes ramshackle goalposts were photographed in Russia and the Crimean peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, giving a glimpse of life away from the fervour of a tournament that will be watched by fans from around the world.\nYoung Russians do pull-ups from the crossbar and run around on pitches in the shadow of golden onion domes, old Soviet concrete walls and modern high-rises.\nLocals also find alternative uses for the rusty, netless posts that have seen better days. One man ties his goat to the upright, children take a dog for a walk, and a man gallops past another on horseback.\nFor the photo essay, click on reut.rs/2snVfV0\nSlideshow (10 Images) Writing by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
