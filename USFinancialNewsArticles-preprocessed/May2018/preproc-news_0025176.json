    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE:ETE) (“ETE” or the “Partnership”) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nETE’s net income attributable to partners was $363 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $124 million compared to $239 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $395 million, an increase of $180 million compared to $215 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The improved results reflect an increase of $183 million in general partner and incentive distributions from Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”) of which $115 million was attributable to a reduction in incentive distribution waivers.\nThe Partnership’s recent key accomplishments and other developments include the following:\nIn April 2018, ETE acquired the general partner of USA Compression Partners, LP (“USAC”) and approximately 12.5 million USAC common units from USA Compression Holdings, LLC. In April 2018, ETE announced a $0.305 distribution per ETE common unit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or $1.22 per unit on an annualized basis. As of March 31, 2018, ETE’s $1.5 billion revolving credit facility had $873 million of outstanding borrowings and its leverage ratio, as defined by the credit agreement, was 2.79x. In January 2018, Sunoco LP redeemed all outstanding Sunoco LP Series A Preferred Units, for which ETE received proceeds of approximately $313 million.\nThe Partnership has scheduled a conference call for 8:00 a.m. Central Time, Thursday, May 10, 2018 to discuss its first quarter 2018 results. The conference call will be broadcast live via an internet webcast, which can be accessed through www.energytransfer.com and will also be available for replay on the Partnership’s website for a limited time.\nThe Partnership’s principal sources of cash flow are derived from distributions related to its direct and indirect investments in the limited and general partner interests in ETP, including 100% of ETP’s incentive distribution rights, limited and general partner interests in Sunoco LP, as well as the Partnership’s ownership of Lake Charles LNG Company, LLC (“Lake Charles LNG”). Subsequent to the acquisition on April 2, 2018, the Partnership also owns interests in USAC, as discussed above.

The Partnership’s non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP financial measures such as net income, cash flow from operating activities or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance. Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted. The Partnership defines Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, for a period as cash distributions expected to be received in respect of such period in connection with the Partnership’s investments in limited and general partner interests, net of the Partnership’s cash expenditures for general and administrative costs and interest expense. The Partnership’s definitions of Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, also include distributable cash flow from Lake Charles LNG to the Partnership. For Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, certain transaction-related expenses that are included in net income are excluded.\nDistributable Cash Flow is a significant liquidity measure used by the Partnership’s senior management to compare net cash flows generated by the Partnership to the distributions the Partnership expects to pay its unitholders. Due to cash expenses incurred from time to time in connection with the Partnership’s merger and acquisition activities and other transactions, Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, is also a significant liquidity measure used by the Partnership’s senior management to compare net cash flows generated by the Partnership to the distributions the Partnership expects to pay its unitholders. Using these measures, the Partnership’s management can compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows for a period to planned cash distributions for such period.\nDistributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, are also important non-GAAP financial measures for our limited partners since these indicate to investors whether the Partnership’s investments are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in quarterly cash distribution levels. Financial measures such as Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, are quantitative standards used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is in part measured by its yield (which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Distributable Cash Flow, and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, is net income for ETE on a stand-alone basis (the “Parent Company”).\nDistribution Coverage Ratio. The Partnership defines Distribution Coverage Ratio for a period as Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, divided by total cash distributions expected to be paid to the partners of ETE in respect of such period.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR PARENT COMPANY\nFollowing are condensed balance sheets and statements of operations of the Parent Company on a stand-alone basis.\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)\n(unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 ASSETS Current assets $ 105 $ 67 Property, plant and equipment, net 27 27 Advances to and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 5,805 6,082 Goodwill 9 9 Other non-current assets, net 8 8 Total assets $ 5,954 $ 6,193 LIABILITIES AND PARTNERS’ DEFICIT Current liabilities $ 87 $ 70 Long-term debt, less current maturities 6,386 6,700 Long-term notes payable – related companies 658 617 Other non-current liabilities 3 2 Commitments and contingencies Total partners’ deficit (1,180 ) (1,196 ) Total liabilities and partners’ deficit $ 5,954 $ 6,193 STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $ (2 ) $ (13 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest expense, net (86 ) (83 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 448 361 Losses on extinguishments of debt — (25 ) Other, net 3 (1 ) NET INCOME 363 239 General Partner’s interest in net income 1 1 Convertible Unitholders’ interest in income 21 6 Limited Partners’ interest in net income $ 341 $ 232\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006392/en/\nEnergy Transfer\nInvestor Relations:\nLyndsay Hannah, Brent Ratliff, Helen Ryoo, 214-981-0795\nor\nMedia Relations:\nVicki Granado, 214-840-5820\nSource: Energy Transfer Equity, L.P.",
