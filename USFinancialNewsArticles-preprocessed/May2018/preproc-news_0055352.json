(NASDAQ:DCPH), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing key mechanisms of tumor drug resistance, today announced that it has appointed Stephen B. Ruddy, Ph.D. as Chief Technical Officer. In this newly created role, Dr. Ruddy will be responsible for establishing and leading a world-class manufacturing and supply chain organization at Deciphera.\n“We are pleased to add Steve to our leadership team at this strategically important time in the evolution of Deciphera,\" said Michael D. Taylor, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Deciphera Pharmaceuticals. \"Steve brings extensive pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply chain expertise, which will be invaluable as we plan for the potential registration and commercialization of DCC-2618 and the further development of Deciphera’s clinical-stage pipeline.”\n“I am delighted to be joining Deciphera Pharmaceuticals at such an exciting time in the advancement of the company’s proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor pipeline,” said Dr. Ruddy. “I look forward to working with the highly talented and passionate team at Deciphera in continuing to build and scale its product development and manufacturing capabilities and helping to bring promising new treatment options to patients with cancer.”\nStephen B. Ruddy, Ph.D. has more than 25 years of global pharmaceutical management and leadership experience in small-molecule and biologics development and manufacturing. Prior to joining Deciphera, Dr. Ruddy served as Vice President of Pharmaceutical Development at TESARO, Inc., an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, where he built and led a CMC organization that enabled multiple small-molecule NDA and MAA approvals and advanced multiple immuno-oncology product candidates from discovery into clinical development. Before joining TESARO, Dr. Ruddy served as Senior Director, Technology Development & Operations at ViroPharma Inc., prior to and following its acquisition by Shire plc. Prior to joining ViroPharma, he served in CMC leadership roles of increasing responsibility at Elan Corporation plc, Merck & Co., Inc., NanoSystems LLC and Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Ruddy earned a B.S. in Pharmacy and a Ph.D. in Pharmaceutics, both from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nAbout Deciphera Pharmaceuticals\nDeciphera Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of cancer patients by tackling key mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the rate and/or durability of response to existing cancer therapies. Our small molecule drug candidates are directed against an important family of enzymes called kinases, known to be directly involved in the growth and spread of many cancers. We use our deep understanding of kinase biology together with a proprietary chemistry library to purposefully design compounds that maintain kinases in a “switched off” or inactivated conformation. These investigational therapies comprise tumor-targeted agents designed to address therapeutic resistance causing mutations and immuno-targeted agents designed to control the activation of immunokinases that suppress critical immune system regulators, such as macrophages. We have used our platform to develop a diverse pipeline of tumor-targeted and immuno-targeted drug candidates designed to improve outcomes for patients with cancer by improving the quality, rate and/or durability of their responses to treatment.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180529005176/en/\nMedia:\nThe Yates Network\nGina Nugent, 617-460-3579\ngina@theyatesnetwork.com\nor\nInvestor Relations:\nArgot Partners\nLaura Perry or Sam Martin, 212-600-1902\nLaura@argotpartners.com or Sam@argotpartners.com\nor\nCompany:\nDeciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC\nChristopher J.
