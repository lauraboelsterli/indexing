    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- At close of regular business on May 4, 2018, Aberdeen Asset Managers Limited (\"AAML\"), part of Aberdeen Standard Investments (\"ASI\"), completed the previously announced agreement with Alpine Woods Capital Investors, LLC (\"Alpine\") to transfer certain assets related to the investment management business of Alpine (the \"AAML/Alpine Agreement\") following the appropriate shareholder approvals, including the approval of new investment advisory agreements for three closed-end funds (and for AWP, also a subadvisory agreement with Aberdeen Asset Management Inc., or \"AAMI\") and respective shareholder approval of reorganizations of Alpine-advised mutual funds into a newly organized series of Aberdeen Funds, with more than $3.6 billion in assets under management.\nClosed-end funds\nASI assumed responsibility for the management of Alpine Global Dynamic Dividend Fund (\"AGD\"), Alpine Total Dynamic Dividend Fund (\"AOD\") and Alpine Global Premier Properties Fund (\"AWP\") (each a \"Fund\" and collectively, the \"Funds\") from Alpine. As noted within each Fund's proxy statement, the Fund names will be changed in order to identify the manager more closely with the Funds and to differentiate them in a competitive market with many known brands. The current investment policies and strategies of the Funds will remain unchanged, so there will be continuity of strategy for the Funds. AAML and its affiliates have extensive experience managing U.S. registered closed-end funds, with dedicated fund support. The name changes are as follows:\nPrior Fund Name\nTicker\nNew Fund Name\nAssets under\nManagement (US$)\nas of 5/1/2018\nWeb Address\nAlpine Global\nPremier Properties Fund\nAWP\nAberdeen Global\nPremier Properties Fund\n$605,244,836\naberdeenawp.com\nAlpine Total\nDynamic Dividend Fund\nAOD\nAberdeen Total Dynamic\nDividend Fund\n$1,077,487,441\naberdeenaod.com\nAlpine Global\nDynamic Dividend Fund\nAGD\nAberdeen Global\nDynamic Dividend Fund\n$145,458,046\naberdeenagd.com\nIn connection with the closing of the acquisition and shareholder approval, effective as of May 4, 2018, the four new Trustees of AWP, AOD and AGD are P. Gerald Malone, Martin Gilbert, Nancy Yao Maasbach and John Sievwright.\nThe day-to-day management of AOD and AGD will be the responsibility of ASI's Global Equity team, and AWP will be managed by the Global Real Estate team. The teams work in a collaborative fashion, with all team members having both portfolio management and research responsibilities. ASI welcomed two new colleagues from Alpine Woods to join the teams managing AOD and AGD; Joshua Duitz has joined the Global Equity Team and will work primarily on the dynamic dividend funds which he has managed since 2012 and Bruce Ebnother, managing the real estate products since 2011, has joined the Global Real Estate team.\nMutual Funds\nFollowing the reorganization approved by shareholders, each target fund below transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the corresponding acquiring fund.\nTarget Funds Each a Series of\nAlpine Series Trust\nSurviving Funds Each a Series of Aberdeen Funds\nAssets under\nManagement (US$)\nas of May 1, 2018\nAlpine Dynamic Dividend Fund\nAberdeen Dynamic Dividend Fund\n$160,546,376\nAlpine Rising Dividend Fund\nAberdeen Income Builder Fund\n$98,983,628\nAlpine Global Infrastructure Fund\nAberdeen Global Infrastructure\nFund\n$124,218,036\nAlpine International Real Estate Equity Fund\nAberdeen International Real\nEstate Equity Fund\n$122,633,898\nAlpine Realty Income and Growth Fund\nAberdeen Realty Income and\nGrowth Fund\n$91,706,123\nAlpine High Yield Managed Duration Municipal Fund\nAberdeen High Yield Managed\nDuration Municipal Fund\n$211,938,198\nAlpine Ultra Short Municipal Income Fund\nAberdeen Ultra Short Municipal\nIncome Fund\n$997,691,189\nThe day-to-day management of the Aberdeen Dynamic Dividend Fund and Aberdeen Global Infrastructure Fund will be the responsibility of ASI's Global Equities team.

Joshua Duitz joined the Global Equity team and will work primarily on the Aberdeen Dynamic Dividend Fund and Aberdeen Global Infrastructure Fund, which he has managed since 2012. Bruce Ebnother, who has managed real estate products since 2011, joined the Global Real Estate team.
