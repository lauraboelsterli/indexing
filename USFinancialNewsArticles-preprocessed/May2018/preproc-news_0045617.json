U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he delivers remarks during the Prison Reform Summit at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nPence told Fox News that North Korea should not attempt to seek concessions from the United States for promises it did not intend to keep.\n“It would be a great mistake for Kim Jong Un to think he could play Donald Trump,” Pence said according to excerpts of an interview made available by Fox. When asked if Trump could still walk away from the summit scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, he replied: “Well there’s no question.” Reporting by David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Sandra Maler",
