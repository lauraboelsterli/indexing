    "text": "BERLIN, May 7 (Reuters) - A senior German official on Monday expressed concern about limits facing foreign correspondents in China, and urged Beijing to allow state-funded German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle to open an office in Beijing.\nForeign Ministry State Secretary Andreas Michaelis underscored the importance of freedom of speech and the press as central rights in the German constitution in remarks at the opening of a one-day German-Chinese journalist dialogue.\n“We are concerned when we hear reports about obstruction of the work of foreign journalists in China,” Michaelis told two dozen Chinese and Western media representatives, and Guo Weimin, vice minister of China’s Information Office of the State Council.\nMichaelis noted that Deutsche Welle had tried unsuccessfully for some time to open an office in Beijing.\n“We believe, that as strategic partners we should use the opportunity to get to know one another better, and to understand each other’s perspectives. In Germany, we can receive China Global Television network in every hotel, in every household. Why should this not be possible in China for Deutsche Welle?” he said.\nMichaelis said he welcomed news that German weekly newspaper Die Zeit would be re-opening an office in China, and said he hoped that other media would be able to do so as well.\n“We may not always have the same opinion, but less dialogue is not the right way to overcome our differences,” he said. “We need more dialogue, more cooperation, and more exchanges.”\nGuo said media organisations had an important role to play in promoting understanding, combating trade protectionism, and helping expand economic ties between the two countries.\n“In a world in which we cooperate more and more, the media are a bridge that ... connects us,” he said.\nThe minister spoke after Michaelis and did not address his comments on Deutsche Welle.\nIn October Chinese President Xi Jinping told foreign journalists to roam the country and report more, even as five global news organisations found themselves without invitations to cover a speech where Xi introduced his new leadership line-up following a once-in-five-years Communist Party Congress.
