    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 7:03 PM / Updated 28 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Malawi says World Bank, EU to unlock suspended budget aid Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLILONGWE, May 18 (Reuters) - Malawi’s finance minister said on Friday that economic stability would unlock budget support from the country’s western donors which had been suspended over graft allegations.\nFinance Minister Goodall Gondwe said that the county had achieved economic stability and attained the desired goal of the International Monetary Fund’s approval of a $112.3 million loan which in turn has helped unlock frozen aid.\n“With inflation at 9.7 percent in April, interest rates are falling, the exchange rate has stabilised and foreign reserves have soared to a historical level, it means that the target of economic stability has been achieved,” Gondwe told parliament when presenting his 2018/19 budget.\nBoth the World Bank and the European Union suspended budget support in 2012 over a corruption scandal in which public servants siphoned off millions of dollars.\nLast month the IMF approved a new three-year loan arrangement for Malawi to assist the southern African country’s economic and financial reforms.\nThe fund said that Malawi had shown progress in achieving macroeconomic stabilisation following two years of drought.\nGondwe said the country will now focus on robust economic growth as the main target and forecast the economy to expand by 4.1 percent this year, supported by more infrastructure investment and social spending.\nThe growth forecast compares with 5.1 percent in 2017.\n“World Bank returned with budget support during the current financial year and it is due to disburse another one in the early part of the next financial year. It is also expected that the EU could approve budget support for Malawi in the course of 2018/19,” he said.\nMalawi has a total public debt of $3.50 billion, with about a third of that in external debt.
