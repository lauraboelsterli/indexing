This shortened time in construction and period of approval allows our clients to quickly supply their products to the market.\nWith its competitiveness, Samsung BioLogics has won the CMO Leadership Award presented by Life Science Leader in all six core categories for two consecutive years.\nFor the 2018 CMO Leadership Awards, more than 110 CMOs from around the world were evaluated on 23 performance metrics to determine winners in the six categories. Only CMO clients participate in the survey, which enhances the validity of the award.\nTH Kim, CEO and President of Samsung BioLogics, said \"There has been some cases recently where CMO's failure of receiving approval affects the clients' drug marketing schedule.\" Then he added that \"Samsung BioLogics has once again demonstrated that it possesses world class Quality with Data Integrity which is critical to get global approvals. Samsung BioLogics has been striving to establish a system to completely prevent even tiny data errors that may occur during the whole production process of biopharmaceuticals from the establishment of the company and to set it up as a corporate culture.\nTH Kim also said \"We will continue to do our best to continuously innovate ourselves so that clients and patients can receive high quality medical products in a timely manner\"\nSamsung BioLogics will be attending the BIO International 2018 Conference in Boston June 4-7, 2018, as an exhibitor for the 8th year in a row to pursue additional contracts.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/samsung-biologics-receives-an-additional-fda-approval-for-its-world-largest-plants-production-300654138.html\nSOURCE Samsung Biologics",
