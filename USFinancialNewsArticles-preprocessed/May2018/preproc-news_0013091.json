In addition, RQDII investors must submit investment details to the central bank, and are subject to PBOC’s macro prudent assessment.\nThe notice on RQDII, launched in 2014, came after China last month resumed the Qualified Domestic Institution Investor (QDII) scheme, which allows Chinese investors to convert yuan into foreign currencies to buy overseas securities.\nChina’s forex regulator has also widened the quotas of two other outbound investment schemes in Shanghai and Shenzhen as part of the government’s efforts to liberalize financial markets.
