S&P 500 e-minis were down 1.75 points, or 0.06 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 2.25 points, or 0.03 percent.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield spiked above the key 3 percent level to its highest since July 2011 on Tuesday after the retail data. It was last at 3.0613 percent.\nFederal funds futures implied that traders saw a 54 percent chance that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise rates for a fourth time by year-end.\nMacy’s 6.9 percent jump after reporting a much better-than-expected rise in same-store sales in the first quarter, helped shares of other retailers. J. C. Penney, Kohl’s and Nordstrom were all up more than 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent.\nMicron rose 2.1 percent in premarket trading after RBC Capital Markets began coverage with “outperform” rating, while AMD gained 1.7 percent after a rating upgrade at Susquehanna.
