Since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States this month from the Iran nuclear deal, European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the agreement. Published 15 Hours Ago Reuters Anadolu Agency | Getty Images Chinese President Xi Jinping and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at a meeting at Saadabad Palace in Tehran, Iran on January 23, 2016.\nChina will host Iranian President Hassan Rouhani next month at a regional summit in a Chinese coastal city, the country's foreign ministry said on Monday, as major power scramble to save Iran's nuclear deal after the United States pulled out.\nRouhani will pay a working visit to China and attend the summit of the China and Russia -led security bloc the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the ministry said.\nIt did not give exact dates for his visit, but the summit is scheduled to be held on the second weekend of June in the northern Chinese city of Qingdao.\nIran is currently an observer member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, though it has long sought full membership.\nRussia has previously argued that with Western sanctions against Tehran lifted, it could finally become a member of the bloc which also includes four ex-Soviet Central Asian republics, Pakistan and India.\nThe 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers lifted international sanctions on Tehran. In return, Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities, increasing the time it would need to produce an atom bomb if it chose to do so.\nSince U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States this month, calling the agreement deeply flawed, European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal.\nChina has also strongly supported the deal and is one of its signatories.",
