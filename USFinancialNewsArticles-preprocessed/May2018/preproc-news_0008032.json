(Nasdaq:AEIS), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Carrying on the momentum seen in 2017, first quarter semiconductor revenue again reached record levels while our Industrial business soared to new historical highs due to the rapid adoption of our advanced technology and expanding geographical presence,” said Yuval Wasserman, president and CEO of Advanced Energy. “Our diversification strategy is working - producing strong results - as we continue to execute on our strategic plan towards our aspirational goals. We believe our strong balance sheet provides the flexibility required to acquire new products and technologies and return value to shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter Results\nSales were $195.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $179.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $149.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP income from continuing operations was $46.4 million or $1.16 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018 compared with a loss from continuing operations of $29.0 million or $0.73 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, and income from continuing operations of $35.4 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP income from continuing operations was $53.4 million or $1.34 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018.

Advanced Energy’s non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of non-cash related charges such as stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, as well as non-recurring items such as acquisition-related costs. Additionally, the first quarter non-GAAP results exclude estimated income tax expense associated with U.S. tax reform. For the second quarter ending June 30, 2018 guidance, the company expects stock-based compensation of $2.7 million and amortization of intangibles of $1.4 million. The non-GAAP measures included in this release are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, similar measures calculated under generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Advanced Energy believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors to evaluate business performance without the impacts of certain non-cash charges and other charges which are not part of the company’s usual operations. The company uses these non-GAAP measures to assess performance against business objectives, make business decisions, develop budgets, forecast future periods, assess trends and evaluate financial impacts of various scenarios. In addition, management's incentive plans include these non-GAAP measures as criteria for achievements. Additionally, the company believes that these non-GAAP measures, in combination with its financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with additional perspective. While some of the excluded items may be incurred and reflected in the company’s GAAP financial results in the foreseeable future, the company believes that the items excluded from certain non-GAAP measures do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of its continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. The use of non-GAAP measures has limitations in that such measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and these measures should only be used to evaluate the company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Please refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe company’s guidance with respect to anticipated financial results for the second quarter ending June 30, 2018, potential future growth and profitability, our future business mix, expectations regarding future market trends and the company’s future performance within specific markets (e.g., statements regarding anticipated semiconductor and industrial market growth) and other statements herein or made on the above-announced conference call that are not historical information are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
