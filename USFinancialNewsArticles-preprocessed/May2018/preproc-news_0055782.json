    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Eight Chinese regions have pledged to beef up anti-pollution curbs, vowing fresh cuts to smog levels, a push for cleaner water and soil, and tighter scrutiny of government officials after Beijing-led probes uncovered thousands of violations.\nHere is a summary of the targets and measures proposed by the major regions:\nSHANDONG - Aims to cut concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 to 49 micrograms per cubic meter by 2020\n- Will cut 3.55 million tonnes per year (tpy) of crude steel capacity and 600,000 tpy of pig iron capacity in 2018\n- Still needs to close 7.1 million tpy of ironmaking capacity and 5.94 million tonnes of steelmaking capacity that Rizhao Steel Holding Group was asked to cut in 2015\n- Will promote withdrawal of excess and outdated capacity in the aluminum, chemical, cement, steel and other high-polluting and high coal-consuming industries\n- Inspections and large-scale overhauls of outdated coal-fired power and illegal coal-fired power generation units will continue until end-June\n- By end-June, it will develop plan to reduce coal consumption by 2020\nZHEJIANG - Will reduce heavy metal pollutants in key industries by more than 10 percent from 2013 levels by 2020\n- Build 20 new waste disposal facilities by end-2018, each with a capacity of at least 10,000 tonnes per day, to ease the shortage of garbage disposal capacity\nXINJIANG - By 2020, PM2.5 levels in the capital Urumqi will have fallen by 25 percent from 2017 levels. Percentage of days with heavy and worse pollution will fall by 15 percent from 2017\n- Will strictly control consumption of thermal coal during winter time, and cut production of thermal power, cement, steel, coal chemicals in winter\n- By 2020, emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide will fall 3 percent from 2015 levels in areas where pollution is severe\n- Will continue to crack down on use of film residue in farmland and restore polluted soil in oil and mine fields\n- Will demolish small coal-fired thermal power plants that the state has ordered to shut by end-2019 and ban new small to medium-sized coal plants in Duha, Huaidong and Yili districts\nJILIN - By 2020, PM2.5 levels will drop by at least 18 percent from 2015 levels and percentage of coal consumption in overall energy consumption will drop to below 63 percent\n- By 2020, will eliminate small coal-powered boilers in counties and cities, and animal waste treatment rates will reach more than 75 percent\n- Will strictly implement measures to cut and stop heavy manufacturing on days with heavy pollution\nSICHUAN - Will shut 4.2 million tpy of crude steel capacity, 5 million tpy of cement, 34 million tpy of coal and 1.12 gigawatts of coal-fired power capacity by end-2020\n- Government will close Dazhou Steel and Iron Corpâ€™s current factory and move it to a suburban area as soon as possible\nReporting by Tom Daly, Hallie Gu and BEIJING newsroom; Compiled by Josephine Mason; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ",
