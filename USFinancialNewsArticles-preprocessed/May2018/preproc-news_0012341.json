    "text": "May 7, 2018 / 11:05 AM / in 17 minutes Buffett bashes bitcoin as nonproductive, thriving on mystique Jonathan Stempel , Jennifer Ablan 2 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday said buyers of bitcoin, which he has characterized as “rat poison squared,” thrive on the hope they’ll find other people who will pay more for it. Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, pauses while playing bridge as part of the company annual meeting weekend in Omaha, Nebraska U.S. May 6, 2018. REUTERS/Rick Wilking\nLikening bitcoin demand to the tulip mania in 17th century Holland, Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said the mystique behind the cryptocurrency has driven a surge in its price.\n“It does create a rising price, creates more buyers ... If you don’t understand it, you get much more excited,” Buffett said on CNBC television. “People like to speculate, they like to gamble.”\nBuffett said investors would instead be much better off investing in U.S. stocks, which in turn are also a far better investment than 10- or 30-year U.S. government bonds.\nBuffett said stock prices are elevated but not in a bubble.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\nHe said he would much rather have Berkshire’s pile of cash and equivalents be $30 billion, rather than the $108.6 billion it was at the end of March, but good deals have not emerged.\nBuffett revealed last week having bought about 75 million additional Apple Inc shares in the first quarter, despite already owning about 165.3 million.\nBerkshire now owns 5 percent of the iPhone maker, trailing only Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.\nHe also said he would be happy to see Apple shares go down in price if it would spur repurchases.\nBuffett presided on Saturday at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which was expected to have drawn more than 40,000 people.
