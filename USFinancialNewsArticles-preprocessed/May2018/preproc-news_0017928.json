    "text": "Fox Is Buying 7 Sinclair-Owned Television Stations for $910 Million Sinclair Broadcast Group, the owner of the largest chain of television stations in the nation. William Thomas Cain—Getty Images By Emily Price 3:21 PM EDT\nTwenty-First Century Fox has agreed to buy seven television stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group at a cost of $910 million, Reuters reports .\nThe deal allows Sinclair to acquire the regulatory approval it needs to complete its purchase of Tribune Media . For Fox, the buy grows its coverage to nearly half of all households in the United States and puts it in 19 of the top 20 television markets in the U.S.\nEarlier this year, Sinclair gained attention for its decision to require the anchors at its stations to read a script during the news broadcast condemning “fake news” from larger national news stations. Many, including the anchors reading the scripts, felt like the move was pushing a pro-Trump agenda.\nIn April, President Trump tweeted his support for Sinclair Broadcasting and said it was “far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.” Most of Sinclair’s stations are CNN affiliates.\nWith 173 stations, Sinclair is the largest owner of local TV stations in the United States.
