These results continue to confirm an upward trend initiated in 2017 that is bringing improved volumes to GGR and Equipment. Contractual Data Acquisition activities remain challenged by low demand and deteriorated price conditions.\nIn the current context of strengthening oil prices, we observe a gradual market improvement, even as the major oil companies remain very cautious in their spending. In this environment, we confirm our revenue growth and EBITDAs margin targets for 2018.\nThe restructuring of CGG was successfully completed at the end of February and our balance sheet has been restored. My ambition, as the new CEO, and with the commitment of all our teams, is to return CGG to a business of sustainable and profitable growth, paving a new path to success for all our shareholders, clients and employees.\"\nPost-closing events\nApril 24th: Completion of the first lien refinancing\nCGG S.A. announced the issuance by its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, CGG Holding (U.S.) Inc., of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.000% First Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2023 and €280 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% First Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2023. These new first lien senior secured notes represent a total principal amount of $645m at a weighted average coupon of 8.40%. The cumulated savings related to such refinancing over the period running up to February 2021 (original non-call period) amount to c. $70m.\nApril 26th: Renewal of the governance\nCGG's Board of Directors, meeting on April 26, 2018, elected Philippe Salle as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Sophie Zurquiyah took up her position of CEO of the Group and was appointed director by the general meeting on the same day. Since the beginning of the year, CGG Board of Directors has completed the process of renewing its governance with the appointment of 6 new Directors.\nTransitory first time application of IFRS 15\nThe application of IFRS 15 does not result in any significant change to the Group's revenue recognition policies but for multi-clients pre-commitments. CGG's preliminary interpretation of the new standard was that the historical method, relying on percentage of completion principles, was the best accounting solution to timely provide a fair vision of the industrial and financial performance of the Company and was compliant with the new IFRS standard. However, our auditors' technical panel eventually concluded early 2018 that it was not the case.\nFollowing this determination, CGG investigated the merits and the practicability of an alternative revenue recognition policy, based on two performance obligations: one service with revenues to be recognized over time and weighting on average between 80%-95% of total obligations, and one corresponding to the final processed data with revenues to be recognized only upon delivery. This alternative revenue recognition policy has, however, not been endorsed by the Group's auditors and the regulators of the financial markets where the Group's securities are listed. In addition, some other seismic players have decided to implement IFRS 15 in Q1 2018 through a revenue recognition policy for pre-commitments based on a single performance obligation and deferring the recognition of revenues upon delivery of final processed data.\nIn that context and in the absence of a finalized IFRS 15 accounting policy, CGG decided to present a dual approach in the Group's first quarter 2018 results:\n(i) one set of figures (the \"Segment Figures\") corresponding to the figures used for internal management reporting purposes and produced in accordance with the Group's historical method (percentage of completion) and\n(ii) a second set of figures (the \"IFRS\" figures) in line with the accounting practice adopted by some other seismic players as described above, with pre-commitment revenue recognized in full only upon delivery of the final data.\nCGG intends, through further discussions with its auditors and with the regulators, to continue advocating for the IFRS 15 compliance of the alternative revenue recognition policy described above based on the two distinct performance obligations contained in these contracts. This approach would allow the Company going forward to base its financial communication only on its IFRS accounts rather than on multiple sets of figures. The Company aims to fix a definitive approach with its auditors and the regulators prior to the release of the half-year 2018 financial statements.\nKey IFRS Figures - First Quarter 2018\nIn million $ First Quarter\n2017* Fourth Quarter\n2017* First Quarter\n2018 Group Revenue 249.4 400.7 245.6 Operating Income (96.9) (8.0) (67.1) Equity from investments 2.5 (8.9) 1.3 Net cost of financial debt (46.8) (46.8) (33.2) Other financial income (loss) (1.6) 1.0 762.8 Income Taxes (2.3) (12.2) (17.2) Net Income (145.1) (74.9) 646.6 Net Debt 2,334.9 2,639.9 659.3 Capital Employed 3,342.0 3,168.0 3,149.4 *Previous periods are not restated as per IFRS 15 guidelines\nKey Segment Figures - First Quarter 2018\nIn million $ First Quarter\n2017 Fourth Quarter\n2017 First Quarter\n2018 Segment Revenue 249.4 400.7 294.7 Segment EBITDAs 28.7 134.1 53.0 Group EBITDAs margin 11.5% 33.5% 18.0% Segment Operating Income (67.2) 17.5 (22.3) Opinc margin (26.9)% 4.4% (7.6)% Non-recurring charges (NRC) (29.7) (25.5) (33.9) IFRS 15 adjustment na na (10.9) IFRS Operating Income (96.9) (8.0) (67.1) Equity from investments 2.5 (8.9) 1.3 Net Financial Costs current part (48.4) (45.8) (30.4) Non-recurring financial items 0 0 760.0 Income Taxes (2.3) (12.2) (17.2) Net Income (145.1) (74.9) 646.6 Segment Operating Cash Flow 34.4 143.4 62.8 IFRS Operating Cash Flow (10.8) 117.0 7.1 Segment Free Cash Flow (74.3) 13.4 (39.9) IFRS Free Cash Flow (119.5) (13.0) (95.6) Net Debt 2,334.9 2,639.9 659.3 Capital Employed 3,342.0 3,168.0 3,179.7\nKey figures bridge: Segment to IFRS - First Quarter 2018\nQ1 2018 P&L items\nIn million $ Segment figures IFRS 15 adjustments NRC* adjustments IFRS figures Total Revenue 294.7 (49.1) 0 245.6 OPINC (22.3) (10.9) (33.9) (67.1)\nQ1 2018 Cash Flow Statement items\nIn million $ Segment figures IFRS 15 adjustments NRC adjustments IFRS figures EBITDAs 53.0 (49.1) (33.9) (30.0) Change in Working Capital & Provisions 31.0 49.1 (21.8) 58.3 Cash Flow from Operations 62.8 0 (55.7) 7.1\nOpening Balance Sheet - January 1st 2018\nIn million $ Segment figures IFRS 15 adjustments NRC adjustments IFRS figures MC Data Library NBV 831.2 119.4 0 950.6 Other current liabilities 123.1 130.6 0 253.7\nClosing Balance Sheet - March 31st 2018\nIn million $ Segment figures IFRS 15 adjustments NRC adjustments IFRS figures MC Data Library NBV 853.9 157.6 0 1,011.5 Other current liabilities 104.9 153.1 0 258.0 *Non-recurring charges linked to Transformation Plan and Financial Restructuring\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results by Operating Segment and before non-recurring charges\nGeology, Geophysics & Reservoir (GGR)\nGGR\nIn million $ First Quarter\n2017 Fourth Quarter\n2017 First Quarter\n2018 Variation\nYear-on-year Variation\nQuarter-to-quarter Segment Revenue 158.0 255.0 185.1 17% (27)% Multi-Client 72.2 158.6 84.4 17% (47)% Prefunding 53.2 72.1 49.2 (8)% (32)% After-Sales 19.0 86.5 35.2 85% (59)% Subsurface Imaging & Reservoir (SIR) 85.8 96.4 100.7 17% 4% Segment EBITDAs 80.2 164.5 96.9 21% (41)% Margin 50.8% 64.5% 52.4% 160 bps na Segment Operating Income 18.3 63.3 38.4 110% (39)% Margin 11.6% 24.8% 20.7% 910 bps (410) bps Equity from Investments 0 (0.2) (0.5) na (150)% Capital Employed (in billion $) 2.3 2.2 2.2 na na GGR Segment Revenue was $185 million, up 17% year-on-year and down 27% sequentially.\nMulti-Client revenue was $84 million, up 17% year-on-year and down 47% sequentially. 44% of the fleet was allocated to multi-client programs compared to 29% in Q1 2017 and 75% in Q4 2017.

This compares to 91% in the first quarter of 2017 and 82% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our vessel production rate was 96%. This compares to 98% in the first quarter of 2017 and 97% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe decrease in revenue can be explained by the higher dedication to multi-client surveys, as 44% of the fleet was dedicated to multi-client programs versus 29% in the first quarter of 2017 (75% in the fourth quarter of 2017) and different type of contract this quarter. In Q1 2017, we were executing a large contract for Pemex with high-end multi-source vessel setup.\nLand and Multi-Physics Data Acquisition revenue was $32 million, up 48% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. Land and Airborne continued to recover from a very low point in Q1 2017.\nContractual Data Acquisition Segment EBITDAs was $(25) million.\nContractual Data Acquisition Segment Operating Income was $(34) million. Contractual Data Acquisition activities continued to suffer from a competitive market in marine. Weather downtimes and more specifically an earthquake in Papua New Guinea affecting Land surveys operations, further impacted activities.\nThe equity from investments contribution can mainly be explained by the positive contribution from the ARGAS and SBGS JVs this quarter.\nContractual Data Acquisition Capital Employed was stable at $0.3 billion at the end of March 2018.\nNon-Operated Resources\nNon-Operated Resources\nIn million $ First Quarter\n2017 Fourth Quarter\n2017 First Quarter\n2018 Variation\nYear-on-year Variation\nQuarter-to-quarter Segment EBITDAs (8.0) (2.8) (7.0) 13% (150)% Segment Operating Income (20.3) (4.1) (7.0) 66% (71)% Equity from Investments 0 (2.9) (3.5) na (21)% Capital Employed (in billion $) 0 0.1 0.1 na na The Non-Operated Resources Segment comprises, in terms of EBITDAs and Operating Income, the costs relating to non-operated resources.\nNon-Operated Resources Segment EBITDAs was $(7) million, including the restart costs of one vessel (Caribbean).\nNon-Operated Resources Segment Operating Income was $(7) million.\nThe equity from investments includes the impact of 50% of the Global Seismic Shipping (GSS) JV, which we own with Eidesvik.
