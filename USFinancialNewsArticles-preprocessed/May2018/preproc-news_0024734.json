    "text": "SAN CARLOS, Calif., May 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BioCardia®, Inc. [OTC: BCDA], a leader in the development of comprehensive solutions for cardiovascular regenerative therapies, filed its 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results:\nBioCardia reported a net loss of $3.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, which compares to a net loss of $2.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Research and development expenses were $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to expenses incurred while conducting the pivotal CardiAMP Heart Failure Trial. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1.7 million, a 5.4% decrease compared to $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net cash used in operations in the first quarter of 2018 was $3.0 million, an increase of $758,000, from $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n2018 Corporate Highlights:\nThe CardiAMP Heart Failure Trial is currently enrolling patients at 13 world class centers in the United States with Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) National Reimbursement. The trial design was published in the American Heart Journal in April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a second pivotal Investigational Device Exemption trial for the CardiAMP Cell Therapy System for the treatment of chronic myocardial ischemia with refractory angina. CMS has approved this CardiAMP Chronic Myocardial Ischemia Trial for national reimbursement coverage. The Company received a new US Patent related to its CardiAMP cell potency assay, providing further protection to its autologous cell therapy programs in both heart failure and chronic myocardial ischemia indications.\nAbout BioCardia®\nBioCardia , Inc., headquartered in San Carlos, California, is developing regenerative biologic therapies to treat cardiovascular disease. CardiAMP™ and CardiALLO™ cell therapies are the Company's biotherapeutic product candidates in clinical development. The Company's current products include the Helix™ transendocardial delivery system and the Morph® steerable guide and sheath catheter portfolio. BioCardia also partners with other biotherapeutic companies to provide its Helix systems and clinical support to their programs studying therapies for the treatment of heart failure, chronic myocardial ischemia and acute myocardial infarction.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to many risks and uncertainties.
