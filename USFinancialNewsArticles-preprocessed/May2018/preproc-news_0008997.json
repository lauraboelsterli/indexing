    "text": "Reports Record Bookings of $182 Million\nRaises Full-Year Revenue and EPS Guidance\nWESTFORD, Mass., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kadant Inc. (NYSE:KAI) reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRevenue increased 45% to $149 million GAAP diluted EPS increased 20% to $0.96 Adjusted diluted EPS increased 30% to $1.07 Net income increased 21% to $11 million Adjusted EBITDA increased 49% to $24 million and represented 16% of revenue Gross margin was 44.3% Bookings increased 53% to a record $182 million Record bookings and revenue for parts and consumables of $103 and $96 million, respectively Backlog increased 24% sequentially to a record $180 million Cash flow from operations was $7 million\nNote: Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items as detailed later in this press release under the heading “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nManagement Commentary\n“We had a great start to 2018 with record bookings and solid EPS performance in the first quarter,” said Jonathan Painter, president and chief executive officer. “We saw excellent performance by our newly acquired businesses as well as strong internal growth, which was broad-based both geographically and across our product lines. Our backlog increased 24 percent sequentially to a record $180 million and our bookings were a record $182 million leading us to increase our revenue and EPS guidance for the year.\n“Our record bookings performance of $182 million was led by strong capital bookings in North America and Europe and record parts and consumables bookings of $103 million. As a long-standing strategic focus of ours, I am pleased to see these positive results with our parts and consumables business.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenue increased 45 percent to $149.2 million compared to the first quarter of 2017, including $34.8 million from acquisitions and a $6.7 million increase from the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, revenue increased five percent compared to the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 44.3 percent. Net income increased 21 percent to $10.9 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, compared to $9.0 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 30 percent to $1.07 compared to $0.82 in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2018 excludes $0.05 of restructuring costs, $0.04 of discrete tax expense, and $0.02 of amortization from acquired backlog. Adjusted diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2017 excludes $0.02 of acquisition costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 49 percent to $23.5 million compared to $15.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA excludes $0.8 million of restructuring costs and $0.3 million of amortization from acquired backlog in the first quarter of 2018 and $0.3 million of acquisition costs in the first quarter of 2017. Cash flows from operations increased to $7.2 million compared to $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Bookings increased 53 percent to a record $181.9 million compared to $118.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 and includes $40.2 million from acquisitions and a $8.2 million increase from the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, bookings increased 12 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nSummary and Outlook\n“We are encouraged by our bookings trend and the excellent start to 2018,” Mr. Painter continued. “Based on our record bookings performance in the first quarter, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our guidance for 2018. We expect to report full year revenue of $625 to $635 million, increased from our previous guidance of $605 to $615 million. We expect to achieve GAAP diluted EPS of $4.98 to $5.08 in 2018, increased from our previous guidance of $4.74 to $4.84. The 2018 guidance incorporates an increase in our forecasted interest and tax expense. The 2018 guidance includes pre-tax restructuring costs of $1.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, discrete tax expense of $0.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and pre-tax amortization expense associated with acquired backlog of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these expenses, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $5.15 to $5.25 for 2018. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $0.89 to $0.94 on revenue of $150 to $154 million. The second quarter of 2018 guidance includes pre-tax restructuring costs of $0.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Excluding this expense, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $0.95 to $1.00 for the second quarter of 2018.”\nConference Call\nKadant will hold a webcast with a slide presentation for investors on Tuesday, May 1, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. eastern time to discuss its first quarter performance, as well as future expectations.

We believe that the inclusion of such measures helps investors gain an understanding of our underlying operating performance and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts our performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by us in our financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. We also believe this information is responsive to investors' requests and gives them an additional measure of our performance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release have limitations associated with their use as compared to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, in that they may be different from, and therefore not comparable to, similar measures used by other companies.\nRevenue included $34.8 million from acquisitions and a $6.7 million favorable foreign currency translation effect in the first quarter of 2018. We present increases or decreases in revenue excluding the effect of acquisitions and foreign currency translation to provide investors insight into underlying revenue trends.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring costs, acquisition costs, amortization expense related to acquired backlog and discrete tax expense. These items are excluded as they are not indicative of our core operating results and are not comparable to other periods, which have differing levels of incremental costs or income or none at all.\nAdjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin exclude:\nPre-tax restructuring costs of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018. Pre-tax expense related to acquired backlog of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. Pre-tax acquisition costs of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS exclude:\nAfter-tax restructuring costs of $0.6 million ($0.8 million net of tax of $0.2 million) in the first quarter of 2018. After-tax expense related to acquired backlog of $0.2 million ($0.3 million net of tax of $0.1 million) in the first quarter of 2018. Discrete tax expense of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. After-tax acquisition costs of $0.2 million ($0.3 million net of tax of $0.1 million) in the first quarter of 2017.\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in this press release.\nFinancial Highlights (unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts and percentages) Three Months Ended Consolidated Statement of Income (a) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Revenues $ 149,193 $ 102,857 Costs and Operating Expenses: Cost of revenues 83,114 53,840 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 45,776 34,620 Research and development expenses 2,869 2,147 Restructuring costs 770 -
