    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 7:16 PM / in an hour Former Wilmington Trust executives convicted in U.S. fraud trial Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMay 3 (Reuters) - Four former Wilmington Trust Co executives were convicted on Thursday of U.S. charges that they concealed from regulators the amount of troubled loans still on the bankâ€™s books after the 2008 financial crisis, prosecutors said.\nThe verdict by a federal jury in Wilmington, Delaware, came in one of the few criminal cases in which federal prosecutors sought to hold top executives at a well-known financial company accountable for conduct tied to the crisis.\nThe former Wilmington executives are President Robert Harra, Chief Financial Officer David Gibson, Controller Kevyn Rakowski and Chief Credit Officer William North.\nWilmington Trust is now owned by M&T Bank Corp.
