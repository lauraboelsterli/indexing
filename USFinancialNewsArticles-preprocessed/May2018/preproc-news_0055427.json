(NASDAQ: EXEL) today announced the appointment of Andrew R. Peters as Vice President, Strategy. In this newly created role, Mr. Peters will work with the Exelixis leadership team to further refine the company’s mid- and long-term strategy focused on advancing the next generation of Exelixis medicines.\nMr. Peters has thirteen years of experience in the biotechnology industry, including twelve as an equity research analyst covering small-, mid- and large-cap biotechnology companies. He joins Exelixis from Deutsche Bank Securities where he served as a director and senior analyst from May 2016 to May 2018.\n“It’s a pivotal time for Exelixis as we seek to expand the company’s pipeline beyond CABOMETYX, our lead marketed product, through targeted business development and a return to internal drug discovery,” said Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelixis. “Andrew’s extensive experience as a biotechnology industry analyst makes him a valuable addition to the Exelixis team as we work to identify potential future growth opportunities for the company. His familiarity with Exelixis and the biotech landscape should make for a seamless transition into his new role.”\nPrior to joining Deutsche Bank Securities, from 2006 to 2016 Mr. Peters served in equity research analyst roles at UBS Securities, Susquehanna International Group, and Morgan Joseph & Co., Inc. He began his career in the biotechnology industry in the business development group at Amylin Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Peters holds a Master of BioScience degree from the Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences and obtained his Bachelor of Arts in Science and Management (with a Biotechnology Sequence) from Claremont McKenna College.\nAbout Exelixis\nFounded in 1994, Exelixis, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXEL) is a commercially successful, oncology-focused biotechnology company that strives to accelerate the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines for difficult-to-treat cancers. Following early work in model genetic systems, we established a broad drug discovery and development platform that has served as the foundation for our continued efforts to bring new cancer therapies to patients in need. We discovered our lead compounds, cabozantinib and cobimetinib, and advanced them into clinical development before entering into partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies in our efforts to bring these medicines to patients globally. We are steadfast in our commitment to prudently reinvest in our business to maximize the potential of our pipeline. We intend to supplement our existing therapeutic assets with targeted business development activities and internal drug discovery – all to deliver the next generation of Exelixis medicines and help patients recover stronger and live longer. Exelixis recently earned a spot on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500 list, a yearly award program honoring the 500 fastest-growing companies over the past four years.
