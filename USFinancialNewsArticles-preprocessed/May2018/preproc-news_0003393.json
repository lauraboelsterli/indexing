FILE PHOTO - Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, gestures at a regular news conference in Beijing, China, January 6, 2016. REUTERS/Jason Lee\nSpeaking at a daily news briefing, ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had noted reports about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiling what he called evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme as well as the reaction sparked by the disclosure.\nThe IAEA is the only international body with the right to supervise the agreement and make judgements about it, and China has noted that the agency has said several times Iran is in compliance, Hua said.

REUTERS/ Amir Cohen\nAll sides need to continue upholding the pact, she added.\nIsrael said on Tuesday it does not seek war with Iran and suggested U.S. President Donald Trump backed Israel’s latest attempt to kill the 2015 Iran nuclear deal by disclosing the purported evidence of past Iranian nuclear arms work.\nChina, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, was one of the architects of the agreement, and has said many times it should continue to be upheld by all the signatories.
