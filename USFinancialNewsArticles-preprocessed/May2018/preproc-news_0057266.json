    "text": "May 28, 2018 / 6:18 PM / Updated an hour ago German soccer fans investigated for wearing Ku Klux Klan-style hoods Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Police are investigating a group of soccer fans in eastern Germany who celebrated their club’s victory by marching through town in Ku Klux Klan-style hoods.\nAfter FC Energie Cottbus won promotion to the third-tier of the German league on Sunday, a group of fans, their faces covered with hoods resembling those worn by the U.S. white supremacist group, marched holding a red banner with “The rise of the evil ones”, written in gothic script.\nThe soccer club called the fans’ behavior “inhumane, repugnant and in no way tolerable,” and said they faced a life-long ban from its games if identified.\n“We are deeply saddened by the fact that a few people, through their actions, spoiled the joy of victory and damaged the image of tens of thousands of Energie fans and the club,” it said in a statement.\nThe use of extreme-right symbols has particular sensitivity in the city of 100,000 near the Polish border where tensions between far-right supporters and refugees escalated earlier this year after Syrian teenagers were detained over two knife attacks.
