Sage offers a suite of services that supports an entire cybersecurity lifecycle, including program development, education and training, threat detection, technology testing, advisory services, and digital forensics.\n“The acquisition of Sage enables Tyler to be as proactive as possible in offering data security expertise and services, as risks to data are becoming more prevalent across all industries, including the public sector,” said Lynn Moore, president of Tyler. “With the addition of Sage and its core product for managed threat detection, nDiscovery, Tyler clients will have the opportunity to add an additional layer of security in a cost-effective way. We look forward to bringing even more security to our clients through this complementary offering.”\nSage currently delivers three primary offerings to approximately 240 clients in the healthcare, financial, retail, education, and government sectors.\nSage’s main security offerings include:\nAdvisory services, which include developing risk assurance policies and consulting to clients when their data may have been compromised.

Threat detection, which is the software used in conjunction with experts who review daily logs for new threats in the network environment.\nThe acquisition of Sage will allow Tyler to provide clients with unique cybersecurity services that further protect their investments in Tyler solutions.
