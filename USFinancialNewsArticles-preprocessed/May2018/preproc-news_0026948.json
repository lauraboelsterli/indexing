REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\nThe U.S. shale oil producer said last week it would expand the board size to seven from five, to allow investors to pick two nominees from Icahn’s five-person slate.\nIcahn, who holds a 13.51 percent stake in SandRidge, got the company to back out of its planned buyout of rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc ( BCEI.N ) and forced the removal of the company’s chief executive and chief finance officer.\nThe billionaire investor on Friday nominated Jonathan Christodoro, a former managing director of Icahn Capital LP, and Nancy Dunlap, the private counsel and head of the private family office of former U.S. Senator Jon Corzine.
