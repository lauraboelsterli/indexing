(Nasdaq: GILD) announced today its results of operations for the first 2018.

A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in the tables on pages 7 and 8.\nProduct Sales\nTotal product sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.0 billion compared to $6.4 billion for the same period in 2017. Product sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $3.5 billion in the United States, $1.0 billion in Europe and $469 million in other locations. Product sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $4.5 billion in the United States, $1.3 billion in Europe and $661 million in other locations.\nAntiviral Product Sales\nAntiviral product sales, which include sales of HIV, chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C (HCV) products, were $4.4 billion for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $5.8 billion for the same period in 2017.\nHIV and HBV product sales were $3,329 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3,265 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based products, which include Genvoya ® (elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg), Descovy ® (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg) and Odefsey ® (emtricitabine 200 mg/rilpivirine 25 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg). HCV product sales, which consist of Epclusa ® (sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg), Harvoni ® (ledipasvir 90 mg/sofosbuvir 400 mg), Vosevi ® (sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) and Sovaldi ® (sofosbuvir 400 mg), were $1,046 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2,576 million for the same period in 2017. The decline was primarily due to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets and lower sales of Epclusa in the United States as a result of increased competition.\nOther Product Sales\nOther product sales, which include Letairis ® (ambrisentan), Ranexa ® (ranolazine), AmBisome ® (amphotericin B liposome for injection) and Yescarta ® (axicabtagene ciloleucel), were $626 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $536 million for the same period in 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nThree Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 Research and development expenses (R&D) $ 937 $ 931 Non-GAAP R&D expenses * $ 814 $ 889 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 997 $ 850 Non-GAAP SG&A expenses * $ 884 $ 807 * Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude acquisition-related, stock-based compensation and other expenses. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in the tables on pages 7 and 8.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017:\nR&D expenses increased primarily due to stock-based compensation expenses associated with Gilead’s acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite). The increase was partially offset by lower expenses resulting from Gilead’s purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP R&D expenses * decreased primarily due to the 2017 impact of Gilead’s purchase of an FDA priority review voucher. SG&A expenses increased primarily due to stock-based compensation expenses associated with Gilead’s acquisition of Kite, higher costs to support Gilead’s product launches including Biktarvy ® (bictegravir 50 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg) and Yescarta, geographic expansion and increased expenses to support the growth of Gilead’s business following the acquisition of Kite. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses * increased primarily due to higher costs to support Gilead’s product launches including Biktarvy and Yescarta, geographic expansion and increased expenses to support the growth of Gilead’s business following the acquisition of Kite.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAs of March 31, 2018, Gilead had $32.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to $36.7 billion as of December 31, 2017.

Gilead cautions readers that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include: Gilead’s ability to achieve its anticipated full year 2018 financial results; Gilead’s ability to sustain growth in revenues for its antiviral and other programs; the risk that private and public payers may be reluctant to provide, or continue to provide, coverage or reimbursement for new products, including Vosevi, Yescarta, Epclusa, Harvoni, Genvoya, Odefsey, Descovy, Biktarvy and Vemlidy ® ; austerity measures in European countries that may increase the amount of discount required on Gilead’s products; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments and geographic regions and decreases in treatment duration; availability of funding for state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs); continued fluctuations in ADAP purchases driven by federal and state grant cycles which may not mirror patient demand and may cause fluctuations in Gilead’s earnings; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of Viread and Truvada, an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; and potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices or reducing the number of insured patients; the possibility of unfavorable results from clinical trials involving investigational compounds; Gilead’s ability to initiate clinical trials in its currently anticipated timeframes; the levels of inventory held by wholesalers and retailers which may cause fluctuations in Gilead’s earnings; Kite’s ability to develop and commercialize cell therapies utilizing the zinc finger nuclease technology platform and realize the benefits of the Sangamo partnership; Gilead’s ability to submit new drug applications for new product candidates in the timelines currently anticipated; Gilead’s ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all, for new and current products, including Biktarvy; Gilead’s ability to successfully commercialize its products, including Biktarvy; the risk that physicians and patients may not see advantages of these products over other therapies and may therefore be reluctant to prescribe the products; Gilead’s ability to successfully develop its hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory programs; safety and efficacy data from clinical studies may not warrant further development of Gilead’s product candidates, including GS-9620 and Yescarta in combination with Pfizer’s utomilumab; Gilead’s ability to pay dividends or complete its share repurchase program due to changes in its stock price, corporate or other market conditions; fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the U.S. dollar that may cause an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact on Gilead’s future revenues and pre-tax earnings; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).
