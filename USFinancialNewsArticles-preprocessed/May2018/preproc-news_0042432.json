A soldier of the Hawaii National Guard stands over a crack in a road in Leilani Estates during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, U.S., May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Terray Sylvester\nAs Kilauea oozed lava from 22 fissures on its eastern flank, residents of Pahoa on the Big Island, some wearing ash masks, hunkered down in shelters and waited for an expected resumption of major eruptions.\nThe first evacuations came before dawn on May 3, when the volcano began its current cycle of eruptions and earthquakes.\n“We’re all trying to establish or find some normalcy in our lives knowing that we’re on an active volcano that’s very active right now,” said Cindy Hartman, a dietician at Hilo Medical Center.\nShe packed up and left her home in the Kalapana-Seaview neighborhood on Sunday, after a fissure opened just two miles from the last road out.\nHartman has been staying with a friend but is looking for temporary housing, faced with the possibility that lava could flow for months. Old-timers have reminded her that a similar event in 1955 lasted for 88 days.\nFour people were rescued by helicopter after a fast moving lava flow crossed Pohoiki Road, one of the main arteries in and out of the area, isolating about 40 homes.

REUTERS/Terray Sylvester\n“People still in that area are asked to stay in a safe place and wait for further instructions,” the county said in an alert.\nKilauea spewed ash nearly six miles into the sky on Thursday in what scientists warned could be the first in a string of even more violent explosive eruptions.\nResidents were warned to take shelter from the ash as toxic gas levels spiked in a small southeast area where lava has burst from the ground during the two-week eruption.\n“I’m in quite a bit of shock to be honest,” said Glenn Canon, 61, who evacuated on the first day of the eruption, as he picked up a UPS package in a church parking lot. “I’m just kind of running around in circles.”\nThe mouth of the summit crater vent has nearly tripled in size during the past couple of days from about 12 acres in area to 34 acres, according to USGS geophysicist Mike Poland. Slideshow (4 Images)\nWhile this widening coincided with back-to-back explosive, steam-driven eruptions from the crater this week, Poland said, the enlargement was caused primarily by the interior walls of the crater vent collapsing, as the magma continues to drop through the throat of the volcano.\nGeologists say it remains unlikely Kilauea will have a massive eruption like that of 1790, which killed dozens of people in the deadliest such event to occur in what is now the United States.\nKilauea’s falling lava lake has likely descended to a level at or below the water table, allowing water to run on to the top of its lava column and create steam-driven blasts, they said.\nA spike in toxic sulfur dioxide gas levels has closed schools around the town of Pahoa, 25 miles east of the volcano, where lava from giant cracks has destroyed 40 homes and other structures, and forced about 2,000 residents to flee.\nA change in wind direction caused volcanic gas to drift northwest towards Pahoa, prompting National Guard troops to don gas masks at a nearby road intersection.\nThe Pahoa fire station recorded a “red level” of sulfur dioxide, meaning the gas could cause choking and an inability to breathe, Fenix Grange of the Hawaii Department of Health told a news conference in Hilo.\nThere have been no deaths or serious injuries reported during the current eruption.\nAn aviation red alert was in effect due to risks ash could be carried into aircraft routes and damage jet engines.
