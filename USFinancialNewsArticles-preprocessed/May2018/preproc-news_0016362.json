    "text": "HIGHLAND HEIGHTS, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- General Cable Corporation (NYSE: BGC) reported today results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2018. For the quarter, reported loss per share was $0.08 and reported operating income was $34 million. Adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income were $0.20 and $38 million, respectively, for the quarter. See page two of this press release for the reconciliation of reported to adjusted results and related disclosures.\nMichael T. McDonnell, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our first quarter reflects continued performance improvement in Latin America, stronger subsea and land turnkey project activity in Europe, and demand stability in our North America businesses, particularly electric utility, construction and automotive. Although commodity pricing and business dynamics related to our review of strategic alternatives and pending transaction with Prysmian S.p.A. affected results, our 2018 outlook is positive, as seasonal demand trends, turnkey project activity and restructuring savings are expected to drive sequential and year over year improvement in the second quarter.” McDonnell continued, “Regarding the pending merger with Prysmian, we are also pleased that the regulatory approval process is advancing, and we continue to expect the merger to be completed by the third quarter of 2018, subject to receiving the remaining regulatory approvals and satisfying other customary conditions.”\nSummary\nReported operating income of $34 million was up $10 million year over year primarily due the wind down of restructuring costs coupled with stronger subsea and land turnkey project activity in 2018 Adjusted operating income of $38 million decreased $7 million year over year as continued performance improvement in Latin America and stronger subsea and land turnkey project activity in Europe were more than offset by subsiding metal benefits and unfavorable product mix in North America Impact of rising metal prices was a benefit of $2 million and $7 million for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively Operating cash flow was a use of $86 million for the first quarter of 2018 driven by investments in working capital and rising metal prices Maintained significant liquidity with $255 million of availability on the Company’s $700 million asset-based revolving credit facility and $54 million of cash and cash equivalents\nFirst Quarter Segment Demand\nNorth America – Unit volume as measured in metal pounds sold was up 4% versus prior year driven by stronger demand for construction, automotive and aluminum rod products.\nEurope – Unit volume as measured in metal pounds sold was up 7% versus prior year driven by stronger demand for electric utility products including subsea and land turnkey project activity.\nLatin America – Unit volume as measured in metal pounds sold was down 10% versus prior year driven by uneven spending on electric infrastructure and construction projects throughout the region as well as the impact of the Company’s go-to-market initiatives focused on margin improvement. Aerial transmission cables in Brazil as measured in metal pounds sold was down 8% year over year.\nNet Debt\nAt the end of the first quarter 2018 and the end of the fourth quarter 2017, total debt was $1,169 million and $1,086 million, respectively, and cash and cash equivalents were $54 million and $85 million, respectively. The increase in net debt was driven by seasonal investments in working capital and rising metal prices.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted operating income (defined as operating income before extraordinary, nonrecurring or unusual charges and other certain items), adjusted earnings per share (defined as diluted earnings per share before extraordinary, nonrecurring or unusual charges and other certain items) and net debt (defined as long-term debt plus current portion of long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents) are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Metal-adjusted revenues and return on metal-adjusted sales on a segment basis, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, are also provided herein. See “Segment Information.”\nThese Company-defined non-GAAP financial measures exclude from reported results those items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance and are being provided herein because management believes they are useful in analyzing the operating performance of the business and are consistent with how management reviews our operating results and the underlying business trends. Use of these non-GAAP measures may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies and should only be used in conjunction with the Company’s results reported according to GAAP. Historical segment adjusted operating results are disclosed in the First Quarter 2018 Investor Presentation available on the Company’s website.\nA reconciliation of GAAP operating income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share to adjusted operating income and earnings per share follows:\nFirst Quarter of 2018 versus First Quarter of 2017 First Quarter 2018 2017 Operating Operating In millions, except per share amounts Income EPS Income* EPS Reported $ 34.3 $ (0.08 ) $ 24.2 $ 0.24 Adjustments to reconcile operating Income/EPS Non-cash convertible debt interest expense (1) - 0.01 - 0.01 Mark to market (gain) loss on derivative instruments (2) - 0.24 - (0.10 ) Restructuring and divestiture costs (3) 2.8 0.03 14.1 0.09 Legal and investigative costs (4) 0.5 0.01 0.3 - (Gain) loss on sale of assets (5) - - 3.5 0.02 Asia Pacific and Africa (income)/loss (6) 0.6 (0.01 ) 2.8 0.01 Total adjustments 3.9 0.28 20.7 0.03 Adjusted $ 38.2 $ 0.20 $ 44.9 $ 0.27 NOTE: The tables above reflect EPS adjustments based on the Company's full year effective tax rate for 2018 and 2017 of 40% * Historical results have been recast to reflect the Company’s adoption of ASU 2017-07, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)” (1) The Company's adjustment for the non-cash convertible debt interest expense reflects the accretion of the equity component of the 2029 convertible notes, which is reflected in the income statement as interest expense. (2) Mark to market (gains) and losses on derivative instruments represents the current period changes in the fair value of commodity instruments designated as economic hedges. The Company adjusts for the changes in fair values of these commodity instruments as the earnings associated with the underlying contracts have not been recorded in the same period. (3) Restructuring and divestiture costs represent costs associated with the Company's announced restructuring and divestiture programs as well as costs associated with the review of strategic alternatives that resulted in the previously announced definitive merger agreement with Prysmian. Examples consist of, but are not limited to, employee separation costs, asset write-downs, accelerated depreciation, working capital write-downs, equipment relocation, contract terminations, consulting fees and legal costs. The Company adjusts for these charges as management believes these costs will not continue at the conclusion of both the restructuring and divestiture programs and closing of the merger. (4) Legal and investigative costs represent costs incurred for external legal counsel and forensic accounting firms in connection with the restatement of our financial statements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation. The Company adjusts for these charges as management believes these costs will not continue at the conclusion of these investigations which are considered to be outside the normal course of business. (5) Gains and losses on the sale of assets are the result of divesting certain General Cable businesses. The Company adjusts for these gains and losses as management believes the gains and losses are one-time in nature and will not occur as part of the ongoing operations. (6) The adjustment excludes the impact of operations in the Africa and Asia Pacific segment which are not considered \"core operations\" under the Company's strategic roadmap. The Company has divested or closed these operations which are not expected to continue as part of the ongoing business. For accounting purposes, the continuing operations in Africa and Asia Pacific do not meet the requirement to be presented as discontinued operations.
