    "text": "Pyxl Announces Headquarters Move to Nashville Simultaneously\nNASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Local digital marketing agency, Pyxl , announced today that Daniel Houghton, former CEO of Lonely Planet and 2017 Forbes 30 under 30 honoree, will join the company as CEO. Houghton spent the last five years transforming the iconic, travel brand from traditional publisher to a well-balanced media company that saw sales of their traditional print guides grow while launching a digital media platform that engaged millions globally. Houghton has a strong passion for helping businesses transform and be successful in the ever-evolving digital landscape, taking a proactive approach rather than reactive to challenges in the market.\n“I was so fortunate to have a front-row seat in defining a digital strategy that helped transform a 40-year-old brand that needed new digital products and direction when I arrived,” said Daniel Houghton, CEO of Pyxl. “My passion for partnering with companies globally to transform those that have lagged behind and those that need an innovative new digital strategy is what fueled my move to lead Pyxl.”\nDuring Houghton’s time at Lonely Planet, he discovered that many companies fall behind in their digital strategy because they stick with what they know – traditional – and end up stalling because their competitors are evolving with market innovations. Under his leadership, Lonely Planet became the global leader for travel guidebooks by adopting new technologies and a new mindset, realizing it’s never too late, and transformative digital strategies are available to anyone. This is one of the many offerings he’s excited to provide to clients at Pyxl.\nPyxl was founded by high-tech and digital marketing entrepreneur, Brian Winter, in April 2008 when he purchased a small, marketing firm in Knoxville, Tennessee. Since then, the three-time Inc. 5000 company has experienced significant growth while expanding to Nashville and Scottsdale, Arizona, delivering digital marketing services to an impressive list of clients in high-tech, healthcare, education and retail.\n“After 10 years of significant growth, it was time to expand our executive team and recruit a leader that will forge new partnerships, adapt new technologies and extend our digital capabilities for the continued growth of the company and the benefit of our clients,” said Brian Winter, founder and Chairman of the Board of Pyxl. “The opportunity to have Daniel lead our company is one of those serendipitous moments where you realize you’ve found the right person for your employees, and your clients, and you can’t wait to see what unfolds over the next 10 years.”\nAs part of Houghton’s hiring, Pyxl announced that Nashville will be the company’s headquarters. The combination of Nashville’s incredible growth over the past five years, an expanded talent pool and ease of travel to every major city in the United States, drove the decision to move. According to Winter, Pyxl is constantly looking to expand the depth and breadth of their talent with deep interest in employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences to ensure they're developing and executing on the most impactful digital strategies for clients. The CEO will be based in Nashville along with critical operations functions including HR, finance and marketing.\n“There are big things happening in Nashville right now that position us for strategic growth opportunities,” Houghton said. “It’s an exciting time to be here and have a tangible impact on the digital success of various companies we partner with. My vision is to create digital transformations for our clients that align with and exceed their business goals. Our success is measured by the results we get for our clients.”\nAdditionally, Pyxl intends to continue to invest in Knoxville and Scottsdale as critical hubs for design, development and communications talent. Pyxl’s robust offering of integrated digital services includes strategy, brand and identity creation, design, media planning and management, and website and application development.\nTo learn more about Pyxl and Daniel Houghton, please visit https://pyxl.com/ .\nAbout Pyxl\nFounded in 2008, Pyxl designs and develops custom websites, web applications and mobile apps that balance technology and design with an effective user experience.
