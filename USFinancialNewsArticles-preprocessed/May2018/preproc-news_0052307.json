    "text": "(Reuters) - United States first daughter Ivanka Trump waded into the debate over Serena Williams’s lack of a seeding at the French Open, tweeting that the women’s tour needed to change its rules for players that take maternity leave.\nFILE PHOTO: White House Senior Advisor Ivanka Trump arrives for the launch of U.S. first lady Melania Trump's \"Be Best\" initiative in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 7, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Williams was world number one before leaving the tour last year to have a baby but the 23-times grand slam champion enters Roland Garros ranked 453rd.\nThe three-times French Open champion was not granted a seed by tournament organizers, triggering criticism from women’s groups and tennis pundits.\n“This is ridiculous. @SerenaWilliams is a formidable athlete (best ever!) and loving new mother,” Trump, daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump, wrote on Twitter.\n“No person should ever be penalized professionally for having a child! The #WTA should change this rule immediately. #FrenchOpen.”\nWilliams returned to the professional Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) tour in March at Indian Wells in Southern California.\nShe won her first two matches before losing to sister Venus Williams. Two weeks later, she fell to Japan’s Naomi Osaka in the opening round of the Miami Open.\nReporting by Steve Keating in Indianapolis. Editing by Ian Ransom\n ",
