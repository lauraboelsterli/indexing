    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Item 9 Labs Corp. (OTC:INLB) (“Item 9 Labs” or the “Company”), a leading provider of high-quality medical marijuana and developer of innovative medical cannabis treatments, today announced that it has executed an intellectual property sales agreement with Health Defense, LLC. (“Health Defense”), a Washington-state based company focused on developing wellness-oriented products, for a total purchase price of $1.3 million in cash.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Item 9 will maintain a 10% ownership interest in a newly formed AirWare IP company, Health Defense, LLC. In addition to the purchase price, as a stakeholder in Health Defense LLC, Item 9 will continue to receive trailing revenue from the worldwide sales of all current products and new versions that are in development. The sales and distribution entity, Protego LLC, provides 2 cents per unit sold plus 10% of annual net profits from sales to Health Defense, LLC. As part of the agreement, Item 9 will establish a new exclusive licensing agreement with Health Defense for the AirWare Labs Nasal Filtration Dilator Inserts to be infused with CBD/THC for the Medical Cannabis Sector. Item 9 intends to use the transaction proceeds for product development and general corporate purposes as the Company continues to penetrate the Medical Cannabis industry.\nBryce Skalla, Co-Founder & CEO of Item 9 Labs, commented, “The unique technology behind the AirWare intra-nasal filtration system is quickly positioning Item 9 as a leading player within the Medical Cannabis sector. We believe that this proprietary system will continue to open new doors in other industries looking for the most advanced breathing devices and delivery systems and are confident that Health Defense will succeed in bringing this IP to the forefront of these markets. We are extremely fortunate to have found a strong partner that can market and distribute this technology on a global scale, while we utilize the transaction proceeds for the continued development of our enhanced cannabinoid dosing and delivery.”\nDan Voetmann, Co-Founder of Protego LLC and Health Defense LLC, stated, “According to a recent May 1, 2018 CNN article that referenced a study from the World Health Organization, nine out of every 10 people on the planet breathe air that contains high levels of pollutants and kills 7 million people each year. The amazing intra-nasal filters developed and patented by AirWare are comfortable, discreet, affordable, and an effective solution to pollution, allergens, germs and viruses. Securing this IP ensures continued product development along with the rapidly expanding sales from our worldwide distribution partners. We are excited to be part of this effort which can help to improve the health and longevity of people worldwide.”\nAbout Item 9 Labs Corp.:\nItem 9 Labs Corp.
