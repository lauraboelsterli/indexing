    "text": "66 COMMENTS A new study estimates that the death toll in Puerto Rico from last year’s Hurricane Maria could exceed 4,600, the latest analysis to suggest the official figure of 64 is a severe undercount.\nResearchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and other institutions conducted surveys of nearly 3,300 randomly chosen households across the island and asked about fatalities. They used the findings to calculate how much the mortality rate between Sept. 20, 2017—when the hurricane hit—and Dec. 31, 2017, exceeded the same period in 2016.\nBased on that analysis, researchers found there were 4,645 excess deaths during those months, a 62% increase in the mortality rate. Researchers said the figure could be as high as 5,740 excess deaths, when adjusted for certain bias and methodological issues.\nAmong the main reasons for the deaths cited by respondents were delayed or prevented access to medical care .\nThe study, published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, is the latest to challenge the longstanding official death count of 64. Since last year, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has faced persistent criticism that his administration significantly undercounted fatalities stemming from the storm.\n“The government of Puerto Rico welcomes the newly released Harvard University survey and we look forward to analyzing it,” said Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration. “We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported.”\nIn December, Mr. Rosselló responded to concerns about an undercount by ordering the Puerto Rico Demographic Registry and the Department of Public Safety to examine all deaths that occurred after Maria to derive a more accurate tally. That work is still under way.\nSeveral studies last year by researchers and news organizations concluded that the official death count could approach or exceed 1,000. One of the analyses, by the Puerto Rico Center for Investigative Journalism, found there were at least 985 more deaths in the 40 days after Maria struck the island than during the same period in 2016.\nMaria—the worst storm to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century—knocked out power for the entire island and severely damaged roads and other infrastructure. As a result, hospitals had to rely on generator power, residents lacked refrigeration for vital medicines and many people couldn’t travel to receive medical attention.\nWrite to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com",
