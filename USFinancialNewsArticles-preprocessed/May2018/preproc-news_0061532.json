    "text": "MUMBAI, May 30 (Reuters) - An Indian appeals tribunal on Wednesday put on hold insolvency proceedings against Reliance Communications (RCom), after the debt-laden Indian telecom carrier reached a settlement with Swedish telecom gearmaker Ericsson.\nThe National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in New Delhi has asked RCom to pay Ericsson 5.5 billion rupees ($81.52 million) by end-September as part of the settlement.\nThe settlement potentially paves the way for the Anil Ambani-controlled telecom operator to sell its wireless assets including mobile masts and airwaves to Reliance Jio Infocomm in a deal sources have said is worth $3.8 billion.\nRCom had filed and appeal with the NCLAT, after the National Company Law Tribunal, earlier this month, admitted an insolvency plea against the company that was filed by Ericsson.\nEricsson, which signed a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage RCom’s nationwide telecom network, was seeking 11.55 billion rupees ($171.16 million) from the company and two of its subsidiaries.\n$1 = 67.4650 Indian rupees Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal Editing by Euan Rocha\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
