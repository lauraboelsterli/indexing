    "text": "(Reuters) - ICICI Bank Ltd ( ICBK.NS ) said on Wednesday it will institute an inquiry into the allegations raised by an anonymous whistleblower against Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar.\nFILE PHOTO: A security guard sits outside an ICICI bank branch in Mumbai, India, April 4, 2018. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas ICICI, India’s third-biggest lender by assets, said the probe, headed by an independent person, would examine allegations that the chief executive did not adhere to provisions relating to the bank’s code of conduct and whether her actions involved “conflict of interest”.\nThe bank is battling allegations that Kochhar allegedly favored Videocon Group in its lending practices. Videocon’s founders had an investment in a renewable energy company founded by Kochhar’s husband.\nThe bank has backed Kochhar, calling the rumors “malicious and unfounded”.\nReporting by Aby Jose Koilparambil in Bengaluru; Editing by Vyas Mohan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
