    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s housing ministry said that it would step up checks on local governments’ efforts to rein in property prices, and will hold those who fail to do so accountable.\nA residential area is pictured in Beijing August 29, 2013. REUTERS/Jason Lee The undated statement on the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development’s website warned against property market speculation.\nIt is the second time this month that the ministry has voiced concern about property prices. In early May, it told governments in 12 cities to rein in their fast-rising property prices and step up regulations.\nHome prices in China’s 70 major cities rose 0.5 percent in April from the month before, up from a 0.4 percent rise in March, Reuters calculated using National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data published earlier this month.\nReporting By Alexandra Harney and Yawen Chen; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ",
