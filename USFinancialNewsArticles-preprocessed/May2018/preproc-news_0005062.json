    "text": "TOKYO, May 1 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Nikkei eked out modest gains in holiday-thinned trade on Tuesday supported by buying in index-heavy stocks such as Fast Retailing and Fanuc, though Sony tumbled after the company issued a profit warning.\nThe Nikkei ended 0.2 percent higher at 22,508.03 after moving in and out of the black earlier. However, the broader Topix dropped 0.2 percent to 1,774.18.\nJapan has kicked off Golden Week holidays which tends to subdue trading activity. Markets were closed on Monday, and will be closed on Thursday and Friday for national holidays.\nFast Retailing and Fanuc Corp rose 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, contributing a combined 47 points to the Nikkei.\nSony Corp tumbled 6.1 percent after the company forecast operating profit of 670 billion yen ($6.13 billion) for the year through March.. The stock loss accounted for a sizable 12 points in the benchmark index.\nOn the other hand, Hitachi Ltd jumped 6.1 percent after the company forecast a record-high operating profit for this fiscal year, up 4.9 percent on the year to 750 billion yen.\nSeparately, the Nikkei reported over the weekend that Hitachi will ask the UK government to take a direct stake in the company that is set to build and operate a nuclear power plant in Wales. Currently, it is 100 percent owned by the Japanese industrial company.\nBanks underperformed, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group falling 3.0 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group shedding 1.4 percent.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
