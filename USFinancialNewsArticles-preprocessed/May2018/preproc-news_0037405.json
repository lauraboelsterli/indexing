    "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Online file sharing company Dropbox will pay $1.6 million in civil penalties and $450,000 in restitution as part of a settlement with prosecutors in California over its subscription renewal policies.\nDistrict attorneys in four counties sued, alleging the firm failed to properly notify customers using its paid Dropbox Pro service about its automatic renewal policy in violation of state law.\nDropbox agreed to the settlement without admitting liability. The settlement was announced Wednesday by officials in Alameda County, where the civil action was filed.\nIn addition, prosecutors alleged the company didn't sufficiently advise consumers that its Dropbox for Business service was intended only for organizations or businesses — not individual consumers using it for personal, family or household reasons.\nDropbox says it's pleased to have resolved the matter.",
