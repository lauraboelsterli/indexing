REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci “Taking into account the lack of legitimacy of the electoral process we do not recognize the results of (Sunday’s) election ... which excluded the participation of some political actors,” said Argentina’s Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie.\nChile is not part of the Group of 20, but was invited to participate in the meeting of foreign ministers by Argentina, which holds the G20 rotating presidency this year.\nReporting by Maximiliano Rizzi and Maximilian Heath; writing by Caroline Stauffer, editing by G Crosse\n ",
