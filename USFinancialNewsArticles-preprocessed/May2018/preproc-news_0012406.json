    "text": "DALLAS, May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Simmons Bank, as Trustee of the Sabine Royalty Trust (NYSE: SBR), today declared a cash distribution to the holders of its units of beneficial interest of $0.284380 per unit, payable on May 29, 2018, to unit holders of record on May 15, 2018. Sabine's cash distribution history, current and prior year financial reports and tax information booklets, a link to filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission and more can be found on its website at http://www.sbr-sabine.com/ .\nThis distribution reflects primarily the oil production for February 2018 and the gas production for January 2018. Preliminary production volumes are approximately 53,509 barrels of oil and 559,942 Mcf of gas. Preliminary prices are approximately $58.11 per barrel of oil and $2.85 per Mcf of gas.\nThe table below compares this month's production and prices to the previous month's:\nNet to Trust Sales\nVolumes\nAverage Price\nOil\n(bbls)\nGas\n(Mcf)\nOil\n(per bbl)\nGas\n(per Mcf)\nCurrent Month\n53,509\n559,942\n$58.11\n$2.85\nPrior Month\n51,521\n614,123\n$59.51\n$2.85\nRevenues are only posted and distributed when they are received. Most energy companies normally issue payment of royalties on or about the 25 th of every month, and depending on mail delivery, a varying amount of royalties are not received until after the revenue posting on the last business day of the month. The revenues received after that date will be posted within 30 days of receipt.\nDue to the timing of the end of the month of April, approximately $1,875,000 of revenue received will be posted in the following month of May in addition to normal receipts during May. Since the close of business in April and prior to this press release, approximately $559,000 in revenue has been received.\nSabine Royalty Trust, as it does after the end of each year, had a year-end Reserve Report prepared in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's requirements. This report provides an evaluation of the estimated asset value as of December 31 of each year, which can be used to estimate the remaining life of the Trust.\nThe estimated net proved reserves, as of January 1, 2018, attributable to the Trust from the properties appraised are approximately 6.7 million barrels of oil and 34.250 billion cubic feet of gas with a future net value of approximately $319,703,000 with a discounted value at 10% of $156,300,000. With these estimated quantities of this year's reserve estimate of 6.7 million barrels of oil and 34.250 billion cubic feet of gas remaining, it could be estimated that the Trust still has a life span of 9 to 12 years. The report is an exhibit to the Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed on March 8, 2018 and is available to all unitholders at this time on the SEC website and Sabine's website.\nThe January 1, 2018 Reserve Summary is available on the Sabine website at http://www.sbr-sabine.com/ .\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sabine-royalty-trust-announces-monthly-cash-distribution-for-may-2018-300642685.html\nSOURCE Sabine Royalty Trust",
