    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rennova Health, Inc. (OTCQB:RNVA), (OTCQB:RNVAW) (“Rennova” or the “Company”), a vertically integrated provider of industry-leading diagnostics and supportive software solutions to healthcare providers that recently announced the acquisition of its second Rural Hospital, announces follow up interview of CEO Seamus Lagan, on Uptick Newswire’s “Stock Day” podcast with Everett Jolly to discuss the progress of taking ownership of the Company’s second rural hospital and what it hopes to achieve this year.\n“You and your management team have been working diligently on taking ownership of your second hospital which is in Jamestown, Tennessee,” commented Jolly. “Where are you at in that process?”\n“Our target was May 1 st but we have pushed that back one month and will take ownership on June 1st,” said Lagan. “The transition of ownership is going exceptionally well but the transition of the many employees in Jamestown onto new benefit scheme etc took a little longer than expected. Our employees are key to the success of the hospital going forward and the extra month creates the opportunity to ensure employees have an enjoyable experience as they join the Rennova team. June 1 st is now a fixed date and we are well on schedule to achieve that date.”\n“I know management believes in building a company with a strong foundation,” continued Jolly. “What would be the right alignment of the stars to be confident you are on the track the Company is perusing?”\n“Completing this acquisition which includes ownership of a nearby physicians practice and properly integrating and managing them to being cash flow positive and profitable is a key first step,” said Lagan. “If we can do that in the next three to six months and get to where we don’t need additional capital to cover overheads we can possibly exit 2018 looking for our next acquisition.”\nTo listen to the full interview please click here to the following link:\nAbout Rennova Health, Inc.\nRennova provides industry-leading diagnostics and supportive software solutions to healthcare providers, delivering an efficient, effective patient experience and superior clinical outcomes.
