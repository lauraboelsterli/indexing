    "text": "When it comes to protecting your Social Security number, there is a crucial step you should take: Sign up for an online account with the Social Security Administration.\nThe agency no longer mails statements to individuals who are under 60 that include information such as your earnings and estimated benefits. Instead, you are now encouraged to create an online My Social Security account .\nBut many individuals have yet to sign up. According to a March survey by MassMutual, 86 percent of individuals ages 50 to 59 have not created an account, despite the fact that they will no longer receive statements in the mail.\nLeaving that undone can create an opportunity for identity thieves to set up an account in your name. And they may even try to claim benefits under your record.\nMore from Fixed Income Strategies:",
