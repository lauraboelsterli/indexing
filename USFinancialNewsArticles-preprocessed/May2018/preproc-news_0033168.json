    "text": "Year over year first quarter revenues increased 49% and SaaS revenues increased 120%\nMELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intellicheck, Inc. (NYSE American: IDN), an industry leader in identification authentication solutions, today announced its financial results for the first quarter\nRevenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 grew 49% to $1,062,062 versus $712,660 in the prior year comparable period. SaaS revenue in the first quarter grew 120% and totaled $595,000 versus $270,000 in the quarter ending March 31, 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues improved to 90.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 versus 84.6% in the prior year comparable period.\nIntellicheck CEO Bryan Lewis said, “While I am encouraged by our progress, I am committed to refocusing our efforts to realize greater revenue growth of our SaaS based products in our key markets. To that end, I have initiated a complete reorganization of the sales force, which includes bringing in new sales people to work within a revamped operational structure. These operational changes reflect my belief that significant adjustments needed to be made to support our sales goals and allow us to manage the business in real time on a daily basis.”\nLewis explained that the actions he has taken in the first ninety days of his tenure make his intentions clear. “I am going to continue taking what I believe are the necessary steps to build momentum, drive consistent growth and position the Company on a well-defined path for success,” he concluded.\nThe net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was ($1,067,957) or ($0.07) per diluted share versus ($936,757) or ($0.09) per diluted share in the comparable prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and certain non-recurring charges) was a loss of ($961,969) for the first quarter of 2018 versus a loss of ($738,636) in the prior year comparable period. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided elsewhere in this release.\nCash at March 31, 2018 totaled $7.8 million and stockholders’ equity totaled $15.7 million at the end of period.\nThe financial results reported today do not take into account any adjustments that may be required in connection with the completion of the Company’s review process and should be considered preliminary until Intellicheck files its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter\nConference Call Information:\nThe Company will hold an earnings conference call today, May 14, at 4:30 p.m. ET/1:30 p.m. PT to discuss operating results.
