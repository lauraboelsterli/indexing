(TSXV: RYU) (\" RYU \" or the \" Company \"), creator of urban athletic apparel, is pleased to report its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $907,915, 94% higher than revenue of $467,003 during the same period in 2017. RYU's financial results have been encouraging with continued sales growth in 2018 and a 46% gross profit for the quarter.\nIn Canadian dollars\nThree months ended\nMarch 31 ,\n(unaudited)\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$907,915\n$467,003\nGross profit\n$419,890\n$219,256\nGross profit %\n46%\n47%\n\"We started the year with exciting developments on all fronts of the business and we are pleased that first quarter results are consistent with our 2018 retail revenue target of 100% YoY growth,\" said Marcello Leone, CEO. \"This is our ninth consecutive quarter of growth and we are especially proud, given that the first quarter in our industry is the slowest. Our brand continues to resonate as RYU was recently a finalist in the World Retail Awards. Our team is working hard to execute our business plan with the recent influx of capital, which in part will be used to open our three new US retail locations, which are under construction, launch our new ryu.com website, and kick-off our global advertising campaign in the second half of the year.\"\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company achieved the following milestones:\nRYU's expansion plan is on target to have eight stores by the end of 2018 and to achieve +100% year over year growth in retail revenue. In the first quarter of 2018 the Company began construction planning at its retail store in Brooklyn, New York and secured the leases to its second and third US store locations in the state of California. This expansion gives RYU exposure in New York City and Los Angeles, the most important urban centers of both coasts of the United States. The three stores are under construction and have targeted openings in the third quarter of 2018.\nE-commerce revenue grew 50% against the same period in 2017 as traffic to ryu.com increased by 57% during the same comparative period.\nRYU secured new strategic wholesale accounts with Nordstrom, Equinox Canada and Rise by We that align with its brand value proposition.\nRYU was selected as a finalist for the World Retail Awards in two categories: Retail Start Up of the Year and Social Media Campaign of the Year (#RYUOneMoreRep). The Company was honoured that RYU was one of only two Canadian companies that qualified as finalists among many global retailers across all the World Retail Awards categories.\nRYU appointed THRSXTY/Exposure, as its new global Agency of Record for creative strategy and marketing services. THRSXTY/Exposure is a marketing services agency based in London, Tokyo, New York, and Paris, specializing in fashion, retail and lifestyle brands. A new global advertising and branding campaign will launch in conjunction with RYU's US retail store openings in the third quarter of 2018.\nThe Jeremy Bieber Group is acting in a Global Chief Influencer role for RYU.\nThe Company closed non-brokered private placements on January 19 th and February 19 th raising gross proceeds of $5,651,945 and $3,997,808 respectively.\nShareholders exercised 52,060,615 warrants for total proceeds of $10,089,488. The Company is pleased to report that 84% of the $0.20 warrants subject to the acceleration of their expiry dates, as announced on February 20, 2018, were exercised by March 29, 2018.\nReaders are encouraged to review the Company's condensed consolidated interim financial statements in their entirety, including the notes thereto, and corresponding MD&A on SEDAR.
