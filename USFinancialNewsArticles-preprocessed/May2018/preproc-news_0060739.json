    "text": "BEIJING, May 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Xinyuan Real Estate Co., Ltd. (\"Xinyuan\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: XIN), an NYSE-listed real estate developer and property manager primarily in China and also in other countries, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 201 8 Highlights\nUnder ASC 606, the Company expects to recognize revenue for all contracts executed starting from January 1, 2018, on an \"over time\" basis using costs incurred, an input measure. First quarter results reflect the adoption of ASC 606 and may not be directly comparable to prior periods. The adoption of ASC 606 reduced first quarter reported revenues and net income by US$341.4 million and US$32.8 million, respectively. Contract sales increased 24.7% to US$380.7 million from US$305.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 and decreased 53.8% from US$823.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Total revenue decreased 38.0% to US$174.1 million from US$280.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and decreased 76.0% from US$725.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross profit decreased 38.2% to US$38.7 million, or 22.2% of total revenue, from US$62.6 million, or 22.3% of total revenue, in the first quarter of 2017 and decreased 78.5% from US$180.3 million, or 24.8% of total revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Selling, General and Administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 22.9% from 12.6% in the first quarter of 2017 and increased from 10.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss was US$12.7 million compared to net income of US$7.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 and net income of US$35.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Diluted net loss per American Depositary Share (\"ADS\") attributable to shareholders were US$0.16 compared to diluted net earnings per American Depositary Share(\"ADS\") US$0.11 in the first quarter of 2017 and US$0.50 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nMr. Yong Zhang, Xinyuan's Chairman, stated: \"Despite the fact that the overall domestic real estate market is affected by the continuous government restrictions on purchases and prices, our contract sales in the first quarter of 2018 have increased 25% from the first quarter of last year.\n\"This quarter's financial report reflects the normal seasonal adjustment of the real estate industry and the impact of the new changes in accounting standards.\nIn early 2018, Xinyuan adopted a strategy to become an international technology-driven property ecosystem, under which Xinyuan will place emphasis not only on the development of its traditional real estate business, but also on its five sub-businesses: industrial real estate; commercial property management; traditional property management; property construction management, and real estate technology. This combination of Xinyuan's core real estate business with its five sub-businesses will form an ecosystem that functions as an integrated whole.\nWith the upgrade of our strategy, we expect the Group's sales and net profits will grow better than last year, and we maintain a stable dividend policy this quarter. The management is optimistic about the financial outlook for the entire year of 2018, and will further enhance operational efficiency, optimize the capital structure, and build a first-class global real estate development operations and asset management group.\"\nFirst Quarter 201 8 Financial Results\nContract Sales\nContract sales in China totaled US$375.5 million in the first quarter compared to US$240.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 and US$817.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Company's GFA sales in China were 149,800 square meters in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 140,300 square meters in the first quarter of 2017 and 443,600 square meters in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe average selling price (\"ASP\") per square meter sold in China was RMB15,932 (US$2,506) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to RMB11,820 (US$1,717) in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB12,118 (US$1,794) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nContract sales in the United States totaled US$5.2 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company commenced pre-sales of one new project in the first quarter of 2018, Tianjin Spring Royal Palace II, which contributed 1.8% and 1.5% of total GFA sales and total contract sales, respectively.\nBreakdown of GFA Sales and ASPs by Project in China\nProject\nQ1 2017\nQ4 2017\nQ1 2018\nGFA\nASP\nGFA\nASP\nGFA\nASP\n(m 2 '0 00s)\n(RMB)\n(m 2 ' 000s)\n(RMB)\n(m 2 ' 000s)\n(RMB)\nXingyang Splendid II\n8.6\n6,710\n1.6\n11,650\n-\n-\nKunshan Royal Palace\n2.3\n21,222\n1.3\n24,232\n-0.2\n22,314\nJinan Royal Palace\n22.4\n9,280\n35.5\n12,404\n22.4\n12,626\nXuzhou Colorful City\n1.7\n15,131\n31.4\n11,246\n3.6\n10,265\nChengdu Thriving Family\n4.7\n11,277\n15.8\n10,724\n4.5\n17,183\nChangsha Xinyuan Splendid\n9.7\n9,050\n4.2\n18,379\n2.6\n15,130\nSanya Yazhou Bay No.1\n26.3\n15,432\n2.7\n27,497\n30.9\n23,197\nXi'an Metropolitan\n3.1\n8,889\n21.2\n9,719\n1.5\n9,594\nZhengzhou Xindo Park\n13.2\n6,342\n11.3\n11,110\n0.1\n10,000\nJinan Xin Central\n6.8\n11,777\n16.9\n11,477\n12.2\n10,527\nHenan Xin Central I\n0.5\n11,568\n9.5\n12,890\n0.3\n18,486\nZhengzhou Fancy City I\n0.8\n21,739\n2.0\n14,004\n0.2\n19,949\nZhengzhou Fancy City II (South)\n10.1\n12,394\n4.4\n15,899\n1.2\n13,031\nTianjin Spring Royal Palace I\n(Tianjin Spring Royal Palace)\n-0.1\n6,844\n2.5\n12,590\n1.1\n14,631\nKunshan Xindo Park\n4.4\n18,244\n12.7\n22,311\n2.3\n23,009\nZhengzhou International New City I\n0.9\n10,834\n33.9\n4,401\n2.4\n13,322\nHenan Xin Central II\n15.0\n10,955\n10.4\n11,858\n7.7\n11,768\nXingyang Splendid III\n-\n-\n18.9\n7,237\n16.2\n7,381\nChangsha Mulian Royal Palace\n-\n-\n21.6\n12,899\n2.0\n16,177\nZhengzhou International New City\nII\n-\n-\n76.7\n13,711\n11.8\n13,739\nZhengzhou International New City III\n-\n-\n73.6\n14,058\n20.4\n13,802\nZhengzhou Fancy City II (North)\n-\n-\n31.2\n9,499\n2.3\n9,813\nTianjin Spring Royal Palace II\n(Tianjin Spring Royal Palace)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2.7\n13,412\nOthers\n9.9\n-\n4.3\n-\n1.6\n-\nTotal\n140.3\n11,820\n443.6\n12,118\n149.8\n15,932\nRevenue\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company's total revenue decreased 38.0% to US$174.1 million from US$280.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and decreased 76.0% from US$725.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The revenue decrease was mainly due to the adoption of ASC606.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was US$38.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, compared to a gross profit of US$62.6 million, or 22.3% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017 and a gross profit of US$180.3 million, or 24.8% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses were US$39.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to US$35.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 and US$78.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A expenses were 22.9% compared to 12.6% in the first quarter of 2017 and 10.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was due to costs associated with company expansion and the decrease of revenue.\nNet Income\nThe Company experienced a net loss due to the decrease of revenue, increase of SG&A expenses, and increase of interest expenses due to an increase in debt during the quarter. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was US$12.7 million compared to net income of US$7.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and net income of US$35.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net margin decreased from 2.6% in the first quarter of 2017 and 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to negative 7.3% for the first quarter of 2018.

The balance of the Company's real estate properties under development at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was US$3,457.1 million compared to US$1,996.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdoption of ASC606\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
