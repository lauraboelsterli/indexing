    "text": "NEW YORK, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- This is my third update regarding NTN Buzztime's (NYSE-Amex: NTN) upcoming 2018 shareholder meeting. Unfortunately, the Board continues to ignore its fiduciary duty to shareholders, even after 10 years of poor financial results, delayed product rollouts, and an 83% decline in its stock price. While I've extended numerous olive branches to help NTN over the years, the company's Board continues to protect the status quo and has ultimately chosen to waste NTN's resources on a proxy fight.\nReviewing last year's shareholder vote, it is clear the market is sending a strong message to the Board as existing members only received roughly 50% support, and that was when they went unchallenged:\nNTN - 2017 Results of shareholder votes for BOD members\nName\nVotes For\nVotes For (%)\nWitheld\nBroker Non-Votes\nWitheld/Non Vote\nJeff Berg\n1,013,109\n52%\n237,084\n703,777\n48%\nRam Krishnan\n1,033,578\n53%\n216,615\n703,777\n47%\nSteve Mitgang\n982,917\n50%\n267,276\n703,777\n50%\nPaul Yanover\n1,035,478\n53%\n214,715\n703,777\n47%\nFinally, as NTN works to comply with my demand letter, I would like to thank the numerous shareholders and other stakeholders who have reached out to me to discuss their concerns & interests regarding the success of NTN Buzztime.\nSean Gordon as a proposed Board member\na) Brings 20+ years of sales skills & business building\nb) Driven by results, not excuses\nc) Thinks outside the box & takes calculated risks\nd) Passionate & focused on moving quickly\nSan Diego Tribune article - 4/24/18\nhttp://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/technology/sd-fi-ntn-buffalowildwings-20180424-story.html\nFollow up Board letter – 3/26/18\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ntn-buzztime-activist-nyse-amex-ntn-determined-to-bring-about-positive-change-sends-follow-up-letter-to-the-board-of-directors-300619356.html\nInitial Board letter – 1/24/18:\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/748592/000147793218000647/ntn_ex991.htm\nSean Gordon\nEmail: srg4investing@gmail.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ntn-buzztime-activist-sends-demand-letter-to-the-companys-board-of-directors-to-inspect-ntns-books--records-for-a-list-of-the-companys-shareholders-300640083.html\nSOURCE Sean Gordon",
