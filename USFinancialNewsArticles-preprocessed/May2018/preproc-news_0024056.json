Our revenue was 79% over Q1 2017 and almost reached the level of our strongest quarter which was Q3 2017. The adjusted EBITDA was 52% over the same quarter last year. Total revenue hit $56.6 million meeting our budget and on track for our $268 million forecast for fiscal 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA was 14% of revenue, lower than our annual target due to lower Q1 volume. The Accessibility segment showed adjusted EBITDA of 19% of revenue and we forecast to hit an overall adjusted EBITDA of 15.5% in Q2, followed by 16.5% in Q3 and Q4 of this year ,” declared Marcel Bourassa, President and Chief Executive Officer of Savaria.\n“Our recent financing through a bought deal of $57 million combined with a new term loan of $50 million provides Savaria a total of $180 million of accessible cash for acquisitions and funding of organic growth.\n“Our new Vuelift luxury home elevator sales and Savaria ceiling lift product line are on an accelerating growth path and expected to contribute increasingly to our revenue growth this year,” concluded Mr. Bourassa.\nOutlook 2018\nFactoring in the benefits of the acquisition of Master Lifts that was completed in December 2017, the Corporation forecasts an increase of 48% of revenue to some $268 million and an adjusted EBITDA in the range of $42.5-$44.5 million for fiscal 2018, excluding any new acquisitions.\nSavaria Corporation ( savaria.com ) is one of North America’s leaders in the accessibility industry.
