Antara Foto/Galih Pradipta/via REUTERS\nAbdurrahman is on trial for “planning and/or mobilising others to carry out terrorist acts ... to create an atmosphere of terror among the public”.\nProsecutor Anita Dewayani told the court that under Indonesia’s anti-terrorism laws the defendant, if found guilty, should face the death sentence.\n“In view of the law, we demand the South Jakarta Court judges sentence the defendant who has been found legally and convincingly to have carried out terrorism,” said Dewayani.\nProsecutors have linked him to an alleged plot for a “Paris-style attack” targeting foreigners, as well as the January 2016 attacks in which eight people were killed, including four attackers, when suicide bombers and gunmen attacked the heart of the Indonesian capital.\nThey also say he was behind a suicide attack last year that killed three police officers at a Jakarta bus station and the bombing of a church in Samarinda on Borneo island that wounded four children.

Antara Foto/Galih Pradipta/via REUTERS\nAbdurrahman’s lawyer said in court on Friday that there was no evidence to link the defendant to the attacks.\n“He believed in establishing a caliphate, but he never proposed bombing,” said lawyer Asrudin, adding that his client had only ever talked about carrying out jihad in Syria.\nThe cleric was re-arrested by police last year after serving time in prison for setting up a militant training camp in the Indonesian province of Aceh.\nAuthorities believe Abdurrahman is the ideological leader of Islamic State-linked Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a militant group in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country that the United States has designated as a terrorist organization.

Antara Foto/Galih Pradipta/via REUTERS\nPolice linked a series of suicide bombings on churches and outside a police station in Surabaya this week to JAD.\nIn all, around 30 people were killed in the attacks, including 13 of the suspected suicide bombers.
