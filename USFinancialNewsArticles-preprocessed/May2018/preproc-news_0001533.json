    "text": "Brian Anderson went 3-for-4 with a homer and a clutch catch as the Miami Marlins defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 8-4 on Monday night at Marlins Park.\nAnderson, a rookie third baseman, played in right field for just the third time as a pro. In the seventh inning, after the Phillies loaded the bases with one out while trailing 6-4, Anderson charged in and made a diving grab. The Phillies did not score in the frame.\nReliever Merandy Gonzalez (2-0), another Marlins rookie, earned the win, pitching two scoreless innings.\nJorge Alfaro and Maikel Franco each hit two-run homers for the Phillies. Franco has 12 RBIs in four games against Miami this year.\nNeither starting pitcher fared well.\nMiami’s Dan Straily, making his 2018 debut after starting the season with a right forearm injury, lasted just four innings, allowing six hits, four walks and four runs.\nThe Phillies’ Jake Arrieta (3-1) yielded eight hits, two walks and six runs in 3 2/3 innings. In two games against the Marlins this month, Arieta has given up nine runs, eight earned, in 7 2/3 innings.\nPhiladelphia opened the scoring in the second inning. After Franco worked a seven-pitch walk, Alfaro jumped on Straily’s first delivery, driving an 81 mph slider over the wall in left-center for a 2-0 lead.\nMiami cut its deficit to 2-1 in the bottom of the second. Cameron Maybin singled, advanced to third on a hit by Miguel Rojas and scored on Lewis Brinson’s groundout.\nThe Marlins rallied for a 5-2 lead in the third. Martin Prado led off the inning with an infield single off Arrieta’s right foot. After a Starlin Castro walk, Derek Dietrich pulled a first-pitch double off the wall in right-center, just missing a homer by two feet. Prado scored, and Castro went to third.\nOn the next pitch, Anderson hit a curveball the opposite way for a two-run double over a drawn-in infield. Rojas capped the inning with an RBI groundout.\nThe Phillies cut their deficit to 5-4 in the fourth as rookie Scott Kingery doubled to left and Franco followed with a two-run homer. Straily escaped further trouble when he got Rhys Hoskins to pop out with runners on second and third.\nMiami extended its lead to 6-4 in the fourth on doubles by J.T. Realmuto and Castro, who got the RBI. The Marlins closed the scoring on Anderson’s two-run homer in the seventh.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
