    "text": "NEW YORK, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Namely, the leading HR platform for mid-sized companies, today announced the departure of Matt Straz as the company's CEO, effective immediately. The Board of Directors arrived at this decision after determining that his actions were inconsistent with that which is expected of Namely leadership.\nNamely is a company that provides HR solutions, resources and best practices to help clients achieve their workplace goals. The company is steadfast in its goal to model the best workplace practices, including demonstrating commitment to its values by taking decisive action if or when anyone, including its CEO, acts contrary to those values.\nBoard member Elisa Steele will lead the Office of the CEO. Elisa has more than 25 years of leadership experience at several of the world's leading technology companies. She last served as President & CEO of Jive Software and has held senior positions at Microsoft, Skype, Yahoo!, NetApp and Sun Microsystems.\nAlong with Elisa Steele, the Office of the CEO will also include Dan Murphy, CFO; Paul Rogers, CTO; and Graham Younger, President and CRO â€“ all of whom are recent additions to Namely's executive team as the company scales beyond $50M of ARR (annual recurring revenue).\n\"On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am confident that, together with the entire leadership team, we will ensure the company's operations are smooth during this transition and that we will continue to serve our customers well,\" said Elisa Steele. \"Namely is a company with a great team of people and a great product. We are undoubtedly well-positioned to attract a stellar CEO to take the company into its next chapter.\"\nThe Board of Directors has begun a formal search to identify a permanent successor.\nAbout Namely\nNamely is the first HR platform that employees actually love to use.
