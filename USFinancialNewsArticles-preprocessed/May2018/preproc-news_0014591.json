    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 4:12 PM / in an hour Cycling - Wellens claims Giro stage four as Froome loses time Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nCALTAGIRONE, Italy (Reuters) - Belgian Tim Wellens lived up to expectations when he won the fourth stage of the Giro d’Italia, a 202-km treacherous ride from Catania with a steep finish as Chris Froome struggled on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: Cycling – the 101st Giro d'Italia cycling race – The 9.7-km Stage 1 in Jerusalem – May 4, 2018 - Lotto rider Tim Wellens of Belgium prepares at the start line. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\nAfter three opening days in Israel and a rest day, the Giro finally reached Italian soil, with Wellens tipped as a favourite for the day’s stage.\nThe Lotto-Soudal rider was on the right end of a late split and he sustained his effort on an 800-metre climb up an average gradient of almost 10 percent to the finish line.\nHe beat Canada’s Michael Woods, who was seconds ahead of Italian Enrico Bataglin.\nFour-time Tour de France champion Froome, who is under investigation for a failed dope test in last year’s Vuelta, struggled in the finale and lost some 20 seconds, according to provisional results.\nAustralian Rohan Dennis retained the overall leader’s pink jersey with a one-second advantage over defending champion Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands.\nPortgual’s Jose Goncalves, one of the overall contenders, suffered a couple of mechanical problems in the finale and dropped out of the top 10.
