    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jones Energy, Inc. (NYSE:JONE) (“Jones Energy” or “the Company”) today announced that the previously declared contingent dividend payment on the Company’s 8% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) will not be paid. The foregone dividend is for the period beginning on the last payment date of February 15, 2018 through May 14, 2018, payable to holders of Preferred Stock of record as of May 1, 2018. As a reminder, the Company is currently prohibited from paying cash dividends on the Preferred Stock under the terms of its indebtedness.
