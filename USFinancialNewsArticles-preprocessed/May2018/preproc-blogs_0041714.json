    "text": "The United States and China launch a second round of trade talks on Thursday to try to avert a damaging tariff war, with the Trump administration demanding a $200 billion cut in China's U.S. trade surplus and greater protections for intellectual property.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose up to $150 billion in punitive tariffs to combat what he says is Beijing 's misappropriation of U.S. technology through joint venture requirements and other policies. Beijing has threatened equal retaliation, including tariffs on some of its largest U.S. imports, including aircraft, soybeans and autos.\nAt talks in Beijing two weeks ago, the two sides presented lengthy lists of demands to each other, agreeing only to keep talking.\nThe Trump administration sought a $200 billion reduction in China's $375 billion U.S. goods trade surplus, an end to joint venture requirements that it says coerce technology transfers from U.S. companies and an end to subsidies for advanced technology industries under the \"Made in China\" 2025 program.\nChina demanded that Trump relax crushing restrictions imposed on Chinese telecommunications equipment maker ZTE , as well as an end to restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States and sales of high-technology goods to China, among others.\nTrump on Sunday said on Twitter that he would help put ZTE back in business after a Commerce Department ban cut off its supply of U.S. components, forcing it to suspend operations.\nIn tweets on Wednesday, Trump linked ZTE's situation to a larger trade deal with China and said that Beijing has \"much to give\" Washington on trade, denying suggestions that his administration was \"folding\" in negotiations with Beijing.\n\"Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\"We have not seen China's demands yet, which should be few in that previous U.S. Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. The U.S. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. China has much to give!\"\nNavarro-Mnuchin rift The talks also get underway with some drama as the White House's harshest China critic, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, was relegated to a supporting role amid a growing rift with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin .\nNavarro will be present at the meetings, but the White House said they would be led by Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The Chinese side will be led by Vice Premier Liu He, the top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping .\nNavarro, author of the book \"Death by China,\" has been a major advocate of punitive tariffs on Chinese goods to try to force Beijing to change its trade practices.\nHe attended the initial round of talks in Beijing but had an angry exchange with Mnuchin on the trip, a person familiar with the episode said.\nThe Washington talks will start as USTR finishes up public hearings on the first batch of U.S. tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods proposed as punishment for alleged violations of U.S. intellectual rights.\nThe tariffs, which target Chinese electrical and machinery parts, autos and flat-screen television sets, could take effect in early June, and may be followed by an additional round targeting $100 billion worth of Chinese goods yet to be identified.\nLiu pledges hard work Liu started his visit in Washington by meeting with trade-focused U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill, listening to their concerns and telling them he would work hard to address problems with the U.S. trade relationship.\nMembers of the trade- and tax-focused U.S. House of Representatives ' Ways and Means Committee said they told Liu that he needed to address U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, barriers to investment in China and U.S. agricultural exports.\nRepublican Representative Kevin Brady , the committee's chairman, said he urged Liu to keep working with the administration toward a solution.\n\"He recognizes there are problems in this trade relationship,\" Brady said of Liu after the meeting. \"And his hope for this trip was to begin to address the trade imbalance, increasing demand of Chinese consumers for U.S. products, as well as to begin to take steps on the structural reforms.\"\nLiu left the meeting with several other Chinese officials without speaking to reporters.",
