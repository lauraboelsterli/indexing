    "text": "NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Former Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein is expected to surrender to New York City police on charges of sexual misconduct on Friday, the New York Times reported, citing two unidentified law enforcement officials.\nBenjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Weinstein, declined to comment on Thursdayâ€™s report.\nMore than 70 women have accused the co-founder of the Miramax studio and The Weinstein Co with sexual misconduct including rape, allegations that gave rise to the #MeToo movement in which hundreds of women have publicly accused powerful men in business, government and entertainment.\nWeinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.
