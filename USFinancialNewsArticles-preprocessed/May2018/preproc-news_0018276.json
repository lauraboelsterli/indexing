FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - FC Bayern Munich Conference - Munich, Germany - September 11, 2017 Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer during the press conference REUTERS/Michaela Rehle\nNeuer, a World Cup winner in 2014, broke a bone in his foot back in September and has not played since, putting his fitness for the tournament in doubt.\nNeuer will be missing when champions Bayern take on VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga finale on Saturday and also against Eintracht Frankfurt in the German Cup final later this month.\nNeuer, who has been replaced in the Bayern team by reserve keeper Sven Ulreich, only recently returned to training but had to take another break for a few days.\n“Manuel will neither play against (VfB) Stuttgart nor in the Cup final,” Heynckes told sports magazine Kicker.\nIf picked for the preliminary Germany squad on May 15, Neuer will only have two friendly internationals against Austria and Saudi Arabia to prepare for the finals starting on June 14.\nGermany have been drawn in Group F with Mexico, Sweden and South Korea.
