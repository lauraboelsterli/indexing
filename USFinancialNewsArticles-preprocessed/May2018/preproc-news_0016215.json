S&P 500 e-minis were up 7 points, or 0.26 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 31.75 points, or 0.47 percent.\nMajor U.S. stock indexes ended up more than 1 percent on Friday after weaker-than-expected U.S. wage growth numbers calmed investor fears about rising interest rates and inflation.\nU.S. corporates have performed strongly in the first quarter, with nearly 80 per cent of the 400 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far topping profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThat is well above the long-term average of 64 percent and the average of 75 percent over the past four quarters.\nTyson Foods Inc fell 4.4 after the meat processor missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit as it was hit by higher freight costs and wages.
