The market is appearing to respond positively in a mild way to the reform of income tax and the increase in infrastructure spend,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\nMaterial stocks led gains, with the sector index rising about 0.6 percent. Building materials maker James Hardie Industries PLC and plastics maker Amcor Ltd rose about 1 percent each.\nMetal miners were also higher, with index heavyweight BHP Billiton rising about 1 percent.\nChinese steelmaking materials such as iron ore and coking coal saw stronger prices overnight, while some base metal prices also firmed. An uptick in metal prices implies stronger sales revenue for miners of metals.\nBut losses in Commonwealth Bank, Australia’s largest lender, single-handedly dragged down the index.\nIts stock fell as much as 3.4 percent to the lowest since November 2016 after its third-quarter cash profit fell 2 percent.\n“(Earnings) are a slight disappointment. An increase in expenses and loan impairment expenses is quite interesting, given the other banks have gone the other way,” McCarthy added.\n“The net impact is a decline in the net interest margin, which is seen as negative for the bank. We can see the underperformance today with shares down 3 pct in early trade, in contrast with other majors which are flatish.”\nCommercial explosives maker Incitec Pivot also dragged on the index, shedding 7 percent after its half-year profit fell.\nNew Zealand shares were largely flat as gains in healthcare and consumer staples were offset by declines across a variety of sectors.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.06 percent or 4.84 points to 8,599.43.\nDairy producer a2 Milk Co was the biggest boost to the benchmark, followed by Ryman Healthcare, but losses in Fletcher Building and telco Spark New Zealand pulled down the index.\nReporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru;Additional reporting by Shanima A Editing by Eric Meijer\n ",
