    "text": "SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A Bosnian citizen sought by Tunisia on terrorism charges over his alleged role in the killing of a Tunisian who Palestinian group Hamas said was one of its members, appeared in court in Sarajevo on Wednesday.\nJudge Branko Peric said Elvir Sarac was suspected by Tunisia of “instigating terrorist acts and of membership of a terrorist organisation, as well as of harming public order and international security”.\nSarac, who was arrested on Tuesday, denied any wrongdoing and said he was on a business trip in Tunisia in December 2016.\nPeric said a decision on whether to extradite Sarac would be taken soon.\nMohammed Zawari, an aerospace engineer and drone expert, was shot dead in December 2016 near the city of Sfax. Tunisian authorities said they had arrested 10 Tunisians but two foreigners suspected of plotting the killing escaped.\nHamas blamed Israel for the killing of Zawari, who had been a member of its organization for 10 years, it said.\nPolice in Croatia in March arrested a Bosnian citizen wanted by Tunisia on same charges.\nA Croatian court ruled last week to allow his extradition to Tunisia, which his lawyers said they would appeal.\nReporting by Maja Zuvela; Editing by Alexandra Hudson\n ",
