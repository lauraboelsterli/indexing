I don’t think we should have that snobbery that if you play cricket, you need to play all formats.”\nButtler also said players should not be criticised for looking to maximise their earnings in tournaments like the IPL.\n“The climate of cricket has changed a lot with the IPL and the money the tournament offers,” said Buttler, who earned 44 million Indian rupees ($659,274) in this year’s players auction after being bought by Rajasthan Royals.\n“At the end of the day, we are professional athletes and we have a short career. To a big extent, earning as much money in that time is hugely important.”\nButtler and his Rajasthan team mate Ben Stokes, who fetched a whopping $1.97 million in the February auction, are among a dozen English players currently playing in the eight-team league.\nThe limited-overs specialist said England’s approach to the shorter formats had changed significantly in recent times.\n“We are taking white-ball cricket as seriously as red-ball cricket,” said the 27-year-old.\n“There are not many players who play all formats. So, the burnout issue is not prevalent anymore. (England coach) Trevor Bayliss, in particular, who had success (in IPL) with Kolkata Knight Riders as the head coach, knows how important it is for the success of players.” $1 = 66.74 Indian rupees Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Peter Rutherford",
