    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE American: CQP):\nSummary of First Quarter 2018 Results (in millions, except LNG data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues $ 1,593 $ 891 Net income $ 335 $ 47 Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 659 $ 319 LNG exported: Number of cargoes 67 43 Volumes (TBtu) 244 152 LNG volumes loaded (TBtu) 241 154 Revised 2018 Full Year Distribution Guidance\nPrevious Revised Distribution per Unit $ 2.00 - $ 2.20 $ 2.20 - $ 2.30 Recent Achievements\nOperational\nAs of April 30, approximately 90 cargoes have been produced, loaded, and exported from the SPL Project (defined below) in 2018. To date, approximately 350 cumulative LNG cargoes have been exported from the SPL Project, with deliveries to 26 countries and regions worldwide.\nFinancial\nIn March 2018, the date of first commercial delivery (“DFCD”) was reached under the 20-year LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with GAIL (India) Limited relating to Train 4 of the SPL Project.\nLiquefaction Project Update\nSPL Project Liquefaction Train Trains 1-4 Train 5 Train 6 Project Status Operational Under Construction Permitted Expected Substantial Completion Complete 1H 2019 — Expected DFCD Window Start Complete 2H 2019 — Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (“Cheniere Partners”) (NYSE American: CQP) reported net income of $335 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $47 million for the comparable period in 2017. The increase in net income was primarily due to increased income from operations as a result of additional natural gas liquefaction trains (“Trains”) in operation at the SPL Project, partially offset by increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $659 million, compared to $319 million for the comparable 2017 period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased income from operations.\nTotal revenues increased $702 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Total operating costs and expenses increased $413 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increases in revenues and total operating costs and expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the comparable prior year period, were primarily driven by the timing of completion of Trains at the SPL Project and the length of each Train’s operations within the periods being compared.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, 67 LNG cargoes were exported from the SPL Project, none of which were commissioning cargoes.\nSPL Project\nThrough Cheniere Partners, we are developing up to six Trains at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities (the “SPL Project”). Each Train is expected to have a nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 4.5 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) of LNG and an adjusted nominal production capacity of approximately 4.3 to 4.6 mtpa of LNG. Trains 1 through 4 are operational, Train 5 is under construction, and Train 6 is being commercialized and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place.\nDistributions to Unitholders\nWe will pay a cash distribution per common and subordinated unit of $0.55 to unitholders of record as of May 7, 2018 and the related general partner distribution on May 15, 2018.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nCheniere Energy, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss its financial and operating results for the first quarter on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern time / 9 a.m. Central time. A listen-only webcast of the call and an accompanying slide presentation may be accessed through our website at www.cheniere.com . Following the call, an archived recording will be made available on our website. The call and accompanying slide presentation may include financial and operating results or other information regarding Cheniere Partners.\n(1)\nNon-GAAP financial measure. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” for further details.\nAbout Cheniere Partners\nCheniere Partners, through its subsidiary, Sabine Pass Liquefaction, LLC (“SPL”), is developing, constructing, and operating natural gas liquefaction facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, on the Sabine-Neches Waterway less than four miles from the Gulf Coast. Cheniere Partners, through SPL, plans to construct up to six liquefaction trains (“Trains”), which are in various stages of development, construction, and operations. Trains 1 through 4 are operational, Train 5 is under construction and Train 6 is being commercialized and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place. Each Train is expected to have a nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 4.5 mtpa of LNG and an adjusted nominal production capacity of approximately 4.3 to 4.6 mtpa of LNG.\nThrough its wholly owned subsidiary, Sabine Pass LNG, L.P., Cheniere Partners owns and operates regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, which includes pre-existing infrastructure of five LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 16.9 billion cubic feet equivalent (“Bcfe”), two marine berths that can each accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4.0 Bcf/d. Cheniere Partners also owns a 94-mile pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cheniere Creole Trail Pipeline, L.P.\nFor additional information, please refer to the Cheniere Partners website at www.cheniere.com and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain statements that may include “forward-looking statements.” All statements, other than statements of historical or present facts or conditions, included herein are “forward-looking statements.” Included among “forward-looking statements” are, among other things, (i) statements regarding Cheniere Partners’ business strategy, plans and objectives, including the development, construction and operation of liquefaction facilities, (ii) statements regarding expectations regarding regulatory authorizations and approvals, (iii) statements expressing beliefs and expectations regarding the development of Cheniere Partners’ LNG terminal and liquefaction business, (iv) statements regarding the business operations and prospects of third parties, (v) statements regarding potential financing arrangements, and (vi) statements regarding future discussions and entry into contracts.
