    "text": "YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenian president Armen Sarkissian on Wednesday called for talks to take place this week to resolve the political crisis that has engulfed the small ex-Soviet state since protests led to the prime minister’s resignation last week.\n“I deeply regret that the political crisis continues despite the fact that everyone is talking about how dangerous it is for the future of the country,” Sarkissian said, in a statement published by his press service.\n“I call for consultations to be continued this coming week, to find a way out of the crisis,” he said.\nReporting by Hasmik Mkrtchyan; Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Christian Lowe\n ",
