FILE PHOTO: A view of one of two Rolls Royce Trent 1000 engines on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner during a media tour ahead of the Singapore Airshow on February 12, 2012. REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo\nRolls-Royce will set out full details on how it intends to speed up necessary inspections and repairs on Wednesday, a spokesman for the engine manufacturer said, confirming a development first reported by the Financial Times.\nTurbine blades in the Trent 1000 package C engines are not lasting as long as expected, requiring extra inspections and meaning airlines are having to ground some aircraft.\nAir New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic are among the airlines affected.
