    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“C.H. Robinson”) (NASDAQ: CHRW) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nTotal revenues increased 14.9 percent to $3.9 billion Net revenues increased 10.1 percent to $625.9 million Aggregate transportation volume increase of 1.5 percent Income from operations increased 1.9 percent to $191.6 million Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 17.4 percent to $1.01 Operating cash flow increased 116.4 percent to $200.6 million\n“In a rapidly changing freight environment, we were able to deliver double-digit net revenue growth, expand our digital capabilities, make significant investments in our Global Forwarding business and deliver increased operating income,” said John Wiehoff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of C.H. Robinson. “We delivered a significant improvement in operating cash flow and returned nearly $135 million to shareholders, a 23 percent increase versus the first quarter of last year.”\nFirst Quarter Results Summary\nTotal revenues increased 14.9 percent to $3.9 billion, driven by growth across all transportation service lines. Net revenues increased 10.1 percent to $625.9 million, driven primarily by growth in truckload, less than truckload (\"LTL\"), air, ocean and customs services. Operating expenses increased 14.1 percent to $434.3 million. Personnel expenses increased 13.0 percent to $328.3 million, driven primarily by a 5.7 percent increase in average headcount and higher variable compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased 17.7 percent to $106.0 million, due primarily to a favorable $8.75 million legal settlement in the prior year and increased bad debt, occupancy and equipment maintenance and depreciation expense in the current year. Income from operations totaled $191.6 million, up 1.9 percent from last year. Operating margin of 30.6 percent declined 250 basis points. Interest and other expenses increased by $1.4 million, driven primarily by increased debt levels and higher variable interest rates on short-term debt. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3 percent compared to 31.7 percent last year, driven primarily by a $17.1 million benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Net income totaled $142.3 million, up 16.6 percent from a year ago. Diluted EPS of $1.01 increased 17.4 percent.\nNorth American Surface Transportation (\"NAST\") Results\nSummarized financial results of our NAST segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % change Total revenues (1) $ 2,663,011 $ 2,259,252 17.9 % Net revenues 414,769 372,440 11.4 % Income from operations 174,078 155,877 11.7 % (1) Excludes intersegment revenues. First quarter total revenues for C.H. Robinson's NAST segment totaled $2.7 billion, an increase of 17.9 percent over the prior year, driven by increased pricing. Total NAST net revenues increased 11.4 percent in the quarter to $414.8 million. Net revenues in truckload increased 10.1 percent driven by higher pricing. LTL net revenues increased 14.8 percent due to higher pricing and volumes. Intermodal net revenues decreased 13.8 percent driven by increased accessorial and dray costs. Excluding the impact of the change in fuel prices, our average North America truckload rate per mile charged to customers increased approximately 21 percent in the quarter, while our truckload transportation costs increased approximately 21.5 percent. NAST volume increased approximately 1 percent in the quarter, as a 7 percent decline in truckload volume was more than offset by LTL and intermodal volume growth of 8 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Operating expenses increased 11.1 percent in the quarter due to increased variable compensation and the favorable $8.75 million legal settlement in the year-ago period. Income from operations increased 11.7 percent in the quarter, and operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 42.0 percent. NAST average headcount was approximately flat in the quarter.\nGlobal Forwarding Results\nSummarized financial results of our Global Forwarding segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % change Total revenues (1) $ 553,754 $ 468,788 18.1 % Net revenues 123,037 106,546 15.5 % Income from operations 8,221 16,206 (49.3 )% (1) Excludes intersegment revenues. First quarter total revenues for the Global Forwarding segment increased 18.1 percent to $553.8 million, driven by double-digit volume growth across all service lines. Net revenues increased 15.5 percent in the quarter to $123.0 million. Ocean net revenues increased 8.3 percent. Net revenues in air increased 27.7 percent. Customs net revenues increased 28.5 percent. The acquisition of Milgram & Company added approximately 5 percentage points to the net revenue growth in the quarter. Income from operations declined 49.3 percent to $8.2 million due to a 21.4 percent increase in average headcount, including investments to build scale in air freight, and technology investments across all service lines. Milgram added approximately 7.5 percentage points to the Global Forwarding average headcount. Operating margin declined 850 basis points to 6.7 percent in the quarter.\nRobinson Fresh Results\nSummarized financial results of our Robinson Fresh segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % change Total revenues (1) $ 550,469 $ 550,445 0.0 % Net revenues 53,870 56,837 (5.2 )% Income from operations 9,307 14,652 (36.5 )% (1) Excludes intersegment revenues. First quarter total revenues for the Robinson Fresh segment were approximately flat compared to the prior year at $550.5 million. Segment net revenues declined 5.2 percent to $53.9 million in the quarter. Sourcing net revenues decreased 1.7 percent, driven by a strategic customer exiting the fresh produce business. Transportation net revenues decreased 9.3 percent, primarily driven by truckload volume declines. Robinson Fresh income from operations declined 36.5 percent due to increased variable compensation and a write-off of a supplier advance, partially offset by a 5.6 percent reduction in average headcount. Operating margin declined 850 basis points to 17.3 percent in the quarter.\nAll Other and Corporate Results\nNet revenues for Managed Services and Other Surface Transportation are summarized as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Net revenues 2018 2017 % change Managed Services $ 18,317 $ 17,193 6.5 % Other Surface Transportation 15,932 15,550 2.5 % First quarter Managed Services net revenues increased 6.5 percent to $18.3 million, driven by new business. Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 2.5 percent to $15.9 million, primarily due to volume growth in Europe.\nOther Income Statement Items\nThe first quarter effective tax rate was 21.3 percent, down from 31.7 percent last year. The lower tax rate was primarily driven by the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be 24 to 25 percent in 2018.\nDue to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 (“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”), in-transit shipments are now included in our financial results as of January 1, 2018. We do not expect this new policy to have a material impact on our operating results.\nInterest and other expenses increased approximately $1.4 million in the quarter, driven primarily by increased debt levels and higher variable interest rates on short-term debt. Changes in revaluation of foreign currency did not have a material impact on our first quarter results.\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were approximately flat, as share repurchases were offset by activity in our equity compensation plans.\nCash Flow Generation and Capital Distribution\nCash from operations totaled $200.6 million, up 116.4 percent from the prior year, primarily due to improved collections and increased earnings from the year-ago period.\nIn the first quarter, $134.7 million was returned to shareholders, with $65.4 million in cash dividends and $69.3 million in share repurchases. This represents an increase of 22.9 percent over the prior year.\nCapital expenditures totaled $15.5 million in the quarter. We continue to expect 2018 capital expenditures to be $60 to $70 million, with the majority dedicated to technology.\nOutlook\n“We expect demand to remain high as the benefits of U.S. tax reform strengthen a growing economy,” said John Wiehoff. “Given the driver shortage and electronic logging device mandate, we also expect industry capacity to remain tight. With these dynamics in place, we believe the current freight market fundamentals will continue throughout 2018.”\nJohn continued, “We believe our large carrier network and proven ability to source capacity for our customers is as important as ever in this volatile market. We will leverage our digital transformation to expand the supply chain expertise we provide to our customers and carriers and drive operating efficiencies in our business to increase returns to our employees and shareholders. I am confident that we have the right people, processes and technology to continue to win in the marketplace.”\nAbout C.H. Robinson\nAt C.H.
