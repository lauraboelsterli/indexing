    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConversionPoint Technologies , a leading e-Commerce technology group, has appointed Andrew Dickinson to its advisory board.\nDickinson brings to ConversionPoint an award-winning track record of significant achievements from a number of senior financial and operational roles at Rolls-Royce , including an extraordinary record of 100% on-time delivery, productivity improvements of more than 10%, and a 500% improvement in safety. His global business experience spans Germany, Brazil, Singapore and the UK.\nDickinson was CFO of Rolls-Royce Civil Aerospace in Derby, UK, where he was responsible for the finance, commercial, compliance, risk and IT functions globally for the $10.8 billion division with 24,000 employees. Within the finance department, he led a team of more than 350 finance professionals.\n“Andrew is an outstanding global senior executive and entrepreneur, with a tremendous breadth of international knowledge and experience in business leadership, operations and finance gained at a FTSE 100 company,” noted Robert Tallack, CEO of ConversionPoint. “He will be a tremendous asset with his large company financial background as we grow ConversionPoint.”\nCommented Dickinson: “ConversionPoint is exceptional in how it has brought together various technologies to solve fundamental pain points in today’s e-Commerce world. Where before, companies had to cobble together various data stories, ConversionPoint is creating an innovative SaaS-based solution that unifies different data points in the buyer journey to tell a complete story. No longer will sellers have to guess where the conversion point is with their customers or wonder what ROI marketing efforts have created. I’m fortunate to join the company’s advisory board at this pivotal time in its evolution, and as it sets out on an aggressive growth path that is destined to transform the e-Commerce landscape.”\nDickinson earlier served as general manager at International Engine Component Overhaul (IECO) in Singapore, a joint venture between Rolls-Royce and Singapore Airlines Engineering. During his tenure, the company achieved top and bottom-line growth and perfect on-time delivery performance. The company won several industry awards, which recognized its pursuit of innovation and productivity improvement.\nPrior to IECO, he served as finance director of N3 Engine Overhaul Services, where he was responsible for the establishment and general management of a $135 million repair and overhaul facility on a greenfield site in eastern Germany. He oversaw the building of a new facility and testbed, the development of a company culture, the recruitment and training of 400 employees, the design and implementation of company processes and procedures, and the negotiation of third party financing to fund the company’s growth.\nBefore N3 Engine, he served as director of finance and administration at Rolls-Royce in Brazil, accountable for setting strategic direction and providing company leadership. He was directly responsible for several departments, including finance, procurement, legal, information technology, facility management, health and safety and occupational health.\nDickinson holds a BA with Honors in Accounting and Finance from Liverpool John Moores University, and is a chartered Institute of Management accountant.\nHis appointment is the second addition to the ConversionPoint Technologies Advisory Board. The company recently announced the addition of the global licensing leader, Tim Rothwell , to the board.\nAbout ConversionPoint Technologies\nConversionPoint Technologies, Inc. is a group of e-Commerce technology companies changing how brands, advertisers and agencies connect with, acquire and retain customers.
