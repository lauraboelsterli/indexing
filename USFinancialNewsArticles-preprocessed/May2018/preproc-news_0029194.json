    "text": "May 14, 2018 / 7:26 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago U.S. diplomat involved in accident allowed to leave Pakistan Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. diplomat who was involved in a fatal traffic accident has left Pakistan, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Monday, two days after the diplomat reportedly was barred from leaving the South Asian country.\n“We can confirm that the American diplomat who was involved in a tragic car accident on April 7 in Islamabad has departed Pakistan,” the spokesperson said in an email to Reuters.\nThe spokesperson did not identify the U.S. diplomat and provided no further details of the case.\nPakistani newspapers reported that the American, identified as a military attache, was blocked on Saturday from leaving Pakistan, forcing the U.S. military aircraft sent on his behalf to depart without him.\nOn Friday, an Islamabad court ruled that the American’s diplomatic immunity might not apply in the traffic accident in which his vehicle hit a motorcycle, killing the 22-year-old driver, the Nation and the Express Tribune newspapers said.
