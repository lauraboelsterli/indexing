    "text": "May 30, 2018 / 3:44 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Capital Airlines flight turns around in China after cracks appear in window: Xinhua Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - A Capital Airlines flight from China to Vietnam was forced to turn around after cracks appeared in a window, Chinese state media reported on Wednesday.\nFlight JD421 from the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou to Nha Trang on Vietnamâ€™s coast turned back one hour into the journey on Tuesday afternoon, the official Xinhua news agency said.\nCapital Airlines said cracks had appeared in a window but not the windshield as some passengers had claimed, the agency reported, citing a company statement.\nA video circulating on Chinese social media showed a Capital Airlines staff member telling passengers there were cracks in the windshield.\nThe aircraft was an Airbus A321, according to plane tracking website Flightradar24.\nBeijing-based Capital Airlines, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, and Airbus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nEarlier this month, a Sichuan Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing after a cockpit window blew out.\nAlso in May, a Southwest Airlines plane made an emergency landing after a window pane cracked in flight.
