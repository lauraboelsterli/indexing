Achieved positive comparable traffic growth in all divisions\nMONTEVIDEO, Uruguay--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arcos Dorados Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) (“Arcos Dorados” or the “Company”), Latin America’s largest restaurant chain and the world’s largest independent McDonald’s franchisee, today reported unaudited results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Key Results – Excluding Venezuela\nAs reported consolidated revenues increased 5.5% to $802.8 million versus the first quarter of 2017. On a constant currency basis 1 , consolidated revenues grew 10.7%. Systemwide comparable sales 1 rose 9.8% year-over-year. As reported Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 12.5% to $68.0 million compared with the prior-year quarter. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points to 8.5%. As reported General and Administrative (G&A) expenses remained flat as a percentage of revenues. As reported net income decreased to $13.6 million, from $41.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to re-development proceeds of $51.9 million in the year ago period.\n“The positive momentum continued in the first quarter of 2018 as Arcos Dorados posted strong operating results. An improved macroeconomic environment, favorable consumer trends, and compelling product offerings across our menu contributed to an important shift in mix and increased traffic, driving top line growth, profitability and gains in market share throughout Latin America.\nWe are leveraging our leading market share, streamlined cost structure and unmatched scale to capture the opportunity in front of us. We are deriving additional margin and cash generation by maintaining our focus on bringing more guests to our restaurants more often. I am confident that our strong restaurant portfolio, popular menu items and outstanding team will continue to deliver sustainable growth and significant shareholder value creation,\" said Sergio Alonso, Chief Executive Officer of Arcos Dorados.\n1 For definitions please refer to page 12 of this document.

Refer to “Definitions” section for further detail.\nArcos Dorados’ consolidated results continue to be heavily impacted by Venezuela’s macroeconomic volatility, including the ongoing hyperinflationary environment and the country’s heavily regulated currency. As such, reported results in the quarter reflect significant non-cash accounting impacts from operations in that market. Thus, the discussion of the Company’s operating performance is focused on consolidated results, excluding Venezuela.\nConsolidated – excluding Venezuela\nFigure 2.

The result primarily reflects constant currency revenue growth of 10.7%, partially offset by a negative impact from currency translation, which mainly resulted from the 25.7% and 3.3% year-over-year average depreciation of the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real, respectively. Constant currency revenue growth was supported by a 9.8% increase in systemwide comparable sales, supported by a favorable shift in mix and positive traffic in all divisions.\nFirst quarter consolidated as reported Adjusted EBITDA, excluding Venezuela, increased 12.5% or 15.9% in constant currency terms, with revenue growth and margin expansion in all divisions, except for the Caribbean. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points to 8.5%, driven by efficiencies in Food and Paper (F&P), Payroll, and Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses, partially offset by higher Royalty Fees.\nAs reported, consolidated G&A increased by 5.1% year-over-year, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues.\nMain variations in other operating income (expenses), net\nIncluded in Adjusted EBITDA: In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded an inventory write down of $41.3 million, related to the devaluation in Venezuela, compared to an inventory write down of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Proceeds from refranchising were less than $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 as well as in the prior year comparable quarter.\nExcluded from Adjusted EBITDA: In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded $0.2 million from its re-development initiative, compared with $51.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-operating Results\nNon-operating results for the first quarter reflected a non-cash $1.8 million foreign currency exchange loss, versus a non-cash loss of $8.4 million last year. Net interest expense was $1.8 million lower year-over-year.\nThe Company reported an income tax expense of $12.9 million in the quarter, compared to an income tax expense of $21.4 million in the prior year period.\nFirst quarter net income attributable to the Company totaled $13.6 million ($0.5 million, including Venezuela), compared to net income of $41.0 million ($40.6 million, including Venezuela) in the same period of 2017. The prior year result included $51.9 million from the Company’s re-development initiative compared with $0.2 million this year. The Company concluded the redevelopment program in 2017.\nThe Company reported earnings per share of $0.06 ($0.00, including Venezuela) in the first quarter of 2018, compared to earnings per share of $0.19 (also $0.19, including Venezuela) in the previous corresponding period. Total weighted average shares for the first quarter of 2018 were 211,072,508, as compared to 210,711,224 in the prior year quarter.\nAnalysis by Division :\nBrazil Division\nFigure 3. Brazil Division: Key Financial Results (In millions of U.S. dollars, except as noted)\n1Q17\n(a)\nCurrency\nTranslation\n(b)\nConstant\nCurrency\nGrowth\n(c)\n1Q18\n(a+b+c)\n% As\nReported\n% Constant\nCurrency\nTotal Restaurants (Units) 904 929 2.8% Total Revenues 360.0 (11.7) 16.3 364.7 1.3% 4.5% Systemwide Comparable Sales 4.6% Adjusted EBITDA 44.8 (1.4) 5.4 48.7 8.9% 12.1% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 12.4% 13.4% Brazil’s as reported revenues increased by 1.3%, supported by constant currency growth outpacing a negative currency translation impact from the 3.3% average depreciation of the Brazilian real. Excluding currency translation, constant currency revenues grew 4.5% year-over-year, while total systemwide sales grew 7.4% in constant currency. This reflects the impact of the refranchising of certain company-operated restaurants during the last twelve months. An increase in the number of franchised restaurants reduces the Company’s total revenue comparisons, as company-operated restaurant sales are replaced by rental income received from the Company’s franchisees. In the quarter, systemwide comparable sales rose 4.6%, driven by a higher average check and continued restaurant traffic growth.\nMarketing activities in the quarter, which were designed to sustainably stimulate top-line growth without negatively impacting gross margins, included the launch of the Batata Rústica campaign and the introduction of the Big Tasty Duplo & Chicken Bacon sandwiches, among others. Also in the quarter, the Company launched the McFlurry “Alpino” and “Triplo Chocolate Kopenhagen” in the Dessert category and included “Snoopy” in the Happy Meal.\nAs reported Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.9% year-over-year and 12.1% on a constant currency basis. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points to 13.4%, mainly through capturing efficiencies in F&P costs. Brazil Royalty Fee was partially offset by Growth Support received from McDonald’s Corporation during the quarter.\nNOLAD\nFigure 4.

Systemwide comparable sales increased 11.4%, mainly driven by an increase in traffic across all the division’s markets, combined with a favorable shift in mix. Notably, Mexico guest traffic continues to perform strongly, having recorded the highest comparable growth rate since the formation of Arcos Dorados in 2007. In addition to the positive Easter calendar shift, the Company’s innovative marketing and digital initiatives as well as its focus on delivering a better guest experience are driving the improved performance.\nMarketing activities in the quarter included a new phase of the affordability platform “McTrío 3x3” in Mexico and the introduction of the “Caprese” premium burger in the Signature Line. The dessert category performed well with the launch of the McFlurry Crunch Rocks. Also in the quarter, the Company included “Ty Beanie Boos” and “Snoopy” in the Happy Meal.\nAs reported Adjusted EBITDA increased by 40.1%, or by 41.9% on a constant currency basis. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 130 basis points to 7.5% in the first quarter reflects efficiencies in all cost line items, except Royalty Fees.\nSLAD\nFigure 5.

Systemwide comparable sales increased 19.7%, driven by the combination of a favorable shift in mix and an increase in traffic.\nMarketing activities in the quarter included the introduction of the Blue Cheese & Bacon premium burger in the Signature Line. Also in the quarter, the Company launched the “Papas Blue Cheese” and “Papas Cheddar Bacon” campaigns. The dessert category performed well with the introduction of the McFlurry Hershey’s and the launch of the McColoso. The Happy Meal featured “Ty Beanie Boos” and “Snoopy” during the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 11.5% on an as reported basis and rose 26.1% in constant currency terms. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points to 9.5%, due to efficiencies in all cost line items, except Royalty Fees. SLAD’s Royalty Fee increase was partially offset by Growth Support received from McDonald’s Corporation during the quarter.\nCaribbean Division\nFigure 6.

As such, reported results in the quarter reflect significant non-cash accounting impacts from operations in that market. Thus, the discussion of the Caribbean division’s operating performance is focused on results, excluding Venezuela.\nCaribbean Division – excluding Venezuela\nFigure 7.

Marketing activities in the quarter included the continuation of the MyCombo campaign and the launch of the Mozzarella Melt burger. Also in the quarter, the Company introduced the Chokis Chocobase Cone in the dessert category, and included “Snoopy” in the Happy Meal.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $3.8 million, compared to $3.4 million in the same period of 2017. The Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 10 basis points to 3.8%. Lower Payroll costs, Occupancy and Other Operating expenses as well as G&A largely offset higher F&P expenses and Royalty Fees as a percentage of revenues.\nNew Unit Development\nFigure 8.

Under the new guidance, initial franchise fees are being recognized evenly over the franchise term rather than immediately upon receipt. For further information, please refer to Note #3 of our quarterly financial statements (Form 6-K), filed today with the SEC.\nAnnual General Shareholders Meeting\nThe Company held its Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 24, 2018. All proposals were approved.\nElection of Class I Directors\nMr. Woods Staton, Mr. Ricardo Gutiérrez, Mr. Sergio Alonso and Mr. Francisco Staton have been duly elected as Class I Directors of the Board of Directors of the Company, to hold office until the conclusion of the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting held in the calendar year 2021. Mr. Francisco Staton was elected to the Board of Directors for the first time. Mr. Staton graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree from Princeton University and an MBA from Columbia University, and is currently the Managing Director of Arcos Dorados’ Colombia, Aruba, Curaçao, and Trinidad markets.\nDefinitions :\nSystemwide comparable sales growth: refers to the change, measured in constant currency, in our Company-operated and franchised restaurant sales in one period from a comparable period for restaurants that have been open for thirteen months or longer. While sales by our franchisees are not recorded as revenues by us, we believe the information is important in understanding our financial performance because these sales are the basis on which we calculate and record franchised revenues, and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base.\nConstant currency basis: refers to amounts calculated using the same exchange rate over the periods under comparison to remove the effects of currency fluctuations from this trend analysis.\nTo better discern underlying business trends, this release uses non-GAAP financial measures that segregate year-over-year growth into two categories: (i) currency translation, (ii) constant currency growth. (i) Currency translation reflects the impact on growth of the appreciation or depreciation of the local currencies in which we conduct our business against the US dollar (the currency in which our financial statements are prepared). (ii) Constant currency growth reflects the underlying growth of the business excluding the effect from currency translation.\nAdjusted EBITDA: In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with the general accepted accounting principles (GAAP), within this press release and the accompanying tables, we use a non-GAAP financial measure titled ‘Adjusted EBITDA’. We use Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as our operating income plus depreciation and amortization plus/minus the following losses/gains included within other operating income (expenses), net, and within general and administrative expenses in our statement of income: gains from sale or insurance recovery of property and equipment; write-offs of property and equipment; impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill; and incremental compensation related to the modification of our 2008 long-term incentive plan.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations such as capital structures (affecting net interest expense and other financial charges), taxation (affecting income tax expense) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense), which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Figure 10 of this earnings release include a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA. For more information, please see Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in Note 9 of our quarterly financial statements (6-K Form) filed today with the S.E.C.\nAbout Arcos Dorados\nArcos Dorados is the world’s largest independent McDonald’s franchisee in terms of systemwide sales and number of restaurants, operating the largest quick service restaurant chain in Latin America and the Caribbean.
