Net Credit to the public increased by 2.5% compared with the corresponding period last year and by 1.3% compared with December 31, 2017 (an increase of approximately 5% in annual terms). The increase in credit is mainly from the Middle-Market and Real Estate segments. Net interest income increased by 7.1% compared with the corresponding period last year.
