    "text": "HARRISBURG, Pa., May 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Riverview Financial Corporation (OTCQX: RIVE) declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share for the second quarter of 2018 on May 24, 2018. The dividend is payable June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 15, 2018.\nKirk D. Fox, Chief Executive Officer stated, \"We are pleased to reinstate our dividend for the second quarter of 2018 after suspending it in the first quarter. Executive management and the Board of Directors made the prudent decision to suspend the payment of a first quarter dividend in order to conserve capital given the magnitude of one-time expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017. These expenses included those related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets from the enactment of new tax legislation along with acquisition costs from the merger with CBT Financial Corp. It is our goal to continue to pay to a reasonable dividend without disrupting the delicate balance we must maintain between the payment of a dividend to shareholders and remaining a well-capitalized institution, which is critical in our dedicated efforts to continue building long term value for shareholders. The payment of a second quarter cash dividend represents an annualized yield of 3.2% based on the closing price of our stock on the dividend declaration date.\"\nRiverview Financial Corporation is the parent company of Riverview Bank and its operating divisions Halifax Bank, Marysville Bank, Citizens Neighborhood Bank, CBT Bank, Riverview Wealth Management and CBT Financial and Trust Management.
