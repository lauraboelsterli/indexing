Gross profit of $1.5 million increased 23.4% from $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 24.7% compared to 28.6% in the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses of $3.3 million increased 23.5% from $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $(1.1) million, compared to a loss of $(1.1) million in the first quarter of 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n“We are pleased to build on our 2017 performance with a very strong first quarter. Revenues were up over 40 percent year-over-year, led by the continued expansion in our network of reseller partners, growing adoption of our existing product suite and continued product introductions,” commented Mark Elliott, chief executive officer of Boxlight. “Growth in our reseller network is an important component of our organic growth strategy.”\n“We intend to complement our growth with strategic acquisitions,” added Mr. Elliott. “With this in mind, we are pleased to announce our acquisition of Cohuba, a touch display technology firm based in the U.K. We look forward to leveraging Cohuba’s experienced sales and operational team and channel partner network in this important market.”\nMr. Elliott concluded, “Subsequent to quarter end, we were awarded several significant contracts to deliver Boxlight’s comprehensive suite of products and services to students in thousands of additional U.S. classrooms this year. We are seeing unprecedented adoption of technology solutions in the education market, and we exited the quarter with the strongest sales pipeline in our history. We remain confident that our comprehensive, integrated product and software suite uniquely position Boxlight as a thought leader in the educational technology market.”\nRecent Developments\nDuring the quarter, the company entered into new partnerships with Kansas City Audio Visual (KVAC), a leading reseller in the Midwest; TEQ, a New York-based reseller for the Company’s portable STEM lab, tables, peripherals and supporting products; and Whalley Computer Associates, a prominent reseller in New England. Boxlight will work with these trusted reseller partners to introduce the Company’s interactive and collaborative learning solutions into additional K-12 classrooms in the U.S.\nOn May 14, 2018, the Company announced its acquisition of United Kingdom-based Cohuborate Ltd. (“Cohuba\"), from a family trust of Tony Cann, founder of Promethean. Cohuba is a developer of touch display technology for the education, government and business markets. Through the acquisition, Boxlight gains Cohuba’s experienced sales and operations team, and strong network of reseller partners to distribute Boxlight’s technology solutions to the education market throughout the United Kingdom. Boxlight will relaunch the Cohuba brand in 2018 as its global business and government solution. The acquisition also expands the company’s advisory panel with the addition of Mr. Paul Pickup, former chief operating officer of Promethean and Mr. Andy Pennington, founder and CEO of Cohuba, and previously head of product at Promethean.\nBoxlight acquired Cohuba for approximately $1.8 million through the issuance of 257,200 shares of common stock at a price of $7 per share.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results today, Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

EBITDA represents net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus stock-based compensation and non-recurring IPO expenses. Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of our business model. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to access the strength of the underlying operations of our business. These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. We find this especially useful when reviewing pro forma results of operations, which include large non-cash amortizations of intangible assets from acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Boxlight Corporation\nBoxlight Corporation (Nasdaq: BOXL) (“Boxlight”) is a leading provider of technology solutions for the global education market.
