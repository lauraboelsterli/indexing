    "text": "11 COMMENTS A Girl Scout, a football player and two beloved substitute teachers were among the names of the 10 killed in Friday’s shooting at Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas.\nCynthia Tisdale, 63 years old, worked as a full-time substitute teacher and aide in different departments. On Friday morning, she left a note for her husband saying she had to run out to school. “Had to go meet teacher. I love you,” read a picture of the note, posted on Facebook by a relative. A diagonal scribble in the corner indicated that she made him breakfast before leaving.\n“We are all heartbroken,” her brother-in-law, John Tisdale, a pastor at the Anchor Bible Baptist Church in Pharr, Texas, posted on Facebook. “We never know when our death will come. Cynthia planned on one day retiring and being a full-time grandmother.”\nCynthia Tisdale, in red, with her husband William. The 63-year-old substitute teacher had 11 grandchildren, three children, and one stepdaughter, according to her eldest son. Ms. Tisdale had 11 grandchildren, three children, and one stepdaughter, said her eldest son, Recie. She was also a member of the Baptist church.\nStudent Chris Stone rode to school Friday morning with a friend, who said they laughed the whole way there, “then 45 minutes into school he passes. Life hits hard,” wrote the friend, Logan Pettus, in a Twitter post. Mr. Stone was a junior and played on the football team.\nKim Vaughan, a freshman, was a Girl Scout “and loved by many,” family friend Rachel Woratschka said in a GoFundMe account she organized for the slain girl’s mother, Rhonda Hart.\nAccording to the GoFundMe account, one of two set up for the family, Ms. Hart was a single mother to Kim and a sibling named Tyler. The two accounts had raised more than $28,500 by Saturday evening.\nKyle McLeod, 15 , was killed in art class, according to a relative, the first class the gunman entered on Friday. “Kyle was a sweet young man who was an honor student and was very close to his sister,” said Christine McLeod Williamson, Kyle’s great-aunt.\n“We are all stunned by this loss and hope that Kyle’s death will somehow open dialogue about the many issues surrounding violence in our country. There are no easy answers, but we must continue to question ourselves and our culture to find a way out of this horror,” Mrs. Williamson said.\nSubstitute teacher Glenda Perkins, better known as Ann, was mourned by students who described her as lively, funny, and always smiling. “She always knew how to liven up a classroom and deal with our crazy high school teenage selves!” wrote Carsen Lawrence, a former student, on Facebook. “No one could do it like her.”\nFriends of Angelique Ramirez also set up a fundraising page, and described the Santa Fe High teenager as a kind, compassionate young woman who always thought of others.\n“Angelique’s smile was contagious and brightened up any room she walked into,” said the GoFundMe page, which was started by a family friend. “Words cannot begin to express the pain her friends and family are currently experiencing.”\nSabika Sheikh, an exchange student from Pakistan, is the first international student in the U.S. on a State Department-sponsored exchange program killed in a school shooting, according to a department spokesman. Photo: sheikh family handout/epa-efe/re/EPA/Shutterstock Sabika Sheikh was an honor roll student on an exchange program from Pakistan, fulfilling a dream to study in the U.S.\nShe was one of 72 students from Pakistan living across the U.S. this year as part of the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Program, which is funded by the State Department.\nThe program aims to support U.S. foreign policy goals “by giving foreign youth firsthand experience in the United States and increasing understanding between Americans and people from countries of strategic interest to the United States,” according to the State Department.\nIt is the first time an international student in the U.S. on a State Department-sponsored exchange program died in a school shooting, a department spokesman said.\nIn a statement Saturday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sabika’s death and those of the other victims were ”heartbreaking and will be mourned deeply both here in the United States, and in Pakistan.”\nThe Galveston County, Texas, District Attorney released the names of the 10 victims on Saturday.\nThe 10 Victims of the Santa Fe, Texas, High School Shooting Released Saturday by the Galveston County, Texas, District Attorney\nGlenda “Ann” Perkins — Teacher Cynthia Tisdale — Teacher Kimberly Vaughan Shana Fisher Angelique Ramirez Christian Riley Garcia Jared Black Sabika Sheikh Christopher Jake Stone Aaron Kyle McLeod Write to Nour Malas at nour.malas@wsj.com and Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com",
