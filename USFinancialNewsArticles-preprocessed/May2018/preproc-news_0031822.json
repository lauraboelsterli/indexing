    "text": "TOKYO, May 14 (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds eased on Monday after the Bank of Japan’s buying in short- to medium-term maturities drew larger-than-expected selling interest.\nThe BOJ’s buying in JGBs with five to 10 years to maturity drew selling of 1.802 trillion yen, the biggest since early April. Selling on other maturities also increased from their previous operations.\nTrading was extremely thin, with none of major benchmark issues, including 10-, and 20-year JGBs, traded in the morning.\nThe 10-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.045 percent, while the 20-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.525 percent.\nThe five-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to minus 0.105 percent. The 30-year yield rose 1 basis point to 0.745 percent.\nLiquidity in futures trading has been dwindling, too, over the past several days.\nTen-year JGB futures fell 0.03 point to 150.80, with a trading volume of 11,817 lots, the lowest since the last Christmas day.
