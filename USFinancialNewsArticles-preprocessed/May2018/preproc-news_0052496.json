FILE PHOTO: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attends a meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali in Moscow, Russia April 2, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo\nDates for the trip have yet to be agreed, she said. Earlier, the RBC news portal wrote that Lavrov would travel to North Korea on May 31.\nThat would mean him visiting before a proposed summit in Singapore between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nOn Tuesday, Trump cast doubt on plans for that meeting, which has been scheduled for June 12.\nRussia is considered an ally of North Korea, but has supported United Nations sanctions against it over Pyongyangâ€™s nuclear programme.\nLavrov accepted an invitation to visit North Korea last month.
