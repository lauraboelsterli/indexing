    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 6:20 AM / in 7 hours Iran says Syria has every right to defend itself against Israel: TV Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nANKARA (Reuters) - Iran on Friday supported Syria’s right to defend itself against aggression from Israel, state TV reported, accusing others of remaining silent over the attacks on Tehran’s key regional ally. Missile fire is seen from Damascus, Syria. REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki\n“Iran strongly condemns ...(Israel’s) attacks on Syria. The international community’s silence encourages Israel’s aggression. Syria has every right to defend itself,” the broadcaster quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi as saying.\nIsrael said it had attacked nearly all of Iran’s military infrastructure in Syria on Thursday after Iranian forces fired rockets at Israeli-held territory for the first time, in the most extensive military exchange ever between the two adversaries. Related Coverage\nThe confrontation came two days after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 multinational agreement aimed it curbing Iran’s nuclear program.\nTehran and its allied Shi’ite Muslim militias back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nSince its Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has refused to recognize Israel.
