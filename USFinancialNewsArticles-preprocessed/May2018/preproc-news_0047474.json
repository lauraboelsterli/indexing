    "text": "Newport Beach, CA, May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DPW Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, filed today its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 reporting the following results:\nGross sales increased $3,568,000 to $5,196,000 for growth of 219.16% compared to gross sales of $1,628,000 for the same quarter ending March 31, 2017. Sales increased by $1,976,000 from sales of $3,220,000 for growth of 61.4% for the immediate prior quarter ended December 31, 2017; Gross margins increased $685,000 to $1,393,000 compared to gross margins of $708,000 for the same quarter ended March 31, 2017. However, gross margin profitability decreased to 26.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 43.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in gross margin profitability was partially attributable to the lower margin revenue of $1,793,000 from MTIX, a related party, with gross margins of 21.9% combined with negative margins of (26.5%) on revenues of $237,000 at Super Crypto Mining. The negative margins are attributed to monthly recurring fixed costs at our colocation facilities which temporarily exceed the revenues from our mining operations while we place our miners in service; Total assets increased $7,983,000 to $38,493,000, an increase of 26.2%, compared to an increase of assets of $12,250,000 for total assets of $30,510,000 for the immediate prior quarter ending December 31, 2017, representing growth of 67.1%; Total stockholders’ equity increased $3,042,000 to $21,832,000 for growth of 16.2% compared to an increase of $11,328,000 for total equity of $18,790,000 for the immediate subsequent quarter ended December 31, 2017; Net Loss increased $5,065,000 to $6,059,000 compared to a net loss of $994,000 for the same quarter ending March 31, 2017; Other comprehensive loss was $4,715,000 due to a net unrealized loss on securities available-for-sale of $4,741,000 which was slightly offset by an adjustment for foreign currency translation of $26,000. This compared to other comprehensive income of $21,000 for the same quarter ended March 31, 2017; Non-Cash charges $4,152,000, an increase of $3,774,000 when compared to non-cash charges of $378,000 for the same quarter ended March 31, 2017; Raised capital from financing activities of $11,892,000, an increase of $10,795,000 compared to capital raised from financing activities of $1,097,000 for the same quarter ended March 31, 2017; The Company used capital of $9,765,000 for investment activities, an increase of $8,073,000 compared to capital used in investment activities of $692,000 for the same quarter ended March 31, 2017. A very large portion of this increase in investment activities was due to the Company’s continued support of Super Crypto Mining; The total value of cryptocurrencies held as of March 31, 2018 was $166,000 based on the fair value of the closing price for each cryptocurrency consisting of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ethereum; and The Company’s investment portfolio includes marketable securities totaling $1,938,000 and an investment of $7,594,000 in Avalanche International Corp dba MTIX International, Inc. The Company notes the value of their investments can severely fluctuate as they are reported quarterly on a “mark-to-the-market” basis which will include the volatility of the market.\nFor the period ending March 31, 2018, the Company recognized $1,793,000 from the $50,000,000 purchase order from MTIX, Ltd. The Company anticipates recognizing for the fiscal year 2018 a total revenue of between $6,400,000 to $8,000,000 from fulfillment of the MTIX purchase order.\nDPW noted that its subsidiary, Coolisys Technologies, has a current order backlog of $68,000,000 as of today, May 21, 2018 which includes all subsidiaries it recently has acquired.\nSuper Crypto Mining generated revenues of $237,000 for the period ending March 31, 2018. The revenue was severely affected by the Company’s transition to its new facility located in the Midwest and the declining value of the major cryptocurrencies during the period. The Company is currently mining $420,000 to $460,000 a month of cryptocurrencies or between $1,200,000 to $1,400,000 in value per quarter. The Company expects to have by July 31, 2018 an aggregate of 5,500 miners operational while the Company continues to pursue its goal of having 10,000 miners operational by the end of 2018.\nFor the second quarter ending June 30, 2018, the Company is providing guidance of $7,000,000 to $7,600,000 in gross revenues and maintains its total revenue projections for fiscal year 2018 of $44,000,000 to $49,000,000.\n“We are excited about the continued growth in the first quarter. We see a strong 2018, as we have said before, although we had some challenges with our new Midwest facility for Super Crypto Mining, it is now online and operational, and we are seeing strong results,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Ault added, “I am proud of the team, as we continue to deliver on all the promises we have made to the shareholders.”\nThe Company reminds shareholders, investors and all others interested that it is hosting today its conference call via webcast at 3:00 PM Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) to review these financial results reported, after the close of the U.S. financial markets.
