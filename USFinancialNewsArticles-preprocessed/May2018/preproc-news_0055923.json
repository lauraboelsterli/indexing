    "text": "MUNICH (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s Ningbo Jifeng Auto Parts Co Ltd ( 603997.SS ) is offering to guarantee jobs for 7-1/2 years as part of its proposed takeover of German automotive supplier Grammer ( GMMG.DE ), two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nGrammer said earlier on Tuesday that Ningbo Jifeng, which is already a major shareholder, was in talks to buy the German company, valuing it at about 772 million euros ($893 million).\nThe sources said the transaction was conditional on Ningbo Jifeng reaching 50 percent ownership of Grammer. It currently holds 25.51 percent. The Chinese group is not aiming for a domination agreement, which would require a stake of at least 75 percent, the sources also said.\nA Grammer spokesman declined to comment.\nReporting by Alexander Huebner; Writing by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Douglas Busvine\n ",
