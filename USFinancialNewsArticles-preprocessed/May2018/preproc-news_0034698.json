May 12, 2018; Miami, FL, USA; Miami Marlins second baseman Starlin Castro (13) is safe at first base on a hit as Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman (5) waits for the throw in the first inning at Marlins Park. Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports\nFreeman, who had his first career five-hit game on Thursday, finished 3-for-4 with three runs scored and three RBIs.\nNeither starting pitcher earned a decision. Braves rookie Michael Soroka allowed eight hits and five runs, one earned, in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out seven.\nMiami’s Jarlin Garcia allowed seven hits, two walks and five runs, four earned, in six innings.\nBraves reliever A.J. Minter (1-0) faced just two batters but got the win, pitching a third of an inning. May 12, 2018; Miami, FL, USA; Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman (5) celebrates his solo home run with starting pitcher Mike Foltynewicz (26) in the dugout in the first inning against the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park. Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports\nDrew Steckenrider (1-1) took the loss, allowing one hit, three walks and two runs in a third of an inning.\nAtlanta opened the scoring in the first on Freeman’s solo homer. He pulled a 93 mph fastball off the upper-deck façade in right-center.\nMiami tied the score 1-1 in the bottom of the first. With two outs and nobody on, Starlin Castro singled, advanced to third on Justin Bour’s single and scored on Brian Anderson’s RBI double off the wall in left. Anderson missed a three-run homer by two feet. Slideshow (7 Images)\nAtlanta took a 2-1 lead in the second, scoring an unearned run. With one out, Ender Inciarte drew a four-pitch walk. The next batter, Flowers, lofted a single to right, and Inciarte scored from first when Anderson tried to bare-hand the ball on a bounce.\nThe Braves extended their lead to 4-1 on Freeman’s two-run homer in the fifth. After a two-out single by Ronald Acuna, Freeman launched a 3-2 slider over the wall in center.\nMiami scored four runs in the fifth, taking a 5-4 lead. After two outs and with nobody on, Miami loaded the bases on singles by Martin Prado and Castro, and a Bour walk.\nThe Marlins scored their first run in the inning when Anderson’s dribbler to third baseman Jose Bautista was fumbled for an error. Derek Dietrich followed with a three-run double high off the wall in left.\nBautista atoned for his miscue in the sixth, pouncing on an 0-1 fastball and drilling it for his first homer as a member of the Braves, tying the score 5-5. He has 332 career homers, most of them with the Toronto Blue Jays.\nThe Braves forced Steckenrider and Junichi Tazawa to throw a combined 52 pitches in the eighth, drawing four walks, including RBI free passes by Flowers and Johan Camargo. Inciarte typified Atlanta’s approach in the inning, drawing a 13-pitch walk. All four walks in the inning came with two strikes.\nThe Braves blew the game open in the ninth on Charlie Culbertson’s RBI triple and Inciarte’s two-run homer.\n—Field Level Media",
