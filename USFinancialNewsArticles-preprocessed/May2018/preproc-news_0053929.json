    "text": "BAAR-ZUG, Switzerland, May 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Partners Group, the global private markets investment manager, is leading a consortium of investors in the acquisition of Techem GmbH (\"Techem\" or \"the Company\"), a global market leader in the provision of heat and water sub-metering services. Partners Group, which will invest on behalf of its private equity and infrastructure clients, will be joined in the acquisition by Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (\"CDPQ\") and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (\"Ontario Teachers'\") as well as Techem's management team. The consortium is acquiring Techem from Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund 2, which acquired 100% of the Company in 2008. The transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, values Techem at an enterprise value of EUR 4.6 billion.\nFounded in 1952 and headquartered in Eschborn, Germany, Techem caters to a global client base of real estate operators and private home owners from its 150 branches in more than 20 countries. Its principal Energy Services business provides services and devices for the metering and billing of energy and water, plus device sales, hire and maintenance. In addition, its Energy Contracting business delivers heat, cooling, flow energy and light, as well as the planning, set-up, financing and operation of energy systems and energy monitoring and controlling services. Techem is the market leader in Germany, the largest sub-metering market in the world, as well as in an additional 13 European markets. Techem solutions today account for 6.9 million tons of CO2 emission savings per year, thus contributing to global climate protection objectives. In the 2016/17 financial year, Techem's 3,640 employees serviced 11 million apartments worldwide, recording sales of EUR 782.7 million.\nFollowing the close of the acquisition, Partners Group together with CDPQ and Ontario Teachers' will work with Techem's management team, led by Frank Hyldmar, to support the development of the Company in existing markets and expand its presence geographically. One value creation initiative will focus on the introduction of new technologies to Techem's strong existing platform and installed base to enhance the customer experience. There will also be a continued focus on customer services and quality excellence programs as the Company grows.\nFrank Hyldmar, CEO of Techem, comments: \"A decade after delisting from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Techem can show a solid track record of growth. However, even with our market-leading position today, we believe there is plenty of future growth potential for our Company and look forward to working with Partners Group, an experienced private equity and infrastructure investor, as well as its strategic partners CDPQ and Ontario Teachers', to realize our ambitions and deliver an exceptional service to our customers around the world.\"\nJürgen Diegruber, Partner, Private Equity Europe, Partners Group, adds: \"Techem is a market leader in a growing industry with strong tailwinds. With increasing global awareness of energy usage, Techem's products and services are a key element of the fight against energy waste, enabling heating and energy supplies to be managed in a more precise and sustainable manner. We look forward to working with Frank Hyldmar and his talented team, as well as with our partners CDPQ and Ontario Teachers', to expand Techem's market-leading position.\"\nStéphane Etroy, Executive Vice-President and Head of Private Equity, CDPQ, says: \"Energy efficiency, which is at the center of Techem's offering, is key to building a sustainable future. Given CDPQ's desire to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, investing in Techem is a very attractive opportunity for us. Techem's business model positions it to benefit from growing urbanization and demand for housing energy efficiency, over the long term. We are confident that together with Techem's solid management team, Partners Group, and Ontario Teachers', the company will continue on its path of success.\"\nJo Taylor, Senior Managing Director International, Ontario Teachers', comments: \"Techem is a well-positioned business that looks set for continued domestic and international growth. It serves the growing, global need for energy conservation and empowers users in multi-occupancy properties to have greater control over their own energy consumption by providing accurate billing. Ontario Teachers' has a strong track record in the energy and infrastructure sectors, as well as significant experience in the sub-metering space and we are delighted to partner with Techem's innovative management team and with Partners Group and CDPQ.\"\nAbout Partners Group\nPartners Group is a global private markets investment management firm with over EUR 62 billion (USD 74 billion) in investment programs under management in private equity, private real estate, private infrastructure and private debt.
