    "text": "1 COMMENTS The market for riskier corporate bonds is picking up again, showing the resilience of investor appetite for high-yielding junk debt in the face of rising Treasury yields, large fund outflows and volatility in stocks.\nAfter two months of negative returns, bonds rated speculative grade, or “junk,” by credit-rating firms have returned 0.6% in April, counting price changes and interest payments, according to Bloomberg Barclays data, compared with negative 1.3% for investment-grade bonds.\nThe average junk-bond yield was 3.33 percentage points above the comparable Treasury yield on Wednesday, up from a postcrisis low of 3.11 percentage points on Jan. 11 but down from its recent peak of 3.69 percentage points on Feb. 9.\nA shrinking spread signals greater confidence in the credit quality of the bonds, which have sometimes picked up signs of economic stress earlier than other assets. A strong and stable junk-bond market has been the norm in recent years, but its performance of late is notable given the obstacles it has faced.\nSince the end of last year, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has climbed to around 2.96% from 2.41%. When Treasury yields rise, yields on corporate debt generally must rise as well—as their prices fall—because even the strongest companies carry greater default risk than the U.S. government. Rising rates can also enhance the appeal of Treasurys relative to corporate bonds and spook investors, leading to cash outflows that can further drag down the market.\nSo far this year, investors have pulled more than $14 billion from high-yield mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. Along with the threat from rising interest rates, analysts have attributed the outlflows to broad concerns about the value of riskier assets.\nDue to their risk profile, junk bonds often move in tandem with major U.S. stock indexes, which have swung sharply this year between gains and losses. They also tend to be less volatile than stocks, thanks in part to the relatively large coupons that they pay out, which can offset price declines.\nInvestors and analysts say that the outflows from publicly accessible high-yield funds have likely been mitigated by stable or even increased demand from institutional sources, such as pension funds, that see opportunity in rising yields.\nHigh-yield bonds have also gotten an assist from a somewhat unlikely source: leveraged loans, which are the secured, floating-rate debt often issued by the same junk-rated companies that borrow in the bond market.\nThough the leveraged loans can sometimes compete for investor dollars with high-yield bonds, the two assets can also help each other. This year, retail investors have poured more than $4 billion into loan funds, highlighting the appeal of their adjustable coupons while interest rates are rising. Demand from other investors, such as managers of collateralized loan obligations, has also been robust, creating an incentive for companies to borrow in the loan market instead of the bond market.\nNet supply of high-yield bonds—or total new issuance excluding bonds that were used to refinance old debt—has dropped this year to around $25 billion from $30 billion through April of last year and $68 billion three years ago, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. That means that even as demand for junk bonds has fallen, supply has decreased as well, creating a market that is more or less in balance.\nThrough April 25, bonds accounted for 19.6% of net issuance of syndicated high-yield debt, according to LCD, compared with 23.4% last year and 49.9% in 2010.\n“If you’re an issuer who was going to go to the bond market,” it’s easy to say, “I’ll just do a bigger loan, because there’s a massive amount of demand for loan paper,” said Andrew Susser, head of high yield at MacKay Shields.\nIn addition, Mr. Susser said, many junk-bond investors also hold loans, which they can sell if bond prices are falling and they want an alternative way of raising cash to meet redemptions or buy new bonds.\nIn the meantime, high-yield investors have generally been welcoming to the relatively small number of companies that have sold new bonds this year. In recent sessions, two debut issuers, Jagged Peak Energy LLC and WeWork Cos., both increased the size of their bond deals to match strong demand, while Netflix Inc., a frequent borrower, upped a sale to $1.9 billion from $1.5 billion.\nWrite to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com",
