Photo: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\nGerman auto parts manufacturer Schaeffler Technologies AG & Co. KG both benefits and suffers from higher steel prices in the U.S., the company’s finance chief said.\nThe Herzogenaurach-based maker of valve trains, belt drives and wheel bearings said its U.S. suppliers have raised their prices after President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum drove up the cost for the metals in the U.S.\nThe tariffs took effect at the end of March and apply to several steel exporting countries, including Japan and China. Schaeffler operates eight factories and three research and development centers in the U.S. and sources the majority of its raw materials and components locally.\n“Part of the rise in prices has been passed on to us,” said Chief Financial Officer Dietmar Heinrich Tuesday in an interview with CFO Journal. He declined to provide specific figures.\nBut the company also expects some benefits from the run up in regional metals prices. Schaeffler forecasts to make more money from its sales of scrap metal – the manufacturing by-products such as steel chippings. “The price for this [scrap metal] will rise because of higher steel prices,” said Mr. Heinrich.\nSchaeffler has also negotiated price variation clauses for several components it buys from U.S. suppliers which help protect it from some of the effects of the higher steel prices, said Mr. Heinrich.\nThe company can pass some of the increase in costs on to its consumers — large international auto makers — as its competitors are facing the same challenge, said Jürgen Pieper, senior advisor at B. Metzler seel. Sohn & Co. Holding AG, a German bank. “The impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs will be neutral over time,” said Mr. Pieper.\nSchaeffler plans to localize its production further to mitigate currency risks and to limit its exposure to potential new tariffs, Mr. Heinrich said. Producing locally also helps the company react faster to changing customer needs, he added. Schaeffler is expanding its existing sites in Vietnam and the U.S. and is also building a new factory in Xiangtan, China. The company is investing €1.4 billion ($1.67 billion) on capital expenditure projects this year, Mr. Heinrich said.\nThe threat of new trade tariffs — as suggested by the U.S., the EU and China — is reinforcing an existing trend to move production closer to where customers are based, said Mr. Pieper.\nSchaeffler is not planning to reduce its investments because of the uncertainties around trade, said Mr. Heinrich. “We still have a positive outlook,” he said. The company plans to invest 6% to 8% of annual revenue per year. In the first quarter, the figure was 8.6%.\nSchaeffler generated net income of €240 million on revenue of €3.6 billion in the first quarter, slightly lower than during the prior year quarter when it reported net income of €279 million on revenue of €3.5 billion.\nShare this: IMPORT TARIFFS Previous CFO Moves: Snap Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte The Excess Cash Dilemma: Charles Holley, CFO-in-Residence Having excess cash from repatriation and lower corporate tax rates as a result of tax reform is a welcome opportunity for many CFOs. Deciding how to put it to work, however, could be challenging, depending on a company’s strategy and resources, and various stakeholder interests, says Charles Holley, independent senior advisor to Deloitte. He discusses issues for CFOs to consider when forming a strategy for excess cash, such as the organization’s capacity to handle additional investment, and the importance of communicating the plan to both external and internal stakeholders.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
