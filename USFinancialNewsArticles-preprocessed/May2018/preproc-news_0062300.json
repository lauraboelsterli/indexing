    "text": "WellCare Health Plans said on Tuesday it would buy Meridian Health Plans of Michigan and Illinois for $2.5 billion in cash to become the top Medicaid provider in those states.\nThe deal will help WellCare add about 1.07 million Medicaid members in Michigan and Illinois and includes the acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager MeridianRx, WellCare said in a statement.\n\"This transaction strategically aligns with our focus on government-sponsored health plans...,\" WellCare Chief Executive Officer Ken Burdick said in a statement.\nMeridian's businesses are expected to generate more than $4.3 billion in total revenue in 2018, WellCare said.\nThe deal comes as health-care payers and pharmacies are responding to a shifting landscape, including changes in the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com.\nIn December, U.S. drugstore chain operator CVS Health agreed to buy U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc for $69 billion, seeking to tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower-cost medical services in pharmacies.\nU.S. retailer Walmart was reported to have been in early-stage talks in March with health insurer Humana Inc about developing closer ties.\nThe WellCare-Meridian deal would add 40 to 50 cents per share to WellCare's adjusted earnings in 2019, 70-80 cents per share in 2020, and more than $1.00 per share in 2021.\nWellCare said it expected to fund the transaction through cash on hand, as well as from issuing new equity of up to $1.2 billion and debt of up to $1 billion.\nThe company also said it had secured $2.5 billion in committed bridge financing",
