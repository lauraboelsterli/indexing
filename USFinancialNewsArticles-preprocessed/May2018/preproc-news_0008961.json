Sunesis has built an experienced cancer drug development organization committed to improving the lives of people with cancer. The Company is focused on advancing its novel kinase-inhibitor pipeline, with an emphasis on establishing proof of concept that its oral non-covalent BTK-inhibitor vecabrutinib is effective in ibrutinib-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Vecabrutinib is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b/2 study in adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other B-cell malignancies who have progressed after prior therapies. Beyond the development of vecabrutinib, the Company has two other kinase inhibitor programs, including the Takeda-partnered pan-RAF inhibitor TAK-580, which is in clinical trials for solid tumors, and Sunesisâ€™ proprietary preclinical PDK1 inhibitor SNS-510, which is in preclinical development with an IND submission planned in 2019. PDK1 is a master kinase that activates other kinases important to cell growth and survival including members of the AKT, PKC, RSK and SGK families.\nFor additional information on Sunesis, please visit www.sunesis.com .\nSUNESIS and the logos are trademarks of Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nInvestor and Media Inquiries: Maeve Conneighton Willie Quinn Argot Partners Sunesis Pharmaceuticals Inc. 212-600-1902 650-266-3716\nSource:Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
