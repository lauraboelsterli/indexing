    "text": "BRENTWOOD, Tenn., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AAC Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AAC) today announced financial results for the first 2018 and reiterates its previously issued full year 2018 guidance.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational and Financial Highlights:\n(All comparisons are to the comparable prior-year period, unless otherwise noted)\nTotal revenue increased 18% to $78.5 million on a comparable accounting basis (increased 7% as reported) Average daily inpatient revenue (ADR) increased 46% to $933 Total average daily census (ADC) increased to 1,027 compared with 956 Outpatient visits increased 83% to 30,313 Net loss attributable to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders was $0.2 million, or $(0.01) per diluted common share Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $15.1 million (see non-GAAP reconciliation herein) Adjusted earnings per diluted common share was $0.13 (see non-GAAP reconciliation herein)\n\"We are off to a solid start in 2018,\" said Michael Cartwright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AAC Holdings, Inc. \"A highlight for us this quarter was the closing of our acquisition of AdCare on March 1, and the integration since then has been going well. We also continue to be disciplined in improving our operational efficiencies, and I'm happy to see DSOs continuing to trend down to less than 100 days.\"\nAdoption of New Revenue Recognition Standard\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ASC Topic 606), a replacement of Revenue Recognition ASC Topic 605. The Company adopted ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Under ASC Topic 606, the provision for doubtful accounts, which historically was reported as an operating expense, is now reported as a direct reduction to revenue effective January 1, 2018. This change in presentation reduced revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and did not have an effect on net income or earnings per share. As the Company adopted ASC Topic 606 using the modified retrospective approach, prior year periods were not recast and as such, revenues as reported are not comparable to the current year presentation. For purposes of this release, we have applied our adoption of ASC Topic 606 to the prior year period. We believe this allows for an accurate comparison of prior period revenue. Where we have used language such as \"less the provision for doubtful accounts,\" this indicates a comparison of periods that reflects our adoption of ASC Topic 606.\nAdCare Acquisition\nOn March 1, 2018, AAC acquired AdCare, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"AdCare\"). AdCare offers treatment for drug and alcohol addiction and includes, among other things, a 114-bed hospital and 5 outpatient centers in Massachusetts, as well as a 59-bed residential inpatient treatment center and 2 outpatient centers in Rhode Island. AdCare was purchased for total consideration of $85.0 million, subject to adjustments.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nAAC breaks down its revenues between client related revenue and non-client related revenue. Client related revenue includes: (1) inpatient treatment facility services and related professional services; (2) outpatient facility services, related professional services and sober living services; and (3) client related diagnostic services, which includes point of care drug testing and client related diagnostic laboratory services. Non-client related revenue includes marketing and diagnostic services provided to third parties as well as addiction services provided to individuals in the criminal justice system.\nTotal revenue on a comparable accounting basis (i.e., less the provision for doubtful accounts) increased 18% to $78.5 million compared with $66.5 million in the same period in the prior year. Total revenue as reported increased 7%.\nInpatient treatment facility revenue, less the provision for doubtful accounts, increased 40% to $64.9 million compared with $46.3 million in the same period in the prior year. Average daily inpatient revenue increased 46% to $933 compared with $640 in the same period in the prior year.\nOutpatient and sober living facility revenue, less the provision for doubtful accounts, increased 60% to $8.4 million compared with $5.3 million in the same period in the prior year. Average revenue per outpatient visit (ARV) decreased 13% to $278 compared with $318 in the same period in the prior year.\nClient related diagnostic services revenue, less the provision for doubtful accounts, decreased 80% to $2.6 million compared with $13.0 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in client related diagnostic services is a result of previously anticipated lower reimbursements combined with a shift in the mix of client related diagnostic services from higher reimbursed tests to lower reimbursed tests.\nNon-client related revenue, less the provision for doubtful accounts, increased 40% to $2.6 million compared with $1.8 million in the same period in the prior year.\nNet loss attributable to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders was $0.2 million, or $(0.01) per diluted common share, compared with $0.6 million, or $(0.03) per diluted common share, in the prior-year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $15.1 million compared with $12.7 million for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted net income attributable to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders was $3.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted common share, for both the current and prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders and adjusted earnings per diluted common share are non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this release.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nAs of March 31, 2018, AAC Holdings' balance sheet reflected cash and cash equivalents of $14.3 million, net property and equipment of $169.7 million and total debt of $303.8 million, net of debt issuance costs of $9.4 million.\nCash flows used in operations totaled $19.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 and included a $25.0 million payment related to the settlement of the Tennessee class action litigation matter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $7.3 million.\n2018 Outlook\nAAC maintains its previously issued guidance, which includes AdCare from the March 1, 2018 acquisition date, as follows:\nFull Year 2018 Guidance\n(in millions, except per share data)\nTotal Revenues\n$325 - $340\nInpatient treatment facility revenue\n$262 - $266\nOutpatient and sober living facility revenue\n$40 - $46\nClient related diagnostic services revenue\n$12 - $15\nNon-client related revenue\n$11 - $13\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$68 - $72\nAdjusted Earnings per Diluted Common Share\n$0.75 - $0.80\nThe Company expects an annual effective tax rate of 24% to 26% and diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding of approximately 24.5 million for the year.\nThis outlook above does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, transaction-related costs, litigation settlement or expenses related to legal defenses.\nWith respect to the \"2018 Outlook\" above, reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted common share guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts. This inability results from the inherent difficulty in forecasting generally and quantifying certain projected amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations. In particular, sufficient information is not available to calculate certain adjustments required for such reconciliations, including de novo start-up and other expense and acquisition-related expenses. We expect these adjustments may have a potentially significant impact on future GAAP financial results.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. CT to further discuss these results. The number to call for this interactive teleconference is 412-542-4144. A replay of the conference call will be available through May 10, 2018, by dialing 412-317-0088 and entering the replay access code, 10119636. The live audio webcast of the Company's quarterly conference call will also be available online in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at ir.americanaddictioncenters.org .\nAbout American Addiction Centers\nAmerican Addiction Centers is a leading provider of inpatient and outpatient substance abuse treatment services.

Management believes the Non-GAAP Disclosures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. We believe the Non-GAAP Disclosures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results. The Non-GAAP Disclosures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The items excluded from the Non-GAAP Disclosures are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other financial statement items presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Because the Non-GAAP Disclosures are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, the Non-GAAP Disclosures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, income tax benefit, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, stock-based compensation and related tax reimbursements, litigation settlement and California matter related expense, acquisition-related expense (which includes professional services for accounting, legal, valuation services and licensing expenses), de novo start-up and other expenses, employee severance expense and facility closure operating losses and expense.\nAAC HOLDINGS, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES\nUnaudited\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to AAC Holdings, Inc.
