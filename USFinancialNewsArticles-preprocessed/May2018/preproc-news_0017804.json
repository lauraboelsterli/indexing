Premiere of “Avengers: Infinity War” - Arrivals - Los Angeles, California, U.S., 23/04/2018 - Actor Robert Downey Jr. poses with fans. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\nDisney and Marvel’s latest collaboration earned $112.5 million from 4,474 locations in its second frame. The 56 percent decline was just enough to top the record previously held by fellow Marvel title “Black Panther,” which made $111.6 million in its second weekend. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” holds the prize for biggest second weekend, with a mighty $149 million in 2015. Only five films have ever hit the $100 million-mark in their second weekends.\nIn just North America, the superhero mashup has made $450.8 million. Among “Infinity War’s” numerous accomplishments is being the fastest film to gross $1 billion, in just 11 days. And the film has yet to open in China.\nOne of three weekend releases opening in “Infinity War’s” almighty wake is “Overboard,” anchoring in the second spot with a solid $14 million in 1,623 theaters. The MGM and Lionsgate Pantelion remake of Goldie Hawn-Kurt Russell’s classic romcom of the same name now stars Anna Faris and Eugenio Derbez. That three-day estimate washes in slightly ahead of Derbez’s last leading role, “How to be a Latin Lover,” which bowed with $12 million in 2017. “Overboard” is currently averaging a bleak 30 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. The audience score, however, is faring better with a 76 percent.\nSlipping to No. 3 in its fifth weekend is Paramount Picture’s “A Quiet Place.” John Krasinski’s horror thriller made $7.5 million in 3,413 locations, bringing its domestic total to an impressive $159.8 million. The third weekend of Amy Schumer’s “I Feel Pretty” secured the fourth slot with $4.9 million from 3,232 theaters. Its North American tally currently sits at $37.8 million. Rounding out the top five is Dwayne Johnson’s “Rampage.” The Warner Bros. film grossed $4.6 million in 3,151 locations. In four weeks, its domestic total is $84.7 million. Premiere of “Avengers: Infinity War” - Arrivals - Los Angeles, California, U.S., 23/04/2018 - Actress Elizabeth Olsen. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n“Black Panther” likely saw another boost from “Infinity War.” The Chadwick Boseman-starrer landed in sixth place, taking in $3.2 million from 1,641 locations in its 12th weekend. To date, “Black Panther” has made $693 million in North America.\nFocus Features’“Tully,” with Charlize Theron, Mackenzie Davis, Mark Duplass, and Ron Livingston, debuted with $3 million in 1,353 theaters. The comedy-drama directed by Jason Reitman and written by Diablo Cody has garnered a solid 89% certified rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nThe final weekend opener, Electric Entertainment’s “Bad Samaritan” launched with $1.6 million from 2,007 locations. Dean Delvin’s thriller starring David Tennant, Robert Sheehan, and Kerry Condon has a B- CinemaScore, along with a 56% critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Premiere of “Avengers: Infinity War” - Arrivals - Los Angeles, California, U.S., 23/04/2018 - Actress Evangeline Lilly poses with fans. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\nThanks primarily to “Infinity War,” the year to date box office is up 5.2 percent, according to comScore.",
