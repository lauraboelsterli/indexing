    "text": "President Donald Trump on Friday said the date and location have been set for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , which would be announced soon, and hinted at progress in winning the release of three Americans held in North Korea .\nThe White House has said the first meeting between sitting U.S. and North Korean leaders could take place in the coming weeks. Trump is expected to push for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.\n\"We're having very substantive talks with North Korea and a lot of things have already happened with respect to the (U.S.) hostages. I think you're going to see very good things,\" Trump told reporters.\nThe U.S. government is looking into reports that three Americans arrested in recent years in North Korea had recently been relocated from a labor camp to a hotel near Pyongyang, as expectations grow that they will be released before the summit.\nTrump said this week that the demilitarized zone, or DMZ, between North and South Korea would be an excellent venue for the planned summit, but that Singapore was also a possible site.\nThe Peace House at the DMZ was the venue for a meeting last month between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nTrump also told reporters on Friday that he was not considering reducing the U.S. military's presence in South Korea as part of the negotiations.\n\"Troops are not on the table,\" he said before a flight to Dallas, Texas, where he will address the National Rifle Association.",
