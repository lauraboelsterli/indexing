    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 9:00 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago UPDATE 2-LendingClub reports 1st qtr earnings above expectations Reuters Staff\n(Adds details from earnings call)\nBy Diptendu Lahiri and Anna Irrera\nMay 8 (Reuters) - U.S. online lender LendingClub Corp beat analyst expectations for earnings in the first quarter on Tuesday, as it originated more loans through its platform and transaction fees rose.\nExcluding one-time items, LendingClub earned 1 cent per share, while analysts on average had expected a loss of 1 cent per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nLendingClub’s transaction fees rose 12.7 percent in the first quarter ended March 31, helping lift total revenue by 22 percent to $151.7 million.\nThe San Francisco-based startup originated $2.3 billion in loans in the period, up 18 percent from a year earlier.\nThe company took in $12.7 million in revenue from the sale of loans, compared with $1.9 million a year earlier.\n“We are pleased with our position as we start 2018,” Chief Executive Officer Scott Sanborn said on a call with analysts. “Last year was a time of rebuilding and transforming LendingClub.”\nLendingClub, one of the largest companies known as peer-to-peer lenders, runs a website where consumers can apply for loans that are funded either by individual investors or by institutions such as banks.\nThe company has been restoring its business since May 2016 when it acknowledged issues including the way it had sold loans to an investor, leading to the ouster of its founder and then chief executive.\nAs with other online lenders, it has also been facing concerns from investors about the quality of its loans and its ability to grow at a fast pace.\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued the company last month for allegedly overcharging consumers and misleading them on hidden fees.\nLendingClub said that including $17 million of expenses related to ongoing legal costs from government investigations, its net loss for the first quarter widened from the same period last year to $31.2 million.\nSanborn said the company could not yet indicate what changes to its business might result from the lawsuit. “We made pretty clear in our public response, we believe our practices are currently in compliance,” Sanborn said.\nThe company on Tuesday also maintained its 2018 revenue forecast of between $680 million and $705 million.\nShares of the company rose around 1 percent to $2.85 in after-hours trading on Tuesday.
