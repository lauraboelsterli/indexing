A Volkswagen logo is pictured during the Volkswagen Group's annual general meeting in Berlin, Germany, May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nBild, citing company sources, said that an internal commission found no wrongdoing and that he could return.\nA spokesman for VW said a decision had not been made.\nIn January, it came to light that Volkswagen, BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) funded an organisation called European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT) to commission the tests.\nAs head of sustainability topics at VW group, Steg was in charge of the EUGT.
