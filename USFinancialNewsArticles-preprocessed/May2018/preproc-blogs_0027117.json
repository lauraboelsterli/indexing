    "text": "GRAINS-Wheat edges higher but gains muted ahead of USDA report Published 6 Hours Ago Reuters\nSYDNEY, May 10 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures edged higher on Thursday after touching a more than one-week low in the previous session, although trade remained cautious ahead of a widely watched U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast later in the session.\nFUNDAMENTALS\n* The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.3 percent at $5.12 a bushel by 0101 GMT, having closed down 0.6 percent on Wednesday when prices hit a low of $5.06-1/4 a bushel - the lowest since May 1.\n* The most active soybean futures were unchanged at $10.15-3/4 a bushel, having closed down 0.4 percent on Wednesday.\n* The most active corn futures were up 0.1 percent at $4.03-1/4 a bushel, having closed down 0.1 percent in the previous session.\n* The USDA is due to issue its May supply/demand report on Thursday.\n* Analysts on average estimate U.S. 2018/19 world wheat ending stocks at 269.18 million tonnes, down just slightly from a record-high 271 million at the end of 2017/18.\n* Analysts on average expect the USDA on Thursday to lower its forecasts of domestic and global 2017/18 soybean ending stocks.\n* Analysts expect little change in the USDA's forecast of 2017/18 ending stocks for corn from its April figure near 2.18 billion bushels.\nMARKET NEWS\n* The dollar held firm on Thursday after the 10-year U.S. bond yield rose back to the psychologically important 3 percent mark and investors looked to U.S. consumer price data due later to show an acceleration in inflation. Oil prices rose about 3 percent on Wednesday and hit fresh 3-1/2 year highs after a bigger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. oil inventories extended gains from the United States' decision to quit a nuclear deal with Iran.\n* Wall Street surged on Wednesday as surging oil prices boosted energy stocks following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision the previous day to quit a nuclear agreement with Iran.\nDATA AHEAD (GMT)\n0130 China Consumer prices Apr 0130 China Producer prices Apr 1230 U.S. Consumer prices Apr 1230 U.S. Weekly jobless claims\nGrains prices at 0101 GMT\nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 512.00 1.50 +0.29% -0.49% 495.46 58 CBOT corn 403.25 0.50 +0.12% +0.00% 397.34 59 CBOT soy 1015.75 0.00 +0.00% -0.44% 1044.58 37 CBOT rice 12.70 $0.03 +0.20% -0.47% $12.99 31 WTI crude 71.52 $0.38 +0.53% +3.56% $67.12 70\nCurrencies\nEuro/dlr $1.185 $0.000 -0.03% -0.13% USD/AUD 0.7456 -0.001 -0.08% +0.08%\nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
