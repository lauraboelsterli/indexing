    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday said Republican President Donald Trump’s cancellation of a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was good for the head of the reclusive nation, saying Trump had legitimized a “thug” and the head of a “police state.”\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) leads Democratic members of Congress during their \"Better Deal\" platform rally at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst “I think it’s a good thing for Kim Jong Un,” Nancy Pelosi told reporters. “He got global recognition and regard. He’s the big winner. And when he got this letter from the president saying, ‘OK, never mind,’ he must be having a giggle fit right now, there, in North Korea.”\nReporting by Lisa Lambert and Amanda Becker; Editing by Bill Trott\n ",
