Kline’s deep experience with Kohl’s gives him valuable insights into the concerns of large employers, as well as the needs of a diverse and dispersed workforce.\n“Having been in their shoes, I understand the challenges that large employers face with their benefits strategies and particularly workforce engagement,” Kline shares. “I look forward to learning about each of our clients’ culture and strategy, and helping them shape programs that meet the needs of their associates, while controlling costs and eliminating waste using our data-driven guidance platform.”\nKline will unify Evive’s Client Strategy, Client Success, and Client Operations teams and align their work with each client’s success metrics. Guided by a singular vision, these teams can now ensure a more coordinated service experience to Evive customers at the executive, strategy, and operations levels.\nEvive President and CEO Prashant Srivastava notes, “We’ve had the pleasure of working with Allen during his tenure at Kohl’s. His approach is empathetic and strategic, and he’s proven that benefits programs can both empower and bring tremendous value to employees and employers alike.” Srivastava continues, “At Evive, we work toward this sort of win/win with all of our clients.”\n“Allen is unique in that he operates in the worlds of thinking and doing,” adds Executive Chairman Peter Saravis . “Not only will Allen enhance day-to-day service levels with our client-delivery teams, but his thought leadership in benefits helps our clients at the highest strategic levels as well.”\nAt Kohl’s, Kline led benefits initiatives including health plans, well-being, retirement, work/life, and onsite child development centers. A graduate of Purdue University, he holds a Bachelor of Science in Retail Management.\nAbout Evive\nEvive changes how people use benefits.
