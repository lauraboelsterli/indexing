REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\nAhead of the first detailed discussion among ministers of the thorny issue of customs arrangements with the European Union, some Conservative lawmakers have demanded that May drop one of her proposed solutions.\n“I think we’ll have a useful first discussion today, but then I’d expect we’d come to a conclusion over the next few weeks,” Minister for the Cabinet Office David Lidington told Sky News.\nHe said that May would stay on as prime minister even if she lost a vote on the customs arrangement.
