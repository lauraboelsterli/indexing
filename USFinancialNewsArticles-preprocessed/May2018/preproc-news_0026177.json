    "text": "SAO PAULO, May 10 (Reuters) - Brazilian food company BRF SA on Thursday reported a first-quarter net loss of 114 million reais ($32.11 million), missing a consensus estimate for net income of 14.99 million reais, as the company continued to reel from fallout from a food safety scandal that prompted trade bans and led it to reduce production capacity.\nBRF, Brazilâ€™s largest chicken processor, also missed a consensus estimate for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operating profit, which came in at 783 million reais, some 7 percent below forecast. ($1 = 3.5506 reais) (Reporting by Ana Mano Editing by Leslie Adler)\n ",
