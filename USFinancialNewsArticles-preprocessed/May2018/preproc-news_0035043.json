    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The Malaysian government’s exposure as of October 2015 if state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) defaulted on its loans was 20.3 billion ringgit ($5.12 billion) before interest, a declassified auditor’s report made available on Wednesday showed.\nFILE PHOTO: A man walks past a 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) billboard at the funds flagship Tun Razak Exchange development in Kuala Lumpur, in this March 1, 2015 file photo. REUTERS/Olivia Harris/File Photo The report by the Malaysian auditor general was declassified on Tuesday. A summary that was made available at the time said senior officials at scandal-plagued 1MDB withheld information from its board and took some decisions without the board’s approval.\nReporting by Rozanna Latiff and Emily Chow; Writing by Liz Lee; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
