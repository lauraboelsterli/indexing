    "text": "Jose Berrios pitched eight strong innings, Logan Morrison drew a bases-loaded walk to bring in the go-ahead run, and the host Minnesota Twins defeated the Detroit Tigers 4-2 at Target Field on Monday night.\nBerrios (5-4) held the Tigers to two runs on three hits in eight innings while walking two and striking out nine. He didn’t allow a hit after the third inning. Fernando Rodney collected his 10th save.\nMax Kepler had a two-run double to lead the offense. Robbie Grossman scored a run and knocked in another.\nNicholas Castellanos led the Tigers with a solo homer and run-scoring single.\nBlaine Hardy, making his second major-league start, allowed two runs on seven hits in five innings. He struck out four while not walking a batter.\nEduardo Escobar drew a one-walk in the eighth against Daniel Stumpf (1-3). He advanced to third on Eddie Rosario’s double. Following an intentional walk, Stumpf walked Morrison on four pitches to give Minnesota a 3-2 lead. Grossman’s sacrifice fly off Warwick Saupold provided the Twins with an insurance run.\nCastellanos gave the Tigers a quick lead with his one-out homer in the first. His fifth long ball of the season sailed over the center-field wall.\nDetroit made it 2-0 in the third. Jose Iglesias led off with a double and Dixon Machado walked before Leonys Martin hit into a 6-4-3 double play. Castellanos then smacked a single to center, bringing Iglesias home.\nThe Twins were held in check until the fifth, when they broke through with two runs. Hardy retired two batters after Grossman reached on a leadoff single. Brian Dozier then ripped a double, putting two runners in scoring position.\nKepler followed with another double to right, tying the score at 2-all. Eduardo Escobar appeared to give the Twins a 3-2 advantage when he followed with a single to left to bring home Kepler. After replay review, the call was overturned and Kepler was ruled out at the plate.\nMinnesota had a runner on third with two out in the seventh but reliever Louis Coleman retired Dozier on a groundout.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
