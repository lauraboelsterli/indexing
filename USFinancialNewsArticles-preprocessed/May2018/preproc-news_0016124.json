    "text": "MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The shareholders of Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) (\"Gannett\" or the \"company\") elected Chairman John Jeffry Louis, President and CEO Robert J. Dickey, Matthew W. Barzun, John E. Cody, Stephen W. Coll, Donald E. Felsinger, Lila Ibrahim, Lawrence S. Kramer, Tony A. Prophet, Debra A. Sandler and Chloe R. Sladden to the Board of Directors at the annual meeting held today at the company’s headquarters, with each director receiving at least 98% of the votes cast. The directors were elected to serve one-year terms ending at Gannett’s annual meeting in 2019.\nGannett’s shareholders also overwhelmingly approved the other three proposals presented at the meeting:\nratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young as the company’s independent accounting firm for the 2018 fiscal year; approval of an amendment to the company’s 2015 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan; and approval, on an advisory basis, of the company’s executive compensation program.\nThe Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share, payable on June 25, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 11, 2018.\nIn addition, the Board approved a $100 million, three-year stock repurchase program, which replaces the program approved in July 2015. “We are pleased that the Board approved this new program. As with the prior authorization, we expect to use this program to buy back shares opportunistically to return value to shareholders from time to time as market conditions warrant,” said Robert J.
