The volume traded was 14.00 billion as of the last full trading day. ** As of 0424 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 22.43 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 13.33 as of the last full trading day, while the dividend yield was 2.3 percent.
