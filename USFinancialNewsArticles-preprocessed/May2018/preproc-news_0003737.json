The dividend will be paid on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2018.\nThe declaration and payment of any future dividend will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and contractual restrictions. Future dividends are expected to be funded by cash balances and future cash flows from operations.\n2018 Guidance\nThe 2018 guidance ranges for the year remain unchanged from our fourth quarter release and are as follows:\n2018 Guidance Range\nRevenues $45.0 to $46.0 billion Adjusted EBITDA $8.45 to $8.75 billion EPS (diluted) $8.50 to $9.00 per diluted share Capital Expenditures Approximately $3.5 billion The Company’s 2018 guidance contains a number of assumptions, including:\n2018 guidance for EPS (diluted) includes an estimated $110 million income tax benefit, or $0.31 per diluted share, for excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes. The timing and amounts related to employee equity award settlements are difficult to project and may vary from this estimate. 2018 guidance reflects the sale of the Company’s Oklahoma facilities which closed February 1, 2018. These facilities had annual revenues of approximately $1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $180 million in 2017. 2018 guidance includes an estimated impact of $1.25 earnings per diluted share related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 2018 guidance excludes any acquisitions that have not been completed as of March 31, 2018. 2018 guidance excludes any hurricane insurance recoveries the Company may receive. 2018 guidance excludes any changes in our estimates of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. 2018 guidance excludes the impact of items such as, but not limited to, gains or losses on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs and impairments of long-lived assets.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table reconciling forecasted net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to forecasted Adjusted EBITDA is included in this release.\nThe Company’s guidance is based on current plans and expectations and is subject to a number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks, including those set forth below in the Company’s “Forward-Looking Statements.”\nEarnings Conference Call\nHCA will host a conference call for investors at 10:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time today.

Forward-looking statements include the Company’s financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018, as well as other statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words like “may,” “believe,” “will,” “expect,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “initiative” or “continue.” These forward-looking statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to a number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks, many of which are beyond our control, which could significantly affect current plans and expectations and our future financial position and results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, (1) the impact of our substantial indebtedness and the ability to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, (2) the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Law”), including the effects of any repeal of, or changes to, the Health Reform Law or changes to its implementation, the possible enactment of additional federal or state health care reforms and possible changes to other federal, state or local laws or regulations affecting the health care industry, (3) the effects related to the continued implementation of the sequestration spending reductions required under the Budget Control Act of 2011, and related legislation extending these reductions, and the potential for future deficit reduction legislation that may alter these spending reductions, which include cuts to Medicare payments, or create additional spending reductions, (4) increases in the amount and risk of collectability of uninsured accounts and deductibles and copayment amounts for insured accounts, (5) the ability to achieve operating and financial targets, and attain expected levels of patient volumes and control the costs of providing services, (6) possible changes in Medicare, Medicaid and other state programs, including Medicaid supplemental payment programs or Medicaid waiver programs, that may impact reimbursements to health care providers and insurers and the size of the uninsured or underinsured population, (7) the highly competitive nature of the health care business, (8) changes in service mix, revenue mix and surgical volumes, including potential declines in the population covered under third-party payer agreements, the ability to enter into and renew third-party payer provider agreements on acceptable terms and the impact of consumer-driven health plans and physician utilization trends and practices, (9) the efforts of health insurers, health care providers, large employer groups and others to contain health care costs, (10) the outcome of our continuing efforts to monitor, maintain and comply with appropriate laws, regulations, policies and procedures, (11) increases in wages and the ability to attract and retain qualified management and personnel, including affiliated physicians, nurses and medical and technical support personnel, (12) the availability and terms of capital to fund the expansion of our business and improvements to our existing facilities, (13) changes in accounting practices, (14) changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in our markets, (15) the emergence and effects related to infectious diseases, (16) future divestitures which may result in charges and possible impairments of long-lived assets, (17) changes in business strategy or development plans, (18) delays in receiving payments for services provided, (19) the outcome of pending and any future tax audits, disputes and litigation associated with our tax positions, (20) potential adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations, litigation and other claims that may be made against us, (21) the impact of potential cybersecurity incidents or security breaches, (22) our ongoing ability to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology, (23) the impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, or similar events beyond our control, (24) changes in interpretations, assumptions, and expectations regarding the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including additional guidance that may be issued by federal and state taxing authorities or other standard-setting bodies, and (25) other risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements contained herein, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s views only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAll references to “Company” and “HCA” as used throughout this release refer to HCA Healthcare, Inc. and its affiliates.\nHCA Healthcare, Inc.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures Operating Results Summary (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) First Quarter 2018 2017 Revenues $ 11,423 $ 10,623 Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. $ 1,144 $ 659 Gains on sales of facilities (net of tax) (305 ) (1 ) Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities (a) 839 658 Depreciation and amortization 553 521 Interest expense 431 419 Provision for income taxes 157 289 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 138 118 Adjusted EBITDA (a) $ 2,118 $ 2,005 Adjusted EBITDA margin (a) 18.5 % 18.9 % Diluted earnings per share: Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. $ 3.18 $ 1.74 Gains on sales of facilities (0.85 ) - Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities (a) $ 2.33 $ 1.74 Shares used in computing diluted earnings per share (millions) 359.749 379.980 (a) Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). We believe net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA are important measures that supplement discussions and analysis of our results of operations. We believe it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our results of operations on the same basis used by management. Management relies upon net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measures to review and assess operating performance of its health care facilities and their management teams. Management and investors review both the overall performance (including net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and GAAP net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc.) and operating performance (Adjusted EBITDA) of our health care facilities. Adjusted EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) are utilized by management and investors to compare our current operating results with the corresponding periods during the previous year and to compare our operating results with other companies in the health care industry. It is reasonable to expect that gains on sales of facilities will occur in future periods, but the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our health care facilities and complicate period comparisons of our results of operations and operations comparisons with other health care companies. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. as a measure of operating performance or cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Because net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities, and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. HCA Healthcare, Inc. Supplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures 2018 Operating Results Forecast (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) For the Year Ending December 31, 2018 Low High Revenues $ 45,000 $ 46,000 Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. (a) $ 3,020 $ 3,200 Depreciation and amortization 2,200 2,200 Interest expense 1,775 1,775 Provision for income taxes 955 1,075 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 500 500 Adjusted EBITDA (a) (b) $ 8,450 $ 8,750 Diluted earnings per share: Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. $ 8.50 $ 9.00 Shares used in computing diluted earnings per share (millions) 355.300 355.300 The Company's forecasted guidance range is based on current plans and expectations and is subject to a number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks. (a) The Company does not forecast the impact of items such as, but not limited to, losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs (benefits) and impairments of long-lived assets because the Company does not believe that it can forecast these items with sufficient accuracy. (b) Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that supplements discussions and analysis of our results of operations. We believe it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our results of operations on the same basis used by management. Management relies upon Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess operating performance of its health care facilities and their management teams. Management and investors review both the overall performance (including net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc.) and operating performance (Adjusted EBITDA) of our health care facilities. Adjusted EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) are utilized by management and investors to compare our current operating results with the corresponding periods during the previous year and to compare our operating results with other companies in the health care industry.
