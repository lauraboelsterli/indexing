FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Champions League - Paris St Germain Press Conference - Parc des Princes, Paris, France - March 5, 2018 Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery during the press conference REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\nThe image included a picture of the Spaniard next to the Arsenal badge with the message: “Proud to be part of the Arsenal family” before it was taken down on Tuesday.\nArsenal are expected to name the former Paris St Germain coach as successor to the long-serving Arsene Wenger this week.\nWenger left the north London club after nearly 22 years at the helm after they finished sixth in the league. Emery, who joined PSG in June 2016, left the French club at the end of this season, having led them to a domestic treble. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Ian Ransom",
