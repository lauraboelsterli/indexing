Picture taken May 11, 2018. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha Newly elected Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said this week that all efforts were being made to release Anwar, a former foe, immediately and secure a full royal pardon from the country’s monarch.\n“Yes,” Nurul said in a text message when asked to confirm whether her father was being released on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO - Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim speaks to Reuters at his office in Petaling Jaya outside Kuala Lumpur August 4, 2008. REUTERS/Bazuki Muhammad/File Photo Anwar was jailed in 2015 for charges of sodomy, a charge he and his supporters say was politically motivated.\nNurul added the pardon from the monarch is being sought on the grounds of “miscarriage of justice”.\nReporting by Joseph Sipalan; writing by Praveen Menon; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\n ",
