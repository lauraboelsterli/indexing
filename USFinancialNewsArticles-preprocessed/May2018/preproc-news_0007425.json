Non-GAAP adjusted net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter was $1.4 million, or $0.07 adjusted net loss from continuing operations per diluted share, compared to $1.3 million, or $0.06 adjusted net loss per diluted share in the same period in the prior year.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the first quarter was $1.0 million, compared to $1.1 million in the same period in the prior year.\nDigirad President and CEO Matt Molchan said, “Overall, our business performed within our expectations. Despite some harsh weather conditions in the Midwest and the Northeast, our service businesses, Diagnostic Services and Mobile Healthcare, continued to deliver convenient, effective and efficient healthcare solutions on an as needed, when needed, and where needed basis across the country during the quarter.\" Molchan continued, “Our Diagnostic Imaging business continued to see improvements, exceeding revenue for the quarter on a year over year basis. Also, in the quarter, as previously announced - we sold our service contracts in our MDSS business unit to Philips - effectively discontinuing operations in this unit. We also completed some operational and personnel changes in our core business areas as a result of the divestiture of the MDSS business. Finally, we were able to pay down our debt from $19.5 million at the beginning of the quarter to $13.0 million at the end of the quarter. We expect our business to continue to generate free cash flow, which we will use to pay down debt and fund our ongoing dividend, both of which we believe deliver value to our shareholders.”\nThe Company also announces a cash dividend of $0.055 cents per share that will be paid on May 30, 2018, to shareholders of record on May 15, 2018.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company announced its financial guidance for 2018, which is to generate revenues from continuing operations of between $100 and $105 million, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of between $8.5 and $9.5 million, and free cash flow between $4 and $5 million.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call is scheduled for 11:00 a.m. EDT on May 1, 2018 to discuss the results and management's outlook.

Further excluded in the measure of adjusted EBITDA are interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation.\nA discussion of the reasons why management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Digirad's financial condition and results of operations is included as Exhibit 99.2 to Digirad's report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1st, 2018.\nAbout Digirad Corporation\nDigirad delivers convenient, effective, and efficient healthcare solutions on an as needed, when needed, and where needed basis.
