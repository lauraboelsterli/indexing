(NYSE: GNL), a real estate investment trust focused on the acquisition of net lease industrial properties, today announced that it closed on the acquisition of five industrial assets representing approximately 1.4 million square feet for $83.0 million. The five buildings are leased to a leading steel service supplier with products and services provided to clients throughout the Midwestern U.S. and Canada that has an implied investment grade credit rating on Moody's Analytics of \"Baa3 3 .\" The buildings were purchased at a price equating to a weighted-average GAAP capitalization rate of 8.19% 1 and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 10.0 years 2 . This transaction strengthens GNL's already strong Midwest presence and lengthens its weighted-average remaining lease term.\nThese properties are part of the $293 million of acquisitions announced earlier in 2018 and to date $146.4 million has closed. GNL funded the transactions with borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nProperty Summary\nThree of the buildings are located in Michigan, one in Ohio and one in Indiana, all well- positioned near interstate highways and rail facilities. Additionally, the properties are near numerous major cities in the Midwest, further enhancing the tenant's supply chain efforts. The industrial buildings included in this transaction comprise all of the tenant's facilities and also house the company's offices, central inventory, and processing depot.\nProperty Summary Table\nClosing\nDate\nBuildings\nSquare\nFeet\nAsset Type\nLease\nTerm\n(yrs) (1)\nPurchase\nPrice\n(mm)\nLocation\n5/16/2018\n5\n1,392,000\nIndustrial\n10.0\n$83.0\nMichigan,\nOhio and\nIndiana\n(1)\nAs of May 16, 2018.\nAbout Global Net Lease, Inc.\nGlobal Net Lease, Inc.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to be materially different. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding stockholder liquidity and investment value and returns. The words \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.

GAAP capitalization rate is calculated by dividing the income the property will generate (before debt service and depreciation and after fixed costs and variable costs) by the acquisition price of the property.\n2 The weighted average remaining lease term in years based upon square feet as of May 16, 2018.\n3 Implied Investment Grade includes ratings of tenant parent (regardless of whether or not the parent has guaranteed the tenant's obligation under the lease) or lease guarantor. Implied Investment Grade ratings are also determined using a proprietary Moody's analytical tool, which compares the risk metrics of the non-rated company to those of a company with an actual rating. The ratings information is as of March 2, 2018.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-net-lease-closed-on-five-industrial-properties-for-83-0-million-300649928.html\nSOURCE Global Net Lease, Inc.",
