The International Air Transport Association (IATA) logo is seen at the International Tourism Trade Fair ITB in Berlin, Germany, March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch\nAlexandre de Juniac, speaking to reporters at a media event ahead of the organizationâ€™s annual meeting due to begin on Sunday, said fresh forecast would be given next week, adding that the December projection was based on oil at $60 per barrel.\nIn December, the group had predicted a record $38.4 billion net profit for the airline industry in 2018, with $27.9 billion coming from U.S. and European airlines.\nJuniac said higher fuel price had not yet been passed on in fares yet.\nIATA represents some 280 airlines comprising 83 percent of global air traffic.
