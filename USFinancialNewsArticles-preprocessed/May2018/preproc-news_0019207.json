    "text": "NEW YORK, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Remedy ( www.digitalremedy.com ), a white-labeled ad operations and sales solution for publishers, advertisers and influencers, announced today that Keith “Kappy” Kaplan has been appointed to the company’s Board of Directors, effective May 9, 2018. His appointment follows the acquisition of CrowdHere and the elevation of its former CEO Nick Pahade to COO and President of Digital Remedy. Kaplan most recently served as the Global President of Monetization for King Entertainment, a division of Activision Blizzard.\n“A longtime digital strategist who understands the pressures of the market from many different seats, Kappy is a natural fit for our board,” said Mike Seiman, Chairman and CEO of Digital Remedy. “His guidance will help us to realize our vision of delivering solutions that meet and exceed advertiser and publisher needs in a rapidly evolving digital ecosystem.”\nAt King, a leading interactive entertainment company for the mobile world, Kaplan oversaw the global expansion of the company’s revenue by focusing on the growth and development of strategic accounts, agencies, and partnerships. His expanding team of regional sales, marketing, and account management focused on fostering deep relationships, developing partnership programs, and addressing top marketers’ challenges, including innovative solutions that ultimately connected brands with consumers in ways that enhanced their experience.\n“I’m excited to join the Board of Digital Remedy to partner in the development of the organization’s long-term roadmap,” said Kaplan. “I hope my industry connections bring invaluable insight to bear in this process, as I work to be an advocate and proponent for the company and all Digital Remedy has accomplished to date.”\nKaplan brings 20 years of experience and leadership in effectively communicating brand and product offerings to a global audience. He held positions at Yahoo as Head of Revenue for Genome and Head of Global Agency & Client Development. Before that, he was the President and Chief Revenue Officer of Interclick and President of Adconion Media group in North America, which was acquired by Amobee. Earlier in his career, Kaplan served in senior roles at Cablevision Sports, Paramount Pictures, CBS Outdoor, L90 Interactive, MetroLights Outdoor Media and MaxWorldwide Inc.\n“Keith has been a friend and colleague for the entirety of our careers, but I have never had the opportunity to join him on the board of a company we mutually admire,” said Nick Pahade, COO, President and Board Member of Digital Remedy. “Our deep ties within the industry will be reinforced by our new positions, and I look forward to the connections we will make for the company.”\nRecipient of a B.A. degree from Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Communication, he is also a member of the S.I. Newhouse Dean Advisory Board at Syracuse University and was recently appointed to the ad:tech Board of Directors. Kaplan lives with his wife and three children in Westport, Connecticut.\nDigital Remedy solves the complex and evolving online marketing challenges of marketers, publishers, and influencers through a combination of innovative technology and superior customer service.
