Of additional and positive note after quarter close was our successful debt refinancing. In short, we are delivering results in a growth market consistent with our strategy and in accordance with our 2018 Plan. We are also excited with the renewed pace of Requests for Proposal issuances fueled by the recently passed federal budget, a strong indication of future growth for KeyW and our industry,” said Bill Weber, KeyW’s president and chief executive officer.\nBusiness Development Highlights and Contract Awards\nFor the first quarter, contract awards totaled approximately $106 million, which was in line with company expectations. Trailing twelve-month contract award values totaled $555 million, or 1.1 times revenue. The company reported having approximately $1.3 billion in proposals submitted and awaiting award as of March 31, 2018.\nFirst-quarter awards were highlighted by several highly differentiated classified technical programs, including a development effort for a space-related science and technology customer, an award for a forensics and software development program and a cyber development opportunity.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues for the quarter of $125.7 million increased by $57.5 million, or 84%, compared to the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to contracts acquired through the acquisition of Sotera and increased product sales associated with our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance core focus area.\nOperating income for the quarter was $1.0 million, compared with an operating loss of $1.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in operating income and margin resulted primarily from the additional revenue acquired in the Sotera acquisition and increased product sales, partially offset by the associated higher cost of revenue, operating expense and amortization expense. Operating expenses in the quarter included $0.8 million of acquisition and integration costs and an additional $1.9 million of non-recurring expenses.\nGAAP net loss for the quarter was $3.1 million, or $(0.06) per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $3.9 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $11.4 million, or 9.0% of revenue, for the quarter, compared to $4.5 million, or 6.5% of revenue, in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased year-over-year primarily because of the additional Sotera revenue, partially offset by the associated higher direct and indirect expenses.\nAdditional Financial Metrics\nKeyW reported total backlog at March 31, 2018, of $1.14 billion, compared with total backlog of $1.19 billion at December 31, 2017.\nCash flow used in operations for the quarter was $16.0 million, compared to $3.8 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in cash flow used in operations was primarily due to a temporary increase in days sales outstanding (DSO), which were 79 days for the quarter, and a seasonal increase in payroll and related expenditures. The increase in DSO resulted from complexities associated with contract novation and systems integration, and the company expects DSO to return to a normalized level by the end of the fiscal year. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018, was $3.1 million. At March 31, 2018, the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under its 2017 Credit Agreement.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nKeyW is reiterating the fiscal 2018 guidance it issued on March 15, 2018, based on the company's financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and its current outlook for the remainder of 2018. The table below summarizes the company's fiscal year 2018 guidance:\nFiscal 2018 Guidance Revenue $495 million - $515 million Adjusted EBITDA margin 8.9% - 9.3% Weber concluded: “KeyW delivered solid and predictable results in the first quarter of 2018. Our financial performance was above our expectations and contract awards were in line with our plan. Furthermore, after quarter close we delivered on our promise to successfully refinance our debt. We are laser focused on executing our operating plan and generating strong cash flow over the remainder of the year.”\nConference Call Information\nAs previously announced, a conference call and webcast have been scheduled to discuss these results today, May 8, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. EDT.

The adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table and adjusted EBITDA as percentage of full year revenue guidance reconciliation table below provide a reconciliation of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to net income (loss) and estimated net income (loss) margin, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income margin, operating income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin or similarly titled measures in the same manner as we do. We prepare adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. We encourage you to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons:\nwe have various non-recurring transactions or non-operating transactions and expenses that directly impact our net income. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to approximate the net cash provided by operations by adjusting for non-recurring or non-operating items; and securities analysts use adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies.\nOur board of directors and management use adjusted EBITDA:\nas a measure of operating performance; to determine a significant portion of management's incentive compensation; for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.\nAlthough adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nadjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitments; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or interest income; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes; adjusted EBITDA does not include non-cash expenses related to stock compensation; adjusted EBITDA does not include acquisition and integration costs; adjusted EBITDA does not include other adjustments which are non-recurring expenses; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements; and\nother companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nTHE KeyW HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation Table (in thousands and unaudited) Table 1 Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net (loss) income $ (3,127 ) $ (3,884 ) Depreciation 2,590 1,432 Intangible amortization 3,941 1,650 Share-based compensation 1,180 958 Interest expense, net 4,828 2,609 Tax (benefit) expense (693 ) — Acquisition and integration costs 773 1,687 Other adjustments 1,870 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 11,362 $ 4,452\nAdjusted EBITDA as Percentage of Full Year Revenue Guidance Reconciliation Table Fiscal Year 2018 Estimate Low High Net (loss) income -3.0 % -2.4 % Depreciation 2.0 % 1.9 % Intangible amortization 2.4 % 2.4 % Share-based compensation 0.8 % 0.8 % Interest expense, net 6.8 % 6.5 % Tax (benefit) expense -0.7 % -0.5 % Acquisition and integration costs 0.2 % 0.2 % Other adjustments 0.4 % 0.4 % Adjusted EBITDA Margin 8.9 % 9.3 %\nSource:KeyW Corp.",
