    "text": "MONETT, Mo., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ: JKHY), a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for the financial services industry, today announced third quarter fiscal 2018 results.\nRevenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased to $384.7 million, a 9% improvement over the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating income increased 9% to $96.3 million. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted December 22, 2017 had a large impact on our provision for income taxes and contributed to the large increase in net income of 21% over the third quarter of fiscal 2017 to $72.4 million, or $0.93 per diluted share.\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, revenue increased 7% to $1,119.4 million over the same nine months of fiscal 2017. Operating income increased 6% to $283.8 million, and net income increased 61% to $291.4 million, or $3.76 per diluted share, with the increase again due mainly to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAccording to David Foss, President and CEO, \"We are happy to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. Our sales teams continue to have a very solid year through our third quarter, and our fourth quarter has started out very well as it appears they should exceed their quota target for the fiscal year. We have now migrated 34 financial institutions to the new payment platform, and we continue to see high levels of interest. I want to thank all of our associates for all their efforts to produce these results.\"\nOperating Results\nRevenue, cost of sales, and gross profit results for the quarter and the nine months ended March 31, 2018 were as follows:\nRevenue (Unaudited)\n(In Thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\nServices & Support\n$\n244,830\n$\n226,856\n8\n%\n$\n706,879\n$\n666,062\n6\n%\nPercentage of Total Revenue\n64\n%\n64\n%\n63\n%\n64\n%\nProcessing\n139,854\n126,911\n10\n%\n412,495\n381,287\n8\n%\nPercentage of Total Revenue\n36\n%\n36\n%\n37\n%\n36\n%\nTotal Revenue\n384,684\n353,767\n9\n%\n1,119,374\n1,047,349\n7\n%\nThe increased revenue in the services and support revenue line for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was mainly driven by growth in our \"outsourcing and cloud\" and \"product delivery and services\" revenues. The increase in outsourcing and cloud and the increase in processing revenue were partially due to revenue from Ensenta. Deconversion fees, which are included within product delivery and services, increased $3.8 million compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Excluding deconversion fees from both periods, revenue from fiscal 2018 acquisitions, and fiscal 2017 revenue attributable to divested products, revenue increased 6%. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, deconversion fees increased $0.9 million compared to the prior year-to-date period. Excluding deconversion fees from both periods, revenue from fiscal 2018 acquisitions, and fiscal 2017 revenue attributable to divested products, revenue increased 7%. The increase in the services and support line was driven primarily by increased \"outsourcing and cloud\" and \"product delivery and services\" revenue. The product delivery and services revenue increase in the year-to-date period was driven by the completion of revised contractual obligations on several long-term contracts that permitted the Company to recognize previously deferred revenue related to our bundled arrangements. The increase in the processing line was driven by increased \"transaction and digital\" and \"card\" processing revenue. For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, core segment revenue increased 7% to $136.6 million from $127.2 million in the same period a year ago. Payments segment revenue increased 12% to $132.6 million, from $118.4 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue from the complementary segment increased 11% to $104.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $94.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2017. Revenue in the corporate and other segment decreased 22% to $11.0 million, compared to $14.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, revenue in the core segment increased 10% to $399.9 million, compared to $364.0 million a year ago. Payments segment revenue increased 6% to $381.7 million, from $359.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Complementary segment revenue increased 7% to $298.1 million, up from $279.2 million a year ago. Revenue from the corporate and other segment decreased 11% to $39.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 from $44.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.\nOperating Expenses and Operating Income\nOperating income increased 9% to $96.3 million, or 25% of third quarter fiscal 2018 revenue, compared to $88.7 million, or 25% of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFor the year-to-date period, operating income increased 6% to $283.8 million, or 25% of revenue, compared to operating income of $268.8 million, or 26% of revenue, for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.\n(Unaudited, In Thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nCost of Revenue\n$\n221,592\n$\n206,727\n7\n%\n$\n637,960\n$\n599,636\n6\n%\nPercentage of Total Revenue\n58\n%\n58\n%\n57\n%\n57\n%\nResearch and Development\n22,591\n20,801\n9\n%\n65,934\n61,413\n7\n%\nPercentage of Total Revenue\n6\n%\n6\n%\n6\n%\n6\n%\nSelling, General, & Administrative\n44,185\n39,794\n11\n%\n133,532\n119,795\n11\n%\nPercentage of Total Revenue\n11\n%\n11\n%\n12\n%\n11\n%\nGain on disposal of a business\n—\n(2,286)\n(100)\n%\n(1,894)\n(2,250)\n(16)\n%\nTotal Operating Expenses\n288,368\n265,036\n9\n%\n835,532\n778,594\n7\n%\nOperating Income\n$\n96,316\n$\n88,731\n9\n%\n$\n283,842\n$\n268,755\n6\n%\nOperating Margin\n25\n%\n25\n%\n25\n%\n26\n%\nCost of revenue increased 7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, but remained consistent as a percentage of revenue. The increased costs were primarily due to increased headcount driving increased salaries and benefits as well as higher direct costs of product, costs related to our new card payment processing platform and faster payments initiatives, and increased amortization of capitalized software. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, cost of revenue increased 6% compared to the equivalent period of the prior year, but remained a consistent percentage of revenue. The increased costs were primarily due to higher personnel costs, higher direct costs of product, costs related to our new card payment processing platform and faster payments initiatives, and increased amortization of capitalized software. Research and development expense increased for the third quarter and year-to-date period mainly due to increased salary and personnel costs resulting from increased headcount, but remained consistent with the prior year third quarter and year-to-date period as a percentage of total revenue. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 11% over the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, but remained a consistent percentage of revenue. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expense, salaries, and personnel costs. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 11% compared to the equivalent period of fiscal 2017, and increased less than 1% as a percentage of revenue. The increased spending was mainly due to the Jack Henry Annual Conference in October, as well as increased commissions, salaries, personnel costs, and increased professional service expenses due to contracting with outside experts in preparation for our adoption of the new ASC 606 revenue standard. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recognized a gain related to the sale of Alogent. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, gains on disposals of businesses totaled $1.9 million, due to the disposals of the ATM Manager and jhaDirect product lines. The prior year gain was related to the sale of Alogent.\nNet Income\nNet income for the third quarter and the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n(Unaudited, In Thousands,\nExcept Per Share Data)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nIncome Before Income Taxes\n$\n95,712\n$\n88,495\n8\n%\n$\n283,093\n$\n268,360\n5\n%\nProvision for Income Taxes\n23,317\n28,451\n(18)\n%\n(8,287)\n87,258\n(109)\n%\nNet Income\n$\n72,395\n$\n60,044\n21\n%\n$\n291,380\n$\n181,102\n61\n%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n0.93\n$\n0.77\n21\n%\n$\n3.76\n$\n2.31\n62\n%\nProvision for income taxes decreased in the third quarter, with an effective tax rate at 24.4% of income before income taxes, compared to 32.1% for the same quarter of the prior year. The decrease was due to adjustments recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The decreased provision for income taxes in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was also due primarily to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAccording to Kevin Williams, CFO, \"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act impacted the quarter and year to date net income as we continue to implement the new rules over our fiscal year, which will continue to adjust the full year to a blended effective rate. The table below adjusts out all the non-operational impacts on the financials by excluding deconversion fees, revenue and operating income from acquisitions, and revenue and gain from divestitures to allow our investors to focus on our true operating performance of revenue growth of 6% and operating income increase of 8% over the respective prior year quarter.\"\nEffects of Deconversion Fees, Acquisitions, and Divestitures\nThe table below shows our revenue and operating income (in thousands) for the third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year periods, excluding the impacts of deconversion fees, divestitures, and fiscal 2018 acquisitions.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n%\nChange\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nReported Revenue (GAAP)\n$\n384,684\n$\n353,767\n9\n%\n$\n1,119,374\n$\n1,047,349\n7\n%\nAdjustments:\nDeconversion fees\n15,734\n11,888\n34,288\n33,423\nRevenue from fiscal 2018 acquisitions\n7,637\n—\n9,057\n—\nRevenue from divestitures\n—\n2,261\n—\n7,497\nProforma Revenue\n$\n361,313\n$\n339,618\n6\n%\n$\n1,076,029\n$\n1,006,429\n7\n%\nReported Operating Income (GAAP)\n$\n96,316\n$\n88,731\n9\n%\n$\n283,842\n$\n268,755\n6\n%\nAdjustments:\nDeconversion fees\n15,458\n11,888\n33,195\n33,416\nOperating income from fiscal 2018 acquisitions\n632\n—\n85\n—\nOperating income from divestitures\n—\n438\n—\n1,871\nGain on disposal of businesses\n—\n2,286\n1,894\n2,250\nProforma Operating Income\n$\n80,226\n$\n74,119\n8\n%\n$\n248,668\n$\n231,218\n8\n%\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Review\nAt March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents increased to $57.4 million from $42.9 million at March 31, 2017.
