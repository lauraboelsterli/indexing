Soccer Football - Europa League Semi Final Second Leg - RB Salzburg v Olympique de Marseille - Red Bull Arena, Salzburg, Austria - May 3, 2018 Marseille's Rolando celebrates scoring their first goal with team mates REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\nAmadou Haidara’s strike and a Bouna Sarr own goal took Salzburg to the brink of a remarkable comeback having lost the first leg 2-0 but substitute Rolando had the final say and Marseille will meet Atletico Madrid in the final in the French city of Lyon.\nSalzburg reached the last four by overturning a two-goal deficit against Lazio and another successful fightback looked on when the Austrian champions took the lead through a brilliant solo strike by Haidara who glided past three players before toe-poking the ball in after 53 minutes.\nThe goal sparked Marco Rose’s side into life and they got their second little more than 10 minutes later. Haidara’s cross found its way to Xaver Schlager whose shot was going off target until it hit the toe of Marseille defender Sarr and went in.

It happened late but it happened.”\nThe set-piece that led to the winning goal was contentious as Salzburg thought the ball had come off a Marseille player last.\nSalzburg manager Marco Rose and some of his players argued with the officials following the final whistle.\n“I’m sorry for the guys who played their great Europa League season, then we were whistled away by the referee, what am I supposed to do? That’s unbelievable,” Rose said.\n“My boys are great,” he added. “They have great characters, we also had the opportunity to win but Marseille is in the final, we have to watch. We are very disappointed.” Reporting by Christian Radnedge,; Editing by Ed Osmond",
