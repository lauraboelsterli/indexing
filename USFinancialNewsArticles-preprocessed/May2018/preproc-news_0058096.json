    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Reuters) - Sugar producer Tongaat Hulett said on Monday its full-year profit fell by 37 percent, weighed down by higher-than-expected sugar imports by South Africa and low international prices.\nDiluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) fell to 534.8 cents ($0.4296) in the year ended March 31, from 852.7 cents in the previous year. This was in line with the companyâ€™s guidance.\nHEPS is the main profit measure used in South Africa which strips out certain once-off items. ($1 = 12.4500 rand) (Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)\n ",
