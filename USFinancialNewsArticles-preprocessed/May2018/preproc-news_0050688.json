Closing is anticipated in the next 30 days.\n\"We anticipate a highly-complimentary combination that significantly expands the capabilities of both firms,\" states Amer Hammour, Chairman, Madison Marquette. \"Madison Marquette's investment management as well as retail and mixed-use development, marketing and management expertise would join PMRG's office, medical, industrial and multi-family capabilities to provide leadership across all asset classes to our clients and investment partners.\" PMRG's dominance in the southern US is a perfect match for Madison's presence in primary gateway markets on both coasts.
