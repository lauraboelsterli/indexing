    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Griffon Corporation (“Griffon” or the “Company”) (NYSE:GFF) announced that its subsidiary, Clopay Building Products Company, Inc. (“Clopay”) has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CornellCookson, Inc. (“CornellCookson”), a leading US manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail use, for $180 million. After taking into account tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price is approximately $170 million.\n“CornellCookson is a highly strategic addition to Griffon’s Home and Building Products segment, complementing Clopay’s existing portfolio of residential and commercial sectional doors with leading brands and products,” said Ronald J. Kramer, Griffon’s Chairman and CEO. “This acquisition will expand our existing footprint in the commercial channel, and strengthen our relationships with professional dealers and installers. With a legacy of innovation, quality, and customer service going back to 1828, the Cornell and Cookson names will be right at home within our growing family of iconic brands including Clopay, AMES, True Temper, and ClosetMaid.”\nThe acquisition is expected to be financed through cash on hand. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in June 2018.\nGriffon and CornellCookson have structured the acquisition such that it will be treated as an asset purchase for tax purposes. This election will generate a tax benefit with an estimated present value of more than $10 million for Griffon and its shareholders.\nIn the first full year of operations, Griffon expects CornellCookson to contribute $200 million in net sales and $0.15 in earnings per share.\nBaird is acting as Griffon’s financial advisor and Dechert is acting as Griffon’s legal counsel for the acquisition of CornellCookson.\nForward-looking Statements\n“Safe Harbor” Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: All statements related to, among other things, income (loss), earnings, cash flows, revenue, changes in operations, operating improvements, industries in which Griffon operates and the United States and global economies that are not historical are hereby identified as “ ” and may be indicated by words or phrases such as “anticipates,” “supports,” “plans,” “projects,” “expects,” “believes,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “hope,” “forecast,” “management is of the opinion,” “may,” “will,” “estimates,” “intends,” “explores,” “opportunities,” the negative of these expressions, use of the future tense and similar words or phrases.
