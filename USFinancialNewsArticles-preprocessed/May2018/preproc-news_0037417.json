The portion of deferred product revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers increased 29%.\nCapital Allocation -- In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Cisco declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.33 per common share, or $1.6 billion.

Non-GAAP net income per share for the period is calculated using diluted shares of 4,936 million, as the Company had non-GAAP net income for this period.\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\nGROSS MARGINS, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING MARGINS, AND NET INCOME\n(In millions, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended April 28, 2018 Product\nGross\nMargin Service\nGross\nMargin Total\nGross\nMargin Operating\nExpenses Y/Y Operating\nIncome Y/Y Net\nIncome Y/Y GAAP amount $ 5,679 $ 2,080 $ 7,759 $ 4,625 6 % $ 3,134 (1 )% $ 2,691 7 % % of revenue 61.0 % 65.8 % 62.3 % 37.1 % 25.1 % 21.6 % Adjustments to GAAP amounts: Share-based compensation expense 24 33 57 342 399 399 Amortization of acquisition-related\nintangible assets 161 — 161 67 228 228 Supplier component remediation charge\n(adjustment), net (9 ) — (9 ) — (9 ) (9 ) Acquisition/divestiture-related costs 1 1 2 89 91 91 Significant asset impairments and\nrestructurings — — — 82 82 82 Income tax effect/significant tax\nmatters — — — — — (287 ) Non-GAAP amount $ 5,856 $ 2,114 $ 7,970 $ 4,045 6 % $ 3,925 2 % $ 3,195 6 % % of revenue 62.9 % 66.9 % 63.9 % 32.5 % 31.5 % 25.6 %\nThree Months Ended April 29, 2017 Product\nGross\nMargin Service\nGross\nMargin Total\nGross\nMargin Operating\nExpenses Operating\nIncome Net\nIncome GAAP amount $ 5,480 $ 2,038 $ 7,518 $ 4,349 $ 3,169 $ 2,515 % of revenue 61.7 % 66.7 % 63.0 % 36.4 % 26.5 % 21.1 % Adjustments to GAAP amounts: Share-based compensation expense 22 34 56 349 405 405 Amortization of acquisition-related\nintangible assets 124 — 124 59 183 183 Supplier component remediation\ncharge (adjustment), net (13 ) — (13 ) — (13 ) (13 ) Acquisition/divestiture-related costs — — — 43 43 43 Significant asset impairments and\nrestructurings — — — 70 70 70 Income tax effect — — — — — (177 ) Non-GAAP amount $ 5,613 $ 2,072 $ 7,685 $ 3,828 $ 3,857 $ 3,026 % of revenue 63.2 % 67.8 % 64.4 % 32.1 % 32.3 % 25.3 %\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\nGROSS MARGINS, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING MARGINS, AND NET INCOME (LOSS)\n(In millions, except percentages)\nNine Months Ended April 28, 2018 Product\nGross\nMargin Service\nGross\nMargin Total\nGross\nMargin Operating\nExpenses Y/Y Operating\nIncome Y/Y Net\nIncome\n(Loss) Y/Y GAAP amount $ 16,473 $ 6,211 $ 22,684 $ 13,721 — % $ 8,963 — % $ (3,693 ) (151 )% % of revenue 60.9 % 65.9 % 62.2 % 37.6 % 24.6 % (10.1 )% Adjustments to GAAP amounts: Share-based compensation expense 70 98 168 1,010 1,178 1,178 Amortization of acquisition-related\nintangible assets 444 — 444 188 632 632 Supplier component remediation\ncharge (adjustment), net (41 ) — (41 ) — (41 ) (41 ) Legal and indemnification\nsettlements 122 — 122 — 122 122 Acquisition/divestiture-related\ncosts 1 3 4 195 199 199 Significant asset impairments and\nrestructurings — — — 332 332 332 Income tax effect/significant tax\nmatters (1) — — — — — 10,648 (1 ) Non-GAAP amount $ 17,069 $ 6,312 $ 23,381 $ 11,996 2 % $ 11,385 — % $ 9,377 4 % % of revenue 63.1 % 67.0 % 64.1 % 32.9 % 31.2 % 25.7 % (1) Includes an $11.1 billion charge as related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNine Months Ended April 29, 2017 Product\nGross\nMargin Service\nGross\nMargin Total\nGross\nMargin Operating\nExpenses Operating\nIncome Net\nIncome GAAP amount $ 16,565 $ 6,113 $ 22,678 $ 13,739 $ 8,939 $ 7,185 % of revenue 62.1 % 66.5 % 63.2 % 38.3 % 24.9 % 20.0 % Adjustments to GAAP amounts: Share-based compensation expense 62 101 163 963 1,126 1,126 Amortization of acquisition-related\nintangible assets 343 — 343 201 544 544 Supplier component remediation\ncharge (adjustment), net (29 ) — (29 ) — (29 ) (29 ) Acquisition/divestiture-related costs — 1 1 157 158 158 Significant asset impairments and\nrestructurings — — — 614 614 614 Income tax effect — — — — — (612 ) Non-GAAP amount $ 16,941 $ 6,215 $ 23,156 $ 11,804 $ 11,352 $ 8,986 % of revenue 63.5 % 67.6 % 64.6 % 32.9 % 31.6 % 25.1 %\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE\n(In percentages)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended April 28,\n2018 April 29,\n2017 April 28,\n2018 April 29,\n2017 GAAP effective tax rate (1) 17.3 % 21.2 % 139.1 % 21.1 % Total adjustments to GAAP provision for income taxes 3.7 % 0.8 % (118.1 )% 0.9 % Non-GAAP effective tax rate 21.0 % 22.0 % 21.0 % 22.0 % (1) Includes an $11.1 billion charge as related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for the nine months ended April 28, 2018.\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP GUIDANCE FOR Q4 FY 2018\nQ4 FY 2018 Gross Margin Rate Operating Margin Rate Tax Provision Rate Earnings per Share (2) GAAP 61.5% -

The total pre-tax cash charges to the GAAP financial results is estimated to be approximately $300 million consisting of severance and other one-time benefits, and other associated costs. We expect to recognize up to $50 million of these charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 with the remaining amount to be recognized through fiscal 2019.\n(2) Estimated adjustments to GAAP earnings per share are shown after income tax effects.\nExcept as noted above, this guidance does not include the effects of any future acquisitions/divestitures, asset impairments, restructurings and significant tax matters or other events, which may or may not be significant unless specifically stated.\nForward Looking Statements, Non-GAAP Information and Additional Information\nThis release may be deemed to contain , which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding future events (such as execution on our strategy, our investment in innovation and ability to continue to build a strong innovation pipeline, continued progress in transforming our business toward more software and subscriptions, our ability to maintain our position in the industry and the impact we will continue to drive with our customers, continued broad-based strength across our portfolio, and our ability to continue to execute well, deliver profitable growth and return capital to our shareholders) and the future financial performance of Cisco (including the guidance for Q4 FY 2018) that involve risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that these are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including: business and economic conditions and growth trends in the networking industry, our customer markets and various geographic regions; global economic conditions and uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; overall information technology spending; the growth and evolution of the Internet and levels of capital spending on Internet-based systems; variations in customer demand for products and services, including sales to the service provider market and other customer markets; the return on our investments in certain priorities, key growth areas, and in certain geographical locations, as well as maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services; the timing of orders and manufacturing and customer lead times; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; variability of component costs; variations in sales channels, product costs or mix of products sold; our ability to successfully acquire businesses and technologies and to successfully integrate and operate these acquired businesses and technologies; our ability to achieve expected benefits of our partnerships; increased competition in our product and service markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; manufacturing and sourcing risks; product defects and returns; litigation involving patents, intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters, and governmental investigations; our ability to achieve the benefits of the announced restructuring and possible changes in the size and timing of the related charges; man-made problems such as cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, computer viruses or terrorism; natural catastrophic events; a pandemic or epidemic; our ability to achieve the benefits anticipated from our investments in sales, engineering, service, marketing and manufacturing activities; our ability to recruit and retain key personnel; our ability to manage financial risk, and to manage expenses during economic downturns; risks related to the global nature of our operations, including our operations in emerging markets; currency fluctuations and other international factors; changes in provision for income taxes, including changes in tax laws and regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our income tax returns; potential volatility in operating results; and other factors listed in Cisco's most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed on February 20, 2018 and September 7, 2017, respectively. The financial information contained in this release should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Cisco's most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as each may be amended from time to time. Cisco's results of operations for the three and nine months ended April 28, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of Cisco's operating results for any future periods. Any projections in this release are based on limited information currently available to Cisco, which is subject to change. Although any such projections and the factors influencing them will likely change, Cisco will not necessarily update the information, since Cisco will only provide guidance at certain points during the year. Such information speaks only as of the date of this release.\nThis release includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nCisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations.\nFor its internal budgeting process, Cisco's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, significant gains and losses on investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing and significant tax matters. Cisco's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. For additional information on the items excluded by Cisco from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout Cisco\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that has been making the Internet work since 1984.
