    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey’s central bank hiked interest rates by 300 basis points on Wednesday, taking decisive action to put a floor under the cratering lira currency and win back investor confidence shaken by interventions from President Tayyip Erdogan.\nThe central bank, which was due to hold its next policy-setting meeting on June 7, said it had met as an emergency measure and lifted its top interest rate to 16.5 percent from 13.5 percent.\nInvestors had been betting the sharp selloff in the lira - it has fallen some 20 percent so far this year and touched a series of record lows - would force the bank into making such a move.\nRelated Coverage Turkish govenrment spokesman says lira 'game' will not change election outcome: Anadolu The lira reversed course after the decision and was some 2 percent firmer on the day at 4.5717 at 1637 GMT. Earlier it had tumbled to a record low of 4.9290.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “It is high time to restore monetary policy credibility and regain investor confidence,” Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Twitter, shortly before the central bank’s announcement.\nInvestors have lashed the lira on concerns about monetary policy after Erdogan, a self-described “enemy of interest rates”, said last week he expected to assert greater control over policy after elections on June 24, deepening worries about the central bank’s ability to tame double-digit inflation.\nAdditional reporting by Orhan Coskun and Claire Milhench; writing by Daren Butler and David Dolan; editing by John Stonestreet\n ",
