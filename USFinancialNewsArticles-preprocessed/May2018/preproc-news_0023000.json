    "text": "AT&T paid Michael Cohen for guidance on its proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner , according to company documents obtained by The Washington Post .\nThe documents describe Cohen's contract with the company, a relationship that earned President Donald Trump's personal lawyer $600,000.\nThe telecommunications giant declined to comment on the documents to the Post. The newspaper said, however, that AT&T did not challenge the authenticity of the documents.\nCohen's lawyer declined to comment to the Post.\nAT&T had already confirmed it paid Cohen for \"insights\" on the Trump administration. In a Wednesday memo to employees, AT&T said that Cohen was one of the consultants it hired to better understand how the White House would approach a number of issues including antitrust enforcement.\nThe Justice Department sued to block the deal in November.\nAT&T did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for further comment.\nRead the full story in The Washington Post.",
