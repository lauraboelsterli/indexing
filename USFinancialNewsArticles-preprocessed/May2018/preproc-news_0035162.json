    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - European car sales rose 9.6 percent in April, led by Toyota ( 7203.T ), Hyundai ( 005380.KS ) and Ford ( F.N ), and boosted by an increase in the number of business days, according to industry data published on Thursday.\nFILE PHOTO: The Toyota logo is shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S., November 30, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Registrations in EU and European Free Trade Area countries advanced to 1.349 million cars last month from 1.231 million a year earlier, Brussels-based industry association ACEA said.\nFILE PHOTO: A Hyundai logo is seen at Hyundai of Serramonte in Colma, California, U.S., October 3, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo Thanks to the timing of this year’s Easter holiday, European showrooms were open for business on more days last month than in April 2017, helping the year-on-year progression.\nToyota and Hyundai posted sales increases of 20.3 and 15.3 percent respectively, while Ford’s registrations were up 14 percent and Volkswagen Group’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) up 13.1 percent.\nRenault ( RENA.PA ) sales advanced 10 percent, while the Peugeot brand jumped 15.3 percent and PSA Group ( PEUP.PA ) stablemate Citroen posted a 6.9 percent increase.\nHowever Fiat Chrysler ( FCHA.MI ) lost ground as its sales edged just 2.3 percent higher, underperforming the market thanks to a 4.5 percent decline at the core Fiat brand.\nReporting by Laurence Frost; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ",
