(NASDAQ: ITRN) (TASE: ITRN), today announced its consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights of the First Quarter of 2018\nNet subscribers adds in the quarter amounted to 21,000; Record revenue of $63.1 million, up 12.5% year-over-year; Gross margins of 49.9% and operating margins at 24.6%; Record EBITDA of $19.2 million or 30.4% of revenues; Generated $7.5 million in operating cash flow; Dividend of $5 million declared for the quarter;\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $63.1 million, representing an increase of 12.5% from revenues of $56.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. 72% of revenues were from location based service subscription fees and 28% were from product revenues.\nRevenues from subscription fees increased by 15% over the same period last year. The growth was driven primarily by the increase in the subscriber base, which expanded from 1,082,000 as of March 31, 2017, to 1,181,000 as of March 31, 2018.\nProduct revenues increased by 7% compared with the same period last year. Product revenues can be volatile between quarters. The main contribution to growth was the higher product sales in Israel.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $31.5 million (49.9% of revenues), an increase of 12% compared with $28.1 million (50.1% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe gross margin in the quarter on subscription fees improved to 68.4% compared with 66.1% in the same period last year. The gross margin in the quarter on products was 1.2% compared with 11.2% in the same period last year. The lower margin on products during the quarter was due to the product mix\nOperating profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $15.5 million (24.6% of revenues), an increase of 13% compared with an operating profit of $13.8 million (24.6% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nTaxes in the quarter amounted to $4.7 million compared with taxes of $4.6 million in the first quarter of last year.\nDuring the quarter, share in affiliates, net was an income of $687 thousand versus an income of $4 million in the same quarter of last year.

The higher net profit in the first quarter of 2017 was due to the above-mentioned capital gain in that period.\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was $7.5 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had net cash, including marketable securities, of $38.2 million or $1.82 per share, compared with $40.4 million or $1.93 per share as of December 31, 2017.\nDividend\nFor the first quarter of 2018, a dividend of $5.0 million was declared in line with the Company's stated current policy of issuing at least $5 million on a quarterly basis.\nManagement Comment\nEyal Sheratzky, Co-CEO of Ituran said, \"We are very pleased with our first quarter 2018 results.
