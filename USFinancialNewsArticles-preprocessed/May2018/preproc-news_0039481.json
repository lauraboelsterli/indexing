    "text": "VANCOUVER, May 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - INVICTUS MD STRATEGIES CORP. (\"Invictus\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV: GENE; OTC: IVITF; FRA: 8IS1) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding letter of intent (\" LOI \") for an option to acquire 100% (the \" Option \") of the outstanding shares of an applicant (the \" OptionCo \") under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (\" ACMPR \") from OptionCo current shareholders (the \" Vendors \").\nOptionCo has two properties. One is located in Delta, British Columbia (\" Delta Facility \") and is a state of the art, pharmaceutical grade, cannabis production and research facility, which has been submitted to Health Canada for final review and approval under the ACMPR. The Company expects to receive its cultivation license for the Delta Facility in Q2 of 2018. The other property is located in Mission, British Columbia (\" Mission Location \"). The Mission Location application under the ACMPR has been submitted and is awaiting construction of its first 50,000 square foot state of the art, pharmaceutical grade purposed built indoor facility (\"Delta Facility\" and \"Mission Location\" are together referred to as the \" Properties \"). The Option will be exercisable at the sole option of Invictus within 30 days after OptionCo receives its license to cultivate under the ACMPR on the Delta Facility. The exercise price of the Option (the \" Exercise Price \") will be payable as follows:\n1)\nPayment of the sum of $2.5 million CDN in cash to OptionCo to repay agreed upon debts;\n2)\nIssuing to the security holders of OptionCo, within 10 business days of exercising the Option, $10 million in common shares of Invictus valued at a price per share being the greater of: (a) $1.65 CAD per share and (b) Invictus' 10 day Volume Weighted Average Trading Price (\" VWAP \") prior to the date of exercise with the following release schedule:\na) 25% within 10 business days of exercising the Option; and\nb) 25% every 4 months thereafter.\n3)\nInvestment in the sum of $10 million CDN (the \" Investment \") in cash into OptionCo to be used for the 50,000 square foot expansion of the Mission Location and for working capital purposes. The Investment will be in the form of a commitment from Invictus and will be transferred to OptionCo over time on an as needed basis.\n4)\nIssuing to the security holders of OptionCo, within 10 business days of the Mission Location receiving its cultivation license under the ACMPR, $7 million in common shares of Invictus valued at the VWAP immediately prior to the date of the Mission Location receiving its cultivation license under the ACMPR.\nThe Mission Location, located on 32 acres of property of buildable land, is currently under construction and expandable to 1 million square feet of production capacity under one ACMPR license and has the unique ability to expand licensed infrastructure rapidly. The location has direct access to a river providing unlimited water and the energy costs are wholesale value and are eligible for \"Transmission Rate\" with the local power authority ($.05 CDN / KwH) with 38 MG Watt service at the property line. Invictus expects to commence construction immediately with a target completion date of December 2018. The Company plans on expanding to over one million square feet of the property which has already been zoned to accommodate this level of expansion.\nAcreage Pharms Ltd. (\"Acreage Pharms\"), a licensed producer under the ACMPR located in West-Central Alberta on 150 acres, has approximately 40,000 square feet of cannabis ready production with its recently completed Phase 2 expansion. The Company intends on expanding to 120,000 square feet by the end of 2018 once Phase 3 is complete and is also working on plans to increase total capacity to 360,000 square feet in 2019. Invictus is fully funded for the Phase 3 expansion. AB Laboratories Inc. (\"AB Labs\"), a licensed producer under the ACMPR located in Hamilton, Ontario currently operates in a 16,000 square foot facility and continues to make progress on its 40,000 square foot Phase 2 facility. Once completed AB Labs will total 56,000 square foot of production capability. During the first quarter of 2018 AB Labs submitted a secondary license to Health Canada for a nearby property on 100 acres under the name AB Ventures Inc. (\"AB Ventures\"). Once AB Ventures receives its ACMPR license, the entire property will have the potential for cannabis cultivation. Invictus has committed $5.5 million in funding to build out the first 21,000 square foot building on the property with plans to expand to 105,000 square feet of production capacity by the end of 2019. OptionCo located on a 32-acre property expects to complete construction of its first 50,000 square foot facility by the end of 2018 and to expand to 300,000 square feet by the end of 2019. Overall the Company will expand to 250,000 square feet by the end of 2018 and to approximately 824,000 square feet by the end of 2019.\nSubject to completion of satisfactory due diligence, Invictus intends to enter into a definitive option agreement for the purchase of the OptionCo on or before June 30, 2018.\nDan Kriznic, CEO and Chairman commented \"This is a significant milestone for Invictus as we round out our ACMPR licenses through out the country. OptionCo will give us a significant footprint in British Columbia already adding to our large footprint in Alberta and Ontario. As we continue to build out our retail and distribution strategy, we need to have additional capacity and plan to aggressively build out the expansion in the short term as we gear up for the legalization of recreational cannabis.\"\nAbout Invictus\nInvictus owns and operates cannabis companies in Canada with the vision of producing a variety of high quality and low cost cannabis products and strains to the global market place as regulations permit. Gene Simmons, music legend and media mogul, conveys the vision of Invictus as the Chief Evangelist Officer.\nInvictus operates two cannabis production sites under the ACMPR in Canada and has over 95,000 square feet of cannabis production capacity at the licensed production sites. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary Acreage Pharms located in West-Central Alberta on 150 acres, has approximately 40,000 square feet of cannabis ready production with its recently completed Phase 2 expansion. The Company intends on expanding to 120,000 square feet by the end of 2018 once Phase 3 is complete.\nInvictus also owns 50% of AB Labs, a licensed producer under the ACMPR located in Hamilton, Ontario. AB Labs currently operates in a 16,000 square foot facility and recently acquired a facility adjacent to the existing property that will allow for a total of 56,000 square feet of cultivation space expected to be ready for production by June 2018. During the first quarter of 2018 AB Labs submitted a secondary license to Health Canada for a nearby property on 100 acres under the name AB Ventures.\nCombined, the licensed producers owned by Invictus expect to have approximately 200,000 square feet of cannabis production capacity by the end of 2018 and 520,000 square feet of cannabis production capacity by the end of 2019.\nIn addition to the ACMPR licenses, the Company has an 82.5% investment in Future Harvest Development Ltd. a high quality Fertilizer and Nutrients manufacturer based in Kelowna, British Columbia that has been in operation for over 20 years under the brand Plant Life Products and Holland Secret.\nFor more information, please visit www.invictus-md.com .\nOn Behalf of the Board,\nDan Kriznic\nChairman & CEO\nLarry Heinzlmeir\nVice President, Marketing & Communications\n604-537-8676\nIn the United States\nTerry Wills\ntwills@willscom.com\n310-877-1458\nSquare Footage\nCompany\nPhase\nProvince\nCurrent\n31-Dec-18\n31-Dec-19\nAcreage Pharms\n1\nAlberta\n7,000\n7,000\n7,000\nAcreage Pharms\n2\nAlberta\n33,000\n33,000\n33,000\nAcreage Pharms\n3\nAlberta\n80,000\n80,000\nAcreage Pharms\n4\nAlberta\n240,000\nTotal Acreage Pharms\n40,000\n120,000\n360,000\nAB Laboratories\n1\nOntario\n16,000\n16,000\n16,000\nAB Laboratories\n2\nOntario\n40,000\n40,000\nTotal AB Laboratories\n16,000\n56,000\n56,000\nAB Ventures\n1\nOntario\n21,000\n21,000\nAB Ventures\n2\nOntario\n80,000\n80,000\nTotal AB Ventures\n-\n101,000\n101,000\nOption Co\n1\nBritish Columbia\n50,000\n50,000\nOption Co\n2\nBritish Columbia\n250,000\nTotal Option Co\n-\n50,000\n300,000\nTotal Combined\n56,000\n327,000\n817,000\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: This release includes certain statements and information that may constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws or forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
