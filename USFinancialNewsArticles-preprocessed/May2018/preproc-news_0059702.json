    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France started their preparations for the World Cup with a solid 2-0 friendly win over Ireland on Monday as Olivier Giroud scored a landmark goal.\nSoccer Football - International Friendly - France vs Republic of Ireland - Stade de France, Paris, France - May 28, 2018 France’s Blaise Matuidi shoots at goal REUTERS/Charles Platiau Giroud netted the opener to join Zinedine Zidane as France’s fourth highest all-time leading goalscorer and Nabil Fekir claimed the second before the break as Les Bleus kept their first clean sheet in four games.\nThey also have scored two goals or more in their last six matches.\nSoccer Football - International Friendly - France vs Republic of Ireland - Stade de France, Paris, France - May 28, 2018 France coach Didier Deschamps as Antoine Griezmann waits to come on as substitute REUTERS/Charles Platiau France will take on Australia, Denmark and Peru in World Cup Group C. Ireland have not qualified for the finals.\nSlideshow (5 Images) France coach Didier Deschamps left his best striker Antoine Griezmann on the bench with Fekir starting alongside Giroud and Kylian Mbappe and the decision paid off.\nGiroud scored his 31st goal in 72 internationals in the 40th minute. His header from Fekir’s corner was saved on the line by Colin Doyle but the Chelsea striker poked in the rebound.\nOnly Thierry Henry (51), Michel Platini (41) and David Trezeguet (34) have scored more goals for France.\nThree minutes later, Doyle’s error helped Fekir double the tally with a powerful shot from just inside the box.\nIreland failed to muster a single attempt on target until stoppage time, when France keeper Steve Mandanda denied Shaun Williams.\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
