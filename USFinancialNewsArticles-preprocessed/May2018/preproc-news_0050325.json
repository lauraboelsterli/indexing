It’s taking much longer,” he said.\nThe world’s fifth-largest generic medicines maker is pinning its hopes on the launch this year of three specialty drugs: Yonsa for a type of prostate cancer, another, named OTX101, to treat dry eye, and Ilumya for psoriasis.\n“We want to find a new engine of growth and that is why we are investing in this,” Shanghvi said, adding: “We will have to incur significant expenses for these important launches.”\nThirty-six analysts polled by Reuters expect Sun’s fiscal 2019 revenue to come in at 300.36 billion Indian rupees ($4.43 billion) - about 13 percent higher than the 264.89 billion rupees for 2018.\nWhile fourth-quarter profit was better than expected, helped by an uptick in India and emerging markets, revenue in the United States, which accounts for almost 35 percent of the total, fell 3 percent, Sun said here\nRivals Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd and Lupin Ltd reported weak March-quarter earnings this week, blaming pricing pressures. $1 = 67.7800 Indian rupees Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in Mumbai and Arnab Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Louise Heavens",
