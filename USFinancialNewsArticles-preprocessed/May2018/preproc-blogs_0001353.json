    "text": "Australia: UPDATE 2-Australia’s CBA ordered to boost capital until governance failings fixed May 2nd, 2018 Australia\nAustralia’s banking regulator slugged Commonwealth Bank of Australia with an extra A$1 billion ($753 million) capital requirement on Tuesday as it released a scathing report into how the lender allowed money laundering to flourish.\nAustralia’s largest bank had a “widespread sense of complacency” and was reactive in dealing with risk, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) said in the report into the culture that led to the money laundering allegations.\nThe findings pile pressure on the board of Commonwealth Bank following the resignation of chief executive Ian Narev in January, and add to the ignominy heaped on Australia’s top financial firms in recent weeks by an ongoing judicial inquiry into banking sector wrongdoing.\n uk.reuters.com",
