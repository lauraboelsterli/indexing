    "text": "WUHAN CITY, China, May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Renmin Tianli Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABAC) (\"Renmin Tianli\" or the \"Company\"), a producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, with headquarters in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, today announced its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nMr. Luchang Zhou, Chief Executive Officer of Renmin Tianli, commented, \"With total number of hogs sold increasing by 23.7% year-over-year, our hog farming business performed well during the first quarter that more than offset the decrease in blended average selling price (\"ASP\") and the moderate decrease in our retail business, leading to an 8.2% increase in total revenues and improvement in both margins and profitability. Looking ahead, as we continue to focus on improving our inventory turnover rate and managing our expenses, we anticipate a stabilization in our hog farming business despite uncertainty in hog pricing and feed costs.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n($ thousands, except per share data)\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nRevenues\n$ 7,230\n$ 6,681\n8.2%\nHog farming\n6,667\n5,974\n11.6%\nRetail\n562\n707\n-20.5%\nGross margin\n16.2%\n14.0%\n2.1 pp\nOperating margin\n2.6%\n0.4%\n2.1 pp\nNet Income (loss)\n204\n33\n515.0%\nEarnings (loss) per share\n0.025\n0.004\n515.3%\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by $0.55 million, or 8.2%, to $7.23 million from $6.68 million for the same period of last year. The increase in overall revenues was due to an increase in revenues from regular hog sales partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our black hog program.\nRevenues from hog farming, which includes sales of regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs, and black hogs, increased by $0.69 million, or 11.6%, to $6.67 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $5.97 million for the same period of last year. The Company sold a total of 37,373 regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs and black hogs with a blended average selling price of $178 per hog during the first quarter of 2018, compared to 30,217 hogs sold and a blended average selling price of $198 per hog for the same period of last year.\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNo. of\nHogs\nSold\nAverage\nPrice/Hog\n($)\nSales\n($'000)\nNo. of\nHogs\nSold\nAverage\nPrice/Hog\n($)\nSales\n($'000)\nBreeder hogs- regular hogs\n3,810\n$ 265\n$ 1,009\n2,837\n$ 245\n$ 696\nMarket hogs- regular hogs\n22,308\n152\n3,384\n16,792\n169\n2,845\nMarket hogs- black hogs\n11,255\n202\n2,275\n10,588\n230\n2,432\nTotal Hog Farming\n37,373\n178\n6,667\n30,217\n198\n5,974\nKilogram\nAverage\nPrice/kg\n($)\nSales\n($'000)\nKilogram\nAverage\nPrice/kg\n($)\nSales\n($'000)\nRetail- specialty black hog pork products\n107,471\n$ 5\n$ 562\n136,682\n$ 5\n$ 707\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 from regular breeder hog sales increased by 44.9% to $1.01 million with the number of regular breeder hogs sold increasing by 34.3% to 3,810 hogs and the average selling price of regular breeder hogs increasing by 7.9% to $265 per hog. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 from regular market hog sales increased by 18.9% to $3.38 million as the number of regular market hogs sold increased by 32.8% to 22,308 hogs while the average selling price of regular market hogs decreased by 10.5% to $152 per hog. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 from black market hogs decreased by 6.5% to $2.28 million with the number of black hogs sold increasing by 6.3% to 11,255 hogs and the average selling price of black hogs decreasing by 12.0% to $202 per hog.\nWe sold 107,471 kilograms of specialty black hog pork products through retail at approximately $5 per kilogram, generating revenues of $0.56 million for the first quarter of 2018. This compared to136,682 kilograms sold at approximately $5 per kilogram and revenues of $0.71 million for the same period of last year. These revenues, combined with the sales of black market hogs, led to $2.84 million in revenues from our black hog program for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.14 million for the same period of last year.\nGross profit\nCost of goods sold increased by $0.32 million, or 5.5%, to $6.06 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $5.74 million for the same period of last year.

Cost of goods sold for retail decreased by $0.10 million, or 20.5%, to $0.38 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $0.48 million for the same period of last year.\nOverall gross profit increased by $0.23 million, or 24.7%, to $1.17 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $0.94 million for the same period of last year. This increase in our gross profit was primarily related to an increase in gross profit of $0.28 million, or 39.2%, for our hog farming segment and partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of $0.05 million, or 20.2%, for retail. Gross profit for hog farming and retail were $0.99 million and $0.18 million, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.71 million and $0.23 million, respectively, for the same period of last year.\nOverall gross margin was 16.2%, with gross margins for hog farming and retail of 14.8% and 32.4%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018.
