FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo\nRussia has said it would block access to Facebook unless the social network complies with legislation requiring websites which store the personal data of Russian citizens to do so on Russian servers. [nL8N1M73C6]\n“We will take a decision based on the result of these checks,” Alexander Zharov, Rokomnadzor’s chief, was quoted as saying by TASS.
