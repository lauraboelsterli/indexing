    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that there will be a trilateral NAFTA meeting at 1 p.m. Eastern Time with his U.S. and Canadian counterparts, even as he warned against rushing a new deal.\n“I have to make very clear (that) the quality of the agreement and the balance of the agreement has to be maintained. So we are not going to sacrifice balance and quality for time,” Guajardo told reporters on the doorsteps of the U.S. Trade Representative’s office.\nU.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan set a May 17 deadline to be notified of a new North American Free Trade Agreement to give the current Congress a chance of passing it, but Mexico’s top trade official said time was running short to meet such a deadline.
