These estimates and the sources of the fund's dividends and distributions are determined in accordance with accounting principles applicable to the fund. These principles may vary from those applicable to the characterization of distributions under federal tax law and, accordingly, federal tax law treatment will likely vary from the estimated characterization above. In addition, the sources of dividends are estimated at the time of declaration. Actual results will vary from these estimates. A non-taxable return of capital, if any, cannot be determined until after the end of the fund's fiscal year. In January 2019, you will receive final information as to the federal tax status of this and other distributions from the fund in the preceding calendar year.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006411/en/\nPUTNAM SHAREHOLDERS CONTACT :\n1-800-225-1581\nSource: The Putnam Funds",
