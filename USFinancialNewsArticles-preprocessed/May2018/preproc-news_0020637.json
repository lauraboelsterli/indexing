    "text": "NEW YORK, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PDL Community Bancorp, (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:PDLB), the holding company for Ponce Bank (the “Bank”), reported net income of $941,000, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $563,000 for the same period in 2017. The Company was formed on September 29, 2017 in conjunction with the reorganization of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, Ponce Bank’s predecessor, into Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, a mutual holding company. Accordingly, the Company’s financial results of prior periods are solely those of Ponce Bank.\n“As we head into our first full calendar year as a public company, we are heartened that the key initiatives we have focused on are delivering expected results, and more,” said Steven A. Tsavaris, Executive Chairman. Carlos P. Naudon, President and CEO, noted that “we are pleased to report $24.3 million in internal loan growth during the first quarter of 2018, or a 12.3% annualized rate of growth.”\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $8.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $1.4 million, or 19.2%, from $7.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 reflects a $1.9 million, or 21.8%, increase in total interest and dividend income offset by an increase of $537,000, or 35.9%, in total interest expense. The net interest rate spread and net interest margin were 3.61% and 3.95%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.88% and 4.09%, respectively, for the same period in 2017. The increase in interest and dividend income is primarily due to growth in the investor-owned one-to-four family, multifamily, nonresidential, and construction and land loans, that provided an increase in average outstanding loans of $154.3 million or 23.3%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The yield on loans decreased to 5.16% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 5.26% for the same period in 2017. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in average certificates of deposits of $67.8 million or 18.7% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The cost on certificates of deposits increased to 1.65% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 1.47% for the same period in 2017. The cost of all interest-bearing liabilities increased to 1.26% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 1.05% for the same period in 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $885,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $127,000, or 16.8%, from $758,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase is mainly attributed to gains of $176,000 on loans sold combined with an increase of $28,000 in prepayment charges related to mortgage loans offset by decreases in late charges on loans of $23,000, brokerage commission income of $21,000, and line of credit fees $16,000.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expenses were $8.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $1.2 million, or 16.9%, from $7.1 million for the same period in 2017. The increase is mainly attributed to an increase of $629,000 in total compensation and benefits expense which included $189,000 in Employee Stock Ownership Plan expense and an increase of $425,000 in professional services.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets decreased to $9.3 million or 0.98% of total assets at March 31, 2018 from $11.4 million or 1.23% of total assets at December 31, 2017. The decrease is mainly attributed to decrease in nonaccruals of $847,000 in investor-owned one-to-four family residential, a decrease of $383,000 in owner-occupied one-to-four family residential, a decrease of $521,000 in multifamily residential properties, a decrease of $272,000 in nonresidential properties and a decrease of $117,000 in business loans. Additionally, 3 non-accruing loans totaling $1.8 million were sold for a net gain of $142,000 during the quarter. One of the loans sold included a recovery of $170,000.\nProvision for loan losses was $94,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $52,000 for the same period in 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $11.4 million, or 1.37%, of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $11.1 million, or 1.37%, of total loans at December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs totaled $5,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10,000 for the same period in 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $24.1 million, or 2.6%, to $949.6 million at March 31, 2018 from $925.5 million at December 31, 2017. Net loans increased $24.3 million, or 3.0%, to $823.0 million at March 31, 2018 from $798.7 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in net loans was primarily attributed to increases of $15.9 million in multifamily residential and $7.3 million in nonresidential properties.\nTotal deposits increased $38.3 million, or 5.4%, to $752.3 million at March 31, 2018 from $714.0 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in deposits was primarily attributed to increases in certificates of deposits of $26.9 million and an increase of $7.0 million in demand deposits.\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $165.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $164.8 million at December 31, 2017. The Company and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements to be deemed well-capitalized at March 31, 2018. The Bank’s total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 20.55%, the tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio and the common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 19.29%, the tier 1 capital to total assets ratio was 14.27% at March 31, 2018 compared to 20.73%, 19.48%, and 14.67% at December 31, 2017 respectively.\nThe Annual Meeting of Stockholders of PDL Community Bancorp will be held at our administrative office located at 2244 Westchester Avenue, Bronx, New York 10462 on May 10, 2018, at 10:00 am, local time.\nAbout PDL Community Bancorp\nPDL Community Bancorp is the holding company for Ponce Bank.
