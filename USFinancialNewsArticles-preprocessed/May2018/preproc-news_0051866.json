FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of the Deutsche Bank is pictured in Frankfurt, Germany, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo\nThe transfer was a human error and not related to faulty technology, said a person familiar with the matter. It was corrected within a few hours and didnâ€™t result in any financial damages.\nBloomberg News first reported the mistake.\nIn March, Deutsche Bank transferred 28 billion euros ($33 billion) instead of 28 billion yen ($257 million) to its own account at the derivative exchange Eurex.
