REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde/File Photo\nThe draft laws, posted on the Nigerian legislature’s website on April 30, are the versions intended for the Senate, the upper house of parliament.\nThe PIB aims to improve transparency, attract investors, stimulate growth and increase government revenues.\nAfter being debated for well over a decade, the unwieldly and contentious legislation was broken into sections to help it pass into law.\nThe governance part of the bill was passed by both houses of parliament in January. However, that section has not yet been signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, who is also Nigeria’s oil minister.\nThe inability to pass the law and uncertainty around taxation has stunted investment in the west African nation, particularly in deep-water oil and gas fields.\nThe three PIB sections yet to be passed address fiscal and administrative issues and local communities affected by the oil industry.\nOn Tuesday, Senate President Bukola Saraki told Reuters Nigeria’s parliament aims to pass the long-delayed PIB by the end of July.\nThe administrative bill largely deals with the scope of the Nigerian Petroleum Regulatory Commission, which would be the main body regulating the oil and gas sector in the country.\nThe commission would have the power to grant, amend and revoke licences for all kinds of activity in the industry, from exploration and drilling to distribution and sales. It would also make public all those licenses, permits and authorizations, as well as the details of interests or shares held.\nThe bill sets the time limits for various kinds of licenses: three years for an exploration license, 25 years for onshore petroleum licenses and 30 years for deep offshore.\nThe draft seeks to put an end to Nigeria’s subsidies for petroleum products, with a “short transition towards full market pricing”, within a year of the bill being signed into law.\n“The President may direct the Commission to negotiate and award Petroleum Licenses to qualified investors outside of the bidding process,” the draft also said.\nThe fiscal bill sets out the rates of tax and royalties for various oil and gas enterprises, as well as various breaks such as upstream gas operations receiving a tax-free period of five years from the start of production.\nAdditional tax will also be charged when crude prices exceed $60 a barrel, the draft said.\nThe third draft section of the PIB addresses communities that host or are affected by oil and gas sector work.\nFor decades, communities in the Niger Delta oil heartland have complained that spills and pollution have destroyed their land and killed off wildlife.\nRights group Amnesty International accused international oil majors Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Eni SpA in March of negligence when addressing spills in Nigeria.\nOther oil majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp, Total SA and Chevron Corp also operate in Nigeria.\nThe draft bill seeks to address some of those concerns by making companies whose operations are in or near communities set up a trust, with a fund, for the benefit of those people.\nFailure to do so would result in the suspension of their license, the draft said.\nCompanies would have to contribute 2.5 percent of annual operating expenditure for work in that area into the trust’s fund, which would then be used to improve infrastructure, job creation, education and health facilities.
