    "text": "CARLSBAD, Calif., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SeaSpine Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:SPNE), a global medical technology company focused on surgical solutions for the treatment of spinal disorders, announced today financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSummary First Quarter 2018 Financial Results and Recent Accomplishments\nRevenue of $33.2 million, an increase of 4.0% year-over-year U.S. revenue of $29.5 million, an increase of 3.2% year-over-year U.S. Orthobiologics revenue of $15.8 million, a 4.9% increase year-over-year U.S. Spinal Implants revenue of $13.7 million, a 1.4% increase year-over-year International revenue of $3.6 million, an increase of 10.8% year-over-year Transitioned OsteoBallast™ Demineralized Bone Matrix in Resorbable Mesh to full commercial launch\n“We are pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect solid revenue growth in both our Orthobiologics and Spinal Implants portfolios, as well as operational efficiencies,” said Keith Valentine, President and Chief Executive Officer. “As we continue to upgrade our distribution footprint, we are well positioned to leverage our recently launched products and development pipeline across both franchises to deliver clinical value to surgeons, hospitals, and patients.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $33.2 million, a 4.0% increase compared to the same period of the prior year. Total U.S. revenue was $29.5 million, a 3.2% increase compared to the same period of the prior year.\nOrthobiologics revenue totaled $18.0 million, a 5.2% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017, and was led by growth in our DBM franchise. Spinal Implants revenue totaled $15.2 million, a 2.6% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017, and was driven by growth in the Shoreline and Mariner systems.\nGross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 63.3%, compared to 58.7% for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by lower raw material and manufacturing costs for orthobiologics products manufactured at the Company's Irvine, California facility.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $28.0 million, compared to $27.8 million for the same period of the prior year. The $0.2 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher selling and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower R&D and general and administrative expenses.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.1 million, compared to a net loss of $9.1 million for the same period of the prior year.\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 totaled $12.5 million and the Company had no outstanding borrowings against its $30 million credit facility. The Company realized $8.5 million in net proceeds in the first quarter of 2018 through the sale of its common stock under its \"at the market\" equity offering program.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nSeaSpine reiterates expectations for full-year 2018 revenue to be in the range of $135 to $139 million, reflecting growth of 2.5% to 5.5% over full-year 2017 revenue.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nThe Company’s management team will host a conference call beginning today at 1:30pm PT/4:30pm ET to discuss the financial results and recent business developments.

Such include, but are not limited to, statements relating to: the Company's expectations to leverage recently launched products and development pipeline to deliver clinical value; and the Company’s expectations for full-year 2018 revenue. Among the factors that could cause or contribute to material differences between the Company’s actual results and the expectations indicated by the are that include, but are not limited to: surgeons’ willingness to continue to use the Company’s existing products and to adopt its newly launched products, including the risk that the Company’s products do not demonstrate adequate safety or efficacy, independently or relative to competitive products, to support expected levels of demand or pricing; the ability of newly launched products to perform as designed and intended and to meet the needs of surgeons and patients, including as a result of the lack of clinical validation of products in limited commercial (or “alpha”) launch; the Company’s ability to attract new, high-quality distributors, whether as a result of inability to reach agreement on financial or other contractual terms or otherwise, disruption to the Company’s existing distribution network as new distributors are added, and the ability of new distributors to generate growth or offset disruption to existing distributors; continued pricing pressure, whether as a result of consolidation in hospital systems, competitors or others, as well as exclusion from major healthcare systems, whether as a result of unwillingness to provide required pricing or otherwise; the risk of supply shortages and the associated, potentially long-term disruption to product sales, including as a result of the Company’s dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers for components and raw materials, or otherwise; unexpected expense and delay, including as a result of developing and supporting the launch of new products, the fact that newly launched products may require substantial additional development activities, which could introduce further expense and delay, or as a result of obtaining regulatory clearances; the Company’s ability to continue to invest in medical education and training, product development, and/or sales and marketing initiatives at levels sufficient to drive future revenue growth, including as a result of its inability to obtain funding on a timely basis on acceptable terms, or at all; general economic and business conditions in the markets in which the Company does business, both in the U.S. and abroad; and other more fully described in the Company’s news releases and periodic filings with the .
