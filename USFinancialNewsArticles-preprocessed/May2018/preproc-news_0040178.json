    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, a long-time critic of the royal family, will be busy attending engagements and conferences during Saturday’s wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, his spokesman said on Wednesday.\nBritain's Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses a rally, part of the TUC's ‘A New Deal for Working People’ campaign, in central London, Britain, May 12, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth and sixth-in-line to the throne, and Markle, a star in U.S. TV drama “Suits”, will tie the knot next Saturday at Windsor Castle, home to the British royal family for nearly 1,000 years.\nCorbyn wished the couple well during a question and answer session in parliament, and praised Harry’s charity work on raising mental health awareness.\nBut, asked whether the 68-year-old republican would be watching live on television, his spokesman said: “Well, there’s always catch up, isn’t there?” referring to on-demand TV services.\nHe said Corbyn had various engagements scheduled for the weekend including an economic conference.\nA spokesman for the royal couple announced in April that British and international political leaders would not be invited to attend the wedding.\nReporting by William James; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
