    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- North American Nickel Inc. (TSX VENTURE:NAN) (OTCBB:WSCRF) (CUSIP: 65704T 108) (the \"Company\" or “NAN”) is pleased to announce that it has appointed Sarah-Wenjia Zhu as Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\nMrs. Zhu has over 15 years of financing and accounting experience in the public and private equity market with a focus on the Natural Resources sector. Formerly, she held the position of Investment Manager with The Sentient Group. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Accounting from Guangdong University of Finance & Economics and an MBA from the John Molson Business School of Concordia University. Prior to this Mrs. Zhu spent six years on an audit and systems risk consulting business with Deloitte China and gained her accounting qualification (CICPA) before migrating to Canada in 2004. She is also a CFA charter holder.\nNAN CEO, Keith Morrison, commented: “I am very pleased to welcome Sarah to NAN as our new CFO. Sarah brings a combination of skills and experience that will add to both our board and executive teams as we manage the continued growth of the company.\nI would like to thank Mr. Chris Hopkins for his commitment and leadership as CFO for the Company and wish him the best in the future.”\nThe Company has also granted incentive stock options to certain officers and consultants of the Company to purchase up to 700,000 common shares in the capital of the Company pursuant to the Company's stock option plan. All options are exercisable for a period of five years at an exercise price of $0.12 per share.\nAbout North American Nickel\nNorth American Nickel is a mineral exploration company with 100% owned properties in Maniitsoq, Greenland and Sudbury, Ontario.\nThe Maniitsoq property in Greenland is a Camp scale permitted exploration project comprising 2,985 square km covering numerous high-grade nickel-copper + cobalt sulphide occurrences associated with norite and other mafic-ultramafic intrusions of the Greenland Norite Belt (GNB). The >75km-long belt is situated along, and near, the southwest coast of Greenland accessible from the existing Seqi deep water port with an all year-round shipping season and hydroelectric power potential from a quantified watershed.\nThe Post Creek/Halcyon property in Sudbury is strategically located adjacent to the past producing Podolsky copper-nickel-platinum group metal deposit of KGHM International Ltd. The property lies along the extension of the Whistle Offset dyke structure. Such geological structures host major Ni-Cu-PGM deposits and producing mines within the Sudbury Camp.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” and “forward-looking information” under applicable securities laws concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of the Company. Forward-looking statements and forward-looking information include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the timing and completion of the Placement, and the availability of regulatory approvals for the Placement. Except for statements of historical fact relating to the Company, certain information contained herein constitutes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as “plan,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “believe,” “anticipate”, “estimate” and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” occur. Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the statements are made and are based on several assumptions and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Many of these assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of the Company and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct.\nFactors that could cause actual results to vary materially from results anticipated by such forward-looking statements include the inability to obtain regulatory approvals required in relation to the Placement. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Investors and others who rely on forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail. The Company believes that the expectations reflected in those forward-looking statements are reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements included in this press release should not be unduly relied upon. These statements speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management’s estimates or opinions should change except as required by applicable securities laws.\nAlthough the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended. Statements concerning mineral reserve and resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements to the extent they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered if the property is developed.\nStatements about the Company's future expectations and all other statements in this press release other than historical facts are \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as that term defined in the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbours created thereby. Since these statements involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change at any time, the Company's actual results may differ materially from the expected results.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nMark Fedikow\nPresident\nNorth American Nickel Inc.\nFor more information contact:\nNorth American Nickel Inc.\nJaclyn Ruptash\nCorporate Communications\n604-770-4334\nToll free: 1-866-816-0118\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource: North American Nickel Inc.",
