    "text": "EditorsNote: adds “Bryce” in next-to-last graf\nWashington first baseman Matt Adams singled home the tiebreaking run in the 11th inning, and the Nationals won for the 10th time in 12 games, posting a 2-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Thursday night in Phoenix.\nTrea Turner singled and Anthony Rendon walked to open the 11th off Fernando Salas (3-4) before Andrew Chafin entered and gave up Adams’ single.\nDavid Peralta and Daniel Descalso had two hits apiece for the Diamondbacks (24-13), who have the best record in the National League and are 10-0-2 in series this season.\nThe Thursday contest opened a four-game series.\nBrandon Kintzler (1-2) stranded runners on second and third in the 10th inning, and Sean Doolittle pitched around a one-out single in the 11th for his seventh save.\nMichael A. Taylor, Howie Kendrick and Pedro Severino doubled, and Tanner Roark gave up one run in seven innings for Washington. Roark struck out four and did not walk a batter.\nDiamondbacks right-hander Zack Greinke gave up four hits and one run in seven-plus innings, with six strikeouts and no walks. He left after giving up Taylor’s double leading off the eighth inning, when Washington tied the game at 1.\nTaylor took third on Wilmer Difo’s sacrifice bunt and scored when reliever Archie Bradley balked. Bradley made a move to throw third base out of the stretch but hesitated and restarted after noticing third baseman Descalso was not covering the base.\nArizona took a 1-0 lead in the fifth when Ketel Marte singled, took second and scored when Grienke slapped a slider into short left field. Greinke stole second on the first pitch to Peralta but was stranded there. Greinke is 6-for-6 in stolen-base attempts in his career.\nGreinke joins Joe Saunders and Braden Shipley as the only pitchers in Arizona history with a hit, an RBI and a stolen base in the same game.\nBryce Harper singled to right field on the fourth pitch of the game to snap an 0-for-19 skid. He had been hitless since homering twice in a 7-3 victory over Philadelphia on May 4. He was given his first day off Wednesday, a 2-1 loss in San Diego, and he finished 1-for-5 on Thursday.\nWashington catcher Matt Wieters was removed with an apparent left knee injury sustained on a single to center field leading off the second inning. Severino entered to run and stayed in the game behind the plate.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
