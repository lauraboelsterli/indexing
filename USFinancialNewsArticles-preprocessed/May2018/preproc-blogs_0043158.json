Of those, the biggest prize would be an agreement with the U.S., the U.K.’s biggest national trading partner, writes Stephen Fidler.\nLifting Trump’s Playbook Is Risky for Europe : Flattery, charm and traditional diplomacy failed to stop U.S. President Donald Trump from pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, exiting the Paris climate accord and threatening tariffs on European steel and aluminum. So now, with relations between the U.S. and the European Union at their lowest ebb in 70 years, they are ramping up the rhetoric, writes Simon Nixon.\nCity of London Pushes for Immigration Overhaul After Brexit : The U.K. finance industry has called for wide-ranging reforms of the British immigration system in order to maintain the pipeline of global talent into the sector, in one of the City of London’s biggest interventions into the Brexit debate so far.\nThe Euro’s Headache: Growth, Not Italian Politics : Italy is back in the headlines and the euro is falling, giving up all its gains and more against the dollar this year to move below $1.18. But while the formation of an antiestablishment government in Rome is a headwind, there are bigger forces at work: the currency market has been rethinking the global growth story, writes Richard Barley.\nIran Uses Nuclear Pact as Bargaining Chip With EU Over U.S. Sanctions : Iran vowed to uphold the pact curbing its nuclear activities if the European Union can offset renewed U.S. sanctions, senior officials here said, advocating an approach that would widen a deepening schism between Washington and Brussels.\nNATO Pushes New Antiterror Efforts to Quell Unease of Southern Members : As NATO relocates its headquarters in Brussels, an Italian Renaissance oil painting is going elsewhere, a departure some alliance officials say points to a deeper problem with the organization’s mission and cohesion.\nGreece Steps Closer to Completing Bailout Review : Greece and its international creditors have reached an initial agreement on the reforms Athens must adopt thus paving the way for the completion of the bailout review, the country’s last after an eight-year bailout regime.\nData-Privacy Law Creates New Business for Tech Consultants : The European Union’s tough new data-protection law demands costly changes for many companies—and opens rich business opportunities for others.\nRoyal Wedding: How Will Meghan Markle Adapt to Life in Britain’s Monarchy? : Members of Britain’s Royal family don’t vote and are expected to remain politically neutral. This video explores how Meghan Markle, a humanitarian activist and star of the hit show “Suits,” will adapt to her new life.\n‘Gammon,’ a Porcine Term, Boosts Britons’ Diet of Insults : A tongue-in-cheek political insult has been causing some controversy in Great Britain lately. Britons are applying “gammon,” a term for a cured hind leg of pork to a stereotypical image of an older conservative white man, whose complexion and pudginess are seen as resembling the cut of meat.\nIN THE PAPERS\nPolitical Novice Giuseppe Conte Emerges as Frontrunner to be Italy PM – Financial Times\nLondon is Awash with Russian ‘Dirty Money’ and It’s Damaging Britain, Say U.K. Politicians – Quartz\nRoman Abramovich Awaits Decision on U.K. Visa – The Times\nU.K. Conservatives Split by Brexit Seek to Unite for Survival – Bloomberg\nCity of London is Already Dying – Politico\nBe the first with intelligence for an ambitious day.
