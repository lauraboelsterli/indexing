    "text": "The S&P 500 traded lower on Friday as tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on investor sentiment while both countries continued negotiations on trade.\nThe broad index fell 0.2 percent with consumer staples and lagging. The Nasdaq composite also declined 0.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average bucked the negative trend, rising 7 points as Boeing and Caterpillar shares rose 2 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.\nOn Thursday, the two largest economies in the world began the second round of trade talks. But President Donald Trump told reporters he doubted the negotiations would be successful.\nLater, reports emerged saying China would offer the U.S. a $200 billion trade surplus cut. Those reports, however, were quickly denied by a Chinese ministry spokesman on Friday. \"This rumor is not true. This I can confirm to you,\" the spokesman said. \"As I understand, the relevant consultations are ongoing and they are constructive.\"\nBrendan McDermid | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange \"All of the news we're getting on trade is incremental, unfortunately,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. \"Unless you're in the room, it's hard to get a feel for how these negotiations are going.\"\nTensions between the U.S. and China have increased in recent months as both countries have hit each other with tariffs targeting some of their exports.\nThe major indexes were on track to post slight weekly losses. Entering Friday's session, the Dow was down 0.5 percent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had declined 0.3 percent each. The move lower this week took place after the averages jumped more than 2 percent last week.\nHelping push stocks lower this week were higher interest rates. The benchmark 10-year note yield broke above 3.1 percent for the first time since 2011 this week, while the two-year yield traded at its highest level in nearly 10 years. Fears of the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy faster than expected have pushed investors to sell Treasurys recently.\nIn corporate news, Nordstrom shares dropped nearly 10 percent after the Seattle-based retailer reported same-store sales that missed analyst expectations . The miss was enough to overshadow better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the first quarter.\nApplied Materials also dropped about 8 percent after the company issued guidance that disappointed investors.",
