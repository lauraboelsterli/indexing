    "text": "Kenta Maeda struck out 12 over 6 2/3 scoreless innings Wednesday as the Los Angeles Dodgers blanked the visiting Colorado Rockies 3-0 for their sixth victory in seven games.\nThe right-hander has thrown 14 2/3 scoreless innings over his last two outings, striking out 20 since making a mechanical adjustment designed to slow down his delivery.\nMaeda (4-3) threw a career-high 111 pitches Wednesday, giving up just two hits for the second consecutive start. He walked four.\nLogan Forsythe hit an RBI double during a two-run fourth inning. Yasiel Puig and Matt Kemp also drove in runs for the Dodgers, and Justin Turner had hits in back-to-back at-bats to end a 1-for-14 skid. Los Angeles took two of three in the series.\nSince moving into sole possession of first place in the National League West for the first time on Monday, the Rockies have lost consecutive games, though they remain in the top spot in the division.\nRockies starter Kyle Freeland (4-5) gave up three runs on six hits over 6 1/3 innings, losing for the first time since April 30. He walked three and fanned three. Freeland entered the day 3-0 in May with a 1.35 ERA, fifth best in the NL.\nMaeda gave up a pair of walks over the first three innings but did not give up his first hit until Ian Desmond singled with one out in the fifth. Maeda closed his outing by recording 10 of his final 11 outs by strikeout.\nKenley Jansen struck out three in the ninth inning for his 10th save in 12 chances. He has delivered eight consecutive scoreless outings after struggling early in the season.\nAfter getting swept at home by the Cincinnati Reds earlier this month and losing a series at Miami against the Marlins, the Dodgers have won consecutive series against the Washington Nationals and now the Rockies.\nColorado lost consecutive games at Dodger Stadium after seeing its five-game win streak in Los Angeles end on Tuesday.\nThe Rockies, who lead baseball with 32 road games played, ended their nine-game California road trip to San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles with a 4-5 record. They open a nine-game homestand on Friday, concluding the stretch with the Dodgers’ first trip to Denver this season.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
