    "text": "Jayson Tatum is living the rookie dream.\nMay 15, 2018; Boston, MA, USA; Boston Celtics forward Al Horford (42), forward Jayson Tatum (0), and guard Terry Rozier (12) attempt to control a rebound away from Cleveland Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson (13) during the third quarter in game two of the Eastern conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at TD Garden. Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY Sports His Boston Celtics are two wins from the NBA Finals and he’s leading the way at 18.1 points per game in the playoffs.\nOh, and he just had his flaws picked apart by former Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant in his ESPN show “Detail.”\nTo be clear, that’s a plus in Tatum’s book.\n“That was really cool for me. Growing up, (Bryant) was my favorite player. That was really a special moment for me,” Tatum, the No. 3 pick in last year’s draft, said hours before Saturday’s Game 3 in Cleveland.\n“I’ve probably watched like 25 times already. It’s very helpful information that I can take with me.”\nSo what did Kobe find that Tatum can work on?\nTatum, 20, said Bryant noted how he sometimes points his foot toward midcourt on drives from the corner instead of pointing his foot directly at the basket was the biggest takeaway.\n“It was something that he noticed — and I mean, it made a lot of sense when he pointed it out.”\nGame 3 is at 8:30 p.m. ET on ESPN.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
