    "text": "First quarter 2018 net loss available to shareholders of $67 million as strong segment results were more than offset by net derivative losses Adjusted earnings* of $283 million, driven by favorable investment results and lower expenses Annuity sales grew 35 percent over the first quarter of 2017 Variable annuity assets above CTE95 increased to $2.7 billion, due to solid performance from the company's hedging program\nCHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (“Brighthouse Financial”) (Nasdaq: BHF) announced today its financial results for the first quarter\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nThe company reported a net loss available to shareholders of $67 million in the first quarter of 2018, or $0.56 on a per share basis, compared to a net loss available to shareholders of $349 million in the first quarter of 2017. The company ended the first quarter of 2018 with stockholders’ equity (“book value”) of $13.6 billion, or $113.61 on a per share basis, and book value, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), of $12.8 billion, or $106.93 on a per share basis.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the company reported adjusted earnings of $283 million, or $2.36 on a per share basis.\nAdjusted earnings for the quarter included $5 million of net unfavorable notable items, or $0.04 on a per share basis, including:\n$37 million in establishment costs related to planned technology and branding investments; and $32 million of higher fee income related to previously recaptured business in the Life and Run-off segments.\nCorporate expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $230 million pre-tax, down from $287 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company still expects corporate expenses in the first year post-separation of between $1.0 and $1.1 billion.\nAnnuity sales increased 35 percent quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in sales of Shield and fixed indexed annuities. On a sequential basis, annuity sales decreased by 6 percent due to normal seasonal fluctuations.\n“We are very pleased with our results in the first quarter of 2018, including our strong adjusted earnings performance and outstanding quarter-over-quarter sales growth,” commented Eric Steigerwalt, president and chief executive officer, Brighthouse Financial. “We are confident in our strategy and encouraged by our progress. We intend to continue focusing our efforts on offering simpler, more transparent products, enhancing our broad network of independent distribution partners, and building a recognized and respected brand.”\nKey Metrics (Unaudited, dollars in millions except share and per share amounts)\nAs of or For the 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Total Per share Total Per share Net income (loss) available to shareholders $(67) $(0.56) $(349) N/A Adjusted earnings (1) $283 $2.36 $280 N/A Book value $13,608 $113.61 $15,116 N/A Book value, excluding AOCI $12,807 $106.93 $13,610 N/A Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 119,773,106 N/A N/A N/A Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 119,773,106 N/A N/A N/A Ending common shares outstanding 119,773,106 N/A N/A N/A Ending common shares outstanding - diluted 119,773,106 N/A N/A N/A (1) The company uses the term “adjusted loss” throughout this news release to refer to negative adjusted earnings values. * Information regarding the non-GAAP and other financial measures included in this news release and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures discussion below as well as in the tables that accompany this news release and/or the First Quarter 2018 Brighthouse Financial, Inc. Financial Supplement (which is available on the Brighthouse Financial Investor Relations web page at http://investor.brighthousefinancial.com ). Additional information regarding notable items can be found on page 15 of this news release.\nResults by Business Segment and Corporate & Other (Unaudited, in millions)\nFor the Three Months Ended Adjusted earnings March 31,\n2018 (1) December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Annuities $226 $208 $228 Life $66 $5 $(7) Run-off $50 $(80) $49 Corporate & Other $(59) $859 $10 (1) In the first quarter of 2018, the company completed a re-alignment of invested assets based on statutory target asset requirements across all segments. This invested asset re-alignment did not change earnings in total, but did impact individual segment results.\nSales (Unaudited, in millions)\nFor the 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Annuities (1) $1,256 $1,341 $931 Life $2 $3 $17 (1) Annuities sales include sales of a fixed indexed annuity product sold by MassMutual, representing 90% of gross sales of that product. Sales of this product were $173 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $203 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. There were no sales of this product in the first quarter of 2017. Annuities\nAdjusted earnings in the Annuities segment were $226 million in the current quarter, compared to adjusted earnings of $228 million in the first quarter of 2017 and adjusted earnings of $208 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThere were no notable items in the periods presented. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, adjusted earnings remained flat, reflective of higher net investment income and lower taxes offset by higher deferred acquisition costs (DAC) amortization. On a sequential basis, adjusted earnings reflect higher net investment income, lower expenses and lower taxes. These items were partially offset by higher DAC amortization due to market performance in the quarter.\nAs mentioned above, annuity sales increased 35 percent quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in sales of Shield and fixed indexed annuities. On a sequential basis, annuity sales decreased by 6 percent due to normal seasonal fluctuations.\nLife\nAdjusted earnings in the Life segment were $66 million in the current quarter, compared to an adjusted loss of $7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and adjusted earnings of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe current quarter includes $16 million in favorable notable items. There were no notable items in either the first quarter of 2017 or the fourth quarter of 2017. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, adjusted earnings reflect favorable underwriting. On a sequential basis, adjusted earnings reflect higher net investment income due to portfolio re-alignment, favorable underwriting and lower taxes.\nLife insurance sales were down, consistent with the company's strategy of migrating to simpler life insurance solutions. The company expects life insurance sales to remain at similar levels over the medium term, as it revamps its life insurance business.\nRun-off\nAdjusted earnings in the Run-off segment were $50 million in the current quarter, compared to adjusted earnings of $49 million in the first quarter of 2017 and an adjusted loss of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe current quarter includes $16 million of favorable notable items. The first quarter of 2017 did not include notable items. The fourth quarter of 2017 included $91 million in unfavorable notable items. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, adjusted earnings reflect unfavorable underwriting, partially offset by lower taxes. On a sequential basis, adjusted earnings reflect favorable underwriting, lower expenses and lower taxes.\nCorporate & Other\nCorporate & Other had an adjusted loss of $59 million in the current quarter, compared to adjusted earnings of $10 million in the first quarter of 2017 and adjusted earnings of $859 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe current quarter includes $37 million of unfavorable notable items while the first quarter of 2017 did not include notable items. The fourth quarter of 2017 included $886 million in favorable notable items, primarily related to the enactment of tax reform. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, adjusted earnings reflect lower net investment income and higher expenses. On a sequential basis, adjusted earnings reflect lower expenses, partially offset by lower net investment income.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income for the first quarter was $817 million. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, adjusted net investment income* decreased $33 million to $825 million from lower net derivative investment income. On a sequential basis, adjusted net investment income increased $45 million, primarily as a result of an increase in alternative investment income.\nThe net investment income yield was 4.50 percent during the quarter.\nStatutory Capital and Liquidity (Unaudited, in billions)\nAs of March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Variable annuity assets above CTE95 (1) $2.7 $2.6 N/A Statutory combined total adjusted capital (2) (3) $6.5 $6.6 $4.2 (1)\nConditional Tail Expectation (“CTE”) 95 is defined as the amount of assets required to satisfy contract holder obligations across market environments in the average of the worst 5 percent of 1,000 capital market scenarios over the life of the contracts (“CTE95”).\n(2)\nRepresents combined results for Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY and New England Life Insurance Company.\n(3)\nReflects preliminary statutory results as of March 31, 2018.\nCapitalization\nHolding company liquid assets were $647 million at March 31, 2018.\nStatutory total adjusted capital on a preliminary basis decreased approximately $100 million to $6.5 billion at March 31, 2018, driven by an increase in variable annuity reserves related to market performance.\nAssets above CTE95 increased to $2.7 billion at March 31, 2018, due to solid performance of the company’s hedging program.\nEarnings Conference Call\nBrighthouse Financial plans to hold a conference call and audio webcast to discuss its financial results for the first quarter of 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.\nTo listen to the audio webcast via the internet, please visit the Brighthouse Financial Investor Relations webpage at http://investor.brighthousefinancial.com . To join the conference call via telephone, please dial (844) 358-9117 from within the U.S. or +1-209-905-5952 from outside the U.S.\nA replay of the conference call will be made available until Friday, May 18, 2018 on the Brighthouse Financial Investor Relations webpage at http://investor.brighthousefinancial.com .\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\nOur definitions of the non-GAAP and other financial measures may differ from those used by other companies.\nNon-GAAP Financial Disclosures\nWe present certain measures of our performance that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures highlight our results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business, as well as enhance the understanding of our performance by the investor community.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures, previously referred to as operating measures, should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nNon-GAAP financial measures:\nMost directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\nadjusted earnings net income (loss) available to shareholders adjusted earnings, less notable items net income (loss) available to shareholders adjusted revenues revenues adjusted expenses expenses adjusted earnings per common share earnings per share adjusted earnings per common share, less notable items earnings per share adjusted return on equity return on equity adjusted return on equity, less notable items return on equity adjusted net investment income net investment income Reconciliations to the most directly comparable historical GAAP measures are included for those measures which are presented herein. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable efforts to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income (loss) available to shareholders.\nAdjusted Earnings, Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Expenses\nAdjusted earnings, which may be positive or negative, is used by management to evaluate performance, allocate resources and facilitate comparisons to industry results. This financial measure focuses on our primary businesses principally by excluding (i) the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and (ii) businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by us, referred to as divested businesses.\nAdjusted earnings reflects adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, both net of income tax, and excludes net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Provided below are the adjustments to GAAP revenues and GAAP expenses used to calculate adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses, respectively.\nThe following are significant items excluded from total revenues, net of income tax, in calculating the adjusted revenues component of adjusted earnings:\nNet investment gains (losses); Net derivative gains (losses) except: earned income on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (“Investment Hedge Adjustments”); and Amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (loss) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity GMIB fees (“GMIB Fees”). (1)\nThe following are significant items excluded from total expenses, net of income tax, in calculating the adjusted expenses component of adjusted earnings:\nAmounts associated with benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs (“GMIB Costs”); (1) Amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts (“Market Value Adjustments”); and Amortization of DAC and value of business acquired (\"VOBA\") related to (i) net investment gains (losses), (ii) net derivative gains (losses), (iii) GMIB Fees and GMIB Costs and (iv) Market Value Adjustments. (1)\nThe tax impact of the adjustments mentioned is calculated net of the U.S. statutory tax rate, which could differ from our effective tax rate.\nConsistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance.\nAdjusted Earnings per Common Share and Adjusted Return on Equity\nAdjusted earnings per common share and adjusted return on equity are measures used by management to evaluate the execution of our business strategy and align such strategy with our shareholders’ interests.\nAdjusted earnings per common share is defined as adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average number of fully diluted shares of common stock outstanding for the period.\nAdjusted return on equity is defined as total annual adjusted earnings on a four quarter trailing basis, divided by the simple average of the most recent five quarters of total Brighthouse Financial, Inc.'s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI.\nAdjusted Net Investment Income\nWe present adjusted net investment income to measure our performance for management purposes, and we believe it enhances the understanding of our investment portfolio results. Adjusted net investment income represents net investment income including investment hedge adjustments and excluding the incremental net investment income from consolidated securitization entities (\"CSEs\").\n(1) Collectively, amounts related to GMIB, excluding amounts recorded in NDGL, may be referred to as “GMIB adjustments.” Other Financial Disclosures\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses includes functional department expenses, public company expenses, certain investment expenses, retirement funding and incentive compensation; and excludes establishment costs.\nNotable items\nCertain of the non-GAAP measures described above may be presented further adjusted to exclude notable items. Notable items reflect the impact on our results of certain unanticipated items and events, as well as certain items and events that were anticipated, such as establishment costs. The presentation of notable items and non-GAAP measures, less notable items is intended to help investors better understand our results and to evaluate and forecast those results.\nBook Value per Common Share and Book Value per Common Share, excluding AOCI\nBrighthouse uses the term “book value” to refer to “stockholders’ equity.” Book value per common share is defined as ending Brighthouse Financial, Inc.'s stockholders' equity, including AOCI, divided by ending common shares outstanding - diluted. Book value per common share, excluding AOCI, is defined as ending Brighthouse Financial, Inc.'s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, divided by ending common shares outstanding - diluted.\nCTE95\nAs part of our variable annuity risk management strategy, we intend to support our variable annuity business with assets consistent with those required at a Conditional Tail Expectation (“CTE”) 95 level, which is defined as the amount of assets required to satisfy contract holder obligations across market environments in the average of the worst 5 percent of 1,000 capital market scenarios over the life of the contracts (“CTE95”).\nHolding Company Liquid Assets\nHolding company liquid assets include liquid assets in Brighthouse Financial, Inc., Brighthouse Holdings, LLC, and Brighthouse Services, LLC. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly traded securities excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and collateral financing arrangements.\nSales\nStatistical sales information for Life sales is calculated using the LIMRA definition of sales for core direct sales, excluding company-sponsored internal exchanges, corporate-owned life insurance, bank-owned life insurance, and private placement variable universal life insurance. Annuity sales consist of 100 percent of direct statutory premiums, except for fixed indexed annuity sales distributed through MassMutual that consist of 90 percent of gross sales. Annuity sales exclude company sponsored internal exchanges. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity.\nNet Investment Income Yield\nSimilar to adjusted net investment income, we present net investment income yields as a performance measure we believe enhances the understanding of our investment portfolio results. Net investment income yields are calculated on adjusted net investment income as a percent of average quarterly asset carrying values. Asset carrying values exclude unrealized gains (losses), collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, freestanding derivative assets, collateral received from derivative counterparties and the effects of consolidating under GAAP certain variable interest entities that are treated as CSEs.\nAdjusted Statutory Earnings\nAdjusted statutory earnings is a measure of our ability to pay future distributions and are reflective of whether our hedging program functions as intended. Adjusted statutory earnings is calculated as statutory pre-tax income less the variable annuities reserve methodology (Actuarial Guideline 43) and including both the reserve and capital methodology based CTE95 calculation and unrealized gains (losses) associated with the variable annuities risk management strategy.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe information presented in this news release is derived from the consolidated financial statements of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. for periods subsequent to the separation from MetLife, Inc. that occurred on August 4, 2017, and is derived from the combined financial information of the MetLife U.S. Retail Separation Business for periods prior to the separation. The combined financial information was prepared in connection with the separation of a substantial portion of MetLife, Inc.'s former Retail segment as well as certain portions of its former Corporate Benefit Funding segment, and presents the combined results of operations and financial condition of certain former direct and indirect subsidiaries and certain of its current and former affiliates.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time may contain information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “intend,” “goal,” “target,” “forecast,” “objective,” “continue,” “aim,” “plan,” “believe” and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include, without limitation, statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operating and financial results, as well as statements regarding the expected benefits of the separation from MetLife (the “Separation”) and the recapitalization actions.\nAny or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the actual future results of Brighthouse. These statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Although it is not possible to identify all of these risks and factors, they include, among others: differences between actual experience and actuarial assumptions and the effectiveness of our actuarial models; higher risk management costs and exposure to increased counterparty risk due to guarantees within certain of our products; the effectiveness of our exposure management strategy and the impact of such strategy on net income volatility and negative effects on our statutory capital; the additional reserves we will be required to hold against our variable annuities as a result of actuarial guidelines; a sustained period of low equity market prices and interest rates that are lower than those we assumed when we issued our variable annuity products; our degree of leverage due to indebtedness incurred in connection with the Separation; the effect adverse capital and credit market conditions may have on our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital; the impact of changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies on our insurance business or other operations; the effectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures; the availability of reinsurance and the ability of our counterparties to our reinsurance or indemnification arrangements to perform their obligations thereunder; heightened competition, including with respect to service, product features, scale, price, actual or perceived financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition; changes in accounting standards, practices and/or policies applicable to us; the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders; our ability to market and distribute our products through distribution channels; the impact of the Separation on our business and profitability due to MetLife’s strong brand and reputation, the increased costs related to replacing arrangements with MetLife with those of third parties and incremental costs as a public company; whether the operational, strategic and other benefits of the Separation can be achieved, and our ability to implement our business strategy; whether all or any portion of the Separation tax consequences are not as expected, leading to material additional taxes or material adverse consequences to tax attributes that impact us; the uncertainty of the outcome of any disputes with MetLife over tax-related matters and agreements including the potential of outcomes adverse to us that could cause us to owe MetLife material tax reimbursements or payments; the impact on our business structure, profitability, cost of capital and flexibility due to restrictions we have agreed to that preserve the tax-free treatment of certain parts of the Separation; the potential material negative tax impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other potential future tax legislation that could decrease the value of our tax attributes, lead to increased RBC requirements and cause other cash expenses, such as reserves, to increase materially and make some of our products less attractive to consumers; whether the distribution will qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes and potential indemnification to MetLife if the distribution does not so qualify; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and other factors described from time to time in documents that we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nFor the reasons described above, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statements, which should also be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements included and the risks, uncertainties and other factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, particularly in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” as well as in our periodic reports, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents we file from time to time with the SEC.
