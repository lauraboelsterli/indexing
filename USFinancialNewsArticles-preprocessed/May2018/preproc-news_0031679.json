REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\nThe Commission said in a statement it had “launched the formal process to activate the Blocking Statute by updating the list of U.S. sanctions on Iran falling within its scope,” referring to an EU regulation from 1996.\nEU officials say they are revamping the blocking statute to encompass U.S. President Donald Trump’s May 8 decision to revive Iran-related sanctions, after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including sanctions aimed at Iran’s lifeblood oil sector and transactions with its central bank.

It was developed when the United States tried to penalize foreign companies trading with Cuba in the 1990s, but has never been formally implemented.\nOther measures proposed by the Commission, the EU executive, include urging EU governments to make transfers to Iran’s central bank and to start the legal process of allowing the European Investment Bank to lend to EU projects in Iran.
