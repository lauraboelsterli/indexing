    "text": "MONTREAL, Dynacor Gold Mines Inc.

It is therefore possible that this measure could not be comparable with a similar measure of another Corporation. The Corporation uses this non-IFRS measure as an indicator of the cash generated by the operations and allows investor to compare the profitability of the Corporation with others by canceling effects of different assets bases, effects due to different tax structures as well as the effects of different capital structures.\n(2) Cash-flow per share is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standard definition under IFRS. It is therefore possible that this measure could not be comparable with a similar measure of another Corporation. The Corporation uses this non-IFRS measure which can also be helpful to investors as it provides a result which can be compared with the Corporation market share price.\nOverview Q1-2018\nIn Peru, the rainy season occurs during the first quarter of the year where production has historically been lower than for all other quarters. Nevertheless, during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Corporation continued increasing its level of ore purchased which lead to an increased production (21,035 tonnes processed a 25.2% increase compared to the same period of 2017), in line to our 360 tpd production forecast in December 2018.\nTotal sales amounted to $26.6 million compared to $24.7 million in Q1-2017, a 7.7% increase due to increase gold price ($2.3 million) and slight decrease due to sales volumes ($-0.4 million). Q1-2017 volume had been positively impacted by the high level of ore in process at year-end 2016 which turned into 2017 sales.\nResults from operations\nFinancial statement highlights\nFor the three-month periods ended March 31, (in $'000) 2018 2017 Sales 26,590 24,728 Cost of sales (22,966 ) (21,628 ) Gross operating margin 3,624 3,100 General and administrative expenses (1,120 ) (1,074 ) Transition, maintenance and other expenses - (187 ) Selling expenses (3 ) (3 ) Operating income 2,501 1,836 Net income and comprehensive income 1,601 937 Earnings per share Basic $ 0.04 $ 0.02 Diluted $ 0.04 $ 0.02 The gross operating margin amounted to $3.6 M in Q1-2018 compared to $3.1 M for the same period in 2017 due to higher sales.\nNet income was $1.6 M for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.9 M for the same period in 2017. The quarter increase in net income compared to 2017 is explained by the increase in gross operating margin combined with the absence of interest on the long-term loan and of transition costs in Q1-2018.\nReconciliation of net income and comprehensive income to EBITDA For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income and comprehensive income 1,601 937 Income taxes 742 654 Financial expenses 69 294 Depreciation 558 648 EBITDA 2,970 2,533 Cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities and working capital\nOperating activities\nDuring Q1-2018, the cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital items, amounted to $2.4 M, compared to $1.8 M in Q1-2017. This increase between quarters is primarily explained by the increase in net income combined with the decrease in unrealized foreign exchange gain ($0.2 M) partially offset by the absence of interest on the long-term loan ($0.2 M) in Q1-2018.\nDuring Q1-2018, total cash from operating activities amounted to $4.4 M compared to $3.1 M in Q1-2017. Changes in working capital items amounted to $2.0 M compared to $1.3 M in 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring Q1-2018, there were limited investments of $0.3 M for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment ($0.2 M for the same period in 2017) mainly relating to the additions to the Chala plant. Additions to exploration and evaluation assets during Q1-2018 amounted to $0.1 M (similar to Q1-2017).\nFinancing Activities\nIn Q4-2017, the Corporation fully reimbursed the long-term loan thirteen months before the term. In Q1-2017, the transaction costs and interests represented $0.3 M. In Q1-2018, the Corporation continued the site restoration of its old Huanca Metalex plant and therefore reducing its asset retirement obligation by $0.5 M. Work should be completed as expected and within budget in the second quarter of 2018. Government approval of work performed should be received upon inspection in the following months.\nLiquidity\nAs at March 31, 2018, the Corporation’s working capital amounted to $17.7 M, including $8.6 M in cash ($16.0 M, including $4.8 M in cash at December 31, 2017).\nOutlook 2018\nOre processing\nDynacor expects 2018 to be its best year ever with a gold production estimated between 90,000 and 94,000 ounces. The gold production target for 2018 is based on the current price of gold and current operating conditions. The corporation expects to return to its full 300 tpd capacity soon after the rainy season and plans to expand the capacity to 360 tpd by the end of the year.\nDuring Q1-2018, the Corporation produced 19,072 oz of gold in line with the 2018 forecasts of between 90,000 to 94,000 oz of gold.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/e76c11c1-a54e-42da-8a24-943d49165741\nExploration\nFollowing a new agreement with one of the two local communities, the drilling program will begin after the reception of the exploration permit and after the completion of the IP Geophysics on the disseminated mineralization on the Quartzites and on the Sumac Brecciated Quartzite zone. The approved budget is $2.4 million over the next 24 months.\nDuring Q2-2018, the Corporation will finalize the selection of drill targets with the compilation of geological surface mapping, geochemical rock assays, MMI soil geochemistry and detailed IP survey results, all compiled to select favorable drill targets to be carried out at the end of Q2-2018 and/or beginning of Q3-2018.\nABOUT DYNACOR GOLD MINES INC.\nDynacor Gold Mines Inc. is a gold production corporation headquartered in Montreal, Canada.
