    "text": "The Trump administration is designating the head of Iran 's central bank as a terrorist and hitting him with sanctions intended to further isolate Iran from the global financial system.\nThe Treasury Department accuses Valiollah Seif of helping transfer millions of dollars to Hezbollah , the Iran-backed militant group. Seif is the governor of the Iranian central bank. He's being named a \"specially designated global terrorist.\"\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Seif \"covertly funneled\" money from the Iran's Revolutionary Guards through al-Bilad Islamic Bank in Iraq to help Hezbollah. The Iraqi bank and its chairman is also being punished with sanctions.\nThe U.S. says it's also imposing so-called secondary sanctions on Seif. That means anyone who does business with him could be cut off from the U.S. financial system.",
