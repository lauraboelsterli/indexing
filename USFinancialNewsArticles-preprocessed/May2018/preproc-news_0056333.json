    "text": "0 COMMENTS IN NEW YORK, it’s common to try on neighborhoods like personalities. It can take a few moves to get it right. This has been true of the arts organization the Swiss Institute, which on June 21 debuts its new home in the East Village, after moving between the Upper West Side, SoHo and Tribeca.\nThe nonprofit institution was created in 1986 by a group of Swiss expats looking to highlight their country’s artists and culture. That mission has since broadened to promote a diverse community of international artists, all the while charming the wider art world with its zeitgeist-tapping exhibitions.\nDespite this success, Swiss Institute director Simon Castets yearned to find a permanent home base. After reviewing roughly 100 buildings and raising nearly $4 million, the French-born Castets and his board, chaired by philanthropist Maja Hoffmann, landed on a former Chase bank and brought on Selldorf Architects to handle the renovations.\nA rendering of the reworked structure.

It changes the profile entirely.” The 7,500-square-foot, four-level structure boasts spaces for exhibitions, a research library, a bookstore managed by Printed Matter and an art-filled rooftop terrace. “I wanted to offer the artists a multitude of possibilities for their installations,” architect Annabelle Selldorf says of her design.\nIndeed, the inaugural exhibition, Readymades Belong to Everyone , with work by artists such as Wade Guyton and Claire Fontaine, showcases the versatility of the new home—and the Swiss Institute itself. swissinstitute.net.\nMore from WSJ.
