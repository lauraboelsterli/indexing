    "text": "May 20, 2018 / 10:32 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Pope Francis to nominate 14 new cardinals on June 29 Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nVATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Sunday he would elevate 14 Roman Catholic prelates to the high rank of cardinal, the elite group of churchmen who are his closest advisers and can enter a conclave to choose his successor if they are under 80. Pope Francis leaves at the end of a Mass of Pentecost at Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, May 20, 2018. REUTERS/Remo Casilli\nThe pope made the surprise announcement during his weekly Sunday address. He said the ceremony to elevate the nominees, known as a consistory, would take place on June 29.\nAppointing new cardinals is one of the most significant powers of a Pope, allowing him to steer the future of the 1.2 billion member Catholic Church.\nAfter the June ceremony, Pope Francis will have nominated 74 cardinals since being elected Pope in 2013, according to statistics on the Vatican’s website.\nOnly cardinals under the age of 80 can enter the closed-door conclave which chooses from its ranks a new pope and are known as “cardinal electors”.\nIt was not immediately clear how many of the 14 qualify.\nTwo of those named by the Pope are Bishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer, head of the Vatican’s doctrinal department, known as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and Archbishop Angelo Becciu, deputy secretary of state.\nBoth currently work in the Vatican’s central administration, known as the Curia.
