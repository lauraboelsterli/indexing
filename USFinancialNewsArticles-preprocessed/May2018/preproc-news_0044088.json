Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports With a 22-foot jump shot off a feed from JR Smith with 3:11 remaining in the second quarter, James registered his 2,357th made field goal in the playoffs to surpass Abdul-Jabbar’s record that has stood since he retired in 1989. Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan is third on the all-time list at 2,188.\n“Anytime I’m in the same breath with the greats ... it’s just humbling,” James told reporters postgame.\nJames passed Jordan for No. 1 on the all-time postseason scoring list during last year’s playoffs.\nJames sunk 17 of his 28 shots in the Cavaliers’ win, sending the teams back to Boston tied 2-2 in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals.\nThe 33-year-old James entered Monday averaging 32.9 points in 14 games during the playoffs.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
