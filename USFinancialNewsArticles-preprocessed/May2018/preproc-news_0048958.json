These additional sales volumes should be seen during the second half of 2018,” the company said in a statement.\nLithium and its byproducts accounted for approximately 61 percent of SQM’s gross profit in the first quarter, the company said. Demand exceeded supply, it added, sharply boosting prices in early 2018 to $16,400 per tonne from $13,500 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“We believe that this price pressure will continue throughout the first half of the year,” de Solminihac said.\nThe second stage of SQM’s expansion plans in Chile would increase capacity to 120,000 tonnes, 20,000 tonnes more than previously anticipated, the statement said.\n“The second stage of the expansion in the Salar de Atacama will be completed in the next 18 months with a total investment of US$200 million,” de Solminihac said in the statement.\nThe final stage would boost production capacity to 180,000 tonnes with a price tag of $250 million. It was not immediately clear if that was in addition to the $200 million.\nSQM earlier today reported earnings of $113.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 10 percent, on growth in its lithium business.\nThe results and revised production schedule come one week after China’s Tianqi Lithium Corp said it would buy nearly a quarter of SQM for $4.1 billion from Canada-based fertilizer company Nutrien Ltd.
