    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arch Capital Group Ltd. [NASDAQ: ACGL] today announced François Morin will assume the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective May 25, 2018. He will report to Marc Grandisson, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACGL. Mr. Morin will replace outgoing Chief Financial Officer Mark Lyons, who is leaving Arch to become Senior Vice President and Chief Actuary, General Insurance at AIG in New York.\nMr. Morin joined the Company in 2011 and currently serves as Senior Vice President, Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary of ACGL. Prior to joining Arch, Mr. Morin served in various roles for Towers Watson & Co. and its predecessor firm Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, including its actuarial division, Tillinghast, where he led the firm’s engagement with ACGL.\nMr. Grandisson said, “Anyone who has followed our Company knows one of Arch’s strengths is its deep pool of talent. François’ extensive experience leading Arch’s actuarial and enterprise risk management practices gives him valuable perspective into all financial and capital aspects of our Company.”\nMr. Morin said, “Arch has consistently delivered on its core strategy of being a leader in specialty lines. I look forward to working with Marc and the executive leadership team as we strive to continue to deliver superior returns over the long term, consistent with the record of financial performance we have demonstrated since our founding.”\nGrandisson continued, “Mark and I have worked together since the early days of Arch in 2002. In addition to the significant contributions he has made to our performance over the years, he has been a great colleague and friend. We wish him all the best.”\nMr. Morin has nearly 30 years of experience in the insurance industry. He holds a bachelor’s degree in Actuarial Science from Université Laval in Canada and is a fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society, a Chartered Financial Analyst and a member of the American Academy of Actuaries. Mr. Morin’s promotion is subject to applicable local regulatory approvals.\nAbout Arch Capital Group Ltd.\nArch Capital Group Ltd., a Bermuda-based company with approximately $11.26 billion in capital at March 31, 2018, provides insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance on a worldwide basis through its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \"safe harbor\" for forward−looking statements.
