    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on four Venezuelans and three Florida-based companies under a program meant to pressure Caracas over what the United States sees as its heavy-handed tactics to suppress political opposition.\nThe four people sanctioned were named as Diosdado Cabello Rondon, Jose David Cabello Rondon, Marleny Josefina Contreras Hernandez and Rafael Alfredo Sarria Diaz, the Treasury said in a statement on its website on Friday.\nThe companies, all based in Boca Raton, were named as 11420 Corp, Noor Plantation Investments LLC and SAI Advisors Inc.
