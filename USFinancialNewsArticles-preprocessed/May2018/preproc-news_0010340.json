All other resolutions put forth at the meeting of Tervita shareholders provided for in the Joint Circular were duly passed by Tervita shareholders.\nUpon completion of the Arrangement, the board of directors of the amalgamated company (\"New Tervita\") will be comprised of the following ten members: the current six independent directors of Tervita, Grant Billing (Chairman), Allen Hagerman, Jay Thornton, Cameron Kramer, Douglas Ramsay, Kevin Walbridge; John Cooper (President & CEO of New Tervita); two current independent directors of Newalta, Gordon Pridham and Susan Riddell Rose; and Michael Colodner from Solus Alternative Asset Management LP (Tervita's largest shareholder).\nCompletion of the Arrangement is subject to various closing conditions, including receipt of approval under the Competition Act (Canada) and receipt of a final order by the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench (the \"Court\"). The application for approval of the Court, originally scheduled for May 1, 2018, will now be heard on June 26, 2018 or as soon thereafter as the Court may advise. Tervita has applied to list the common shares and warrants of New Tervita on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the \"TSX\"). Listing is subject to the approval of the TSX in accordance with its original listing requirements. The TSX has not conditionally approved New Tervita's listing application and there is no assurance that the TSX will approve the listing application. Newalta and Tervita are diligently working together toward completion of the required approval under the Competition Act (Canada). The Arrangement is currently expected to close late in the second quarter of 2018 or early in the third quarter of 2018.\nAbout Newalta\nNewalta is a leading provider of innovative engineered environmental solutions that enable customers to reduce disposal, enhance recycling and recover valuable resources from oil and gas exploration and production waste streams.
