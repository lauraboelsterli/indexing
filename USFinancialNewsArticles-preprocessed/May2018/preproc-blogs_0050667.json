    "text": "0 COMMENTS Here are some of the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Tuesday’s session. Stock movements reflect premarket trading.\nBoeing —Up 0.1% : A group of workers at Boeing’s large plane-making facility in South Carolina will vote on union representation later this month after labor regulators on Monday cleared a path for a fresh ballot. The stock has gotten a boost from easing trade tensions lately, rising to its highest level in three months and within 0.2% of its Feb. 27 record.\nGeneral Motors —Up 1.9% : China will reduce its import tariff on autos from 25% to 15% starting July 1—a concession to U.S. trade complaints that could benefit auto makers in Europe and the U.S., including General Motors. Ford Motor shares were up 0.5% and Tesla shares climbed 1.2%.\nNetflix Inc.—Up 0.7% : The streaming company rose 2.4% Monday after it signed former U.S. President Barack Obama and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, to a multiyear deal to produce shows and documentaries for the streaming platform. Shares are at their highest level in a month and now 1.3% off their April 17 all-time high.\nFacebook —Up 0.3% : Top European lawmakers are set to interrogate Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday over the company’s handling of alleged data misuse and election interference on the platform, as the tech giant seeks to appease officials in a region where it is regulated strictly.\nAdobe Systems Inc.—Up 1.1% : Adobe approved a share repurchase program of up to $8 billion through the 2021 fiscal year, and the software firm also announced an agreement to acquire Magento Commerce for roughly $1.7 billion.\nMicron Technology —Up 6.5% : The chip maker late Monday announced a buyback plan of up to $10 billion and said it was collaborating with Intel on a new memory chip, after rising 3.9% during the regular session following a boost to its outlook for the current quarter.\nLowe's —Up 3.1% : Lowe’s said J.C. Penney Chief Executive Marvin Ellison will take over as president and CEO of the home-improvement retailer. J.C. Penney shares were down 8.4%.\nKohl's —Down 2% : Kohl’s posted a surprise increase in sales, exceeded quarterly profit expectations and boosted its full-year earnings outlook. Shares turned negative as the company’s earnings call started after initially rising.\nMacy's —Down 0.7% to $34.38 : Shares of other retailers, including Macy’s, also initially rose before erasing gains following the strong earnings report from Kohl’s. Susquehanna analysts also upgraded Macy’s to positive from neutral and raised their price target to $43 from $25.\nAdvance Auto Parts —Up 5% : The auto parts retailer reported a rise in quarterly profits, though sales fell and missed expectations.\nAutoZone —Up 4.7% : AutoZone also topped earnings expectations, getting a boost from tax changes, but missed on sales, citing cold weather in the most recent quarter.\nThis is an expanded version of the “Stocks to Watch” section of our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter.
