    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 1:17 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Esperion's cholesterol drug safe, effective in new late-stage study Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMay 23 (Reuters) - Esperion Therapeutics said on Wednesday its cholesterol drug was safe and effective in treating heart disease patients in a new late-stage study, weeks after data from an earlier trial raised concerns about the treatment’s efficacy.\nEsperion’s shares plunged some 30 percent on May 2 after analysts questioned the drug’s safety and effectiveness despite late-stage results showing that the treatment had met the main study goal.\nIn the new study, the treatment, bempedoic acid, met the main goal of reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels when compared with a placebo.\nThe study results also showed that adverse muscle-related side effects were lower in patients taking Esperion’s treatment compared with those on a placebo.\nEsperion’s shares rose nearly 3 percent in premarket trading.
