    "text": "Most women would rather talk about their own deaths than money, according to a new study.\nAnd that reluctance is helping to fuel a wealth gap that sets women back into their retirement years, research from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave found.\nWomen are as confident as men when it comes to routine financial tasks such as paying bills, with 90 percent of respondents, and budgeting, 84 percent. But that self-assurance plummets to 52 percent for women when it comes to more complex investing, a 16 percent gap from men, the study found.\nThat lack of know how can hurt women in the long run and compound some already negative effects on their wealth.\nWomen typically earn just 82 cents for every dollar a man in a similar job earns, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAnd they are more likely to take time out of the work force to care for children, parents and their spouses.\nOverall, this can add up to a $1.06 million earnings gap when a woman reaches retirement compared to a man who has stayed in the work force. (Chart from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave below.)\nBut there are concrete steps women can take to mitigate these negative effects on their net worth.\n1) Invest early and often \"I just think the sooner you get started, the better,\" said Mary Ellen Garrett, senior vice president and private wealth manager at the Garrett Group at Merrill Lynch.\nPutting your money to work early can help mitigate the effects of time out of the work force later on, Garrett said.\nPlanning early also helps women anticipate a longer life span. Women on average live five years longer than men, Garrett said, and often spend their final years alone.\n\"The need to be financially self reliant is of the utmost importance,\" Garrett said.\n2) Be strategic about your earning power Because many women take breaks from their career or plan on working past 65, it is imperative for them to keep their skills fresh .\nWhile not working full time, women can still continue to develop their skills by working on a contract basis through the gig economy , said Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Institute and Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.\nAnd women who are in the work force should make sure they take advantage of benefits that enable them to continue to hone their skills. That means taking advantage of classes to expand their professional abilities, even if they're not pursuing a degree, Collinson said.\nWhen negotiating a new position, women should also be sure to negotiate their pay .\nshow chapters Women aren't saving enough for retirement 6:28 PM ET Fri, 9 March 2018 | 00:58 3) Don't underestimate how much you will need\nWomen who are approaching retirement or who are already retired are increasingly",
