REUTERS/Ann Saphir\nThe Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted measure on mortgage requests fell 1.6 percent to 258.1 in the week ended April 27.\nInterest rates on “conforming” 30-year mortgages, or loans with balances of $453,100 or less, averaged 4.80 percent, which was the highest since September 2013 and up from 4.73 percent from the prior week, MBA said.
