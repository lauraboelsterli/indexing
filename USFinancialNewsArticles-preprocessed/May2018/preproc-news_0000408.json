(\"exhale\")).\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 3.0%, inclusive of rabbi trust impact and stock- based compensation. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 6.0%, primarily driven by payroll and related expenses, including severance charges and the acquisition of exhale. Refer to the table on page 9 of the schedules for a reconciliation of selling, general, and administrative expenses to Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nOPENINGS AND FUTURE EXPANSION\nNine hotels (or 1,896 rooms) were added in the first quarter of 2018. The Company's net rooms increased 7.2%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The Company is on pace to add approximately 60 hotels in the 2018 fiscal year.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had executed management or franchise contracts for approximately 340 hotels (or approximately 73,000 rooms), compared to the expectation for approximately 330 hotels and 70,000 rooms as of December 31, 2017. This represents development pipeline growth of approximately 10%, compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nSHARE REPURCHASE\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased $95 million of shares, consisting of 1,209,987 shares of Class A common stock, including 244,260 shares, or $20 million of shares delivered in the settlement of a November 2017 accelerated share repurchase program. There were no Class B shares repurchased in the quarter. The Company ended the first quarter with 47,515,803 Class A and 70,496,643 Class B shares issued and outstanding.\nFrom April 1 through April 27, 2018, the Company repurchased 1,070,144 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $82 million. As of April 27, 2018, the Company had approximately $706 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.\nCAPITAL STRATEGY UPDATE\nDuring the first quarter, the Company completed the following transaction:\nOn March 29, 2018, sold the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort (301 rooms), the Grand Hyatt San Francisco (668 rooms), and the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa (454 rooms) for pre-tax net proceeds of approximately $992 million in a portfolio sale to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. The hotels continue to be Hyatt-branded under long-term management agreements.\nThe Company remains on track to successfully execute plans to sell approximately $1.5 billion of real estate by the end of 2020 as part of its capital strategy. Two of the three properties in the portfolio transaction, the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, reflect a combined attributed sale value of approximately $800 million and form part of the $1.5 billion permanent sell-down program. To date, the Company has sold approximately $1.1 billion of real estate under the program.\nBALANCE SHEET / OTHER ITEMS\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company reported the following:\nTotal debt of $1,450 million. Pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality venture debt of $564 million, substantially all of which is non-recourse to Hyatt and a portion of which Hyatt guarantees pursuant to separate agreements. Cash and cash equivalents, including investments in highly-rated money market funds and similar investments, of $1,160 million, short-term restricted cash of $450 million and short-term investments of $54 million. Undrawn borrowing availability of $1.5 billion under Hyatt's revolving credit facility. In the quarter, the Company refinanced the $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, extending the maturity of the facility to January 2023.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nThe Company's current outlook incorporates the adoption of new accounting standards which is expected to result in an approximate $32 million reduction in 2018 fiscal year Adjusted EBITDA, compared to the initial outlook provided on February 14, 2018, which was based on historical accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). Consistent with prior disclosures, the vast majority of the Adjusted EBITDA reduction is attributable to the accounting for deferred gains. Also reflected in the revised outlook is the March 2018 portfolio sale to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. which reduced estimated 2018 fiscal year Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $40 million.\nThe Company is revising the following information for the 2018 fiscal year:\nNet income is expected to be approximately $495 million to $553 million, compared to previous expectation of $176 million to $215 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $765 million to $785 million, compared to previous expectation of approximately $805 million to $825 million. These estimates also include a favorable impact from foreign currency of approximately $5 million (low end of forecast) to $10 million (high end of forecast), compared to previous expectation of $0 (low end of the forecast) to $5 million (high end of the forecast). Refer to the table on page 3 of the schedules for a reconciliation of Net Income Forecast to Adjusted EBITDA Forecast. Comparable systemwide RevPAR is expected to increase approximately 2.0% to 3.5% compared to previous expectation of 1.0% to 3.0%. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $320 million to $324 million, compared to previous expectation of $367 million to $371 million. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $76 million, compared to previous expectation of $75 million to $76 million. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27% to 29%, compared to previous expectation of 27% to 31%. The Company expects to grow net rooms by approximately 6.5% to 7.0%, compared to previous expectation of approximately 6.0% to 6.5%. The number of hotel openings remains at approximately 60. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $375 million, compared to previous expectation of approximately $350 million. The increase is largely attributable to investments funded by cash proceeds from the 2017 sale of Avendra LLC. The Company expects to return at least $700 million to shareholders, compared to a previous expectation of at least $500 million, through a combination of cash dividends on its common stock and share repurchases.\nThe Company is reaffirming the following information for the 2018 fiscal year:\nAdjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately $300 million, consistent with previous guidance. This excludes approximately $34 million to $35 million of stock-based compensation expense, which reflects a $1 million decrease from previous guidance, and any potential expenses related to benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts. Other income (loss), net is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $65 million to $75 million related to performance guarantee expense for the four managed hotels in France.\nNo additional disposition or acquisition activity beyond what has been completed as of the date of this release has been included in the outlook. The Company's outlook is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that Hyatt will achieve these results.\nADOPTION OF NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe most meaningful impacts of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 are as follows:\nGains on the sales of real estate are generally recognized when control of the property transfers to the buyer. Previously, gains on properties sold subject to a management agreement were deferred and amortized in management, franchise, and other fees revenue over the life of the contract. This change results in a reduction in fees revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of income and a reduction in Adjusted EBITDA. However, in periods in which we dispose of a property, we expect to recognize the gain upon sale, which would increase net income in the period. The amortization of management and franchise agreement assets constituting payments to customers (Contra Revenue) is recognized as a reduction to management, franchise and other fees revenue over the expected customer life. Previously, the amortization of such payments was recognized within depreciation and amortization expense. This change results in an equal and offsetting reduction to both revenues and depreciation and amortization expense, such that there is no impact to net income.\nOther areas impacted by the adoption of ASU 2014-09 include:\nIncentive management fees are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur in a future period, as opposed to recognizing amounts that would be due if the management contract was terminated at the end of the reporting period. Revenue related to our loyalty program, primarily recognized in revenues for the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties on our condensed consolidated statements of income, is recognized upon point redemption, net of any redemption expense paid to third parties. For systemwide services recognized under a fund model, the revenues for the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties on our condensed consolidated statements of income, are recognized over time as the services are provided, as opposed to when we incur the related expenses.\nWe do not anticipate the changes for incentive management fees will affect the Company’s net income for any full-year period. Please refer to the discussion of these changes in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings.\nADJUSTED EBITDA DEFINITION REVISION\nEffective January 1, 2018, we made two modifications to our definition of Adjusted EBITDA with the implementation of ASU 2014-09. Our definition has been updated to exclude Contra Revenue which was previously recognized as amortization expense. As this is strictly a matter of financial presentation, we have excluded Contra Revenue in order to be consistent with our prior treatment and to reflect the way in which we manage our business. We have also excluded revenues for the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties. These revenues and costs previously netted to zero within Adjusted EBITDA. Under ASU 2014-09, the recognition of certain revenue differs from the recognition of related costs, creating timing differences that would otherwise impact Adjusted EBITDA. We have not changed our management of these revenues or expenses, nor do we consider these timing differences to be reflective of our core operations. These changes reflect how our management evaluates each segment’s performance and also facilitate comparison with our competitors. We have applied this change to 2017 historical results to allow for comparability between the periods presented.\nPlease refer to page 8 of the release for definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, and pages 2 and 3 of the schedules for a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income Forecast to Adjusted EBITDA Forecast.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nThe Company will hold an investor conference call tomorrow, May 3, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. CT.

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA, as the Company defines them, are non-GAAP measures. We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation plus its pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA based on its ownership percentage of each venture, adjusted to exclude the following items:\ninterest expense; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; amortization of management and franchise agreement assets constituting payments to customers (Contra Revenue); revenues for the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties; costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties; equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures; stock-based compensation expense; gains (losses) on sales of real estate; asset impairments; and other income (loss), net\nEffective January 1, 2018, we made two modifications to our definition of Adjusted EBITDA with the implementation of ASU 2014-09. Our definition has been updated to exclude Contra Revenue which was previously recognized as amortization expense. As this is strictly a matter of financial presentation, we have excluded Contra Revenue in order to be consistent with our prior treatment and to reflect the way in which we manage our business. We have also excluded revenues for the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties. These revenues and costs previously netted to zero within Adjusted EBITDA. Under ASU 2014-09, the recognition of certain revenue differs from the recognition of related costs, creating timing differences that would otherwise impact Adjusted EBITDA. We have not changed our management of these revenues or expenses, nor do we consider these timing differences to be reflective of our core operations. These changes reflect how our management evaluates each segment’s performance and also facilitate comparison with our competitors. We have applied this change to 2017 historical results to allow for comparability between the periods presented.\nWe calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by adding the Adjusted EBITDA of each of our reportable segments and eliminations to corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA. Our board of directors and executive management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Our president and chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, by assessing the Adjusted EBITDA of each segment. In addition, the compensation committee of our board of directors determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based in part on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, segment Adjusted EBITDA or some combination of both. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that the Company uses internally for purposes of assessing operating performance and making compensation decisions.\nAdjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not substitutes for net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, net income, or any other measure prescribed by GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-GAAP measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business. Our management compensates for these limitations by reference to its GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues excluding Contra Revenue and revenues for the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties. We believe Adjusted EBITDA margin is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that the Company uses internally for purposes of assessing operating performance.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted net income, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted net income as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation excluding special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of ongoing operations. We consider Adjusted net income to be an indicator of operating performance because excluding special items allows for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations.\nAdjusted net income is not a substitute for net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, net income, or any other measure prescribed by GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted net income. Although we believe that Adjusted net income can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes special items that are deemed not to be reflective of ongoing operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted net income differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted net income or similarly named non-GAAP measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, Adjusted net income should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business. Our management compensates for these limitations by reference to its GAAP results and using Adjusted net income supplementally.\nAdjusted Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses\nAdjusted SG&A expenses, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted SG&A expenses exclude the impact of expenses related to deferred compensation plans funded through rabbi trusts and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted SG&A expenses assist us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations, both on a segment and consolidated basis.\nComparable Owned and Leased Hotels Operating Margin\nWe define comparable owned and leased hotels operating margin as the difference between comparable owned and leased hotels revenues and comparable owned and leased hotels expenses. Comparable owned and leased hotels revenues is calculated by removing non-comparable hotels revenues from owned and leased hotels revenues as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of income. Comparable owned and leased hotels expenses is calculated by removing both non-comparable owned and leased hotels expenses and the impact of expenses funded through rabbi trusts from owned and leased hotels expenses as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of income. We believe comparable owned and leased hotels operating margin is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that the Company uses internally for purposes of assessing operating performance.\nComparable Hotels\n\"Comparable systemwide hotels\" represents all properties we manage or franchise (including owned and leased properties) and that are operated for the entirety of the periods being compared and that have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. We may use variations of comparable systemwide hotels to specifically refer to comparable systemwide Americas full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the Americas management and franchising segment, comparable systemwide ASPAC full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the ASPAC management and franchising segment, or comparable systemwide EAME/SW Asia full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the EAME/SW Asia management and franchising segment. \"Comparable owned and leased hotels\" represents all properties we own or lease and that are operated and consolidated for the entirety of the periods being compared and have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. Comparable systemwide hotels and comparable owned and leased hotels are commonly used as a basis of measurement in our industry. \"Non-comparable systemwide hotels\" or \"non-comparable owned and leased hotels\" represent all hotels that do not meet the respective definition of \"comparable\" as defined above.\nConstant Dollar Currency\nWe report the results of our operations both on an as reported basis, as well as on a constant dollar basis. Constant dollar currency, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates between comparative periods. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our results as it removes currency fluctuations from our operating results. We calculate constant dollar currency by restating prior-period local currency financial results at the current period’s exchange rates. These adjusted amounts are then compared to our current period reported amounts to provide operationally driven variances in our results.\nRevenue per Available Room (RevPAR)\nRevPAR is the product of the average daily rate (ADR) and the average daily occupancy percentage. RevPAR does not include non-room revenues, which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage, parking, telephone and other guest service revenues. Our management uses RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenues from comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional and segment basis. RevPAR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry. RevPAR changes that are driven predominantly by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do changes that are driven predominantly by changes in average room rates. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs), and could also result in increased ancillary revenues (including food and beverage). In contrast, changes in average room rates typically have a greater impact on margins and profitability as there is no substantial effect on variable costs.\nAverage Daily Rate (ADR)\nADR represents hotel room revenues, divided by the total number of rooms sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry, and we use ADR to assess the pricing levels that we are able to generate by customer group, as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels. Occupancy measures the utilization of a hotel's available capacity. We use occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help us determine achievable ADR levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nForward-Looking Statements in this press release, which are not historical facts, are within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include statements about our plans, strategies, outlook, occupancy, ADR and growth trends, market share, the number of properties we expect to open in the future, the amount by which the Company intends to reduce its real estate asset base and the anticipated timeframe for such asset dispositions, our expected adjusted SG&A expense, our estimated comparable systemwide RevPAR growth, our estimated Adjusted EBITDA growth, maintenance and enhancement to existing properties capital expenditures, investments in new properties capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense estimates, financial performance, prospects or future events and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict.
