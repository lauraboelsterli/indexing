Brazilian climbers attempt for the world record of largest mosaic as they form the Brazilian flag with an image of the World Cup trophy at Sumare bridge in Sao Paulo, Brazil May 6, 2018. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker\nThe climbers lowered themselves into place to create a cardboard image of the Brazilian flag, an effort they hope will set a record for such a mosaic.\n“I hope this will be an incentive for our players, because the Brazilian team has not won a title for a long time,” one of the climbers, Iron Souza, said. “May this serve as an incentive for them to bring a “caneco” (cup) back to our country.” Slideshow (5 Images)\nBrazil are the only team to win the World Cup five times but they have not lifted the trophy since 2002.\nThey are one of the favourites going into the tournament in Russia starting on June 14 and are in Group E along with Switzerland, Costa Rica and Serbia.
