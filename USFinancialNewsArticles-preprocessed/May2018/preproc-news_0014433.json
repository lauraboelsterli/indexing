    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRTX), a clinical-stage oncology company, today reported the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We have made significant progress in all of our programs and continue to be encouraged by positive clinical results for sitravatinib and mocetinostat with planned data presentations at a fall oncology conference,\" said Charles M. Baum, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Additionally, we are on track to file our planned Investigational New Drug application (IND) for MRTX849, a potent and selective inhibitor for KRAS, in the fourth quarter of 2018.\"\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter 2018\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $148.7 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $150.8 million at December 31, 2017.\nLicense and collaboration revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $9.5 million, compared to none in the same period in 2017. License and collaboration revenues relate to the Collaboration and License Agreement between the Company and BeiGene, Ltd. (\"BeiGene\"), which became effective January 7, 2018, under which the Company granted BeiGene an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sitravatinib in Asia (excluding Japan and certain other countries).\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $19.7 million, compared to $14.4 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to an increase in third party research and development expense for sitravatinib due to the continuation and expansion of ongoing clinical trials. The increase is also related to continued development of our KRAS inhibitor program for costs associated with preparing to file a planned IND application for our selected lead clinical compound, MRTX849. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in glesatinib expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.2 million, compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense due to an increase in the fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $14.7 million, or $0.51 per share basic and diluted, compared to net loss of $17.8 million, or $0.73 per share basic and diluted for the same period in 2017.\nAbout Mirati Therapeutics\nMirati Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage oncology company developing targeted product candidates to address the genetic, epigenetic and immunological promoters of cancer. Our precision oncology clinical programs utilize next-generation genomic testing to identify and select cancer patients who are most likely to benefit from targeted drug treatment. In immuno-oncology, we are advancing clinical programs where the ability of our product candidates to improve the immune environment of tumor cells may enhance and expand the efficacy of existing immunotherapy medicines when given in combination. Our pre-clinical programs include potentially first-in-class and best-in-class product candidates specifically designed to address mutations and tumors where few treatment options exist. We approach each of our discovery and development programs with a singular focus: to translate our deep understanding of the molecular drivers of cancer into better therapies and better outcomes for patients.
