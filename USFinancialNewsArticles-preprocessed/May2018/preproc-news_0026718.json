    "text": "Vince Velasquez pitched six solid innings, Carlos Santana homered and the Philadelphia Phillies completed a four-game sweep with a 6-3 victory over the visiting San Francisco Giants on Thursday afternoon.\nVelasquez (3-4) allowed five hits and three earned runs while striking out a career-high 12 batters. He threw 101 pitches, 69 for strikes, and also was 2-for-2 at the plate, raising his season average to .462.\nHector Neris picked up the save, his eighth, with a scoreless ninth inning.\nOdubel Herrera had three hits and Cesar Hernandez added two hits for the Phillies, who swept the Giants in a series for the first time since 1982.\nGiants starter Ty Blach (3-4) was shaky, giving up seven hits and five earned runs in 4 1/3 innings.\nGregor Blanco and Alen Hanson each homered for the Giants.\nPablo Sandoval had a pair of hits for San Francisco.\nBlanco led off the game with a home run to right-center field for a 1-0 Giants lead.\nHanson then ripped a two-run homer in the second off Velasquez, scoring Sandoval for a 3-0 advantage.\nThe Phillies managed just two hits through the first three innings on singles by Hernandez and Velasquez.\nHerrera doubled in his second at-bat in the fourth to extend his streak of reaching base safely to 39 straight games.\nRhys Hoskins later singled, scoring Aaron Altherr and slicing the Giants’ lead to 3-1.\nSantana then came up and blasted a three-run home run to left field, scoring Hoskins and Herrera for a 4-3 Phillies advantage.\nHerrera struck again for an RBI single in the fifth, scoring Hernandez for a 5-3 lead.\nGiants reliever Will Smith wriggled out of further trouble by striking out Hoskins and forcing Santana into a groundout to end the inning.\nHerrera came up with another clutch hit with an RBI single to center in the seventh for a 6-3 lead.\nIn the ninth, Neris struck out Brandon Belt swinging, got Nick Hundley to ground out to second and struck out Sandoval looking to complete the four-game sweep. Neris threw 10 of his 13 pitches for strikes.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
