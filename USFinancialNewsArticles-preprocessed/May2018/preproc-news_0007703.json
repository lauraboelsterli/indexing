    "text": "DUBLIN, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aptiv PLC (NYSE: APTV), a global technology company enabling the future of mobility, today reported first quarter 2018 U.S. GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.15 per diluted share. Excluding special items, first quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $1.29 per diluted share.\nFirst Quarter Highlights Include :\nRevenue of $3.6 billion, up 8% adjusted for currency exchange, commodity movements, acquisitions and divestitures U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations of $307 million, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.15 Excluding special items, earnings from continuing operations of $1.29 per diluted share, up 19% U.S. GAAP operating income margin of 10.3% Adjusted Operating Income margin of 11.8%, up 60 basis points; Adjusted Operating Income of $427 million, up 21% Generated $186 million of cash from continuing operations Returned $208 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends\n\"We are off to an outstanding start in 2018, with revenue and earnings above first quarter expectations,\" said Kevin Clark, president and chief executive officer. \"Our Aptiv team delivered record financial performance, with 8% organic growth resulting from strong gains across the portfolio led by double-digit growth in our fastest-growing product lines, including active safety, infotainment and vehicle electrification. We are also announcing the acquisition of KUM, a leading provider of specialized connectors and cable management solutions for a range of harsh environment automotive applications; and the company returned $208 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our great start to the year positions us for outperformance in 2018, as reflected in our raised outlook for the year, and reinforces our strategy to deliver value to shareholders through innovation, profitable growth, strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital deployment.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nThe Company reported first quarter 2018 revenue of $3.6 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior year period. Adjusted for currency exchange, commodity movements, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue increased by 8% in the first quarter. This reflects growth of 9% in Asia, 8% in Europe, 6% in North America and 19% in South America.\nThe Company reported first quarter 2018 U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations of $307 million and earnings from continuing operations of $1.15 per diluted share, compared to $220 million and $0.82 per diluted share in the prior year period. First quarter Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, totaled $343 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, an increase of 19% on a per share basis compared to $291 million, or $1.08 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nFirst quarter Adjusted Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, was $427 million, compared to $352 million in the prior year period, resulting from the continued above-market growth of our businesses across all regions. First quarter Adjusted Operating Income margin was 11.8%, compared to 11.2% in the prior year period, reflecting sales growth, the beneficial impacts of cost reduction initiatives and the absence of certain warranty charges recorded in the prior year period, partially offset by continued incremental investments for growth. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $155 million, an increase from $126 million in the prior year period.\nInterest expense for the first quarter totaled $34 million, as compared to $33 million in the prior year period.\nTax expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $59 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 16%, compared to $19 million, or an effective rate of 8%, in the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate reflects the geographic mix of pretax earnings and the impact of favorable discrete items recorded in the prior period.\nThe Company generated net cash flow from continuing operating activities of $186 million in the first quarter. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and total available liquidity of $3.7 billion.\nReconciliations of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share, Adjusted Operating Income and Cash Flow Before Financing, which are non-GAAP measures, to the most directly comparable financial measures, respectively, calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") are provided in the attached supplemental schedules.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 1.68 million shares for approximately $149 million under its existing authorized share repurchase program, leaving approximately $840 million available for future share repurchases. All repurchased shares were retired, and are reflected as a reduction of ordinary share capital for the par value of the shares, with the excess applied as reductions to additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings.\nQ2 and Full Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company's second quarter and full year 2018 financial guidance is as follows:\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nQ2 2018\nFull Year 2018\nNet sales\n$3,500 - $3,600\n$13,950 - $14,350\nAdjusted operating income\n$450 - $470\n$1,750 - $1,830\nAdjusted operating income margin\n12.9% - 13.1%\n12.6% - 12.8%\nAdjusted net income per share\n$1.33 - $1.38\n$5.20 - $5.40\nCash flow from operations\n$1,550\nCapital expenditures\n$750\nAdjusted effective tax rate\n15% - 16%\n15% - 16%\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results at 8:30 a.m. (ET) today, which is accessible by dialing 888.486.0553 (US domestic) or 706.634.4982 (international) or through a webcast at ir.aptiv.com . The conference ID number is 9238578. A slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks and has been posted on the investor relations section of the Company's website. A replay will be available two hours following the conference call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains information about Aptiv's financial results which are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Operating Income represents net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expense, equity income (loss), net of tax, income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, restructuring, other acquisition and portfolio project costs, asset impairments, gains (losses) on business divestitures and deferred compensation related to acquisitions. Other acquisition and portfolio project costs include costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net sales.\nAdjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Aptiv before discontinued operations, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Cash Flow Before Financing represents cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses.\nManagement believes the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, management believes Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are useful measures in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nSuch non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the attached supplemental schedules at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAbout Aptiv\nAptiv PLC (NYSE: APTV) is a global technology company that develops safer, greener and more connected solutions, which enable the future of mobility. Headquartered in Dublin, Aptiv has 147,000 employees and operates 14 technical centers, as well as manufacturing sites and customer support centers in 45 countries.

Our management utilizes Adjusted Operating Income in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Management also utilizes Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to our segments, as management also believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Adjusted Operating Income is defined as net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expense, equity income (loss), net of tax, income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, restructuring and other special items. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Operating Income, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Operating income margin represents operating income as a percentage of net sales, and Adjusted Operating Income margin represents Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net sales.\nConsolidated Adjusted Operating Income\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n($ in millions)\n$\nMargin\n$\nMargin\nNet income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n307\n$\n335\nInterest expense\n34\n33\nOther (income) expense, net\n(30)\n23\nIncome tax expense\n59\n19\nEquity income, net of tax\n(5)\n(11)\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\n—\n(123)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n9\n17\nOperating income\n$\n374\n10.3\n%\n$\n293\n9.3\n%\nRestructuring\n20\n52\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n19\n6\nAsset impairments\n—\n1\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n14\n—\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n427\n11.8\n%\n$\n352\n11.2\n%\nSegment Adjusted Operating Income\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nSignal and\nPower Solutions\nAdvanced\nSafety and User\nExperience\nEliminations\nand Other\nTotal\nOperating income\n$\n322\n$\n52\n$\n—\n$\n374\nRestructuring\n18\n2\n—\n20\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n11\n8\n—\n19\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n—\n14\n—\n14\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n351\n$\n76\n$\n—\n$\n427\nDepreciation and amortization (a)\n$\n119\n$\n36\n$\n—\n$\n155\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\nSignal and\nPower Solutions\nAdvanced\nSafety and User\nExperience\nEliminations\nand Other\nTotal\nOperating income\n$\n291\n$\n2\n$\n—\n$\n293\nRestructuring\n13\n39\n—\n52\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n5\n1\n—\n6\nAsset impairments\n—\n1\n—\n1\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n309\n$\n43\n$\n—\n$\n352\nDepreciation and amortization (a)\n$\n102\n$\n24\n$\n—\n$\n126\n(a) Includes asset impairments.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share : Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share, which are non-GAAP measures, are presented as supplemental measures of the Company's financial performance which management believes are useful to investors in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management utilizes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income attributable to Aptiv before discontinued operations, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n307\n$\n335\nIncome from discontinued operations attributable to Aptiv, net of tax\n—\n(115)\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Aptiv\n307\n220\nAdjusting items:\nRestructuring\n20\n52\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n19\n6\nAsset impairments\n—\n1\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n14\n—\nReserve for Unsecured Creditors litigation\n—\n27\nTransaction and related (benefits) costs associated with acquisitions\n(11)\n—\nTax impact of adjusting items (a)\n(6)\n(15)\nAdjusted net income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n343\n$\n291\nWeighted average number of diluted shares outstanding\n266.44\n269.54\nDiluted net income per share from continuing operations attributable to Aptiv\n$\n1.15\n$\n0.82\nAdjusted net income per share\n$\n1.29\n$\n1.08\n(a)\nRepresents the income tax impacts of the adjustments made for restructuring and other special items by calculating the income tax impact of these items using the appropriate tax rate for the jurisdiction where the charges were incurred.\nCash Flow Before Financing : Cash Flow Before Financing is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's liquidity which is consistent with the basis and manner in which management presents financial information for the purpose of making internal operating decisions, evaluating its liquidity and determining appropriate capital allocation strategies. Management believes this measure is useful to investors to understand how the Company's core operating activities generate and use cash. Cash Flow Before Financing is defined as cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses. Not all companies use identical calculations of Cash Flow Before Financing, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The calculation of Cash Flow Before Financing does not reflect cash used to service debt, pay dividends or repurchase shares and, therefore, does not necessarily reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(in millions)\nCash flows from operating activities:\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n316\n$\n229\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n155\n126\nRestructuring expense, net of cash paid\n(16)\n18\nWorking capital\n(185)\n(151)\nPension contributions\n(11)\n(8)\nOther, net\n(73)\n44\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n186\n258\nCash flows from investing activities:\nCapital expenditures\n(243)\n(164)\nCost of business acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n—\n(40)\nDeposit for acquisition of KUM\n(5)\n—\nCost of technology investments\n—\n(15)\nOther, net\n3\n—\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations\n(245)\n(219)\nAdjusting items:\nAdjustment for amount deposited for acquisition of KUM\n5\n—\nAdjustment for the cost of business acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n—\n40\nCash flow before financing\n$\n(54)\n$\n79\nFinancial Guidance : The reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided in the Company's financial guidance to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measure is as follows:\nEstimated Q2\nEstimated Full Year\n2018 (1)\n2018 (1)\n($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted Operating Income\n$\nMargin (2)\n$\nMargin (2)\nNet income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n273\n$\n1,131\nInterest expense\n35\n138\nOther (income) expense, net\n1\n(37)\nIncome tax expense\n64\n268\nEquity income, net of tax\n(8)\n(30)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n8\n40\nOperating income\n373\n10.5\n%\n1,510\n10.7\n%\nRestructuring\n50\n147\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n22\n76\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n15\n57\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n460\n13.0\n%\n$\n1,790\n12.7\n%\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share\nNet income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n273\n$\n1,131\nRestructuring\n50\n147\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n22\n76\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n15\n57\nTransaction and related (benefits) costs associated with acquisitions\n—\n(11)\nTax impact of adjusting items\n(1)\n8\nAdjusted net income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n359\n$\n1,408\nWeighted average number of diluted shares outstanding\n265.41\n265.88\nDiluted net income per share attributable to Aptiv\n$\n1.03\n$\n4.25\nAdjusted net income per share\n$\n1.35\n$\n5.30\n(1)\nPrepared at the estimated mid-point of the Company's financial guidance range.\n(2)\nRepresents operating income and Adjusted Operating Income, respectively, as a percentage of estimated net sales.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aptiv-reports-record-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-and-raises-full-year-outlook-300640752.html\nSOURCE Aptiv PLC",
