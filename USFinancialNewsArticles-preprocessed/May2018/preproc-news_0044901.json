    "text": "SARASOTA, Fla., May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), a diversified technology company, today announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire PowerPlan in an all-cash transaction valued at $1.1 billion. PowerPlan is a leading provider of software and solutions for asset-centric companies, enabling its customers to optimize their financial performance and achieve regulatory compliance.\nPowerPlan’s award-winning software platform integrates highly detailed financial and operational data to help enhance operational efficiency, minimize tax obligations, improve cash flow, and mitigate compliance risk. This comprehensive software solution delivers insight into the impact of complex rules and regulations on areas such as lease accounting, income and property tax provisions, and capital planning, enabling customers to make decisions that improve financial performance.\n“We are excited to add another industry-leading, niche application software business to our family,” said Brian Jellison, Roper’s Chairman, President, and CEO. “The PowerPlan transaction demonstrates our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which results in the acquisition of high performing, niche businesses that grow and compound our cash flow.”\nNeil Hunn, Roper’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, “PowerPlan provides the technology backbone enabling its customers to get the enhanced financial, tax, and operational information they need to improve financial performance. We look forward to working with PowerPlan’s leadership team to continue to grow their innovative product suite, loyal customer base, and strong cash profile.”\nPowerPlan will continue to manage the business from its Atlanta, Georgia headquarters. PowerPlan’s name and brands are not expected to change as a result of the transaction.\nPowerPlan is currently an investment of private equity firm Thoma Bravo.\nAcquisition Financing and Financial Outlook\nDuring the first 12 months of ownership, Roper expects PowerPlan to deliver approximately $150 million of revenue and $60 million of after-tax free cash flow, excluding the impact of fair value accounting for PowerPlan’s deferred revenue and financing costs. Roper anticipates funding the transaction using its revolving credit facility and cash on hand, and expects the acquisition to be immediately cash accretive. PowerPlan has a strong history of growth in revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow, which Roper expects to continue.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.\nAbout Roper Technologies\nRoper Technologies is a constituent of the S&P 500, Fortune 1000, and the Russell 1000 indices.
