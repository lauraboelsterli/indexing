The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted net income, and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, including internal use software amortization of deferred set up costs, amortization of deferred bonus, amortization of deferred sales commissions, and non-cash stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income represents net income before non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets related to assets acquired, including customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, expenses related to the closing and integration of acquisitions and certain other items, if applicable for the period, partially offset by the related tax impact of these items. Adjusted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average of dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. Further information regarding the non-GAAP performance measures included in this press release, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, is contained in the financial tables and will be contained in the Company’s Form 10-Q to be filed for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nTo supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide its Board of Directors, management and investors with additional information and greater transparency with respect to our performance and decision-making. We feel these performance measures provide investors and others with a better understanding and ability to evaluate our operating results and future prospects, and provides the same performance measurement information as utilized by management. These adjustments to the Company’s GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying operational results, trends and performance.\nOur management uses non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as measures of operating performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of annual budgets, to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance. In addition, management currently uses non-GAAP measures in determining cash incentive compensation.\nAbout Financial Engines\nWith roots in Silicon Valley, Financial Engines is the nation’s largest independent investment advisor.
