(NASDAQ:PCYG), the parent company of ReposiTrak, Inc., a compliance, supply chain, and e-commerce platform that partners with retailers, wholesalers, and their suppliers, to accelerate sales, control risk, and improve supply chain efficiencies, announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nStrategic and Financial Highlights:\nRevenue increased 11% to $5.3 million, growth to reaccelerate in fiscal fourth quarter. “Due to unexpectedly high interest in MarketPlace, we increased investment and focused resources on this initiative. Specifically, the Success Team engaged their customers in pre-revenue recruitment for MarketPlace which pushed other opportunities out of the quarter,” said Randall K. Fields. “As a result, MarketPlace revenue is expected to begin to scale in the fiscal fourth quarter, well ahead of plan. This will compound growth from pending deals for other services on our converged platform, giving us a high level of confidence that growth will reaccelerate to our targeted range in the fiscal fourth quarter.” MarketPlace is successfully driving incremental revenue growth for ReposiTrak suppliers. “MarketPlace has been deployed by a major retailer, and we are now processing hundreds of orders per week for its suppliers,” said Mr. Fields. “This retailer is expanding the use of MarketPlace to new categories, providing an even stronger endorsement of our unique capabilities. By enhancing this retailer’s local control of product assortment, while driving more revenue to our suppliers, MarketPlace makes our converged platform very attractive to both parties, increasing demand for all of our services.” Rapid scaling of MarketPlace to more than 700 suppliers attracts growing pipeline of HUBs. “We now have more than 700 suppliers in MarketPlace with nearly 100,000 SKUs available to buyers,” said Mr. Fields. “The addition of suppliers makes MarketPlace more attractive to buyers, and more buyers makes MarketPlace more attractive to suppliers, creating a virtuous circle. Based on our current pipeline, we expect to add several new HUBs to MarketPlace in the coming months. As a result, we are confident MarketPlace will make a substantial contribution to growth in fiscal 2019. Enhanced focus on supplier HUB compliance to accelerate growth of this segment. “With total compliance connections increasing more than 50% year-over-year, we have cemented our dominance with retail and wholesale HUBs. We are now investing aggressively to tackle the supplier HUB segment by adding food safety applications and audit capabilities to help suppliers better manage these data-intensive processes with a single, easy-to-use solution. As a result, we are seeing a dramatic increase in the rate of supplier HUB sign ups. With literally tens of thousands of suppliers in our network, we expect this segment will join MarketPlace as a growth driver in fiscal 2019,” said Mr. Fields. Interest in supply chain and multi-services deals on converged platform continues to rise. “Our converged platform now encompasses more than 250,000 connections across all services,” said Mr. Fields. “As a result, our network has reached the point where its scale is attracting more customers, and driving a trend toward larger supply chain and multi-service deals. We are currently in negotiations with several customers for large supply chain deals and other multi-service engagements to support continued growth. These take longer to close and must be artfully integrated into the Success Team’s workflow, adding variability to our quarterly results.” First international partnership points to initial fruits of strategic initiative. “Our partnership with SerTech Exchange Ltd. will bring the power of the ReposiTrak platform and “speed retail” concept to the European market. SerTech’s strong relationships in the European retail food and food services markets offers us a pathway to explore the significant opportunities offered by the Global market for our solutions without losing our focus on execution for our domestic customers,” said Mr. Fields. “ReposiTrak has a strong record of creating value for U.S. retailers, and we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our presence in new geographical and vertical markets.”\nFinancial Results Summary:\nFiscal 3Q18 Quarterly Results: Total revenue increased 11% to $5.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $4.7 million during the same period a year ago.

These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures will be provided upon the completion of the Company’s annual audit.\nNon-GAAP EBITDA excludes items such as impairment charges, allowance for doubtful accounts, non-cash stock-based compensation and other one-time cash and non-cash charges. Non-GAAP EPS excludes items such as non-cash stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other one-time cash and non-cash charges. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, which may not be indicative of its core operation results and business outlook. Because Park City Group has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the Company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures in the financial presentation below allows investors to compare the Company’s financial results with the Company’s historical financial results reported using non-GAAP financial measures, as well as with the financial results reported by others.\nForward-Looking Statement\nAny statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
