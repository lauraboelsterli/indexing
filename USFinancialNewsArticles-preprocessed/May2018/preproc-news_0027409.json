Both Scarlett and Keith will be valued additions to our executive leadership team.”\nOverton concluded, “On behalf of our Board of Directors, management team and all of our staff, I want to thank Max and Debby for their dedication, leadership and contributions throughout their tenures with the Company. Joining The Cheesecake Factory 36 years ago, Max has played an integral role in growing our bakery from its humble beginning to its global position today. Nearly 20 years ago, Debby was named as our first General Counsel and has been a trusted advisor ever since. She will continue to sit on the board of The Cheesecake Factory Oscar and Evelyn Overton Charitable Foundation. We wish them both the best in their next chapters.”\nScarlett May joins The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated from Brinker International, Inc.
