    "text": "ZURICH, May 9 (Reuters) - Swiss ground services and cargo handling unit Swissport has received a $100 million partial loan repayment from parent HNA Group, it said, adding that it has agreed to postpone collecting the balance for five months.\nThe payment reduced to around 286 million euros ($338.8 million) the balance on the roughly 360 million euro loan that had been due for repayment in full on May 7, Swissport said in a statement on its website on Tuesday.\n“In connection with the $100 million repayment, Swissport agreed to forbear from exercising remedies to collect the remaining unpaid balance under the affiliate loan for a period of five months. Swissport has received a forbearance fee of 150,000 euros, included in the $100 million payment,” it said.\nSwissport continues to earn a market interest rate on the residual amount, it added.\nHNA has been unloading billions of dollars of assets after a $50 billion acquisition spree over two years turned a spotlight on its opaque ownership and aggressive use of leverage. The firm has since seen some pending deals collapse.\n($1 = 0.8442 euros)\nReporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Vyas Mohan\n ",
