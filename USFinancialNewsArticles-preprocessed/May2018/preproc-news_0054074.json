Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 29, 2018 Spain's Garbine Muguruza celebrates winning her first round match against Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\nThe third seed Muguruza, who lifted the Suzanne Lenglen Cup in 2016, prevailed 7-6(0) 6-2 in a rain-disrupted match against the 2009 champion, a clay court expert very few would like to take on so early in the tournament.\nAlthough she has been struggling to return to top form after undergoing wrist surgery last year, world number 43 Kuznetsova remains a formidable opponent.\nMuguruza stayed focused throughout, however, and her power, speed and poise made the difference. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 29, 2018 Spain's Garbine Muguruza in action during her first round match against Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\n“It is, so to speak, (a) second-week match,” Muguruza told a news conference.\n“But this is going to reinforce me. It was a very good first round, and the fact that I won, although it was a very difficult match, it was a match against an expert. The last matches I have played, the results were difficult. Slideshow (11 Images)\n“And I think that I feel very encouraged by this kind of\na match.”\nMuguruza dropped serve twice in the opening set but easily bagged the tie break.\nShe broke early in the second set and this time did not let her guard down against Kuznetsova, who slipped down in the rankings after returning to the tour only in March.\nThe Russian saved a first match point with a passing shot, Muguruza sent a backhand long on the second, but Kuznetsova bowed out after sending a forehand way too long on the third.\nMuguruza next faces French wild card Fiona Ferro.
