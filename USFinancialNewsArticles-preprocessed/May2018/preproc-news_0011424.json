    "text": "WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE: PMT) today reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $22.0 million, or $0.35 per common share on a diluted basis, 2018, on net investment income of $75.7 million. PMT previously announced a cash dividend 2018 of $0.47 per common share of beneficial interest, which was declared on March 28, 2018, and paid on April 27, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nFinancial results:\nNet income attributable to common shareholders of $22.0 million, down from $34.6 million in the prior quarter; the prior quarter’s results included a $13.0 million benefit related to remeasurement of tax-related items that did not recur Diluted earnings per common share of $0.35, down 30 percent from the prior quarter Net investment income of $75.7 million, down 19 percent from the prior quarter Book value per common share of $20.24 at March 31, 2018, up from $20.13 at December 31, 2017 Annualized return on average common equity of 7 percent, down from 11 percent for the prior quarter 1\nInvestment activities and correspondent production results:\nContinued investment in GSE credit risk transfer (CRT) and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) resulting from PMT’s correspondent production business Correspondent production from nonaffiliates related to conventional conforming loans totaled $4.2 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB), down 28 percent from the prior quarter CRT deliveries totaled $3.2 billion in UPB, which is expected to result in approximately $112 million of new CRT investments once the aggregation period is complete Added $67 million in new MSR investments Completed the previously announced sale of $347 million in UPB of nonperforming and performing loans from the distressed loan portfolio\nNotable activity after quarter end:\nIssued $450 million of 5-year term notes at attractive rates under Fannie Mae MSR financing structure\n“PMT’s earnings for the quarter were driven by strong results from our interest rate sensitive strategies and GSE credit risk transfer,” said President and CEO David Spector. “These earnings contributions were partially offset by the underperformance of our distressed loan portfolio. By completing the bulk sale of $347 million in UPB of nonperforming and performing distressed loans announced last quarter, we brought our equity allocated to distressed loans down to 13 percent. We also recently completed the issuance of MSR-backed term notes, representing the culmination of efforts made in close partnership with Fannie Mae. This represents a significant development for the company’s capital structure and allowed us to diversify our sources of financing at attractive terms.”\n1 Annualized return on average common equity is calculated based on annualized quarterly net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of monthly average common equity during the period. The following table presents the contributions of PMT’s segments, consisting of Correspondent Production, Credit Sensitive Strategies, Interest Rate Sensitive Strategies, and Corporate.\nQuarter ended March 31, 2018 Correspondent\nproduction\nCredit sensitive\nstrategies\nInterest rate\nsensitive\nstrategies\nCorporate Total (in thousands) Net investment income: Net gain (loss) on investments Mortgage loans at fair value $ - $ (9,951 ) $ - $ - $ (9,951 ) Mortgage loans held by variable interest entity net of asset-backed secured financing\n- - 604 - 604 Mortgage-backed securities - (186 ) (22,211 ) - (22,397 ) CRT Agreements - 22,551 - - 22,551 Hedging derivatives - - 1,460 - 1,460 Excess servicing spread investments - - 7,751 - 7,751 - 12,414 (12,396 ) - 18 Net gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale 7,599 28 - - 7,627 Net mortgage loan servicing fees - 7 56,148 - 56,155 Net interest income (expense) Interest income 11,169 10,208 19,428 175 40,980 Interest expense (6,798 ) (10,664 ) (17,354 ) - (34,816 ) 4,371 (456 ) 2,074 175 6,164 Other (loss) income 7,073 (1,389 ) - 25 5,709 19,043 10,604 45,826 200 75,673 Expenses: Mortgage loan fulfillment and servicing fees payable to PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.\n11,944 3,085 7,934 - 22,963 Management fees payable to PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.\n- - - 5,696 5,696 Other 469 3,913 108 4,686 9,176 12,413 6,998 8,042 10,382 37,835 Pretax income (loss) $ 6,630 $ 3,606 $ 37,784 $ (10,182 ) $ 37,838 Credit Sensitive Strategies Segment\nThe Credit Sensitive Strategies segment includes results from distressed mortgage loans, CRT, non-Agency subordinated bonds and commercial real estate investments. Pretax income for the segment was $3.6 million on revenues of $10.6 million, compared with pretax income of $39.3 million on revenues of $46.9 million in the prior quarter.\nNet gain on investments was $12.4 million, a decrease of 75 percent from the prior quarter.\nPMT’s distressed mortgage loan portfolio generated realized and unrealized losses totaling $10.0 million, compared with realized and unrealized losses of $8.2 million in the prior quarter. Fair value losses on performing loans in the distressed portfolio were $4.2 million while fair value losses on nonperforming loans were $5.1 million.\nThe schedule below summarizes the gains (losses) on distressed mortgage loans:\nQuarter ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 (in thousands) Valuation changes: Performing loans $ (4,169 ) $ 647 $ 5,970 Nonperforming loans (5,102 ) (11,672 ) (3,169 ) (9,271 ) (11,025 ) 2,801 Gain on payoffs 235 1,114 415 Gain (loss) on sale (915 ) 1,704 - $ (9,951 ) $ (8,207 ) $ 3,216 The losses were driven by multiple factors including adverse valuation impact due to increased investor yield requirements as a result of higher interest rates. Other drivers were the higher than forecasted recidivism of previously performing loans and lower than forecasted transition of loans to performing status, as well as expenses related to the maintenance of PMT’s lien interest in the nonperforming loans. These expenses include property taxes, repair and property maintenance costs, insurance and legal fees. Losses associated with the bulk sale of nonperforming and performing loans, including market-driven valuation changes during the quarter on the remaining portfolio and sale-related expenses, totaled approximately $8 million.\nNet gain on CRT investments was $22.6 million, compared to $57.1 million in the prior quarter. Returns on CRT investments in the first quarter benefitted from ongoing capital deployment into new CRT investments and continued strong credit markets. At quarter end, PMT’s investments in CRT totaled $726 million, compared with $688 million at December 31, 2017.\nNet interest expense for the segment totaled $0.5 million, compared to $0.3 million in the prior quarter. Interest income totaled $10.2 million, a 15 percent decrease from the prior quarter, driven by a decrease in capitalized interest from a reduction in loan modification activity and fewer performing loans in the distressed loan portfolio. Interest expense totaled $10.7 million, down 13 percent from the prior quarter, driven by lower financing costs related to the ongoing reduction of the distressed loan portfolio and real estate acquired upon settlement of loans (REO).\nOther investment losses were $1.4 million, compared with $2.0 million in the prior quarter. At quarter end, PMT’s inventory of REO properties totaled $141.5 million, down from $162.9 million at December 31, 2017.\nSegment expenses were $7.0 million, an 8 percent decrease from the prior quarter, driven by lower servicing fees on a smaller distressed loan portfolio, partially offset by expenses related to the sale of distressed loans.\nInterest Rate Sensitive Strategies Segment\nThe Interest Rate Sensitive Strategies segment includes results from investments in MSRs, excess servicing spread (ESS), Agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and non-Agency senior MBS and interest rate hedges. Pretax income for the segment was $37.8 million on revenues of $45.8 million, compared with pretax income of $3.2 million on revenues of $11.4 million in the prior quarter. The segment includes investments that typically have offsetting exposures to changes in interest rates. For example, in a period with increasing interest rates, MSRs and ESS typically gain in value whereas Agency MBS typically recognize losses.\nThe results in the Interest Rate Sensitive Strategies segment consist of net gains and losses on investments, net interest income and net loan servicing fees, as well as the associated expenses.\nNet loss on investments for the segment totaled $12.4 million, primarily consisting of $22.2 million of losses on MBS; $7.8 million of gains on ESS; and $1.5 million of gains on hedging derivatives.\nNet interest income for the segment was $2.1 million, compared to $2.4 million in the prior quarter. Interest income totaled $19.4 million, a 4 percent increase from the prior quarter, primarily driven by an increase in MBS investments compared to the prior quarter. Interest expense totaled $17.4 million, a 6 percent increase from the prior quarter due to financing costs related to the increase in MBS investments and higher short-term borrowing costs.\nNet mortgage loan servicing fees were $56.1 million, up from $19.9 million in the prior quarter. Net mortgage loan servicing fees included $48.7 million in servicing fees and $1.7 million in ancillary and other fees. Net mortgage loan servicing fees also included a $26.0 million valuation gain on MSRs carried at fair value, $20.8 million of related hedging losses and $0.6 million of MSR recapture income. PMT’s hedging activities are intended to manage the Company’s net exposure across all interest rate-sensitive strategies, which include MSRs, ESS and MBS.\nThe following schedule details net mortgage loan servicing fees:\nQuarter ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 (in thousands) From non-affiliates: Servicing fees (1) $ 48,732 $ 45,554 $ 37,281 Ancillary and other fees 1,703 1,876 1,224 Effect of MSRs: Carried at lower of amortized cost or fair value Amortization and realization of cashflows - (22,609 ) (17,858 ) (Provision for) reversal of impairment - (1,589 ) 1,504 Gain on sale - 660 - Carried at fair value - change in fair value 25,974 (3,765 ) (1,993 ) Gains (Losses) on hedging derivatives (20,849 ) (782 ) (8,698 ) 5,125 (28,085 ) (27,045 ) 55,560 19,345 11,460 From PFSI-MSR recapture income\n595 570 292 Net mortgage loan servicing fees $ 56,155 $ 19,915 $ 11,752 (1) Includes contractually specified servicing fees, net of Agency guarantee fees.\nBefore January 1, 2018, PMT carried the majority of its MSRs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company elected to account for all MSRs at fair value prospectively.\nMSR valuation gains primarily resulted from expectations for lower prepayment activity in the future, driven by higher mortgage rates and growth from our loan production activities. ESS valuation gains also benefited from higher mortgage rates and include recapture income totaling $0.8 million from PFSI for prepayment activity during the quarter. When prepayment of a loan underlying PMT’s ESS results from refinancing by PFSI, PMT generally benefits from recapture income.\nSegment expenses were $8.0 million, a 1 percent decrease from the prior quarter, driven by a decrease in other expenses.\nCorrespondent Production Segment\nPMT acquires newly originated mortgage loans from correspondent sellers and typically sells or securitizes the loans, resulting in current-period income and ongoing investments in MSRs and CRT related to a portion of its production. PMT’s Correspondent Production segment generated pretax income of $6.6 million versus $14.1 million in the prior quarter.\nThrough its correspondent production activities, PMT acquired $13.1 billion in UPB of loans and issued interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) totaling $13.6 billion in the first quarter, compared with $15.4 billion and $15.9 billion, respectively, in the prior quarter. Of the correspondent acquisitions, conventional conforming acquisitions from nonaffiliates totaled $4.2 billion, and government-insured or guaranteed acquisitions totaled $8.8 billion, compared with $5.9 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, in the prior quarter.\nSegment revenues were $19.0 million, a 46 percent decrease from the prior quarter. Segment revenues included a net gain on mortgage loans of $7.6 million, other income of $7.1 million, which primarily consists of volume-based origination fees, and net interest income of $4.4 million. Net gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale in the quarter decreased 62 percent from the prior quarter, driven by higher mortgage rates and a competitive mortgage market. Net interest income decreased 20 percent from the prior quarter primarily driven by the decrease in production volumes.\nThe following schedule details the net gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale:\nQuarter ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 (in thousands) Net gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale: Receipt of MSRs in loan sale transactions $ 66,546\n$ 82,948 $ 58,688 Provision for losses relating to representations and warranties provided in mortgage loan sales:\nPursuant to mortgage loans sales (572 ) (792 ) (673 ) Reduction in liability due to change in estimate 1,042 2,156 4,576 Cash investment (1) (59,380 ) (69,846 ) (37,248 ) Fair value changes of pipeline, inventory and hedges (9 ) 5,766 (6,318 ) $ 7,627 $ 20,232 $ 19,025 (1) Includes cash hedge expense\nSegment expenses were $12.4 million, down 42 percent from the prior quarter, driven by the decrease in production volumes and a lower weighted average fulfillment fee. The weighted average fulfillment fee rate in the first quarter was 28 basis points, down from 33 basis points in the prior quarter, reflective of the more competitive market environment.\nCorporate Segment\nThe Corporate segment includes interest income from cash and short-term investments, management fees, and corporate expenses.\nSegment revenues were $200,000, an increase from $119,000 in the prior quarter.\nManagement fees were $5.7 million, down 3 percent from the prior quarter, resulting from a reduction in PMT’s shareholders’ equity, driven by common share repurchases in the prior quarter. No incentive fees were paid in the first quarter or the prior quarter.\nOther segment expenses were $4.7 million compared with $4.8 million in the prior quarter.\nTaxes\nPMT recorded income tax expense of $9.7 million compared with a $5.1 million expense in the prior quarter, resulting from an increase in income generated by PMT’s taxable REIT subsidiary.\n***\nExecutive Chairman Stanford L. Kurland concluded, “We continued to make advances in the strategic transformation of PMT during the first quarter. We remain focused on reducing the distressed loan portfolio and increasing those initiatives related to correspondent production, which provides such long-term investments as GSE credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing rights. In addition, we continue to pursue initiatives to optimize our liability structure, as evidenced by our recent issuance of term notes to finance Fannie Mae MSRs. Altogether, we believe the combination of these strategies should produce attractive returns on equity, as reflected in our run rate earnings potential.”\nManagement’s slide presentation will be available in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.pennymac-REIT.com beginning at 1:30 p.m. (Pacific Daylight Time) on Thursday, May 3, 2018.\nAbout PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust\nPennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust is a mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests primarily in residential mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets.
