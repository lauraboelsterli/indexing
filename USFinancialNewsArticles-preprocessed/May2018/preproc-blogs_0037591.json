    "text": "UPDATE 1-USTR reviews Thai pork trade as U.S. producers slam market access Published 2 Hours Ago Reuters\n(Adds NPPC comment, background)\nWASHINGTON, May 17 (Reuters) - The United States is reviewing Thailands eligibility for trade preferences after American pork producers raised concerns over the issue, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said on Thursday.\n\"Congress directs USTR to ensure that beneficiary countries are permitting equitable and reasonable market access for American goods,\" it said in a statement.\nThe petition from the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) raises important questions regarding Thailands compliance with the criterion for GSP (Generalized System of Preferences) eligibility, the agency added.\nThailand for years has willfully denied equitable access to our products, NPPC President Jim Heimerl said in a release. Were pleased that USTR is going to look into the unfair treatment U.S. goods are getting from Thailand, he said.\nIn April the NPPC filed a GSP review with the trade representative's office, citing Thailand's failure to provide access to its market for U.S. products - including pork.\nThe group said Thailand, through exorbitant tariffs and \"de facto bans,\" severely limits U.S. pork exports while enjoying its Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rate on agriculture imports into the United States.\nNPPC urged the Trump administration to withdraw or limit Thailand's benefits under the MFN program, which allows for removal of a countrys benefits if the United States is not allowed fair and reasonable access to its market.\nIn 2017, U.S. pork exports to Thailand totaled 31 tonnes valued at roughly $128,000, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The European Union supplies the vast majority of Thailand's imported pork, USMEF said. (Reporting by Susan Heavey and Theopolis Waters in Chicago; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Tom Brown)",
