    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Burcon NutraScience Corporation (TSX:BU) (NASDAQ:BUR) (“Burcon” or the “Company”), a leader in natural product extraction, purification and isolation technologies, announced today that in order to complete the expected delisting of its common shares, the Company intends to file a Form 25 (Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 4, 2018 to delist the Company’s common shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market and to deregister its common shares under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Company expects that the delisting and deregistration will become effective ten days and ninety days, respectively, from the date of filing. The Company today provided notice to NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) of the Company’s intention to file the Form 25.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company received a letter, dated April 25, 2018, from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) that the Panel had determined to delist the Company’s common shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market, the immediate effect of which was to suspend the trading of the Company’s common shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market at the open of business on Friday, April 27, 2018. Nasdaq customarily files a Form 25-NSE with the SEC at least 45 days after a suspension occurs, although the timing of such filing can vary. The Company determined to file the Form 25 as it will provide the Company with greater certainty regarding the timing of its delisting and deregistration.\nSince the suspension of the Company’s common shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company’s common shares have been trading in the United States on the OTC Pink Open Market (the “Pink Market”), operated by OTC Markets Group, under the ticker “BUROF”.\nUpon the effectiveness of the delisting, the Company intends to file a Form 15F with the SEC to terminate its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Upon the filing of the Form 15F, the Company’s reporting obligations with the SEC, including its obligation to file annual reports on Form 20-F and furnish reports on Form 6-K, will be immediately suspended. The Company’s reporting obligations will continue to be met in accordance with Canadian securities regulations and filed on SEDAR under the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com , and on the Company’s website at http://www.burcon.ca .\nAbout Burcon NutraScience Corporation\nBurcon is a leader in developing technologies for the production of valuable plant-sourced ingredients for use in food, nutrition, wellness and supplement products.
