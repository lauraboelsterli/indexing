Wages barely rose last month, which could ease concern that inflation pressure was building and may keep the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening .\nBut the fall in bond yields proved short-lived as world stock markets looked to end the week on a strong note.\nEuropean shares were up 0.5 percent, while Wall Street shares rallied 1 percent in early trade .\nMost euro zone 10-year bond yields were up 2 to 4 basis points, with Germany’s 10 Bund yield 2 bps higher at 0.55 percent, having fallen to a low of 0.52 percent.\n“U.S. equities opened lower after payrolls but have found themselves on a firmer footing, which is taking some of the steam out of the bonds rally post-payrolls,” said Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank in London.\nThe rise in euro zone bond yields came after sharp falls on Thursday, following weaker-than-expected euro zone inflation data. That has helped keep the gap between U.S. and German bond yields near three decade highs.\nMeanwhile, Italian 10-year yields underperformed in the face of political volatility.\nPresident Sergio Mattarella will meet party leaders on Monday to try to secure a coalition deal following an inconclusive March 4 election. Failing that, he is expected to seek backing for a technocrat government to help keep Italy’s finances on track.\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield was up almost 5 bps in late trade at 1.79 percent, pushing the gap over German peers to 124 bps - the widest in more than two weeks.
