    "text": "0 COMMENTS PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia—Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad increased pressure on the country’s attorney general to step down, while Malaysia’s antigraft chief resigned, as the new government prepared to relaunch investigations into financial scandals surrounding former leader Najib Razak .\nOn his first full day in office, Mr. Mahathir indicated he would pursue Mr. Najib and anyone else implicated in an embezzlement scam that allegedly sucked billions of dollars from state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB.\nThe head of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, Dzulkifli Ahmad, resigned Monday morning, giving Mr. Mahathir a free hand in choosing a successor. But there is no sign yet of a resignation by Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali, who cleared Mr. Najib in an earlier investigation into malfeasance at 1MDB.\nMr. Apandi went to his office on the first full working day since Mr. Najib lost May 9’s national election . On Friday, Mr. Mahathir announced a probe into the attorney general’s actions while in office.\nRelated Video Malaysia’s opposition ousted the ruling coalition, clearing the way for new investigations into Prime Minister Najib Razak’s alleged misappropriation of money in the 1MDB corruption scandal, possibly one of the largest global financial scams of all time. “He is refusing to resign for now. He is consulting his lawyers,” one of the people familiar with the matter said, adding that a process has to be followed in removing the country’s chief public prosecutor.\nMr. Mahathir said, however, that Mr. Apandi would soon go on leave and Solicitor General Nor Faizah Atek, who is empowered to fill many of the attorney general’s roles, would take over. Mr. Apandi declined to comment. Mr. Dzulkifli couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Mahathir said he would appoint a new antigraft chief on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, Treasurer-General Irwan Serigar Abdullah, who is also 1MDB chairman, was on Monday relieved of his duties and transferred to the Public Service Department, the government said.\nThe prime minister also said the defeated United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, which Mr. Najib led, wouldn’t be allowed to join his ruling coalition.\nAnwar Ibrahim, the pro-democracy leader who was jailed during Mr. Najib’s premiership for what he said was a trumped-up sodomy conviction, won’t be released until Wednesday at the earliest, his party said. Dr. Mahathir has pledged to hand power to Mr. Anwar once he wins a seat in Parliament, but a panel assessing the status of his pardon from the country’s king has been delayed. He was initially expected to be released on Tuesday, family members said.\nThe 92-year-old Mr. Mahathir, who led the country between 1981 and 2003, quit UMNO in 2016 and led an opposition alliance to unseat Mr. Najib . It was the first time the ruling party had lost an election since independence in 1957. Allegations that Mr. Najib had received hundreds of millions of dollars from the 1MDB fund played a critical part in the bitterly contested campaign.\nOn Saturday, authorities said they issued a travel ban preventing Mr. Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor from leaving the country. While the new government plans to reopen investigations into 1MDB, the fund is also the subject of probes in several other countries. U.S. authorities allege that at least $4.5 billion was misappropriated between 2009 and 2015, including $681 million allegedly received by Mr. Najib, whom lawsuits in the U.S. referred to as “Malaysian Official 1.”\nMr. Najib and 1MDB have denied wrongdoing. On Sunday, police cordoned off his Kuala Lumpur home.\nMr. Mahathir told reporters that his government would investigate all the former government’s alleged crimes, and had instructed the Finance Ministry to review the national budget for ways to reduce spending. He warned all government employees to ensure that no documents were removed or destroyed, and said he had an idea where to find financier Jho Low, a key suspect in the 1MDB investigation.\nHe said the government had not requested Interpol’s help in tracking down Mr. Low, “but we roughly know where he is.” Mr. Low has denied wrongdoing.\n—Jake Maxwell Watts and Bradley Hope\ncontributed to this article.\nWrite to Yantoultra Ngui at yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com and Tom Wright at tom.wright@wsj.com",
