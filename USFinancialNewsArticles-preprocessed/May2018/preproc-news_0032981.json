Xherdan Shaqiri even missed a penalty for Stoke.\nSwansea’s Portuguese manager Carlos Carvalhal is widely expected to leave, five months after arriving.

I must talk with my family. After that I will make the right decision about my future.\n“I know the Championship and reached the play-offs twice. It’s not common for a team to reach the play-offs two years in a row.”\nStoke manager Paul Lambert also said his time in charge was not enough to turn things round after being appointed in January.\n“There were things wrong, without a doubt,” he told the BBC.\n“We drew games that we should have won. A little bit more quality across the top (positions) and we wouldn’t be in this position.\n“There’s a core of players, but there’s a turnaround that needs to happen.” Reporting by Steve Tongue, editing by Pritha Sarkar and Ian Chadband",
