REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo\nThe Italian lender, which is now 68 percent owned by the state, said on Thursday in a statement that “GACS” state guarantees on the senior notes are expected to be obtained over the coming weeks, and the bad loan portfolio is expected to be deconsolidated by June.\nThe senior notes were issued for 2.92 billion euros, the bank said. They will yield a coupon of 3mE plus 1.5 percent, incorporating the premium due to the government for the guarantees provided on the notes.\n($1 = 0.8397 euros)",
