    "text": "397 COMMENTS If you’ve ever taken a statistics class, you’ve probably read Darrell Huff’s “How to Lie with Statistics.” Teachers unions appear to have drawn some lessons from the 1954 book. They’re using misleading statistics to rally public support for teacher walkouts in West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arizona and Colorado. Here are some of their distortions.\n• They conflate school funding and state education spending . In Oklahoma, unions proclaimed that per pupil school spending fell by 28.2% over the past decade. That refers to the inflation-adjusted state’s general funding formula. But total per pupil outlays increased by 16% in nominal terms between 2006 and 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent public education finance report. Adjusting for inflation, that’s a decline of only about 2%.\nOn average across the country, state funds make up only 47% of total school spending. Most of the rest comes from local property taxes. Since property tax hikes are politically unpopular, unions put pressure on state lawmakers to increase education spending from general funds. That has the benefit of diffusing accountability for local spending.\n• They use elevated spending baselines. Teachers unions nearly always compare school spending and teacher salaries today with peak levels before the great recession, which were inflated like housing prices. Between 2000 and 2009, average per pupil spending across the country increased 52% , according to the National Center for Education Statistics. After flat-lining for a few years, per pupil spending ticked up by 7.5% between 2012 and 2015. School spending growth might have slowed over the past several years, but it still increased faster than the consumer price index.\nPer pupil funding in Oklahoma shot up 46% between 2000 and 2009. During this period, average teacher salaries rose 52%. While average salaries have since fallen by 5%, even on an inflation-adjusted basis they remain higher today ($45,245) than in 2000 ($44,861) or 1990 ($44,088).\n• They don’t account for other forms of compensation . Since 2000, per pupil spending on employee benefits has doubled. Benefits make up about 29 cents of every dollar of staff compensation, compared with 21 cents in 2000. In Arizona, about 24% of staff compensation goes to employee benefits, up from 18% in 2000. Teachers don’t see this in their paychecks, but pensions and health benefits are the fastest-growing expenses for many school districts, and most of the money goes to retired teachers.\n• They elide data that don’t fit their argument. According to the National Education Association’s annual survey, the biggest average pay bumps in 2016 were in California (4.3%), Colorado (3.9%) and Wisconsin (3.5%). Wisconsin’s 2011 collective-bargaining reforms limit annual base salary increases to 2% while letting districts negotiate pay with individual teachers based on criteria other than job and education level.\nThe Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in 2016 reported that two-thirds of districts “say they’ve been outbid for applicants and are increasingly offering special pay raises in hopes of keeping high-performing teachers.” Thus, “merit pay” can drive up teacher salaries. But unions focus on base salaries in their promotional materials because they oppose a competitive performance pay structure.\n• They use misleading cross-state comparisons . The New York Times recently reported that Arizona, after cutting taxes, “spent under $7,500 per pupil annually in 2015, the last year for which census data was available; only Utah and Idaho spent less.” Unions similarly claimed recent state income-tax cuts were to blame for Oklahoma’s ranking 49th in teacher pay. But state rankings are remarkably consistent over time. In 2000 Arizona ranked 48th in per-pupil spending and Oklahoma was 48th in teacher salaries.\nThe NEA encourages its affiliate unions to use its annual state rankings “to advocate for higher pay for teachers and more state funding for public schools by showing how my state compares to others.” The union notes that its North Carolina affiliate uses survey data “on average teacher salary rankings and per pupil expenditure rankings as a vital and main negotiating chip to lobby for teacher raises and increased K-12 education funding.” In other words, by playing states against one another, unions hope to drive up education spending across the country.\nSome teachers may be pinching pennies and paying for supplies out of their own pockets. But education spending in most states, even those governed by Republicans, is increasing.\nTeachers are striking now because unions realize that Republicans are on edge about the midterm elections. In a February special election for a Kentucky state House seat, a Democrat won by 36 points in a district Donald Trump carried by 49. Education is a key issue for rural and suburban voters, whose votes Democrats need. That’s why the unions are lying with statistics.\nMs. Finley is a member of the Journal’s editorial board.",
