    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia, the United States and Jordan have agreed to hold a meeting about the fate of Syria’s southern “de-escalation” zone, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said on Tuesday, the RIA news agency reported.\nRussia said on Monday only Syrian army troops should be on the country’s southern border with Jordan and Israel, after Washington warned of “firm measures” over truce violations in the region.\nJordan also said on Monday it was discussing developments in southern Syria with Washington and Moscow and that all three parties agreed on the need to preserve the de-escalation zone which they brokered last year and which has reduced violence.\n(This story corrects headline, lead to clarify meeting will be about, not in, southern Syria.)\nReporting by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ",
