    "text": "Revenues of $51.6 billion for the fourth quarter and $208.4 billion for the full year. Fourth-quarter GAAP loss per diluted share from continuing operations of $(5.58) and full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.30. Fourth-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $3.49 and full-year Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $12.62. Fiscal 2018 cash flow from operations of $4.3 billion. The Board of Directors authorized an additional $4.0 billion share repurchase program. Fiscal 2019 Outlook: Adjusted Earnings of $13.00 to $13.80 per diluted share.\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $51.6 billion, up 6% compared to $48.7 billion a year ago. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 4% over the prior year. For the fiscal year, McKesson had revenues of $208.4 billion, up 5% compared to $198.5 billion a year ago. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 4% over the prior year.\nOn the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), fourth-quarter loss per diluted share from continuing operations was $(5.58), compared to earnings per diluted share of $16.79 a year ago. Full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.30, compared to $23.28 a year ago. Fourth-quarter GAAP loss per diluted share and full-year GAAP earnings per share included after-tax net charges totaling $1.9 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, or $9.07 and $12.32 per diluted share, respectively, driven primarily by non-cash goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges in the company’s European and Canadian retail businesses, partially offset by benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nPrior year fourth-quarter and full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share included an after-tax net gain of $3.0 billion, or $14.10 per diluted share and $13.53 per diluted share, respectively, related to the creation of the Change Healthcare joint venture.\nFourth-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.49, up 2% compared to $3.41 a year ago. Full-year Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $12.62, up 1% compared to $12.54 for the prior year, which includes the $0.31 per diluted share contribution to create a non-profit foundation.\nFor the full year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $4.3 billion and ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion. During the year, McKesson repaid approximately $765 million in net long-term debt, paid $2.9 billion for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of its common stock, invested $580 million internally and paid $262 million in dividends.\n“While we realized significant charges in the fourth quarter reflecting challenging market conditions in Europe and Canada, I’m pleased with the Fiscal 2018 performance across our other businesses. And the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow enabled us to make internal investments and acquisitions that will drive growth,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer. “This strong financial position, combined with actions we are taking in relation to our recently announced multi-year strategic growth initiative, ensures McKesson’s ongoing focus on delivering shareholder value.\n“We also returned capital to shareholders through share repurchases and a quarterly dividend. And yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $4 billion, as we believe that the company’s shares are an attractive investment opportunity and repurchasing stock is an important part of our diversified capital allocation strategy,” continued Hammergren.\nSegment Results\nDistribution Solutions revenues were $51.6 billion for the quarter, up 7% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, Distribution Solutions revenues were $208.1 billion, up 6% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year.\nNorth America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $42.7 billion for the quarter were up 5% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis. For the full year, North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $174.2 billion, up 6% on both a reported and constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. Revenue growth for the quarter and the full year was driven primarily by market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.\nInternational pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.2 billion for the quarter, up 19% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by acquisitions and market growth, which were the same factors that drove full year revenues of $27.3 billion, up 10% on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year.\nMedical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 9%, driven primarily by market growth, including the impact of a stronger flu season. For the full year, Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year.\nFourth-quarter Distribution Solutions GAAP operating loss was $(689) million and GAAP operating margin was (1.33)%. On a constant currency basis, fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 8% from the prior year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin for the Distribution Solutions segment was 2.26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin excluding noncontrolling interests for the Distribution Solutions segment was 2.17% on a constant currency basis.\nFor the full year, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion and GAAP operating margin was 0.59%. On a constant currency basis, full-year adjusted operating profit was $4.1 billion, up 8% from the prior year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin for the Distribution Solutions segment was 1.96% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin excluding noncontrolling interests for the Distribution Solutions segment was 1.87% on a constant currency basis.\nFourth-quarter Technology Solutions GAAP operating profit was $23 million. Fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit was $72 million, driven by the company’s proportionate share of the income from McKesson’s equity investment in Change Healthcare.\nFull-year Technology Solutions GAAP operating loss was $(23) million. Full-year adjusted operating profit was $304 million, primarily driven by the company’s proportionate share of the income from McKesson’s equity investment in Change Healthcare.\nFiscal Year 2018 Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Adjusted Earnings\nAdjusted Earnings per diluted share of $12.62 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, excludes the following GAAP items:\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.60 per diluted share; Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $1.20 per diluted share; Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related credits of 31 cents per diluted share; Restructuring charges of $2.82 per diluted share, including non-cash long-lived asset impairment charges; and Other adjustment net charges of $6.01 per diluted share, primarily including non-cash goodwill asset impairment charges, partially offset by benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nRevised Segment Financial Reporting Effective Fiscal Year 2019\nFollowing the retirement of the president of Distribution Solutions in January 2018 and an evaluation of the company’s management and operating structure, McKesson has revised its reportable segments commencing in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019. McKesson’s new reportable segments are:\nU.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, which includes the U.S. Pharmaceutical and McKesson Specialty Health businesses; European Pharmaceutical Solutions; and Medical-Surgical Solutions.\nAll remaining operating segments and business activities that are not significant enough to require reportable segment disclosure will be included in Other. Other primarily includes McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions (MRxTS) and the company’s equity method investment in Change Healthcare.\nPlease refer to a second 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission for historical supplemental information for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2018; March 31, 2017; and March 31, 2016 reflecting historical results by revised reportable segment.\nFiscal Year 2019 Outlook\nMcKesson expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $13.00 to $13.80 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.\n“Our Fiscal 2019 outlook represents mid- to high-single digit percentage growth year over year, reflecting a more stable market environment and effective capital allocation, while including the previously outlined headwinds in our European and Rexall businesses,” Hammergren concluded.\nMcKesson has ceased providing forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as the company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, as items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control.\nKey Assumptions for Fiscal 2019\nThe Fiscal 2019 outlook is based on the following key assumptions and is also subject to the Risk Factors outlined below:\nMcKesson to deliver mid-single digit percent revenue growth and down slightly to up mid-single digit percent adjusted income from operations growth in Fiscal 2019. U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions to deliver low- to mid-single digit percent revenue growth and flat to down mid-single digit percent adjusted operating profit growth in Fiscal 2019. European Pharmaceutical Solutions to deliver flat to mid-single digit percent revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in Fiscal 2019. Medical-Surgical Solutions is expected to deliver low-double digit percent revenue growth and mid- to high-single digit percent adjusted operating profit growth in Fiscal 2019. Other is expected to deliver low-single digit percent revenue growth and adjusted operating profit to be flat in Fiscal 2019, which includes a gross headwind of between $100 million and $120 million related to the generic pricing initiative the Canadian provincial governments enacted April 1, 2018, as well as the impact of an increase in minimum wage in multiple provinces. Adjusted equity earnings from the company’s investment in Change Healthcare are expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digit percent in Fiscal 2019. Expect low-double digit percent decline in corporate expenses compared to Fiscal 2018. Interest expense is expected to decline year over year. The guidance range assumes a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 23%, which may vary from quarter to quarter. Income attributable to noncontrolling interests is expected to decline year over year. The company’s ownership position in McKesson Europe is assumed to be approximately 77% for Fiscal 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate movements are assumed to have a net favorable impact of up to 10 cents per diluted share year over year. Commencing in Fiscal 2019, the company will provide free cash flow guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $3.0 billion, which is net of expected property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures of between $600 million and $800 million. Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are expected to be approximately 200 million for the year.\nAdjusted Earnings\nMcKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, and other adjustments. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.\nThe company will not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis prospectively as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.\nConstant Currency\nMcKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nMcKesson also provides adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests. The company has arrangements involving third-party noncontrolling interests. As a result, pre-tax results are affected by the portion of pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests information is presented to provide a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the effect of pre-tax earnings that is not attributable to McKesson. The supplemental adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.\nMcKesson also provides a free cash flow estimate on a forward-looking basis. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures, as outlined in the company’s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nRisk Factors\nExcept for historical information contained in this press release, matters discussed may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied.

Any cross-footing differences in per share amounts is due to a difference in weighted average shares outstanding in calculating GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net income. (7) 2018 fourth quarter diluted net loss per share as reported under GAAP, is calculated using a weighted average of 206 million common shares and excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effects. Potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the 2018 GAAP per share computations due to our reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018. Diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP), and GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items, are calculated using a weighted average of 207 million common shares and includes dilutive securities. (8) Adjusted Earnings per share on a Constant Currency basis for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3.45 per diluted share, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.04 per diluted share. (9) 2017, as reported under GAAP, includes a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million ($3,018 million after-tax), net, recognized from the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange within our Technology Solutions segment.

The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry. • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, other adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.\nAcquisition-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business combinations, the formation of joint ventures and the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.\nLIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.\nGains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.\nRestructuring charges - Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, and/or Company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded. These restructuring charges are reflected under various captions within our operating expenses.\nOther adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of assets; asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses; certain discrete benefits related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.\nIncome taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 740, “Income Taxes,” which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results. Additionally, our equity method investments' financial results are adjusted for the above noted items. • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. • Adjusted Operating Profit Margin Excluding Noncontrolling Interests (Non-GAAP): The Company has arrangements involving third-party noncontrolling interests. As a result, our pre-tax results are affected by the portion of pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. To provide additional useful information to investors, we present adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests for our Distribution Solutions segment. We believe such information provides a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of pre-tax earnings that is not attributable to McKesson. We calculate adjusted operating profit excluding noncontrolling interests by removing pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from adjusted operating profit (Non-GAAP). Adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit excluding noncontrolling interests with the applicable segment’s revenues. This information is supplemental to the Company’s GAAP financial results and is provided in Schedule 3 of this document. The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We present adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of net income that is not attributable to McKesson. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180524005575/en/\nMcKesson Corporation\nCraig Mercer, 415-983-8391 (Investors and Financial Media)\nCraig.Mercer@McKesson.com\nor\nKristin Hunter Chasen, 415-983-8974 (General and Business Media)\nKristin.Chasen@McKesson.com\nSource: McKesson Corporation",
