(“IQVIA”) (NYSE: IQV), a leading global provider of advanced analytics, technology solutions, and contract research services to the life sciences industry, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. On January 1, 2018, IQVIA adopted ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Under this new standard, IQVIA recognizes revenue in the Research & Development Solutions segment on a percentage of completion basis. Additionally, ASC 606 requires that service revenue and reimbursed expense revenue be consistently presented as one line on the income statement. Unless stated otherwise, all financial information that follows has been provided under ASC 606. For comparability, IQVIA provided a reconciliation from ASC 605 to ASC 606 for 2017 actual results and 2018 guidance in its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 earnings release. Further, IQVIA is now providing recast 2017 financial results on a quarterly basis.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Operating Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of $2,563 million increased 8.6 percent on a reported basis, and 5.2 percent on a constant currency basis, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Commercial Solutions revenue of $985 million grew 14.1 percent reported and 9.3 percent at constant currency, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Research & Development Solutions revenue of $1,365 million grew 8.1 percent reported and 5.8 percent on a constant currency basis. Research & Development Solutions had approximately $390 million of reimbursed expenses in the quarter, some of which was phased in earlier in the year than originally anticipated. Contracted backlog including reimbursed expenses was $15.16 billion at March 31, 2018, and the company expects approximately $4.6 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2017, contracted backlog including reimbursed expenses was $14.84 billion. For comparability, the company is reporting Research & Development Solutions last twelve months net new business on a contracted basis excluding reimbursed expenses. Under this approach, Research & Development Solutions contracted net new business of $4.72 billion for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, grew 15.7 percent compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2017. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $213 million declined 9.0 percent reported and 12.8 percent at constant currency.\nFirst-quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $547 million increased 8.5 percent reported and 7.4 percent at constant currency. GAAP net income was $69 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.32. Adjusted Net Income of $285 million grew 8.0 percent, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.34 grew 19.6 percent.\n“We started the year with strong financial and operational performance,” said Ari Bousbib, chairman and CEO of IQVIA. “Both our Commercial Solutions and Research & Development Solutions businesses exceeded our expectations; Integrated Engagement Services was in line with expectations, and we are committed to turning this business around.”\nFinancial Position\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $960 million and debt was $10,446 million, resulting in net debt of $9,486 million. At the end of the first quarter of 2018, IQVIA’s Gross Leverage Ratio was 5.1 times, and Net Leverage Ratio was 4.6 times, trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA. At the beginning of the second quarter, IQVIA increased its revolver capacity from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion.\nShare Repurchase\nToward the end of the first quarter, the company repurchased $86 million of its stock in the open market, bringing total post-merger repurchases to $3.7 billion. IQVIA had $1.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining as of March 31, 2018.\nFull-Year 2018 and Second-Quarter 2018 Guidance\nThe company is raising its full-year 2018 revenue guidance range to $10,050 million to $10,250 million from $10,000 million to $10,200 million to reflect first-quarter currency benefit and organic operational strength. Full-year 2018 guidance is reaffirmed for Adjusted EBITDA of $2,150 million to $2,220 million and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share of $5.20 to $5.45.\nFor the second quarter, IQVIA provides guidance in the table below.\n($ millions, except per share data)\nSecond-Quarter\n2017 Recast (1)\nSecond-Quarter\n2018 Guidance\nVPY %\nRevenue $2,355 $2,470 - $2,520 4.9% - 7.0% Adjusted EBITDA $467 $510 - $530 9.2% - 13.5% Adjusted Diluted EPS $1.03 $1.17 - $1.24 13.6% - 20.4% 1.

In this context, often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “target,” similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words. Actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: most of our contracts may be terminated on short notice, and we may lose or experience delays with large client contracts or be unable to enter into new contracts; imposition of restrictions on our use of data by data suppliers or their refusal to license data to us; any failure by us to comply with contractual, regulatory or ethical requirements under our contracts, including current or changes to data protection and privacy laws; breaches or misuse of our or our outsourcing partners’ security or communications systems; hardware and software failures, delays in the operation of our computer and communications systems or the failure to implement system enhancements; failure to meet our productivity or business transformation objectives; failure to successfully invest in growth opportunities; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and our susceptibility to claims by others that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights; the expiration or inability to acquire third party licenses for technology or intellectual property; any failure by us to accurately and timely price and formulate cost estimates for contracts, or to document change orders; the rate at which our backlog converts to revenue; our ability to acquire, develop and implement technology necessary for our business; consolidation in the industries in which our clients operate; risks related to client or therapeutic concentration; the risks associated with operating on a global basis, including currency or exchange rate fluctuations and legal compliance, including anti-corruption laws; risks related to changes in accounting standards, including the impact of the changes to the revenue recognition standards; general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including financial market conditions and risks related to sales to government entities; the impact of changes in tax laws and regulations; and our ability to successfully integrate, and achieve expected benefits from, our acquired businesses. For a further discussion of the risks relating to the combined company’s business, see the “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC, as such factors may be amended or updated from time to time in our subsequent periodic and other filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement after the date of this release, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nNote on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP results, such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS are presented only as a supplement to the company’s financial statements based on GAAP. Non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance understanding of the company’s financial performance, but none of these non-GAAP financial measures are recognized terms under GAAP, and non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided within the schedules attached to this release. The company uses non-GAAP measures in its operational and financial decision making, and believes that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what it regards to be a more meaningful indicator of the underlying operating performance of the business. As a result, internal management reports feature non-GAAP measures which are also used to prepare strategic plans and annual budgets and review management compensation. The company also believes that investors may find non-GAAP financial measures useful for the same reasons, although investors are cautioned that non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP disclosures.\nOur 2018 guidance measures (other than revenue) are provided on a non-GAAP basis because the company is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures. Such items include, but are not limited to, acquisition and integration related expenses, restructuring and related charges, stock-based compensation and other items not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.\nNon-GAAP measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to the company, many of which present non-GAAP measures when reporting their results. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool. They are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP, are not measures of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period determined in accordance with GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider such performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nClick here to subscribe to Mobile Alerts for IQVIA.\nIQVIAFIN\nTable 1 IQVIA HOLDINGS INC.
