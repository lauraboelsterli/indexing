    "text": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Voters head to the polls on June 10 to decide whether Switzerland should introduce a sovereign money system.\nFILE PHOTO: A policeman takes a pictures of members of the sovereign money initiative dressed as Helvetia and William Tell, during a demonstration outside the Shareholders meeting of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in Bern, Switzerland, April 27, 2018. The slogan reads \"Dear Swiss National Bank, please remember why we founded you\". REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo Here’s what you need to know:\nWHERE DOES MONEY COME FROM? Money created by a central bank money is legal tender, while deposits with commercial banks represent a claim on central bank money. Those deposits result from banks’ lending activities. When a bank grants a loan to a customer, it credits the amount in question to their account in the form of a sight deposit. This deposit disappears from the bank’s books as soon as the customer uses it to make payments, but it remains in the banking system.\nWHAT IS SOVEREIGN MONEY? The initiants want to limit the credit-granting ability of commercial banks by making the Swiss National Bank the only body authorised to produce all new money in Switzerland.\nCommercial banks would be able to make loans using only funds they hold in long-term savings accounts, obtain from the money markets, or get from the Swiss National Bank in advance.\nIn effect, this would be 100 percent reserve-based banking.\nWHY IS THIS BEING VOTED FOR NOW? Under Switzerland’s system of direct democracy, any constitutional issue can be put to a binding referendum after proponents gather 100,000 signatures.\nWHAT HAPPENS TO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS? Customers would have the option of holding sovereign money accounts. They would pay no interest, be held off the commercial bank’s balance sheet and could be withdrawn in full at any time, making them completely safe if a bank collapsed.\nWHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE SNB’S ROLE? In future, it would implement monetary policy primarily through steering the money supply. It would no longer alter interest rates to stimulate or reduce demand for credit.\nIt would also create debt-free money.\nInstead of putting francs into the market via purchases of bonds and equities with newly created money, money would be issued directly without having to buy any assets in return. The Swiss government, cantons, or even citizens would get funds in the form of so-called helicopter money.\nHow this would work — would it be a payment or tax cuts — is not yet decided, but it could amount to several hundred francs per citizen.\nARGUMENTS FOR THE INITIATIVE Supporters say a 100 percent reserve requirement would make the banking system more resilient by preventing bank runs.\nUnder the current system, they say, banks lend too much during booms and too little in busts. Sovereign money would restore stability by giving the exclusive power of money creation back to the central bank.\nARGUMENTS AGAINST The banking lobby, the central bank and the Swiss government oppose the plan, saying sovereign money would be a dangerous and unnecessary experiment.\nFinancial regulation, such as deposit insurance which guarantees current accounts of up to 100,000 Swiss francs, guards against bank runs. Other regulations like increased capital requirements aim to prevent crashes.\nThere could also be a shortage of credit, which would make loans more expensive and ultimately harm the Swiss financial industry and the economy as a whole.\nThe SNB has said the proposal would damage its ability to conduct monetary policy because it would no longer be able to buy and sell foreign currencies to weaken or strengthen the franc as required to maintain price stability in Switzerland.\nIf the SNB was required to start distributing francs directly to the government and individuals, there are also question marks about its being able to maintain its independence from political pressure.\nReporting by John Revill and Angelika Gruber, editing by Larry King\n ",
