We do not regard the quarterly or annual fluctuations in the partnerships' carrying values to be meaningful. Therefore, our operating businesses are best analyzed before the impact of investment gains. As a consequence, in the preceding table we separate earnings of our operating businesses from our investment gains.\nAbout Biglari Holdings Inc.\nBiglari Holdings Inc. is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including media, property and casualty insurance, and restaurants. The Company's largest operating subsidiaries are involved in the franchising and operating of restaurants. All major operating, investment, and capital allocation decisions are made for the Company and its subsidiaries by Sardar Biglari, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nComment on Regulation G\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net earnings, Biglari Holdings defines pre-tax operating earnings outside of the investment gains/losses of the Company.\nRisks Associated with Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release may include \" \" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws.
