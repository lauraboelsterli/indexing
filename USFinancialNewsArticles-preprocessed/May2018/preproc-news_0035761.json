In this new role, Matt will lead OPT’s global business development activities that include market and partnership development, marketing, sales, and commercial operations throughout all targeted markets. Prior to joining OPT, Matt was Director of Sales and Marketing for Tampnet, a provider of 4G mobile technology focused on the offshore oil and gas market, where he served as a key member of the executive team selling to Gulf of Mexico and North Sea operators.\nMatt previously served in the U.S. Navy for 25 years as a Navy SEAL and rose to the rank of Command Master Chief. During the time he served in the military, he was assigned to operational units based in Europe, the Middle East, South America and in Virginia, including a tier one Naval Special Warfare unit focused on counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. After five combat deployments in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, Matt selected orders to the Naval Recruiting Command in Millington, Tennessee where he was program manager in charge of all SEAL/SWCC recruiting for the US Navy. Matt then transferred to the Naval Special Warfare Unit Four as Command Master Chief combating Trans National Organized Crime in Central America, South America and the Caribbean.\n“We’re excited to have Matt join OPT.
