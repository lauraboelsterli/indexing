REUTERS/Francois Lenoir The European Commission proposed its new multi-year financial plan earlier on Wednesday, including provisions that could result in cash being withheld from Poland over its treatment of the judiciary.\n“The way to the full compromise over the EU budget is still very long,” Konrad Szymanski told reporters in Warsaw.\nReporting by Anna Koper and Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Justyna Pawlak\n ",
