    "text": "Published: May 20, 2018 4:20 p.m. ET Share\nChina agrees to buy more U.S. goods, but no specific numbers Reuters Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.\nBy Josh Zumbrun\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration won’t apply tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. while the two countries hammer out details of a deal to reduce the yawning U.S. merchandise trade deficit with China.\n“We’re putting the trade war on hold,” Mnuchin said in an interview on Fox News Sunday, while the two countries “try to execute the framework” of a deal to reduce China’s $375 billion annual trade surplus with the U.S.\nDuring bilateral trade talks held in Washington late last week, the U.S. had demanded China reduce its trade advantage by $200 billion or more. China came to the talks ready to step up purchases of U.S. goods, but refused to agree to a specific dollar amount.\nThe talks followed U.S. threats to apply tariffs on as much as $150 billion worth of Chinese imports. The procedural steps to apply tariffs on the first $50 billion tranche of Chinese imports would have been completed next week. Over the weekend, the two sides released a joint statement after concluding the talks. The statement failed to mention any specific numerical target for reduction in the U.S. deficit, as the U.S. had wanted. ",
