    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 4:04 PM / Updated 2 hours ago EU told Britain 'time-limited' backstop won't work - EU official Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union Brexit negotiators told their British counterparts this week that a suggestion from London to make a backstop solution for avoiding a hard border on Ireland “time-limited” was unacceptable.\n“A strictly time-limited backstop would defeat the purpose of the backstop,” a senior EU official told reporters after three days of talks in Brussels. Britain had promised to come back, possibly within two weeks, with a different proposal.\nTalks were not going quickly, the official added, saying that Britain appeared to want to retain access to many EU programmes and systems while not accepting obligations and supervision by EU courts.
