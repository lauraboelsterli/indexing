European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini speaks during an international conference on the future of Syria and the region, in Brussels, Belgium, April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Walschaerts\n“I am particularly worried by the announcement tonight of new sanctions,” Mogherini said.\n“The European Union is determined to preserve it,” she said of the world powers’ 2015 agreement with Tehran. “Together with the rest of the international community, we will preserve this nuclear deal.” Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Hugh Lawson",
