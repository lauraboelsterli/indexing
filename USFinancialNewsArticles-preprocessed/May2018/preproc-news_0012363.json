    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- May 7, 2018 — GoAnimate Inc., a SaaS video creation company that allows everyone to create video quickly and easily, today announced the launch of Vyond. The company will unveil its new Vyond-branded website and video creation platform at the Association for Talent Development (ATD) International Conference and Exposition on May 7 in San Diego. The Vyond brand signifies a commitment to media that moves others to action — a commitment to go beyond static content, beyond poor engagement, and someday even beyond video.\nGoAnimate Inc., a SaaS video creation company that allows everyone to create video quickly and easily is changing its name to Vyond. The brand name change signifies the launch of next-generation product offering as it embraces the future of video and beyond,\n“We’ve experienced significant adoption and growth as GoAnimate, so much so that we’ve outgrown the idea behind it,” said CEO Alvin Hung. “We’re launching this new brand, not because of a sale or acquisition, but because we want our brand to accurately reflect both our current state and our vision for the future.”\nContinued Hung, “We’ve rebuilt our product from the ground up to cement its status as the best-in-class video creation platform. We’ve also further strengthened our security and world-class customer service, which reflects our commitment to delivering maximum value to our subscribers.”\nThe official launch at ATD 2018, the world’s largest event for talent development professionals, will showcase how Vyond will extend its position as the market leader in video creation software by emphasizing three key areas over the coming months:\nPerformance (HTML5 software, improved workflow, enterprise-specific features) Security (ISO 27001 certification, GDPR compliance, data privacy) Support (Vyond Accel , resource center, and community platform)\n“The way people communicate and learn continues to change so rapidly. Video has become expected whether you’re training a team internally or delivering a product message externally. We want everyone to be able to create high-quality video quickly and easily while also ensuring that we safeguard critical assets for our subscribers,” said Hung.\nWith Vyond, companies can create and deliver high-quality video easier than ever. Vyond offers a huge library of templates representing hundreds of industries, occupations, and concepts, and also allows for the import of external audio and images. Complex actions and lip-sync are automatic. Manage colors and styles in seconds to conform with your brand guidelines, then export to the authoring tool, LMS, or hosting platform of your choice.
