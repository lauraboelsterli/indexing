    "text": "Strongest Quarter from Continuing Operations in MVB's History\nFAIRMONT, W.Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- For the three months ended March 31, 2018, MVB Financial Corp. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: MVBF) reported net income of $2.6 million, or $0.24 basic and $0.23 diluted earnings per share compared to $1.6 million, or $0.14 basic and diluted earnings per share for the same period in 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, loans increased $51.2 million or 4.6% from December 31, 2017, which represents an annualized increase of 18.4%. The increase in loans has been driven by our expansion in northern Virginia, as well as, the addition of commercial lenders throughout our markets. In addition to the increase in loan volume during the quarter, loan yields increased 6 basis points. The Company continues to capitalize on disruptions in the market to expand both the lending and deposit teams. The locked Mortgage pipeline increased $61.8 million from December 31, 2017, while over the same period noninterest expense decreased by $975 thousand. The Company continues to monitor expense control and evaluate opportunities for efficiencies.\n“If you heard my comments as part of MVB Financial’s Closing Bell Ceremony on March 28, 2018, you know one thing for certain: I’m excited! First quarter 2018 was our strongest quarter of earnings from continuing operations in MVB history. I’m also excited about our trading volume. MVB’s daily trading volume was 1,000 shares not too long ago, and now we’re trading nearly 20,000 shares a day,” said Larry F. Mazza, CEO and President, MVB Financial.\n“I’m excited because the Mortgage pipeline exceeded budget expectations for the first quarter, and the pipeline is strong looking ahead to the next quarter. I’m also excited about our robust loan performance in the first quarter, which is due to organic growth and the strategic addition of commercial lenders in our key lending areas. I believe that we have a long runway to grow, and we will through excellent execution, hard work, organic growth and M&A. Our team is ready for the challenge. We are focused, motivated and grateful for our families, teammates, Board of Directors, shareholders, communities and especially for our clients.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nLoans of $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2018, increased $51.2 million, or 4.6%, from December 31, 2017, and increased $80.4 million, or 7.5%, from March 31, 2017. Assets of $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2018, increased $47.2 million, or 3.1%, from December 31, 2017, and increased $147.6 million, or 10.3%, from March 31, 2017. Deposits of $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2018, remained flat from December 31, 2017, and increased $17.4 million, or 1.5% from March 31, 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits of $142.8 million increased $16.9 million, or 13.4%, from December 31, 2017, and increased $23.6 million, or 19.7%, from March 31, 2017. Net interest income of $11.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, decreased $218 thousand, or 1.9%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and increased $1.2 million, or 11.2% from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Noninterest income of $9.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, decreased $1.1 million, or 11.0%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and increased $215 thousand, or 2.4%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Noninterest expense of $16.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, decreased $975 thousand, or 5.5%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and increased $422 thousand, or 2.6%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nFINANCIAL DETAILS\nLoans totaled $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $51.2 million, or 4.6%, from December 31, 2017, and an increase of $80.4 million, or 7.5%, from March 31, 2017. The growth in loans is primarily attributable to organic growth and the addition of commercial lenders within the Company’s primary lending areas. The yield on loans was 4.68% as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 6 basis points from December 31, 2017, and an increase of 36 basis points from March 31, 2017. The increase in yields is driven both by Fed rate increases and a commercial focus on increasing loan yields. In connection with the Company’s core conversion in 2017, the Company implemented a CRM system that has provided better insight on loan pricing.\nDeposits totaled $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2018, and remained flat from December 31, 2017, while increasing $17.4 million, or 1.5% from March 31, 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $142.8 million as of March 31, 2018, or 12.4% of the total deposit base, an increase of $16.9 million, or 13.4%, from December 31, 2017, and an increase of $23.6 million, or 19.7%, from March 31, 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits remain a core funding source for the Company. Management will continue to concentrate on balancing deposit growth with adequate net interest margin to meet strategic goals.\nNet interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $11.5 million, a decrease of $218 thousand, or 1.9%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of $1.2 million, or 11.2% from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was due to fewer days in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as well as loan growth occurring late in first quarter of 2018. Net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 3.29%, flat versus the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of 10 basis points versus the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nInterest expense increased 5.5% during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase of 8 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and increased 29.9% compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, due to an increase of 20 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The rising cost of borrowings placed pressure on net interest margin earned from our mortgage operations as the cost of short-term borrowings to fund the mortgage business increased, while the yield from loans held for sale remained relatively flat.\nProvision for loan loss was $474 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a $44 thousand decrease from the quarter ended March 31, 2017, despite a 7.5% increase in loans. The slight decrease in loan loss provision is attributable to lower historical loss rates for the period used to determine the allowance. Nonperforming loans increased $2.5 million, to 0.79%, of total loans as of March 31, 2018, compared to 0.61% of total loans as of March 31, 2017. In addition, net charge-offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased $38 thousand compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, resulting in an annualized net loan charge-offs to total loans ratio of 0.10% as of March 31, 2018.\nNoninterest income totaled $9.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 11.0%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of $215 thousand, or 2.4%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe $1.1 million decrease in noninterest income from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was due to a decrease of $2.0 million in mortgage fee income, which was partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in gain on derivatives. The decrease in mortgage fee income was primarily the result of a $94.0 million decrease in sold loan volume. The increase in gain on derivatives was primarily the result of an increase in the locked mortgage pipeline from $91.4 million as of December 31, 2017, to $153.2 million as of March 31, 2018.\nThe $215 thousand increase in noninterest income from the quarter ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in gain on derivatives, along with increases of $413 thousand in commercial swap fees, $203 thousand in gain on sale of portfolio loans, and $143 thousand in gain on sale of securities all of which were partially offset by a decrease of $3.1 million in mortgage fee income. The increase in gain on derivatives was primarily the result of an increase in the locked mortgage pipeline from 67.6% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to a 12.8% increase in the locked mortgage pipeline for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest expense totaled $16.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $975 thousand, or 5.5%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of $422 thousand, or 2.6%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe $975 thousand decrease in noninterest expense from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $626 thousand in salaries and employee benefits expense and a $448 thousand decrease in data processing and communications. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily the result of lower commissions paid due to a decrease in mortgage closed loan volume of 22.4% versus the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company is also experiencing lower data processing and communications expenses related to a new core system that was implemented in the second quarter of 2017.\nThe $422 thousand increase in noninterest expense from the quarter ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $511 thousand in salaries and employee benefits expense, due to the addition of lenders, treasury team members and the opening of two new branches in 2017. The Company continues to capitalize on disruptions in the market to build out the sales team.\nAs previously announced on February 20, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2018, payable March 15, 2018. This was the first quarterly dividend for 2018 and was equal to the quarterly payouts in 2017 of $0.025 per share.\nAbout MVB Financial Corp.\nMVB Financial Corp.
