    "text": "TORONTO, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Feronia Inc. (“Feronia” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:FRN) today released its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. All amounts in this release are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nQ1 2018 Highlights\nProduced 32,405 tonnes of fruit (Q1 2017: 26,301 tonnes), a year-over-year increase of 23% Produced 6,549 tonnes of Crude Palm Oil (“CPO”) (Q1 2017: 4,869 tonnes), a year-over-year increase of 35% Oil extraction rate of 20.2% (Q1 2017: 18.5%) Revenue of $5.4 million (Q1 2017: $2.3 million), a year-over-year increase of 135%, primarily from the sale of 6,571 tonnes of CPO at an average price of $776 per tonne (Q1 2017: 2,422 tonnes at $789 per tonne) Completed second tranche of private placement of $8.5 million\nXavier de Carnière, Chief Executive Officer of Feronia Inc. commented: “Whilst production levels continue to improve and, at first glance, it would be easy to consider that much of the hard work required to turn this business around has been completed, the reality is that there is still much to be done and considerable challenges to overcome.\n“Our Lokutu mill is currently not as reliable as we would want, creating a bottleneck that we must overcome rapidly if we want to cope with the increasing fruit production. At Boteka, the commissioning of our fibre boiler has suffered some delay and, with it expected to come on-line in late June 2018, considerable work will be required to make up for missing part of the peak production period. Fortunately, our new boiler and turbine at Yaligimba are performing like a Swiss watch and are fully meeting our expectations.\n“Aside from the technical challenges that we continue to overcome one by one, we have now started implementing the clauses of our social contracts recently entered into with our communities. We also have adjusted the salaries of our workforce, in line with the inflation index system that we put in place last year, to maintain the purchasing parity of our workers’ income.\n“We are no strangers to the challenges often faced when operating in the DRC but are, as we have always been, fully committed to ensuring that our employees and local communities benefit from our presence. In that regard, we have recently dedicated extra efforts and resources to help local authorities, our workers and our communities should the recent Ebola outbreak in the DRC affect Boteka. We hope that our commitment is not tested in this instance but, should it be, we are ready.”\nFor further information please contact:\nXavier de Carniere\nChief Executive Officer, Feronia Inc.\n44 (0)7468 697 658\nxavier.decarniere@feronia.com\nwww.feronia.com\nPaul Dulieu\nDirector of Communications and Corporate Development, Feronia Inc.\n44 (0)7554 521421\npaul.dulieu@feronia.com\nwww.feronia.com\nAbout Feronia Inc.\nFeronia is an agribusiness operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). At the heart of Feronia lies a long established palm oil business, Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC), which has three remotely located plantations; Lokutu, Yaligimba and Boteka. When Feronia acquired its palm oil business from Unilever in 2009, it had suffered from years of underinvestment and considerable disruption caused by conflict in the DRC. Our initial focus has been on rebuilding the business and resuming production to secure its future and the livelihoods of the thousands of people we directly employ. Feronia’s plantations produce crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). CPO is part of the staple and traditional diet of the Congolese and, with our products sold locally in the DRC, we are well placed to help decrease reliance on imports and increase food security and quality. Feronia prides itself on being the guardian of our 107 year-old palm oil business and its employees, communities, and environment. We have a long term commitment to improve the living and working environment of our employees and their communities and are committed to sustainable agriculture, environmental protection and community inclusion. Feronia has in place an Environmental and Social Action Plan which is focused on implementing environmental and social best practice and improving social infrastructure. Feronia is working towards certification by the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and is implementing IFC/World Bank standards for environmental and social sustainability. Our oil palm replanting programme is brownfield in nature – replacing old palms with new – and it has no reliance on deforestation. Feronia’s management team has extensive experience in managing both plantations and farming operations in emerging markets.
