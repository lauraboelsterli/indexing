    "text": "TOKYO, May 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Akita Matsui Trading has commented on the recent performance of Tencent Holdings as the company revealed that its Q1 financials ‎yielded considerable growth ‎on a yearly basis, as almost all business lines ‎contributed to yet ‎another profitable quarter for the Chinese internet giant.\nRevenue for the January-March period rose to 73.5 billion yuan ‎‎($11.7billion), ‎up 48 percent from Q1 2017. That ‎exceeded the ‎‎$11.3 billion average estimate of 17 analysts noted Akita Matsui Trading analysts. ‎\nThe owner of WeChat, the ‎China's most popular social-networking ‎platform, has ‎reported solid revenue growth in every quarter in the last two years. The impressive ‎performance was due to strength in its core ‎businesses as well as the cloud ‎computing, online entertainment and ‎payments segments.‎\nThe company also raised its second quarter revenue forecast to growth of ‎‎57 to 63 ‎percent, topping the most optimistic of analyst estimates. ‎\nCommenting on the results, Chief Research‎ Analyst at Akita Matsui Trading , Omori Matsuyo said: \"Tencent has made some high-profile investments in ‎recent months, which ‎made substantial contributions to it top line growth ‎over the first quarter.\"‎\nBy noon, Tencent shares were up 5 percent in ‎the benchmark Hang Seng ‎Index, adding $22 billion to the ‎company's market capitalization. They had ‎increased as much as 10 ‎percent in May, hitting a lifetime ‎closing peak of ‎HK$416 in Hong Kong. ‎\nTencent posted a 61 percent jump in quarterly net profit, which was reported ‎at 23.29 billion yuan ($3.66 billion), ‎beating forecasts of 17.5 billion yuan, ‎though revenues from some ‎product lines grew slower than expected. ‎\nMax Harrington, Head of Corporate Equities at Akita Matsui Trading added: \"Fueled by ‎‎advertising and online games, digital content subscriptions remain a ‎‎booming business and we don't see any signs of slow down or ‎deterioration. ‎Even on the domestic front, Tencent has continued to grow massively ‎‎similar to its rivals, such as Alibaba.\"‎\nTencent's strong metrics were also led by the company's forays into ‎multiple markets. ‎The Shenzhen-based firm has been looking for fresh ‎revenues streams such as its newly launched ‎mini games platform. The positive sentiment has ‎continued this year, with ‎Tencent's stock price ‎surging over 15 percent YTD ‎in 2018.‎\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tencent-beats-forecasts-as-profit-surges-60-in-first-quarter-reports-akita-matsui-trading-300651274.html\nSOURCE Akita Matsui Trading",
