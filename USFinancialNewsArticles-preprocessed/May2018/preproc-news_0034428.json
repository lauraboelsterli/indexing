The Symantec logo is pictured on a screen June 13, 2016. REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo\nThe Norton anti-virus maker said the investigation will also include company’s public disclosures including commentary on historical financial results.\n“At this time, the company does not anticipate a material adverse impact on its historical financial statements,” the company said.\nThe company said its audit committee had retained an independent counsel and other advisers to assist in the investigation.\nSymantec disclosed the whistleblower probe last Thursday in its quarterly earnings report, but did not provide details, triggering a selloff on Friday that wiped out $6 billion of the company’s market value.
