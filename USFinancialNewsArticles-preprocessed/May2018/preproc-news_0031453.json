    "text": "Comments\nSeattle is introducing a brand new tax on giant employers that may assist fund homelessness and reasonably priced housing packages—regardless of opposition from corporations resembling Amazon.\nHowever, the model of the tax that the City Council agreed to on Monday can be far much less onerous than the draft that led Amazon to droop development on a brand new workplace tower in a not-so-subtle risk over offering additional employment in Seattle.\n“We are disappointed by today’s City Council decision to introduce a tax on jobs,” Amazon mentioned in an announcement. “While we have resumed construction planning for Block 18, we remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council’s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.”\nSeattle has a severe homelessness downside that has been exacerbated by the expansion in high-paying jobs there, because of massive employers resembling Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing.\nSo, on the finish of April, the Seattle City Council launched draft laws that will pressure corporations with revenues of over $20 million within the metropolis to pay 26 cents for every hour labored by a Seattle-based worker, or roughly $540 per head per 12 months. This “head tax” was to use over 2019 and 2020, producing $86 million a 12 months for social packages, earlier than turning right into a 0.7% payroll tax. (The annual proceeds of the tax had been initially calculated at $75 million earlier than the council revised its estimates.)\nHowever, with Mayor Jenny Durkan threatening to veto the tax as a result of she was involved about its influence on employment, the measure needed to be watered right down to go.\nIn the tip, the model that handed—unanimously—will see giant employers pay 14 cents per head per hour, or $275 per head per 12 months. The tax will now generate $47 million a 12 months, and it’ll run for 5 years, fairly than turning right into a payroll tax after a two-year run.\n“This legislation will help us address our homelessness crisis without jeopardizing critical jobs. Because this ordinance represents a true shared solution, and because it lifts up those who have been left behind while also ensuring accountability and transparency, I plan to sign this legislation into law,” mentioned Durkan.\nThree-fifths of the cash raised will go to constructing new, reasonably priced housing, whereas the remaining will fund emergency providers for the homeless.\nAmazon wasn’t the one firm left grumbling. Starbucks additionally responded, with public affairs chief John Kelley saying Seattle “continues to spend without reforming and fail without accountability, while ignoring the plight of hundreds of children sleeping outside.”\n“If they cannot provide a warm meal and safe bed to a five year-old child, no one believes they will be able to make housing affordable or address opiate addiction,” Kelley mentioned.
