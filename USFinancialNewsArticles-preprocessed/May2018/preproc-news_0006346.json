    "text": "April 29, 2018 / 10:45 PM / Updated a day ago Golf-Horschel and Piercy claim New Orleans title Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nApril 29 (Reuters) - Billy Horschel won his second Zurich Classic of New Orleans title, this time with partner Scott Piercy as the Americans claimed a one-stroke over compatriots Jason Dufner and Pat Perez on Sunday.\nSolid putting by Horschel, the 2013 champion when the tournament was based on individual play, helped bring home the latest crown as he and Piercy enjoyed a bogey-free final round of five-under-par 65 in the alternate shot format to finish at 22-under 266 at TPC Louisiana.\nThe pair seized the lead with back-to-back birdies to start the back nine and finished with seven consecutive pars.\nDufner and Perez made it tight with a closing 68 but Dufnerâ€™s putt at the last to tie fell short.\nSouth Africans Charl Schwartzel and Louis Oosthuizen took third at 20-under 268 after a 62 but overnight leaders Kevin Kisner and Scott Brown soared to a 77 to tie for 15th.
