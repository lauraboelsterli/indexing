Learn more at www.benefitfocus.com , LinkedIn and Twitter .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including non-GAAP gross profit, operating income (loss), net loss, net loss per common share, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP gross profit, operating income (loss), net loss and net loss per share exclude stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, offering costs expensed, if any and costs not core to our business, if any. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before net interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense, expense related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and costs not core to our business. We define free cash flow as cash from operations plus purchases of property and equipment. Please note that other companies might define their non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do.\nManagement presents these non-GAAP financial measures in this release because it considers them to be important supplemental measures of performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including analysis of the company's performance against prior periods, the preparation of operating budgets and to determine appropriate levels of operating and capital investments. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company's financial and operational performance. Management also intends to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of the company’s future earnings discussions and, therefore, their inclusion should provide consistency in the company’s financial reporting.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures provided in this release, including in the accompanying tables.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nExcept for historical information, all of the statements, expectations, and assumptions contained in this press release are . Actual results might differ materially from those explicit or implicit in the . Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: our continuing losses and need to achieve GAAP profitability; fluctuations in our financial results; risks related to changing healthcare and other applicable regulations; our ability to maintain our culture, recruit and retain qualified personnel and effectively expand our sales force; cyber-security risks; the immature and volatile market for our products and services; the need to innovate and provide useful products and services; our ability to compete effectively; privacy, security and other risks associated with our business; and the other risk factors set forth from time to time in our SEC filings, copies of which are available free of charge within the Investor Relations section of the Benefitfocus website at http://investor.benefitfocus.com/sec-filings or upon request from our Investor Relations Department.
