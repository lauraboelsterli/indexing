Carrington, CEO of ServiceSource. “With his leadership, we refocused the business, executed a successful international expansion, drove major advances to our technology and data platforms, and fostered a culture of client centricity that have had profoundly positive impacts on ServiceSource. He has been a tremendous partner in returning the business to health, growth and market leadership. On behalf of the board and all ServiceSource employees, I want to thank Brian for his many contributions and wish him all the best in retirement.”\nWith Delaney’s retirement, the company will be simplifying the organization by naming two regional presidents who will now report to Carrington.\nMichael Poe, a seven-year veteran of ServiceSource, will assume the role of President – Americas, overseeing the company’s operations in the United States and the Philippines.
