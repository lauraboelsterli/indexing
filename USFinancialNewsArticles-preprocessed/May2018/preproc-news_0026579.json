    "text": "GREENVILLE, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- World Acceptance Corporation (NASDAQ: WRLD) today reported financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nThree-month results\nGross loans outstanding increased to $1.11 billion as of March 31, 2018, a 4.3% increase from the $1.06 billion of gross loans outstanding as of March 31, 2017. Gross loans in the US increased by 6.5%. Gross loans in Mexico decreased 13.4% in US dollars and 16.0% in Mexican pesos. Our unique borrowers in the US decreased by 59,031 or 7.0% during the fourth quarter of 2018. This is compared to a decrease of 62,039 or 7.8% during the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 88,172 or 10.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a decrease of 73,180 or 8.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. For fiscal 2018, we increased our unique borrowers in the US by 42,740 or 5.8%, compared to an increase of 7,631 or 1.0% in fiscal 2017, a decrease of 45,867 or 5.9% in fiscal 2016 and decrease of 11,914 or 1.5% in fiscal 2015.\nNet income for the fourth quarter decreased to $29.1 million, an 8.5% decrease from the $31.9 million reported for the same quarter of the prior year. Net income per diluted share decreased 12.7% to $3.18 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $3.64 in the prior year quarter. The decreases in net income and net income per diluted share were primarily due to the recognition of the deemed repatriation transition tax (the “Transition Tax”), as described below. Excluding the impact of the Transition Tax, net income for the fourth quarter increased 6.7% to $34.0 million compared to $31.9 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Excluding the Transition Tax, net income per diluted share increased 1.7% to $3.70 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $3.64 in the prior year quarter. See “Non-GAAP financial measures” below.\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter increased to $151.9 million, a 5.0% increase from the $144.6 million reported for the same quarter of the prior year. In the US, revenues from the 1,127 offices open throughout both quarterly periods increased by 5.0%. Interest and fee income increased 4.2%, from $119.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to $124.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in average earning loans. Insurance and other income increased by 9.3% to $27.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was related to a $580,000 increase in insurance revenue and a $1.7 million increase in other income compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase in tax preparation revenue.\nAccounts in the US that were 61 days or more past due increased to 5.4% on a recency basis and to 7.5% on a contractual basis at March 31, 2018, compared to 5.0% and 7.0%, respectively, at March 31, 2017. On a consolidated basis, accounts that were 61 days or more past due increased to 6.3% on a recency basis and to 8.8% on a contractual basis at March 31, 2018, compared to 5.5% and 7.8%, respectively, at March 31, 2017. As a result of the higher delinquencies, our allowance for loan losses compared to net loans increased from 9.4% at March 31, 2017, to 10.0% at March 31, 2018.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company ceased all in-person collection visits in December 2015. Following this change in practice, in fiscal 2017 we experienced an increase in delinquencies and charge-offs. We saw an improvement in net charge-offs during the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. This trend continued in the US for the fourth quarter. However, consolidated net charge-offs as a percentage of average net loans on an annualized basis increased from 15.4% to 16.0% when comparing the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, due to increased charge-offs in Mexico. The consolidated provision for the quarter decreased by $3.3 million when comparing the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Consolidated net charge-offs were up $2.9 million when comparing the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The portion of the provision related to a change in loans outstanding decreased by $700,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to the decrease in loans outstanding in Mexico. The US provision decreased $1.6 million when comparing the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The portion of the US provision related to an increase in loans outstanding was flat when comparing the fourth quarter to the prior year quarter. There was a $1.8 million decrease in the US provision due to a larger decrease during the quarter in accounts that were 90 days past due when comparing the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This was offset by an increase in net charge-offs of $1.8 million.\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses amounted to $80.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $70.0 million in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses increased from 48.4% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to 53.2% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. G&A expenses per average open office increased by 15.1 % when comparing the two fiscal quarters, primarily due to an increase in personnel expense, advertising expense, and legal and professional expense.\nPersonnel expense increased $5.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Personnel expense in the US increased by $5.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase is primarily due to $2.5 million in severance related amounts as a result of the separation agreement entered into with the Company’s former CEO. The Company also recorded a $1.8 million charge due to a change in the Company’s paid time off policy that accelerated the accrual of time-off within the calendar year. The policy change became effective January 1, 2018.\nAdvertising expense increased 32.5%, or $950,000 relative to the same quarter last year.\nLegal and professional expense increased by $2.9 million primarily due to additional expense related to the previously disclosed investigation related to our operations in Mexico. We incurred $1.6 million in expense directly related to the investigation during the quarter. See “Other Matters” below for additional information regarding the investigation.\nInterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, decreased by $73,000, or 1.4% from the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The decrease in interest expense is due to a 9.7% decrease in the average debt outstanding, from $350.0 million to $316.2 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s debt to equity ratio decreased from 0.6:1 at March 31, 2017, to 0.5:1 at March 31, 2018.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. US accounting standards require the remeasurement of all US deferred income tax for temporary differences from the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent to the new corporate tax rate of 21 percent. A cumulative adjustment of $10.5 million was recognized in income tax expense from continuing operations as a discrete item in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which included the enactment date. The TCJA requires companies to pay a one-time Transition Tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, we determined, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. We have recorded a provisional Federal and state Transition Tax obligation of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.\nOther key return ratios for the fourth quarter included a 6.3% return on average assets and a return on average equity of 10.9% (both on a trailing 12-month basis).\nAt March 31, 2018, we had approximately 156,000 accounts and approximately $100.9 million in gross loans outstanding in Mexico. There were $116.5 million in gross loans in Mexico as of March 31, 2017. Annualized net charge-offs for Mexico as a percentage of average net loans increased from 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to 16.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Additionally, our Mexican 61+ day delinquencies were 15.8% and 22.7% on a recency and contractual basis, respectively, as of March 31, 2018, a change from 10.1% and 14.0%, respectively, as of March 31, 2017.\nTwelve-month results\nNet income for the twelve months of fiscal 2018 decreased to $53.7 million, a 27.1% decrease from the $73.6 million reported for the prior year. Fully diluted net income per share decreased 28.5% to $5.99 for fiscal 2018 compared to $8.38 for fiscal 2017.\nTotal revenues for the twelve months of fiscal 2018 increased to $548.7 million, a 3.2% increase from the $531.7 million reported for the prior year. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average net loans decreased from 15.7% during fiscal 2017 to 14.9% for fiscal 2018.\nOther matters\nAs previously disclosed, we are conducting an investigation of our operations in Mexico, focusing on the legality under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain local laws of certain payments related to loans, the maintenance of the Company’s books and records associated with such payments, and the treatment of compensation matters for certain employees. We promptly retained outside legal counsel and forensic accountants to lead the investigation upon receipt of an anonymous letter regarding compliance matters, and we have voluntarily contacted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to advise both agencies that an investigation is underway. We are committed to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, intend to cooperate fully with both the SEC and the DOJ, and are continuing to develop and execute a remediation plan to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law. The results of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, reflect the estimated impact of its enactment, which resulted in a $4.8 million decrease in net income for the fourth quarter. Net income and earnings per share excluding the impact of these significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help investors understand the impact of these items on reported results.\nAbout World Acceptance Corporation\nWorld Acceptance Corporation is one of the largest small-loan consumer finance companies, operating 1,308 offices in 15 states and Mexico.\nFourth quarter conference call\nThe senior management of World Acceptance Corporation will be discussing these results in its quarterly conference call to be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time today.
