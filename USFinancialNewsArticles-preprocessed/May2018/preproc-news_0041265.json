    "text": "Westbrook, Maine, Synergy CHC Corp. (OTCQB: SNYR ) (“Synergy” or the “Company”), a consumer health care & beauty company, today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet sales for the first quarter were $9.7 million, compared to $10.8 million for the same quarter in 2017, a 10% decrease. For the first quarter, our net income was negative $0.1 million or ($0.00) (basic and diluted) earnings per share, compared to net income of $2.6 million or $0.03 (basic and diluted) earnings per share for 2017.\nWe currently focus on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business relationships and our resulting operating performance and financial position. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.3 million.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company’s definitions of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA might not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n“Synergy is off to a strong start in 2018 with the addition of new product launches and websites for our Hand MD and Sneaky Vaunt brands,” said Jack Ross, CEO of Synergy. “Moreover, Synergy’s expanding portfolio of products will continue to grow with additions coming to both our Flat Tummy and FOCUSfactor brands.”\nAbout Synergy CHC Corp.\nSynergy CHC Corp. is a leading omni-channel consumer health and beauty company that is in the process of building a portfolio of best-in-class consumer product brands and utilizes The Synergy Effect, which includes a proprietary ROI based algorithm, to sell its products online through social media influencers. Synergy’s strategy is to grow its portfolio both organically and by further acquisition. Synergy’s diversified portfolio now includes FOCUSfactor™, Flat Tummy™, Per-fékt Beauty™, Sneaky Vaunt™, The Queen Pegasus™, Neuragen™, and Hand MD™. For more information, please visit www.synergychc.com .\nSynergy’s brands:\nFlat Tummy ®\nFlat Tummy Tea’s uniquely formulated two-step herbal detox tea works to naturally help speed metabolism, boost energy and reduce bloating to flatten your tummy. It is currently sold online to a 20-30 year old female, predominantly American market.\nSince being founded in 2013, Flat Tummy has grown rapidly, largely attributed to the strength of its branding and its innovative and effective use of social media marketing. The secret is a very specific process and ROI based algorithm used on various social media platforms. To date, Flat Tummy has built a targeted social media following of over 1,500,000, many of whom are now customers.\nFlat Tummy now has over 13,500 positive written reviews on its website, www.flattummyco.com or visit its Instagram page.\nFOCUSfactor ®\nFOCUSfactor is sold at America’s leading retailers such as Costco, Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart, BJ’s Walgreens, CVS and The Vitamin Shoppe. FOCUSfactor, America’s leading brain health supplement, is a nutritional supplement that includes a proprietary blend of brain supporting vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrients. In December 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued US Patent 8,329,227 covering FOCUSfactor’s proprietary formulation “for enhanced mental function”. The issuance of the patent marked one of the few times a patent has been issued for a nationally branded nutritional supplement. FOCUSfactor is clinically tested with results demonstrating improvements in focus, concentration and memory in healthy adults. More information on FOCUSfactor can be found at www.focusfactor.com or visit their Instagram page.\nPer-fékt Beauty ®\nPer-fékt Beauty is one of Synergy's newest brands that was acquired in June of 2017. Per-fékt Beauty markets and sells a specialized range of beauty products (makeup, skin-care & body) via retailers and online through social media channels.\nPer-fékt Beauty is well established in the beauty retail space, opening up an exciting retail opportunity for the rest of our products in that industry. Even more exciting is the potential to apply the same ROI based algorithm that Flat Tummy uses and is currently being used by The Synergy Effect on various online marketing platforms – what could be more per-fekt?\nPer-fékt Beauty can be found at perfektbeauty.com or visit their Instagram page.\nSneaky Vaunt ®\nSneaky Vaunt is one of Synergy's newest brands that launched in March of 2017. Sneaky Vaunt markets and sells a backless, strapless, stick on, push up bra as well as other lingerie items exclusively online through social media channels.\nSneaky Vaunt is being marketed on the same ROI based algorithm that Flat Tummy uses and is currently being used by The Synergy Effect on various online marketing platforms. In just over one year, Sneaky Vaunt has built a targeted social media following of over 450,000 on Instagram.\nSneaky Vaunt can be found at sneakyvaunt.com or visit their Instagram page.\nHand MD ®\nHand MD is the world’s first anti-aging skincare line formulated specifically for the hands. Hands reveal a woman’s true age and the rejuvenation of the hand has become women’s #1 aging concern. Developed by Kara Harshbarger and renowned celebrity dermatologist Dr. Alex Khadavi, Hand MD’s extensive clinical trials show significant improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, skin hydration, hyper-pigmentation and radiance. Hand MD launched on QVC and sold out in an astonishing 5 minutes. More information on Hand MD can be found at handmd.com\nNeuragen ®\nNeuragen ® is a topical product that works directly at the site of the pain as opposed to oral products. Neuragen ® reduces the spontaneous firing of damaged peripheral nerves. By calming these firings at the source, Neuragen ® is clinically shown to reduce shooting and burning pains quickly and without the side effects of orally taken medications. This is in part due to the small lipophilic molecules found in Neuragen ® which rapidly carry the active ingredients through the rough outer layer of the skin to the site of the pain. Neuragen ® is available over the counter in most local pharmacies either in the diabetic section or the analgesic (pain) section. For more information, please visit neuragen.ca\nThe Synergy Effect ®\nThe Synergy Effect is Synergy’s fast-growth online marketing platform, a growth engine built to grow brands exponentially online. Launched in 2017, The Synergy Effect powers Synergy’s brands online, driving revenue using best-in-class digital strategy and its proprietary ROI algorithm. Already boasting success stories including Flat Tummy and Sneaky Vaunt, both of which have experienced unprecedented growth in digital and social media, The Synergy Effect will spend the upcoming year further unlocking the huge online growth potential within Synergy’s existing portfolio of brands, as well as brands acquired by Synergy.\nMore information on The Synergy Effect can be found at thesynergyeffect.com\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
