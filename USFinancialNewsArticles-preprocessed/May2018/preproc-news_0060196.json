    "text": "BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Plymouth Industrial REIT, Inc. (NYSE American: PLYM) (the “Company”) today announced that it has terminated the underwritten public offering of its common stock previously announced on May 21, 2018. The termination results from an assessment by the Company's management that current market conditions are not conducive for an offering on terms that would be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders. As a result of such termination, no shares of common stock will be sold pursuant to the offering.\nThe offering was being made pursuant to a preliminary prospectus dated May 21, 2018 that formed a part of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-225062), which has not been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\nAbout Plymouth\nPlymouth Industrial REIT, Inc. is a vertically integrated and self-managed real estate investment trust focused on the acquisition and operation of single and multi-tenant industrial properties located in secondary and select primary markets across the United States.
