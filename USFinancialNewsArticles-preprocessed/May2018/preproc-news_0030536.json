    "text": "SEATTLE, May 14 (Reuters) - Seattle’s city council on Monday voted to impose a new “head tax” on the city’s biggest companies, including Amazon.com, as a way of fighting a housing crisis sponsors attribute largely to a local economic boom driving up real estate costs.\nThe measure, passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, represented a scaled-back compromise that would raise roughly $47 million a year over five years — down from $75 million annually as a council committee approved last week - to support affordable housing and services for the homeless.\nAmazon, the city’s largest employer, had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday’s action.
