(\"REG\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:REGI) today announced its financial results for first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenues for the quarter were $689.3 million on 135.3 million gallons of fuel sold. Revenues in the first quarter increased $270.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2017 mainly due to the recognition of the entire 2017 federal Biodiesel Mixture Excise Tax Credit (\"BTC\") in our GAAP financial statements in the first quarter of 2018. In addition to the BTC impact, the revenue increase is also the result of a 10.8% increase in gallons sold. Excluding the BTC, average selling price per gallon was $3.18, an increase of 8.2% over the prior year period. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $209.2 million, compared to net loss of $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting recognition of revenues from the entire BTC for 2017 in the 2018 period and no BTC in effect in 2017. Adjusted net income was $4.7 million compared to Adjusted net loss (excluding allocation of the 2017 BTC) of $13.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $17.5 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA (excluding allocation of the 2017 BTC) of $0.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn an adjusted basis, the most recent quarter did not benefit from the BTC, while the prior year period did. After reallocating the net benefit of the BTC to applicable periods in 2017, Adjusted net income was $4.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to Adjusted net income of $22.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $17.5 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $37.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"We are very pleased with our first quarter results,\" said REG President and CEO Randy Howard. \"We generated $17.5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter which traditionally is a period when we operate at closer to a break-even level without the BTC in effect. Energy prices ran up late in the quarter resulting in risk management losses that negatively impacted our Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. However, the higher energy prices should result in better margins on those gallons once delivered in the second quarter.\"\nHoward continued, \"The margin environment continues to look strong as a result of a combination of higher energy prices and lower feedstock prices. We believe that we are in a position to deliver solid results in the second quarter based on current market conditions.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nAll figures refer to the quarter ending March 31, 2018, unless otherwise noted. All comparisons are to the quarter ended March 31, 2017 unless otherwise noted.\nREG sold a total of 135.3 million gallons of fuel, an increase of 10.8% primarily due to increased petroleum gallons sold offset by fewer sales of third party biodiesel. The average selling price per gallon excluding the BTC recognition was $3.18, an increase of 8.2%. The Company produced 106.4 million gallons of biomass-based diesel during the quarter, an 9.8% increase.\nRevenues were $689.3 million, an increase of 64.5% primarily due to the recognition of the 2017 BTC and higher gallons sold.\nOn January 1, 2018, the BTC lapsed as it has several times in the past. Each time it previously lapsed, Congress has reinstated it retroactively. As a result of this history, the Company and many other industry participants have adopted contractual arrangements with customers specifying the allocation and sharing of a retroactively reinstated incentive. The Company estimates that if the BTC is retroactively reinstated for 2018 on the same terms as in 2017, REG's Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA for business conducted in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 would each increase by approximately $42.5 million.\nGross profit was $249.6 million, or 36.2% of revenues, compared to gross profit of $17.3 million, or 4.1% of revenues. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased due to the recognition of the BTC in the quarter offset by the impact from risk management.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $209.2 million, or $5.30 per share on a fully diluted basis. This compares to a net loss of $15.9 million, or $0.41 per share, on a fully diluted basis in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income, excluding the BTC, attributable to common stockholders was $4.7 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $13.6 million, or $0.35 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $17.5 million compared to $0.6 million, excluding the BTC, in the first quarter 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, REG had cash and cash equivalents of $69.3 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from December 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, accounts receivable were $466.5 million, or 61 days of sales. Accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 were $90.6 million. Inventory was $171.9 million at March 31, 2018, or 35 days of cost of sales, an increase of $36.4 million from December 31, 2017. Accounts payable were $238.5 million and $84.6 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Accounts receivable and accounts payable were higher at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 primarily due to the recognition of the 2017 federal BTC in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe table below summarizes REG’s results for the first quarter of 2018.\nREG Q1 2018 and Q1 2017 Revenues, Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA Summary (dollars and gallons in thousands) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Y/Y Change Gallons sold 135,253 122,121 10.8% Average selling price per gallon, excluding the BTC $ 3.18 $ 2.94 8.2% Total revenues $ 689,252 $ 418,893 64.5% Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 209,238 $ (15,914 ) N/M Adjusted EBITDA excluding 2017 BTC allocation $ 17,474 $ 604 2,793.0% Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,474 $ 37,332 (53.2)% Reconciliation of Non - GAAP Measures\nThe Company believes supplementing its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP with non-GAAP measures provides investors with useful information regarding the Company's core operating performance, as well as short-term and long-term trends.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per common share are derived from GAAP results by excluding the non-cash impacts related to the change in the estimated fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability, change in fair value of contingent considerations, impairment of assets, and stock compensation, coupled with other items identified in the table below that are not related to our core operating activities.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for certain additional items identified in the table below, or Adjusted EBITDA, is presented in order to assist investors in analyzing performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are not believed to be indicative of core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is used by the Company to evaluate, assess and benchmark financial performance on a consistent and a comparable basis and as a factor in determining incentive compensation for Company executives.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per common share and Adjusted EBITDA as presented by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS Reconciliation:\nThe following table sets forth Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS for the periods presented, as well as reconciliation to net income (loss):\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months\nEnded\nMarch 31,\n2018 Three Months\nEnded\nMarch 31,\n2017 Net income (loss) attributable to the Company $ 214,389 $ (15,914) Gain on involuntary conversion (4,000) — Gain on sale of assets (990) — Change in fair value of convertible debt conversion liability — 172 Change in fair value of contingent considerations (1,540) 589 Loss on debt extinguishment 232 — Other (income) expense, net (222) 320 Straight-line lease expense (33) (32) Executive severance payment 165 — Non-cash stock compensation 1,794 1,308 2017 BTC (204,936) — Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to the Company $ 4,859 $ (13,557) Effect of participating share-based awards 117 — Adjusted net income (loss) excluding 2017 BTC allocation attributable to common\nstockholders $ 4,742 $ (13,557) Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to the Company $ 4,859 $ (13,557) Allocation of 2017 BTC — 36,728 Adjusted net income (loss) including 2017 BTC allocation attributable to the Company 4,859 23,171 Effect of participating share-based awards 117 492 Adjusted net income (loss) including 2017 BTC allocation attributable to common\nstockholders $ 4,742 $ 22,679 Net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders Diluted $ 5.30 $ (0.41) Adjusted net income (loss) excluding 2017 BTC allocation per share attributable\nto common stockholders Diluted $ 0.12 (0.35) Adjusted net income including 2017 BTC allocation per share attributable to\ncommon stockholders Diluted $ 0.12 $ 0.59 Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:\nThe following table sets forth Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented, as well as reconciliation to net income (loss):\nThree Months\nEnded\nMarch 31,\n2018 Three Months\nEnded\nMarch 31,\n2017 (In thousands) Net income (loss) $ 214,389 $ (15,914 ) Adjustments: Income tax (benefit) expense (1,203 ) 1,075 Interest expense 4,651 4,536 Depreciation 8,859 8,423 Amortization 308 127 EBITDA 227,004 (1,753 ) Gain on involuntary conversion (4,000 ) — Gain on sale of assets (990 ) — Change in fair value of convertible debt conversion liability — 172 Change in fair value of contingent liability (1,540 ) 589 Loss on debt extinguishment 232 — Other (income) expense, net (222 ) 320 Straight-line lease expense (33 ) (32 ) Executive severance 165 — Non-cash stock compensation 1,794 1,308 2017 BTC (1) (204,936 ) — Adjusted EBITDA excluding 2017 BTC allocation 17,474 604 Allocation of 2017 BTC (1) — 36,728 Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,474 $ 37,332 (1) On February 9, 2018, the Biodiesel Mixture Excise Tax Credit (\"BTC\") was retroactively reinstated for the 2017 calendar year. The retroactive credit for 2017 resulted in a net benefit to us that was recognized in the first quarter of 2018 for GAAP purposes. Because this credit relates to the 2017 full year operating performance and results, we removed the net benefit of the 2017 BTC from our 2018 results and allocated a portion of the net benefit of the tax credit to each of the four quarters of 2017 based upon gallons sold.\nAbout Renewable Energy Group\nRenewable Energy Group, Inc.
