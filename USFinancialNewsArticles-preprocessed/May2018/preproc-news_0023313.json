    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 3:01 PM / Updated an hour ago Swiss Islamic leader, facing propaganda charges, refused gun permit John Miller 4 Min Read\nZURICH (Reuters) - A man charged last year with promoting al Qaeda propaganda has been refused a firearms permit, in a ruling by Switzerland’s highest court which he said was driven by anti-Muslim discrimination.\nNicolas Blancho, chairman of the Islamic Central Council of Switzerland (ICCS), sought permission in 2014 to own a SIG Sauer P226 pistol. His bid was rejected, first by police and military officials and later by a Bern court, documents show.\nIn Blancho’s appeal, he contended the lower court had failed to appropriately weigh his private interests in obtaining a firearms license to protect himself and his family against the public’s interest in denying him access to a legal weapon.\nIn their rejection, a three-judge panel of the Swiss Federal Tribunal concluded his appeal failed to address the legal basis of the lower court’s decision and instead resorted to general criticisms that it could not consider.\nThey also underscored the lower court’s conclusion that Blancho failed to offer assurances he could responsibly own a weapon.\nDocuments show the lower court considered Blancho’s “radical beliefs,” such as encouraging others to oppose “interventionist Western forces” and what it said was his refusal to completely accept Swiss laws.\n“There were concrete indications the complainant himself could jeopardize third parties,” the lower court concluded.\n“Nor does the complainant have any guarantee that he would not illegally hand over a weapon acquired by him to other persons who might, in turn, endanger third parties.”\nSwitzerland has liberal gun ownership laws, but individuals generally must apply for a permit.\nThe ICCS describes itself as Switzerland’s largest Islamic organization and says it focuses on representing the local population.\nBlancho was among three ICCS officials charged last September with offences under the Federal Act on the Proscription of Al-Qaeda, Islamic State and Associated Organizations over films made by members of the group in Syria and posted online.\nThe 2015 videos included interviews with leaders of a jihadist umbrella group and of Jabhat al-Nusra, which is affiliated with al Qaeda.\nProsecutors say the films were propaganda in which the filmmakers failed to explicitly distance themselves from al Qaeda activities in Syria. The ICCS contends the video was intended to shed light on a troubled region, not glorify extremists.\nThe ICCS has called the indictments “clearly politically motivated”. The trial is to open next week.\nBlancho’s organization called the Federal Tribunal’s decision on Tuesday “scandalous” and said the case was one of several in which Muslims in Switzerland had been denied weapons permits.\nIn a written statement to Reuters, Blancho called the ruling “humiliating”.\n“For a Swiss citizen to be prevented from owning a weapon because of my Islamic beliefs violates principles of equal treatment,” he said.\n“It also shows that as a Muslim, I am considered a special case in which people just assume I represent a physical threat. That offends me and is unfair.” Reporting by John Miller; editing by Andrew Roche",
