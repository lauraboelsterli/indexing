Other financial institutions — such as regional banks, small banks and credit unions — could also start providing these loans if they get the OK from their respective regulators. Loans with lower interest rates and more lenient pay back requirements could save a typical borrower hundreds of dollars per year. Published 1 Hour Ago CNBC.com\nConsumers who rely on payday loans to fill their budget gaps may have a new option to turn to: traditional banks.\nNational banks just received the go-ahead to serve that market from their regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\nOn Wednesday, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting called for national banks and federal savings associations to step into the short-term, small-dollar installment loan market.\nThese loans typically range from $300 to $5,000, according to the regulator. And that adds up to about $90 billion in loans taken out every year by millions of U.S. consumers. wecolmia | Getty Images\n\"Consumers should have more choices that are safe and affordable, and banks should be part of that solution,\" Otting said in a statement.\nLetting banks offer these kinds of loans will give more choice to consumers, who often turn to payday loans to make up for personal money shortages.\n\"The OCC announcement gives banks the regulatory certainty they needed to offer small loans,\" said Alex Horowitz, senior research officer for the consumer finance project at Pew Charitable Trusts. \"That's a big deal.\"\nUnlike payday loans, which are typically due all at once with the next pay check, short-term, small-dollar loans would give consumers two to 12 months to pay off their balance over several installments, according Horowitz. \"This is good news for consumers.\" -Alex Horowitz, Pew Charitable Trusts\nShort-term loans generally also come with a two-digit annual percentage rate, versus the three digit APR that payday loans typically demand.\n\"This is good news for consumers,\" Horowitz said. \"For a typical payday loan borrower, using a loan like this from a bank would save them hundreds of dollars a year.\"\nThe OCC's go ahead is a key development following authorization the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau gave banks and credit unions to provide these loans last October. The CFPB's green light also came with a condition — that consumers would have at least 45 days to repay the loans.\nFinancial institutions needed the okay from their respective regulators — one of which was the OCC — in order to follow up on the CFPB's move. Others may follow\nThe OCC primarily oversees large banks. That means that other financial institutions who want to get into this lending, such as regional banks, small banks and credit unions, would need the okay from their respective regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration.\nOn Thursday, the National Credit Union Administration proposed a new rule to loosen some of the regulations on small-dollar loan programs, which would make it easier for credit unions to offer these loans, Horowitz said.\nThe FDIC could also opt to reevaluate the rules for offering these kinds of loans for the small banks it regulates once it comes under new leadership.\nAnother proposal for making payday loan-type lending more mainstream was put forth by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, in April. Gillibrand proposed that the U.S. Post Office could start offering retail banking services including small-dollar loans with low fees and interest rates. show chapters",
