    "text": "Diluted EPS of ($2.80) and Adjusted EPS of $1.04\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cabot Corporation (NYSE: CBT) today announced results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nKey Highlights\nDiluted EPS of ($2.80), compared with $1.19 in the prior year period; Adjusted EPS of $1.04, up 18% year-over-year Record EBIT quarter for Reinforcement Materials; 46% increase year-over-year Performance Chemicals EBIT up 12% year-over-year Purification Solutions after-tax asset impairment of $224 million\n(In millions, except per share amounts) Second Quarter 2018 2017 Net sales $ 818 $ 678 Net income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation $ (173 ) $ 74 Net income (loss) per diluted share attributable to Cabot Corporation $\n(2.80\n)\n$\n1.19\nLess: Certain items after tax per share $ (3.84 ) $ 0.31 Adjusted EPS $ 1.04 $ 0.88 Commenting on the results, Cabot President and CEO Sean Keohane said, “I am very pleased with the strong operating results this quarter as we continue to drive our growth strategy. Reinforcement Materials delivered a record EBIT quarter with a 46% year-over-year increase largely from 2018 calendar year customer agreements, strong spot pricing, particularly in Asia, and high capacity utilization. Performance Chemicals results improved compared to the prior year quarter from stronger volumes and realization of price increases across the segment. We had a challenging quarter in Purification Solutions with EBIT lower than the prior year quarter due to lower volumes and pricing in mercury removal products.”\nFinancial Detail\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018, net loss attributable to Cabot Corporation was $173 million ($2.80 per diluted common share). Net loss includes an after-tax charge of $237 million from certain items, which was predominantly comprised of an asset impairment charge in the Purification Solutions segment. Adjusted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.04 per share.\nSegment Results\nReinforcement Materials -- Second quarter fiscal 2018 EBIT in Reinforcement Materials increased by $25 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in EBIT was principally driven by higher prices in Asia and improved pricing and product mix from calendar year 2018 customer agreements. Globally, volumes were flat year over year with gains in Europe and the Americas that offset a decrease in volumes in Asia. Sequentially, Reinforcement Materials EBIT increased by $17 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 driven by improved pricing and product mix and 3% higher volumes with increases in the Americas and Europe, partially offset by seasonally lower volumes in Asia.\nGlobal and regional volume changes for Reinforcement Materials for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the same quarter of the prior year and the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are included in the table below:\nSecond Quarter\nYear over Year Change\nSecond Quarter\nSequential Change\nChanges in Global Reinforcement Materials Volumes 0%\n3%\nAsia (7%) (4%) Europe, Middle East, Africa 7% 12% Americas 5% 9% Performance Chemicals -- Second quarter fiscal 2018 EBIT in Performance Chemicals increased by $6 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher unit margins achieved by price increases and favorable product mix that more than offset higher raw materials costs. Additionally, volumes increased by 9% in the Specialty Carbons and Formulations business and 2% in the Metal Oxides business. Sequentially, Performance Chemicals EBIT increased by $10 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a 19% increase in volumes from Specialty Carbons and Formulations. Metal Oxides volumes were flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The higher segment volumes in both comparative periods were partially offset by higher fixed costs.\nPurification Solutions – Second quarter fiscal 2018 EBIT in Purification Solutions decreased by $8 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 due to lower volumes and margins from increased competition and lower demand in mercury removal applications. Sequentially, Purification Solutions EBIT decreased by $12 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to lower mercury removal volumes and the receipt of the final $5 million of royalty payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The ongoing competitive pressures in mercury removal and other North American powdered activated carbon applications create a challenging outlook for the business, which has resulted in an after-tax impairment charge to the Purification Solutions segment in the quarter of $224 million.\nSpecialty Fluids – Second quarter fiscal 2018 EBIT in Specialty Fluids decreased by $3 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and by $1 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower project activity.\nCash Performance - The Company ended the second quarter of fiscal 2018 with a cash balance of $179 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, cash flows from operating activities were $36 million, which included a $65 million increase in net working capital. Capital expenditures for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $57 million. Additional uses of cash during the second quarter included $19 million for dividends.\nTaxes – During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $7 million for an effective tax rate of 4% and an operating tax rate of 21%. The benefit includes a $27 million net benefit of certain items and discrete tax items primarily related to the Purification Solutions impairment.\nOutlook\nCommenting on the outlook for the Company, Keohane said, “We are very pleased with our current quarter results and our trajectory for the full year. Looking ahead, we anticipate that Reinforcement Materials will continue its robust performance for the balance of the year supported by our strong execution in a favorable market environment. In Performance Chemicals, we expect to maintain our margins while we drive volume growth through the second half of the year. Although the ongoing competitive pressures will continue to impact results in the Purification Solutions segment, we expect higher seasonal volumes and lower variable costs in the second half of the year. In the Specialty Fluids segment, we are expecting the startup of drilling activity on previously awarded projects to drive improved results in the remainder of the year. We continue to execute on our strategy which is delivering significantly higher performance in 2018.”\nEarnings Call\nThe Company will host a conference call with industry analysts at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.

All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including with respect to our performance in the second half of fiscal 2018 and the factors that we expect will impact volumes, demand for our products and margins are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, potentially inaccurate assumptions, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. If known or unknown risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, our actual results could differ materially from past results and from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our results to differ expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to volatility in the price of energy and raw materials; competition from other specialty chemical companies; safety, health and environmental requirements; a significant adverse change in a customer relationship; negative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions; unanticipated delays in site development projects; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates. These factors are discussed more fully in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly under the heading “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, filed with the SEC at www.sec.gov . We assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forward-looking statements should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Cabot’s consolidated financial statements presented on a generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) basis, the preceding discussion of our results and the accompanying financial tables report Adjusted EPS and our operating tax rate, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP. A reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to net income (loss) per share attributable to Cabot Corporation, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and a reconciliation of operating tax rate to effective tax rate, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, are provided in the table titled “Certain Items and Reconciliation of Adjusted EPS and Operating Tax Rate.”\nManagement believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by Cabot management in its financial and operational decision-making, allow investors to see Cabot’s results through the eyes of management, and better enable Cabot’s investors to understand Cabot’s operating performance and financial condition.\nAdjusted EPS . In calculating Adjusted EPS, we exclude from our net income (loss) per share from continuing operations items of expense and income that management does not consider representative of the Company’s business operations. Accordingly, reporting earnings on an adjusted basis supplements the GAAP measure of performance and provides additional information related to the underlying performance of the business. For example, certain of the items we exclude are items that we are required by GAAP to recognize in one period that relate to activities extending over several periods or relate to single events that management considers to be unusual and infrequent, although not necessarily non-recurring. We refer to these items as “certain items.” Management believes excluding these items facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis and evaluates the Company’s operating performance without the impact of these costs or benefits. Management also uses Adjusted EPS as a key measure in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes.\nThe items of income and expense that we have excluded from our calculations of Adjusted EPS, as applicable, but that have been included in our GAAP net income (loss) per share, as applicable, are described below.\nAsset impairment charges, which primarily included charges associated with an impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets. Inventory Reserve Adjustment, which resulted from an evaluation performed as part of an impairment analysis. Global restructuring activities, which included costs or benefits associated with cost reduction initiatives or plant closures and were primarily related to (i) employee termination costs, (ii) asset impairment charges associated with restructuring actions, (iii) costs to close facilities, including environmental costs and contract termination penalties, and (iv) gains realized on the sale of land or equipment associated with restructured plants or locations. Acquisition and integration-related charges, which included transaction costs, redundant costs incurred during the period of integration, and costs associated with transitioning certain management and business processes to Cabot’s processes. Legal and environmental reserves and matters, which consisted of costs or benefits for matters typically related to former businesses or that were otherwise incurred outside of the ordinary course of business. Gains (losses) on sale of investments, which primarily related to the sale of investments accounted for under the cost-method. Non-recurring gains (losses) on foreign currency, which primarily related to the impact of continued currency devaluations on our net monetary assets denominated in that currency. Executive transition costs, which included incremental charges, including stock compensation charges, associated with the retirement or termination of employment of senior executives of the Company.\nCabot does not provide a target GAAP EPS growth rate range or reconciliation of the Adjusted EPS growth rate range with a GAAP EPS growth rate range because, without unreasonable effort, we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the matters we would allocate to “certain items,” including unusual gains and losses, costs associated with future restructurings, acquisition-related expenses and litigation outcomes. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP EPS in future periods.\nOperating Tax Rate . Our “operating tax rate” represents the tax rate on our recurring operating results. This rate excludes discrete tax items, which are unusual or infrequent items that are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate and other tax items, including the impact of the timing of losses in certain jurisdictions, cumulative tax rate adjustments and the impact of the items of expense and income we identify as certain items on both our operating income and the tax provision. Management believes that the operating tax rate is useful supplemental information because it helps our investors compare our tax rate year to year on a consistent basis and to understand what our tax rate on current operations would be without the impact of these items.\nExplanation of Terms Used\nProduct Mix. The term “product mix” refers to the mix of types and grade of products sold or the mix of geographic regions where products are sold, and the positive or negative impact this has on the revenue or profitability of the business or segment.\nNet Working Capital. The term “net working capital” includes accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nSecond Quarter Earnings Announcement, Fiscal 2018\nCABOT CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Periods ended March 31 Three Months Six Months Dollars in millions, except per share amounts (unaudited) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net sales and other operating revenues $ 818 $ 678 $ 1,538 $ 1,289 Cost of Sales (A) 628 509 1,170 961 Gross profit 190 169 368 328 Selling and administrative expenses 78 65 147 128 Research and technical expenses 16 14 31 26 Long-lived assets impairment charge 162 - 162 - Goodwill impairment charge 92 - 92 - Income (loss) from operations (158 ) 90 (64 ) 174 Other income (expense) Interest and dividend income 3 2 6 4 Interest expense (14 ) (13 ) (27 ) (26 ) Other income (expense) (2 ) (1 ) 6 1 Total other income (expense) (13 ) (12 ) (15 ) (21 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies\n(171 ) 78 (79 ) 153 (Provision) benefit for income taxes (A)(B) 7 1 (198 ) (17 ) Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax 1 1 2 3 Net income (loss) (163 ) 80 (275 ) 139 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 10 6 20 10 Net income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation $ (173 ) $ 74 $ (295 ) $ 129 Basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock attributable to Cabot Corporation\nNet income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation (A) (C) $ (2.80 ) $ 1.19 $ (4.78 ) $ 2.05 Weighted average common shares outstanding Diluted (C) 61.8 62.8 61.8 62.8 (A)\nFiscal 2017 amounts have been recast to reflect the retrospective application of the Company’s election to change its inventory valuation method of accounting for its U.S. carbon black inventories from the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method to the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method, which resulted in a decrease in Cost of Sales of less than $1 million, a decrease to the benefit for income taxes of less than $1 million and an increase in Net income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation per diluted common share of $0.01 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

(D) Fiscal 2017 full year amounts have been recast to reflect the retrospective application of the Company’s election to change its inventory valuation method of accounting for its U.S. carbon black inventories from the LIFO method to the FIFO method, which resulted in an increase in General unallocated income of $11 million, an increase in (Provision) benefit for income taxes of ($4) million , an increase in Net income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation per diluted common share of $0.11 per share and an increase in Adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 per share. For more detail on the transition from the LIFO method to the FIFO method, please refer to the Company's 10-Q filings. (E) General unallocated income (expense) includes foreign currency transaction gains (losses), interest income, dividend income and the profit related to the corporate adjustment for unearned revenue. (F) The weighted average common shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share for all periods in fiscal 2018 excludes approximately 1 million shares as those shares would be antidilutive due to the Company’s net loss position in that period. (G) Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS is presented in the Certain Items and Reconciliation of Adjusted EPS and Operating Tax Rate table.\nCABOT CORPORATION CERTAIN ITEMS AND RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EPS AND OPERATING TAX RATE TABLE 1: DETAIL OF CERTAIN ITEMS Periods ended March 31 Dollars in millions, except per share amounts (unaudited) Three Months Six Months 2018 2017 2018 2017 $ $ $ $ Certain items before and after income taxes\nImpairment of goodwill and long-lived assets $ (254 ) $ ― $ (254 ) $ ― Inventory reserve adjustment (13 ) — (13 ) — Global restructuring activities 9 (2 ) 8 (2 ) Acquisition and integration-related charges (1 ) — (1 ) — Legal and environmental matters and reserves (5 ) 2 (6 ) 2 Gains (losses) on sale of investments — — 10 — Other certain items — — (1 ) — Total certain items, pre-tax (264 ) — (257 ) — Tax impact of certain items (A) 32 — 30 — Certain items after tax (excluding discrete tax items) (232 ) — (227 ) — Certain items after tax per share impact (excluding discrete tax items) $ (4.18 ) $ ― $ (4.09 ) $ 0.01 Tax-related certain items Discrete tax items (5 ) 20 (190 ) 20 Total tax-related certain items (5 ) 20 (190 ) 20 Total tax-related certain items per share impact $ 0.37 $ 0.31 $ (2.61 ) $ 0.31 Total certain items after tax $ (237 ) $ 20 $ (417 ) $ 20 Total certain items after tax per share impact $ (3.81 ) $ 0.31 $ (6.70 ) $ 0.32 TABLE 2: CERTAIN ITEMS STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS LINE ITEM Periods ended March 31 Three Months Six Months Dollars in millions, Pre-Tax (unaudited) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Statement of Operations Line Item (B)\nCost of sales $ (8 ) $ (2 ) $ (11 ) $ (2 ) Selling and administrative expenses (2 ) 2 (2 ) 2 Other income (expense) — — 10 — Long-lived assets impairment charge (162 ) — (162 ) — Goodwill impairment charge (92 ) — (92 ) — Total certain items, pre-tax $ (264 ) $ ― $ (257 ) $ ― TABLE 3: RECONCILIATION OF TAX CERTAIN ITEMS Periods ended March 31 Three Months Six Months Dollars in millions (unaudited) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Reconciliation of Provision for income taxes, excluding certain items, to Provision for income taxes\n(Provision) benefit for income taxes (C) $ 7 $ 1 $ (198 ) $ (17 ) Less: Tax impact of certain items 32 — 30 — Less: Tax-related certain items (5 ) 20 (190 ) 20 (Provision) benefit for income taxes, excluding certain items $ (20 ) $ (19 ) $ (38 ) $ (37 ) TABLE 4: RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING TAX RATE Periods ended March 31 Three Months Six Months Forecast Dollars in millions (unaudited) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 Reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the operating tax rate\n(Provision) benefit for income taxes (C) $ 7 $ 1 $ (198 ) $ (17 ) N/A Effective tax rate 4 % (1 %) (248 %) 11 % 224 % Impact of discrete tax items: (D) Unusual or infrequent items (15 %) 25 % 238 % 12 % (180 %) Items related to uncertain tax positions - % (1 %) 2 % 1 % (1 %) Other discrete tax items - % 1 % - % - % - % Impact of certain items 32 % - % 29 % - % (22 %) Operating tax rate 21 % 24 % 21 % 24 % 21 % TABLE 5: RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EPS BY QUARTER FOR FISCAL 2017 and FISCAL 2016 NON-GAAP MEASURE: Periods ended (unaudited) Fiscal 2018 (E) Dec.

Adjusted earnings is defined as the pre-tax income attributable to Cabot Corporation excluding certain items. The tax expense or benefit on adjusted earnings is calculated by applying the operating tax rate, which includes both current and deferred taxes, as defined under the section Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures of the earnings release. (B) This table indicates the line items where certain items are recorded in the table titled Cabot Corporation Consolidated Statements of Operations. (C) Fiscal 2017 amounts have been recast to reflect the retrospective application of the Company’s election to change its inventory valuation method of accounting for its U.S. carbon black inventories from the LIFO method to the FIFO method, which resulted in a decrease to the benefit for income taxes of less than $1 million, an increase in Net income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation per diluted common share of $0.01 per share and an increase in Adjusted earnings per share of $0.01 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For more detail on the transition from the LIFO method to the FIFO method, please refer to the Company's 10-Q filings. (D) The nature of the discrete tax items for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows: (i) Unusual or infrequent items during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 comprised of the net tax impacts resulting from the enactment of H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ($4 million and $189 million, respectively), foreign exchange gain/loss on the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, as well as immaterial impacts related to stock compensation deductions. Additionally, unusual or infrequent items during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 included the tax impact of excludible foreign exchange gains and losses in certain jurisdictions. Unusual or infrequent items during the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 included a tax benefit associated with the generation of excess foreign tax credits upon repatriation of previously taxed foreign earnings, partially offset by charges for the accrual of U.S. tax on certain foreign earnings of prior years; (ii) Items related to uncertain tax positions during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 including net tax benefits from the reversal of accruals for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the settlement of tax audits, the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions, and, for fiscal 2018 only, the refinement of the accrual for existing uncertain tax positions; (iii) Other discrete tax items during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 including net tax impacts from various return to provision adjustments related to tax return filings and, for fiscal 2018 only, changes in non-U.S. tax laws and audit settlements. (E) Per share amounts are calculated after tax and, where applicable, noncontrolling interest, net of tax. (F) Due to the Company’s Net Loss position, GAAP EPS has been calculated using basic weighted average shares for both basic and diluted GAAP EPS. However, in order to provide an Adjusted Non-GAAP EPS with a weighted average share figure that is consistent with all other periods presented, the Company has included this reconciling item to quantify the difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares. The net loss for the six months ended March 31, 2018 is driven by a discrete tax item and impairment charges, so the Company believes this approach provides the most comparable presentation possible. (G) Fiscal 2017 full year amounts have been recast to reflect the retrospective application of the Company’s election to change its inventory valuation method of accounting for its U.S. carbon black inventories from the LIFO method to the FIFO method, which resulted in an increase in Net income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation per diluted common share of $0.11 per share and an increase in Adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 per share.\nCABOT CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES All dollar amounts shown below are in millions, except per share information Fiscal 2018 (A) Dec.
