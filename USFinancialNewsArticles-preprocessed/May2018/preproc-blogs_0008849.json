Now, 9 million American citizens reside overseas, according to the State Department.\nTo find the most worthwhile destinations, GOBankingRates compared the cost of living, including rent, groceries and health care among other factors, in more than 100 countries worldwide based on Numbeo.com's latest Cost of Living Index Rate to determine a ranking.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Your Wealth Weekly advice on managing your money SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service. Privacy Policy . The destinations that scored the best were all far more affordable than the U.S. For example, the cost of living in India was just 27.65 on its scale, with New York City being 100, which means India is more than 70 percent less expensive. The extremely low cost of living was one of the factors that propelled the South Asian country to the No. 1 spot.\nIn addition to the ability to stretch a dollar, many of these locations also promise both modern-day adventure and ancient history.\nshow chapters These are the countries where expats earn more than they would at home 11:42 AM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 | 01:01 Aside from India's Taj Mahal, considered one of the new Seven Wonders of the World , Turkey's capital city Istanbul is home to the historic Hagia Sophia — once a Byzantine cathedral, then an Ottoman mosque and now a museum — and Mexico offers scores of pre-Columbian monuments, from Mayan-built Chichen Itza near Cancun to Aztec temple complex Teotihuacan on Mexico City's outskirts.\nOthers, however, while also rich in history, may present cultural challenges for Americans, as in India, with its pervasive poverty, and Saudi Arabia, with its religious strictures.\nHere are the top 10:*\n10. Estonia\nCost of living index: 58.00\n9. Spain\nCost of living index: 62.58\n8. South Africa\nCost of living index: 48.83\n7. Taiwan\nCost of living index: 66.20\n6.

Saudi Arabia\nCost of living index: 49.57\n1. India\nCost of living index: 27.65\n*Cost of living index numbers alone did not determine rankings, which also take into account other factors, such as health care, rent and grocery costs.\nMore from Fixed Income Strategies:\nStrong economy puts credit-risk investing strategies at risk",
