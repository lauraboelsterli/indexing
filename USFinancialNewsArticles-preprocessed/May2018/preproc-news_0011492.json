    "text": "AMES, Iowa, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NewLink Genetics Corporation (NASDAQ:NLNK) today reported consolidated 2018 and reviewed recent highlights and upcoming milestones.\n“NewLink Genetics continues to produce encouraging data supporting the differentiated mechanism of action of indoximod, its IDO pathway inhibitor, and the potential for indoximod in multiple therapeutic combinations to improve patient outcomes across a broad range of cancer indications,” said Charles J. Link, Jr, MD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nHighlights\nAbstracts accepted for presentation at the ASCO Annual Meeting, June 2018 Abstract 4015 – Phase 2 trial of the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod plus gemcitabine / nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreas cancer – to be presented during the discussion session, “Gastrointestinal (Noncolorectal) Cancer,” Sunday, June 3, 2018, 4:45 PM – 6:00 PM CT Abstract 9512 – Phase 2 trial of the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod plus checkpoint inhibition for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma – to be presented during the discussion session, “Melanoma/Skin Cancers,” Monday, June 4, 2018, 4:45 PM – 6:00 PM CT\nAbstracts presented at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, April 2018 Abstract 3753 – Indoximod modulates AhR-driven transcription of genes that control immune function Abstract 10973 – Front-line therapy of DIPG using the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod in combination with radiation and chemotherapy\nAbstract, Radio-immunotherapy using the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod for children with newly-diagnosed DIPG , to be presented at the 18 th International Symposium on Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (ISPNO), Poster Session 1, Sunday, July 1, 2018, 5:00 PM – 6:30 PM MT\nData from Phase 1b trial of indoximod plus standard-of-care chemotherapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) intended to be presented in the second half of 2018\nFinalized the novel formulation of indoximod\nUpdate on Clinical Programs and Financial Guidance\nNewLink Genetics previously reported that it was undertaking a review of its clinical programs and determined it will not initiate its Phase 3 study of indoximod in combination with PD-1 inhibitors for patients with advanced melanoma. In addition, we have deprioritized pancreatic cancer and have mutually agreed with AstraZeneca not to proceed with the Phase 2 trial.\nClinical opportunities under consideration include high quality randomized studies of indoximod in one or more target disease states for which we have developed promising single-arm data over the last few years. Indoximod has demonstrated encouraging clinical data in a number of cancer indications including AML in combination with chemotherapy, DIPG in combination with radiation and chemotherapy, and melanoma in combination with checkpoint blockade. When we complete the review of our clinical programs, we expect to have substantially reduced the rate at which the Company will be using cash. We intend to update our financial guidance when we report results for the second quarter.\nFinancial Results\nCash Position: NewLink Genetics ended the quarter on March 31, 2018, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $143.9 million compared to $158.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nR&D Expenses: expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $20.3 million, an increase of $4.6 million from $15.7 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $8.4 million in contract research and manufacturing spend, an increase of $670,000 in clinical trial and legal and consulting expense, offset by a $2.1 million decrease in supplies, a $1.2 million decrease in personnel-related and stock compensation expense, and a $1.2 million decrease in licensing expenses.\nG&A Expenses: expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $8.3 million, an increase of $58,000 from $8.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was due to an increase of $733,000 of legal and consulting and other expense, offset by a decline of $675,000 in personnel-related and stock compensation.\nNet Loss: The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $18.3 million compared to net loss of $20.9 million for the same period in 2017. The basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were 37,155,082, resulting in a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.49. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding were 29,213,488, resulting in basic and diluted loss per share of $0.72.\nNewLink Genetics ended Q1 2018 with 37,165,098 shares outstanding.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call and webcast for 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss the financial results and to review its clinical activities.
