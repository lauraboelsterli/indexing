    "text": "WARSAW, Ind., OrthoPediatrics Corp. (NASDAQ:KIDS), a company exclusively focused on advancing the field of pediatric orthopedics, announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter & Recent Highlights\nIncreased total revenue 23.9% to $12.1 million for first quarter 2018, from $9.8 million in first quarter 2017 Deployed $5.5 million of consignment sets during the first quarter 2018 Added 9 incremental U.S. sales representatives in the first quarter 2018 for a total of 84 Launched Titanium PediPlates® and upgraded PediFlex™ Advanced system Received FDA 510(k) clearance for 25 th surgical system, Pediatric Nailing Platform | FEMUR Recognized as one of the 100 Best Places to Work in Indiana for second year\nMark Throdahl, Chief Executive Officer of OrthoPediatrics, commented, “We are very pleased by our solid start to the year with greater than anticipated first quarter revenue growth of 24%. Since becoming a public company last October, we have exceeded anticipated growth in every quarter. While all of our product lines contributed, strong domestic scoliosis sales continued to outpace the industry, further establishing our leading market position in pediatric orthopedics. In addition, we significantly increased our investment in consignment sets to $5.5 million and R&D by 77%, which helped support the FDA 510(k) clearance of our Pediatric Nailing Platform | FEMUR. These investments will further enable our expanding sales force to drive future growth. Once again, we are honored to be recognized as one of the 100 Best Places to Work in Indiana, which validates our culture and its commitment to transforming the lives of children around the world with orthopedic conditions.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $12.1 million, a 23.9% increase compared to $9.8 million for the same period last year. U.S. revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.7 million, a 18.0% increase compared to $7.3 million for the same period last year, representing 71.5% of total revenue. International revenue was $3.4 million, a 41.8% increase compared to $2.4 million for the same period last year, representing 28.5% of total revenue.\nTrauma and Deformity revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.1 million, an 17.9% increase compared to $7.7 million for the same period last year. Scoliosis revenue was $2.7 million, a 39.7% increase compared to $1.9 million for the first quarter 2017. Sports Medicine/Other revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.3 million, a 186.0% increase compared to $0.1 million for the same period last year.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.9 million, a 20.3% increase compared to $7.4 million for the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 73.7%, compared to 76.0% for the same period last year, primarily driven by a higher mix of international revenue, including instrument set sales.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $13.3 million, a 61.3% increase compared to $8.3 million for the same period last year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by $2.2 million of non-cash stock compensation in the first quarter of 2018 reflecting restricted stock accelerated vesting six months after our IPO. This compared to $0.3 million in non-cash stock compensation in the first quarter of 2017. The operating expense increase was also driven by higher commissions, R&D, and the addition of public company expenses. Operating loss for the quarter increased to ($4.4) million from ($0.8) million for the same period last year.\nNet interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.6 million, a 24.0% increase compared to $0.4 million for the same period last year, due to the use of incremental debt during 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was ($5.0) million, compared to ($1.3) million for the same period last year. Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was ($0.41) per basic and diluted share, compared to ($1.55) per basic and diluted share for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was ($1.2) million as compared to zero for the first quarter of 2017. The change was primarily driven by higher R&D and legal expenses. See below for additional information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information.\nThe weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018 was 12,073,776 shares.\nAs of the first quarter of 2018 our independent sales agencies in the United States employed 84 full-time equivalent sales representatives specifically focused on pediatrics, up 9 from the 75 employed in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase is well ahead of the 18 planned additions for the full year 2018.\nPurchases of property and equipment during the first quarter of 2018 were $2.8 million, a 108.0% increase compared to $1.3 million for the same period last year. The primary driver of this increase was the deployment of consigned sets, which include product specific instruments as well as cases and trays.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $34.6 million, compared to $42.6 million as of December 31, 2017, and the Company had approximately $25.4 million in total outstanding indebtedness, including $3.9 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nConference Call\nOrthoPediatrics will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss its financial results.

You can identify by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"could,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"target,\" \"predict,\" \"intend,\" \"future,\" \"goals,\" \"potential,” \"objective,\" \"would\" and other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond OrthoPediatrics’ control. Important factors could from those in the , including, among others, the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth under \"Risk Factors\" in OrthoPediatrics’ K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2018. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. OrthoPediatrics assumes no obligation to update to reflect actual results, subsequent events, or circumstances or other changes affecting such statements except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which differs from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA in this release represents net loss, plus interest expense (income), net plus other expense (income), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, accelerated vesting of restricted stock upon our IPO, public company costs and initial public offering costs. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because the Company believes it is a useful indicator of its operating performance. Management uses the metric as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and for planning purposes, including financial projections. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors as supplemental information because it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in its industry. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to, or superior to, net income or loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed to imply that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, the measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as debt service requirements, capital expenditures and other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and other potential cash requirements. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on the Company’s GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. The Company’s definition of this measure is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The schedules below contain a reconciliation of Net Income to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\nAbout OrthoPediatrics Corp.\nFounded in 2006, OrthoPediatrics is an orthopedic company focused exclusively on providing a comprehensive product offering to the pediatric orthopedic market to improve the lives of children with orthopedic conditions.
