(as) geopolitical risks continue to support prices, (and) an unexpected fall in inventories in the U.S. got investors excited yesterday.\"\nU.S. crude inventories <C-STK-T-EIA> dropped by 1.4 million barrels in the week to May 11, to 432.34 million barrels.\nANZ said the falling U.S. inventories were \"raising concerns of tight markets heading into the U.S. driving season,\" during which demand typically rises.\nLooking beyond seasonal changes, U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said it had raised its Brent price forecast to $90 per barrel by 2020, due to a steady increase in demand.\nEVERYTHING BULLISH?\nNot all indicators pointed to a tighter market, however.\n\"A weakening dollar, strong economic growth and low oil price have all supported a tremendous recovery in oil demand over the last few years, clearing the oversupply in the market. With the dollar strengthening, higher oil prices and softening economic growth, we see a threat to demand growth from 2019,\" BMI Research said on Thursday.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday that it had lowered its global oil demand growth forecast for 2018 from 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to 1.4 million bpd.\nThe IEA said global oil demand would average 99.2 million bpd in 2018.\nAnd although supplies currently only stand at 98 million bpd due to supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the IEA said \"strong non-OPEC growth ... will grow by 1.87 million bpd in 2018.\"\nLeading production increases is the United States, where crude output <C-OUT-T-EIA> has soared by 27 percent in the last two years, to a record 10.72 million bpd.\nThat puts the United States within reach of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd.\nAs a result of its surging production, U.S. crude is increasingly appearing on global markets.\nCommodity brokerage Marex Spectron said that the surge in U.S. supplies was a \"strongly price-bearish development.\"\nIt said the economic outlook was also \"firmly bearish\" as \"short-term credit conditions have worsened which ... hasn't been priced correctly by the market.\"\nThe brokerage also said that U.S. energy intensity \"continues to decrease which is never good news for the future consumption of oil.\"\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Joseph Radford and Richard Pullin)",
