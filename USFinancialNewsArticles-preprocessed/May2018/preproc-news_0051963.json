    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York federal judge has postponed to next week a hearing in the case brought by President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen to limit prosecutors’ review of documents seized from his home and office.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen arrives at his hotel in New York City, U.S., May 11, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The hearing, which had been scheduled to take place Thursday, is expected to address the ongoing review of the seized documents by a court-appointed official called a special master, as well as a motion by adult film star Stormy Daniels to intervene in the case. U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rescheduled the hearing for May 30 in an order late Tuesday evening.\nThe special master, former federal judge Barbara Jones, is tasked with reviewing whether the seized documents are protected by attorney-client privilege before turning documents that are not protected over to prosecutors, who are investigating Cohen for possible crimes related to his business dealings.\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has sought to intervene in the case, saying some of the seized materials could relate to her. Daniels has said Cohen paid her $130,000 to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she had with Trump, which Trump has denied.\nCohen has not formally opposed Daniels’ intervention, but has asked Wood to bar her attorney, Michael Avenatti, from representing her in the case, claiming he violated court rules by making false statements about Cohen in media appearances.\nWood has ordered prosecutors, Cohen and Daniels to submit a joint agenda for the hearing by Friday.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Tom Brown\n ",
