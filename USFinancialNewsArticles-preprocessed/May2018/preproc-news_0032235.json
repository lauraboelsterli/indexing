    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House blamed Hamas leaders for the deadly violence in Gaza on Monday and said Israel has a right to defend itself.\nSmoke rises following an explosion in the northern Gaza Strip, as seen from the Israeli side of the border between Israel and Gaza, May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Amir Cohen “There is no justification for the recklessness and cynicism Hamas has shown in urging people to engage in violence that exposes them to terrible risk. As the Secretary of State has said, Israel has a right to defend itself,” a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said in a statement.\nReporting by Doina Chiacu\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
