    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MUFG Investor Services, the global asset servicing arm of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, today announced that Eiji Ihori will take on the role of interim Chief Executive Officer effective July 1, 2018. Eiji is replacing Mark Porter who is stepping into an advisory role. Mark joined the company in 2015 as part of the acquisition of UBS Alternative Fund Services from UBS Asset Management, where he was employed in various roles for over 25 years.\nMark will transition into a Non-Executive Director role serving as a board member to both our holding company, MUFG Investor Services Holdings Limited and Mitsubishi UFJ Investor Services & Banking Luxembourg S.A. (MIBL).\n“Mark has been a tremendous asset to the organization, providing a vision that has been a road map not only for the Investor Services business, but also for the broader company,” said Eiji. “We look forward to continuing to leverage Mark’s valuable perspective as an advisor and thank him for his excellent leadership through our company’s integration and growth.”\nEiji will be focused on continuing to capitalize upon the company’s strong growth and momentum, working closely with counterparts within the MUFG organization. He has been with Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation (MUTB) for over 35 years and has overseen both the Japanese and global investor services businesses. Over the last three years, Eiji has played a key role in completing the acquisitions in alternative fund administration that have helped MUFG Investor Services scale to one of the leading providers in the space.\nEiji will be supported by John Sergides, who will assume the role of Deputy Chief Executive Officer and align closely on strategic direction for the company. John has been and will continue to be responsible for driving MUFG Investor Services’ asset servicing solutions globally as Head of Sales & Marketing, based in New York. He was formerly the Global Head of Sales at UBS AFS and held several other roles at Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan Chase.\n“MUFG has always followed a client-service model, something that’s central to our identity and the main reason for our growth,” said John. “With new leadership, we aim to ensure that our direction continues to reflect our deep sentiment for relationships while remaining focused on driving strong performance and product innovation. We’re excited by the new opportunities this will ultimately yield for our clients.”\nMac Kirschner will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer of MUFG Investor Services, an integral position in which he will help support a smooth transition and the organization’s day-to-day operations. He is well positioned to lead this function, having spent 16 years in operations at BlackRock, while his last two years as Global Head of Relationship Management for MUFG Investor Services will help maintain that clients remain top priority across all business operations.\nMichael Rucci will also continue to support Eiji particularly on solutions in Dallas and Rockville as CEO of MUFG Fund Services USA.\nAbout MUFG Investor Services\nMUFG Investor Services provides asset servicing solutions to clients globally.
