    "text": "TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose to a three-month high on Friday, buoyed by tepid U.S. inflation data easing concerns over the Federal Reserve hiking rates at an accelerated pace, as well on gains for several companies posting solid earnings.\nThe Nikkei closed the day up 1.16 percent at 22,758.48 after brushing 22,769.16, its highest since Feb. 5. The index gained 1.3 percent this week.\nThere were 163 advancers on the benchmark index against 59 decliners.\nThe broader Topix rose 0.98 percent to 1,794.96.\nChip-related shares advanced after a surge by Apple lifted their U.S. peers. Tokyo Electron gained 2.5 percent, Advantest Corp added 0.9 pct and Murata Manufacturing climbed 4.6 percent.\nSuzuki Motor Corp gained 9.0 percent after the automaker reported that its operating profit jumped 40.3 percent to 374.2 billion yen ($3.42 billion) for the year ended March, topping analyst estimates. Suzuki also anticipates a 2.3 percent rise in global vehicle sales this year to a record 3.3 million units.\nWith the earnings season in full swing corporate results dictated moves in other shares.\nPanasonic Corp rose 4.9 percent after the electronics conglomerate reported a 58 percent surge in net profit for the year ended March to 236.04 billion yen thanks to growth in its automotive-related businesses.\nKirin Holdings advanced 2.4 percent after the brewer’s operating profit increased 26.4 percent to 74.4 billion yen in the January-March quarter.\nInternet and e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc, on the other hand, lost 4.4 percent. Rakuten saw its operating profit slip 30.5 percent to 28.1 billion yen in the January-March quarter, with increases in e-commerce costs and its sponsorship deal with Spanish football club FC Barcelona seen to have weighed.\nSoftBank Group Corp was up 2 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that Japan’s three megabanks will participate in the Vision Fund, an investment fund formed by the technology conglomerate in 2017.\nOf Tokyo’s 33 sub-indexes, 29 gained, led by precision machinery and paper and pulp.
