GAAP net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $13.7 million, or $0.40 per share.\nNon-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased $12.5 million from the comparable quarter last year and decreased $5.8 million sequentially to $32.4 million. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.92, a decrease of 28 percent from the comparable quarter last year and a decrease of 17 percent sequentially. (See below under the heading “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” and the attached table for a description and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.)\n“We are pleased that our financial performance for the third fiscal quarter was within our expectations despite well-documented softness at the high end of the smartphone market, and we achieved our third consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement,” stated Rick Bergman, President and CEO. “We continue to anticipate strong growth in the second half of the calendar year driven by seasonality and the rollout of new products. Synaptics’ continuing transformation into a more diversified company, including growing momentum of our consumer IoT platform, is enabling us to focus our growth priorities on products providing greater opportunities for gross margin contribution and profitability as we move forward.”\nThird Quarter 2018 Business Metrics (fingerprint products classified according to type of device)\nRevenue mix from mobile products was approximately 62 percent. Revenue from mobile products of $244.8 million was down 6 percent sequentially and down 34 percent year-over-year. Mobile products revenue includes all touchscreen, display driver, and applicable fingerprint products. Approximately $21.8 million of mobile product revenue for Q3 fiscal 2017 has been reclassified as IoT revenue. Revenue mix from consumer IoT products was approximately 23 percent. Revenue from consumer IoT products totaled $89.0 million and includes $23.6 million of revenue formerly classified as mobile revenue. Revenue mix from PC products was approximately 15 percent. Revenue from PC products totaled $60.2 million, a sequential decrease of 2 percent and an increase of 13 percent year-over-year, and includes applicable fingerprint products.\nWajid Ali, CFO, added, “Considering our backlog of $259 million entering the June quarter, subsequent bookings, customer forecasts and product sell-in and sell-through timing patterns, and the resulting expected product mix, we anticipate revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $370 to $410 million. We expect the revenue mix from mobile, consumer IoT and PC products to be approximately 58 percent, 25 percent and 17 percent, respectively .”\nCash at March 31, 2018 was $283 million, and cash flow from operations during the third quarter of 2018 was $34 million.\nEarnings Call and Supplementary Slides\nThe Synaptics third quarter fiscal 2018 teleconference and webcast is scheduled to begin at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET), on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, during which the company will provide forward-looking information.

(NASDAQ: SYNA ) www.synaptics.com .\nJoin Synaptics on Twitter , LinkedIn , and Facebook , or visit www.synaptics.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn evaluating its business, Synaptics considers and uses Non-GAAP Net Income, which we define as net income excluding share-based compensation, acquisition related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring and non-recurring items the company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance as a supplemental measure of operating performance. Non-GAAP Net Income is not a measurement of the company’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income. The company presents Non-GAAP Net Income because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance since it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences in net income caused by the existence and timing of share-based compensation charges, acquisition related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring and non-recurring items. Non-GAAP Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s GAAP net income. The principal limitations of this measure are that it does not reflect the company’s actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating its net income and net income per share as compared to its operating results reported under GAAP.\nAs presented in the “Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables that follow, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:\nAcquisition related costs.\nAcquisition related costs primarily consist of:\namortization of purchased intangibles, which includes acquired intangibles such as developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, backlog, licensed technology, patents, and in-process technology when post-acquisition development is determined to be substantively complete, changes in contingent consideration, inventory adjustments affecting the carrying value of inventory acquired in an acquisition, transitory post-acquisition incentive programs negotiated in connection with an acquired business or designed to encourage post-acquisition retention of key-employees, and legal and consulting costs associated with acquisitions that have been announced and are expected to close or have closed, including non-recurring post-acquisition costs and services.\nThese acquisition related costs are not factored into the company’s evaluation of its ongoing business operating performance or potential acquisitions, as they are not considered as part of the company’s principal operations. Further, the amount of these costs can vary significantly from period to period based on the terms of an earn-out arrangement, revisions to assumptions that went into developing the estimate of the contingent consideration associated with an earn-out arrangement, the size and timing of an acquisition, the lives assigned to the acquired intangible assets, and the maturity of the business acquired. Excluding acquisition related costs from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Synaptics against the performance of other companies without the variability and potential earnings volatility associated with purchase accounting and acquisition related items.\nShare-based compensation.\nShare-based compensation expense relates to employee equity award programs and the vesting of the underlying awards, which includes stock options, deferred stock units, market stock units and the employee stock purchase plan. Share-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond the company’s control. As a result, the company excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for share-based compensation provide investors with a basis to compare the company’s principal operating performance against the performance of peer companies without the variability created by share-based compensation resulting from the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.\nRestructuring costs.\nRestructuring costs consist primarily of employee severance and office closure costs, including the reversal of such costs. These costs are generally infrequent, cash-based, and designed to address cost structure inefficiencies. As a result, the company excludes restructuring costs from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for restructuring costs provide investors with a basis to compare the company’s principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by restructuring costs designed to address cost structure inefficiencies in its business.\nOther non-cash items, net.\nOther non-cash items, net includes non-cash amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, and the gain on redemption or the accretion of interest income on certain of the company’s investments in auction rate securities, in which the cost basis was previously written down in value. These items are excluded from non-GAAP results as either the previous write-down was excluded from non-GAAP results or the item is non-cash. Excluding other non-cash items, net from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Synaptics against the performance of other companies without the variability associated with other non-cash items, net.\nLitigation settlement charge.\nLitigation settlement charge represents our estimated or actual cost of settling material litigation claims that are unusual or infrequent. As a result, the company will exclude litigation settlement charge from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting an adjustment for litigation settlement charge provide investors with a basis to compare the company’s principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by an infrequent litigation settlement charge designed to address non-recurring or non-routine costs.\nArbitration costs\nArbitration costs represent the cost of legal and consulting services for the arbitration of disputed matters that are unusual or infrequent. As a result, the company will exclude arbitration costs that are unusual or infrequent from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting an adjustment for arbitration costs provide investors with a basis to compare the company’s principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by infrequent arbitration of disputed matters designed to address non-recurring or non-routine costs.\nEquity investment loss.\nEquity investment loss represents an adjustment in the book value of an equity investment in a minority owned company. The equity investment loss is a non-cash item. As a result, the company excludes equity investment loss from its internal operating forecasts and models when evaluating its ongoing business performance. The company believes that non-GAAP measures reflecting adjustments for equity investment loss provide investors with a basis to compare the company’s principal operating performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by non-cash items.\nNon-GAAP tax adjustments.\nThe company forecasts its long-term non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide investors with improved long-term modeling accuracy and consistency across financial reporting periods by eliminating the effects of certain items in our Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP net income per share, including the type and amount of deductible stock options, delivery of shares under deferred stock unit awards, market stock unit awards, and performance stock unit awards, the taxation of post-acquisition intercompany intellectual property cross-licensing or transfer transactions, and the impact of other acquisition items that may or may not be tax deductible. The company intends to evaluate its long-term non-GAAP tax rate annually for significant events, including material tax law changes in the major tax jurisdictions in which the company operates, corporate organizational changes related to acquisitions or tax planning opportunities, and substantive changes in our geographic earnings mix.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
