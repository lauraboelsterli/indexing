    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 8:03 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago Twitter says glitch exposed 'substantial' number of users' passwords Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) urged its more than 330 million users to change their passwords after a glitch exposed some in plain text on its internal computer network. FILE PHOTO: A man reads tweets on his phone in front of a displayed Twitter logo in Bordeaux, southwestern France, March 10, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/Illustration/File Photo\nThe social network said an internal investigation had found no indication passwords were stolen or misused by insiders, but that it urged all users to consider changing their passwords “out of an abundance of caution.”\nThe blog did not say how many passwords were affected.
