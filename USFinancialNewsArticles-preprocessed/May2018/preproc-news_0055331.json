    "text": "BEIJING, May 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jianpu Technology Inc. (\"Jianpu,\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: JT), a leading independent open platform for discovery and recommendation of financial products in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational Highlights:\nNumber of loan applications submitted through the Company's platform was approximately 12.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of approximately 21.0% from the prior-year period. Credit card volume, which is the measure of the number of credit cards the Company generate revenues from, reached approximately 1.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of approximately 400% from the prior-year period.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nTotal revenues [1] for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 145% to RMB335.7 million (US$53.5 million) from RMB137.3 million in the same period of 2017. Total recommendation services revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 131% to RMB289.3 million (US$46.1 million) from RMB125.2 million in the same period of 2017. Gross profit increased by 139% to RMB286.4 million (US$45.7 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB119.9 million in the same period of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss [2] , which excluded share-based compensation expenses, decreased by 35.9% to RMB19.8 million (US$3.2 million) in the first quarter of 2018, from RMB30.9 million in the same period of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA [3] , which excluded share-based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest income and expenses, and income tax expenses from net loss, for the first quarter of 2018 was a loss of RMB18.6 million (US$3.0 million), representing a decrease of 30.3% from a loss of RMB26.7 million in the same period of 2017.\nMr. David Ye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Jianpu, commented, \"We are pleased to continue our strong growth momentum in the first quarter of 2018, recording revenue growth of 145% and gross profit growth of 139% year-over-year and continuously enhancing operating efficiency, with non-GAAP adjusted net margin improved from -22.5% in the first quarter of 2017 to -5.9% in the first quarter of 2018. Notably in the first quarter, we continued to capitalize on the market demand shift toward credit cards, as evidenced by a 400% increase in credit card volume on a year-over-year basis. The accelerated growth in our credit card business illustrates both the scalability and efficiency of our unique platform model as well as our robust user engagement capabilities.\n\"With greater clarity on the regulatory front, we witnessed a growing recovery in the online lending activities since March, following the Chinese New Year holiday, and believe the worst is now behind us. We will take advantage of the improving trend and are optimistic that a more structured and healthier regulatory framework will support a sustainable growth in the consumer credit market,\" concluded Mr. Ye.\n\"Our first quarter results continued to demonstrate our solid growth trajectory,\" said Oscar Chen, Chief Financial Officer of Jianpu. \"During the quarter, we realized total revenues of RMB335.7 million, exceeding our guidance, with impressive growth across all business streams. Even with modest growth in loans recommendation services due to seasonality and market adjustments within the new regulatory framework, we successfully captured the shift of user demand and achieved remarkable performance in our credit card recommendation services, delivering a 718% year-over-year growth, driven by both volume growth and unit price increases. On the bottom line, we continued our positive momentum with non-GAAP adjusted net loss decreasing by 35.9% from the year-ago period, and 34.7% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\"\n[1] The Company has adopted ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\", using the modified-retrospective transition approach beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption has no significant impact on the Company's financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and comparable periods.\n[2] Non-GAAP adjusted net loss represents net loss before share-based compensation expenses. There is no income tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustment of share-based compensation expenses. See \"Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" for more details.\n[3] Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before share-based compensation expenses. EBITDA represents net loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. See \"Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" for more details.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 145% to RMB335.7 million (US$53.5 million) from RMB137.3 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to increases in revenues from recommendation services.\nTotal revenues from recommendation services increased by 131% to RMB289.3 million (US$46.1 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB125.2 million in the same period of 2017.\nRevenues from recommendation services for loans increased by 46.5% to RMB160.1 million (US$25.5 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB109.3 million in the same period of 2017, due to the increase in both number of loan applications on the Company's platform and average fee per loan application. The number of loan applications on the Company's platform was approximately 12.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of approximately 21.0% from the prior-year period. The average fee per loan application increased to RMB13.27 (US$2.12) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB10.93 in the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenues from recommendation services for credit cards increased by 718% to RMB129.2 million (US$20.6 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB15.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, due to the increase in both credit card volume and average fee per credit card. Credit card volume for recommendation services reached approximately 1.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of approximately 550% from the prior-year period. The average fee per credit card increased to RMB97.15 (US$15.49) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB77.33 in the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenues from advertising and marketing services and other services increased by 280% to RMB46.4 million (US$7.4 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB12.2 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to an increase in revenues from big data and risk management solutions as well as an increase in the advertising services provided to credit card issuers.\nCost of revenues increased by 183% to RMB49.3 million (US$7.9 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB17.4 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the increases in traffic acquisition costs of advertising and marketing services, data acquisition costs and short message service fees.\nGross profit increased by 139% to RMB286.4 million (US$45.7 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB119.9 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to continuing growth in revenue.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 111% to RMB259.0 million (US$41.3 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB123.0 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was mainly due to growth in marketing and advertising expenses and payroll related costs.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 107% to RMB43.6 million (US$6.9 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB21.1 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to the increase in payroll costs mainly for the new hiring of R&D people to further enhance our big data and risk management service capabilities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 970% to RMB42.8 million (US$6.8 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB4.0 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to recognition of share-based compensation, including the employee options granted historically with a performance target contingent upon the IPO and the new options granted under Jianpu's 2017 Share Incentive Plan to the management and executives in December 2017, as well as increase in professional fees for maintaining our listing status.\nShare-based compensation expenses recognized in cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses in the first quarter 2018 were RMB37.3 million (US$5.9 million) in total.\nLoss from operations increased to RMB59.0 million (US$9.4 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB28.3 million in the same period of 2017.\nIncome tax expenses was nil in the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB3.3 million in the same period of 2017. The decrease of the annualized effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the change of the cost and expenses structure and the lower enacted tax rate of subsidiaries in 2018. The Company's domestic subsidiaries expect to complete their 2017 annual tax filings with relevant tax authorities by the end of May 2018, which may result in a change of tax positions in the income tax provision and deferred tax assets recognized as of December 31, 2017. The effect of such change, if any, will be recognized when it occurs.\nNet loss increased by 80.7% to RMB57.1 million (US$9.1 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB31.6 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in share-based compensation expenses.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net loss , which excluded share-based compensation expenses from net loss, decreased by 35.9% to RMB19.8 million (US$3.2 million) in the first quarter of 2018 from RMB30.9 million in the same period of 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA , which excluded share-based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest income and expenses, and income tax expenses from net loss, for the first quarter of 2018 was a loss of RMB18.6 million (US$3.0 million), representing a decrease of 30.3% in the same period of 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was RMB24.7 million (US$3.9 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared with net cash used in operating activities of RMB62.6 million in the same period of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB1,396.9 million (US$222.7 million), and working capital of approximately RMB1,431.7 million (US$228.2 million).\nOutlook\nBased on the information available as of the date of this press release, the Company provides the following outlook, which reflects the Company's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nSecond Quarter 2018\nBased on the Company's current estimates, total revenues for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be approximately RMB460 million, representing an increase of approximately 80% on a year-over-year basis.\nConference Call\nThe Company's management will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on May 29, 2018 (8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on May 29, 2018).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nUnited States (toll free):\n+1-888-346-8982\nInternational:\n+1-412-902-4272\nHong Kong (toll free):\n800-905-945\nHong Kong:\n+852-3018-4992\nChina:\n400-120-1203\nParticipants should dial-in at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start time and ask to be connected to the call for \"Jianpu Technology Inc.\"\nAdditionally, a live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company's investor relations website at http://ir.jianpu.ai .\nA replay of the conference call will be accessible approximately one hour after the conclusion of the live call until June 5, 2018, by dialing the following telephone numbers:\nUnited States (toll free):\n+1-877-344-7529\nInternational:\n+1-412-317-0088\nReplay Access Code:\n10120608\nAbout Jianpu Technology Inc.\nJianpu Technology Inc. is a leading independent open platform for discovery and recommendation of financial products in China.
