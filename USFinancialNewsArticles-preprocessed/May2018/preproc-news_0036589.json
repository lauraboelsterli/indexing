REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\nRichemont, which has luxury brands including Cartier and Montblanc, is just in the process of acquiring full control of luxury retailer Yoox Net-a-Porter ( YNAP.MI ) for 2.6 billion euros as part of efforts to boost its online presence and attract younger customers.\n“Our long-term approach does not preclude us from targeting strategic investments and divestments, as we have demonstrated over the past year,” the company said on Friday.\nOver the last two years, Richemont has undergone a major management shake-up, replacing almost all of its brand heads, its finance chief and appointing a senior executive committee instead of a CEO.\nThe luxury watch market has recovered in the past year from a severe downturn, but companies like Richemont remain under pressure to exploit digital sales channels and rekindle demand for traditional watches among younger consumers.\nA weak performance at the group’s watch brands, including IWC and Vacheron Constantin, and a disappointing net profit contributed to a fall of nearly 8 percent in Richemont’s shares, making them the worst performer in the European sector index .SXQP. The shares were 5 percent lower at 0920 GMT.\nThe group’s net profit rose 1 percent to 1.221 billion euros ($1.44 billion), which was well below expectations of 1.719 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts.\nSales for the year increased 3 percent to 10.97 billion euros, driven by double-digit growth in Asia.\nChief Financial Officer Burkhart Grund told reporters on a call the inventory buybacks, mainly focused on watch brands in Europe, and which followed 278 million euro buybacks in the previous year, were necessary to ensure “healthy inventory levels at trade partners”, and were now likely finished.\nHe also said Richemont was still in talks to sell its Lancel business to Italian leather goods company Piquadro, but wanted to grow mainly organically its leather goods businesses that include Chloe handbags, Cartier wallets and Montblanc phone cases.\n“Overall a messy result with the watch buyback probably hurting the underlying business in the final part of the year,” Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said.\n“Long term the company probably did the right thing in terms of the watch clean up. However, timing is unfortunate given the watch market recovery,” he said. HONG KONG RECOVERY\nCyrille Vigneron, head of Richemont’s flagship brand Cartier, said the Hong Kong market had seen a sharp, V-shaped recovery since the summer, driven by both local and mainland Chinese customers.\nHe told investors on Friday that Cartier was in a healthy situation, with its average pricing rising, and was confident of regaining market share.\nGrund said the appreciation of the euro led tourist shoppers to buy more in Asia and less in Europe.\nChief Operating Officer Jerome Lambert said the launch of lower-priced watches under the Baume brand should help Richemont to target younger customers.\nThe group has appointed Eric Vallat to head its fashion and accessories business and to join its senior executive committee, which lost Chief Technology Officer Jean-Jacques Van Oosten who left earlier this month after just four months in the job..\nGrund said that the group would decide on its future technology setup, including management issues, after finalizing the YNAP deal.\nRichemont said it would raise its dividend to 1.90 Swiss francs ($1.90) per share, from 1.80 francs a year ago. It said it aimed to grow its dividend each year. Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz. Editing by Jane Merriman",
