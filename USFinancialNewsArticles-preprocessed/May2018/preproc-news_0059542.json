    "text": "May 30 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index rose on Wednesday as energy shares gained from a rise in Brent Crude oil price to $76 a barrel.\n* At 9:53 a.m. ET (1353 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 84.98 points, or 0.53 percent, at 16,007.59.\n* Oil prices rose helped by tight supplies despite expectations that OPEC and its allies will pump more in the second half of 2018 and helped by forecasts U.S. inventories fell.\n* 10 of the index's 11 major sectors were higher, led by the energy sector, which rose 1.1 percent.\n* Shares of Suncor Energy and Canadian Natural Resources, both up 0.6 percent, were the biggest boosts in the energy sector\n* The financials sector gained 0.3 percent. The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady, but dropped cautious language about future rate moves in a signal that higher borrowing costs are on the way.\n* The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart, ahead of a Bank of Canada interest rate decision, boosted by higher oil prices and broader declines for the greenback.\n* On the TSX, 205 issues were higher, while 37 issues declined for a 5.54-to-1 ratio favoring gainers, with 19.90 million shares traded.\n* The largest percentage gainers on the TSX were MEG Energy Corp, which jumped 4 percent and Enerplus Corp , which rose 3.8 percent.\n* Laurentian Bank of Canada fell 5.8 percent, the most on the TSX, after it said it had to buy back inadvertently insured mortgages from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.\n* The second biggest decliner on TSX was Keyera Corp . Shares of the company slipped 1.7 percent after it said it was proceeding with phase two of its Wapiti gas plant.\n* The most heavily traded shares by volume were Bombardier Inc, Tamarack Valley and Crescent Point .\n* The TSX posted three new 52-week highs and two new lows.\n* Across all Canadian issues there were 12 new 52-week highs and six new lows, with total volume of 35.34 million shares.\n* Economic data showed that the country's current account deficit widened to C$19.50 billion ($15.00 billion) in the first quarter.\n* Canadian producer prices climbed by 0.5 percent in April from March.
