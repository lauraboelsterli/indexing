Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk\nThe logo of French oil giant Total is shown outside Paris in 2016. Associated Press Good morning. Companies that choose to leave Iran because the U.S. exited the nuclear deal are doing so for a number of reasons, sanctions experts say, including a need to stay in the U.S. market, potential banking problems or secondary sanctions.\nCompanies such as Total SA , A.P. Moller-Maersk and Allianz SE announced last week they were set to walk away from the business they started with Iran following the 2016 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. President Donald Trump earlier this month said the U.S. would leave the deal and re-impose all of the sanctions lifted as part of the agreement. The phase-in of those sanctions will occur over a six-month period, but some companies are accelerating their departures.\n“Many non-U.S. companies who have announced their intention to exit Iran must be experiencing deja-vu,” said Adam M. Smith, a partner at law firm Gibson Dunn Crutcher LLP.\nCompanies saying they’re leaving Iran decided their market interests in the U.S. outweigh the potential of those in Iran, sanctions observers said.\n“They are motivated by preserving their access to the [U.S.] dollar economy,” said Sanjay Mullick, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.\nCompanies are afraid of the pain that comes from enforcing secondary sanctions, said Daniel Tannebaum, the leader of PwC’s global financial services sanctions practice. There isn’t much of a history of enforcing them, and there may not need to be. “The threat of secondary sanctions is enough to scare institutions and companies out of the market,” said Mr. Tannebaum.\nThat threat led Total to halt its work in Iran, said Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne, in an interview at the Center for Strategic and International Studies last week in Washington. “As soon as the U.S. decide to put back in place the secondary sanctions there is no possibility for us to be a major company, a global company,” he said.\nMr. Pouyanne said 90% of Total’s financing is linked to the U.S. financial system and secondary sanctions that block the firm from U.S. banks would make business impossible. “I cannot run a company in 130 countries without any access to any U.S. banks,” he said.\nThe banking issue is a very large concern, said Janet Kim, partner at the firm Baker McKenzie. Even during the nuclear deal banks were reticent to work in Iran, she said, but the U.S. walking away from the agreement makes them even more so.\nA company needs banking services to operate in Iran, she said. “If that infrastructure isn’t there, it’s almost impossible to continue to do business with Iran,” she said.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nColombian ex-anticorruption director extradited to U.S. The former Colombian national anticorruption director and a Colombian lawyer were extradited to face U.S charges.\nProsecutors said both Luis Gustavo Moreno Rivera, who was the Colombian national director of anticorruption, and Leonardo Luis Pinilla Gomez, an attorney practicing there, arrived Thursday in the U.S to face charges of laundering money related to foreign bribery. They were arrested in Colombia on an Interpol notice, prosecutors said.\nMr. Moreno’s lawyer said his client is glad to be in the U.S. to address the charges filed against him. A lawyer for Mr. Pinilla couldn’t immediately be reached.\nThe two men allegedly tried to orchestrate a scheme in which they received a fee to obstruct a separate corruption investigation into a Colombian governor who acted a U.S. cooperating source. The then-director of the anticorruption office had allegedly offered to inundate his prosecutors with work so they wouldn’t be able to focus on the investigation, prosecutors said. – Samuel Rubenfeld\nCOMPLIANCE\nChina praised a reduction in trade tensions with the U.S. after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that a trade war was “on hold” as the countries work on a wider trade agreement, Reuters reports.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News on Sunday that the U.S. was ‘putting the trade war on hold.’ PHOTO: ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES Investigators have yet to issue their final report on a Southwest Airlines flight last month that led to a passenger’s death. But one thing is clear : Despite a warning about a suspect engine part nearly two years earlier, investigators didn’t mandate enhanced inspections for an unusually long time and acted only after the fatality, the WSJ reports.\nWith former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak under effective house arrest, the focus in the probe of theft from the 1Malaysia Development Bhd. sovereign-wealth fund is turning to Jho Low, whom the U.S. Justice Department alleges was the ringleader, the WSJ reports.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department on Friday levied sanctions against one of Venezuela’s most powerful men, accusing Diosdado Cabello Rondón of state-aided narco-trafficking and corruption, as the administration escalated its pressure campaign against Caracas, the WSJ reports.\nThe Trump administration moved toward dismantling Obama-era policies aimed at enforcing the Fair Housing Act. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is withdrawing a computer tool used to check if local and state governments were properly addressing segregated housing patterns, the WSJ reports.\nDATA SECURITY\nA cottage industry around privacy technology has sprung up, with firms offering to help companies more efficiently meet the demands of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. Some new tools could create additional legal risk for the companies using them, experts say, the WSJ reports.\nRISK\nEmployees allege in lawsuits against American Airlines , Kroger and Montage Hotels & Resorts LLC , among others, that the firms are unfairly subtracting fractions of their hourly wages using time-tracking technology. American said it pays staff for the work they do. Kroger and Montage declined to comment, the WSJ reports.\nIran vowed to uphold the pact curbing its nuclear activities if the European Union can offset renewed U.S. sanctions, senior officials in Tehran said, advocating an approach that would widen a deepening schism between Washington and Brussels, the WSJ reports.\nThe outlook for containing Ebola is more favorable than during a major outbreak in West Africa in 2014, the head of the Worlkd Health Organization said. The virus has been reported in Mbandaka, a Congo River port city, from where it could spread to the capital, Kinshasa, Reuters reports.\nSTRATEGY\nBlackstone Group is shedding its investment in hotel group Hilton Worldwide Holdings , closing out the most profitable private-equity investment in real estate ever. The hotel chain said Friday that Blackstone would sell 15.8 million of its shares in privately negotiated transactions, the WSJ reports.\nDenise Morrison’s abrupt departure as chief executive officer of Campbell Soup Co. indicates the company’s yearslong push into fresh and refrigerated foods has failed. U.S. soup sales and Campbell’s fresh-food business have faltered, suggesting to analysts the firm needs a new plan , the WSJ reports.\nCampbell paid high prices to acquire small but growing brands—like its recent $700 million acquisition of organic soup maker Pacific Foods. PHOTO: RICHARD B. LEVINE/NEWSCOM/ZUMA PRESS The U.S.’s Fifth Third Bancor p said it would buy MB Financial in a deal valued at about $4.7 billion, Reuters reports. The price is equivalent to a 24% premium over MB Financial’s most recent closing price.\nUnited Technologies is selling the Taylor Co. , which produces ice-cream and frozen-drink machines, to Middleby for $1 billion in cash, as the industrial conglomerate works to sharpen its focus on its core businesses, the WSJ reports.\nThe Morning Risk Report from WSJ’s Risk & Compliance Journal cues up the most important news in risk and compliance every weekday morning.
