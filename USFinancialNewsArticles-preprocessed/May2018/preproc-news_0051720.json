Our housing category remains resilient despite low overall transaction volumes in China's housing market. Two of our newest early-stage businesses, Zhuan Zhuan, the C2C used goods transaction platform, and 58 Town, a version of 58 specifically designed for rural areas, both continue to grow rapidly. We continue to launch more features across our platform and are pushing further into lower tier cities to take advantage of growth opportunities there.\"\nMr. Hao Zhou, Chief Financial Officer of 58.com added, \"Revenues during the quarter increased a solid 24.3% year-over-year despite the impact from Chinese New Year falling later than usual. On a sequential basis, revenues decreased due to typical seasonality. Net and operating margin continued to improve significantly year-over-year. At the same time, our total number of employees at the end of this quarter decreased by approximately 7% year-over-year, which demonstrates our ability to leverage technology to increase operational efficiency and create more synergies between our various business segments.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nR evenues\nTotal revenues were RMB2,471.2 million (US$393.0 million), representing an increase of 24.3% from RMB1,988.3 million in the same quarter of 2017.\nMembership revenues were RMB928.9 million (US$147.7 million), an increase of 17.1% from RMB792.9 million in the same quarter of 2017. The increase in membership revenues was primarily driven by an increase in the number of subscription-based paying membership accounts. The total number of subscription-based paying membership accounts on the Company's platforms, which include 58.com, Ganji.com and Anjuke.com , was approximately 2,665,000 during the first quarter of 2018, a 20.5% increase from approximately 2,212,000 in the same quarter of 2017. Subscription-based paying membership accounts refer to the users who have purchased the Company's subscription-based membership services and whose membership subscriptions are active at any point during a given period. Some paying members purchase membership services from more than one platform from the Company, which contributes separately to the revenues of each platform.\nOnline marketing services revenues were RMB1,492.0 million (US$237.3 million), an increase of 31.2% from RMB1,137.0 million in the same quarter of 2017.

The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increases in the costs of used good sold, traffic acquisition costs (\"TAC\") paid to 58.com's advertising union partners, salaries and benefits, and short message service (\"SMS\") costs.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit was RMB2,213.2 million (US$352.0 million), an increase of 23.7% from RMB1,788.7 million during the same quarter of 2017.\nGross margin was 89.6%, compared with 90.0% during the same quarter of 2017.\nOperating E xpenses\nOperating expenses were RMB1,946.4 million (US$309.5 million), representing an increase of 13.8% from RMB1,710.8 million in the same quarter of 2017.\nSales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were RMB1,439.2 million (US$228.9 million), an increase of 15.5% from RMB1,246.0 million in the same quarter of 2017.\nWithin sales and marketing expenses, advertising expenses accounted for RMB682.0 million (US$108.5 million) and RMB512.2 million during the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses associated with the promotion of the 58.com and Zhuan Zhuan brands.\nNon-advertising sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were RMB757.2 million (US$120.4 million), an increase of 3.2% from RMB733.8 million in the same quarter of 2017. Non-advertising sales and marketing expenses include salaries, benefits, commissions and share-based compensation for the Company's sales, sales support, customer service, and marketing dealer management personnel, as well as online and offline promotional expenses, and other operating expenses that are associated with sales and marketing activities. The increase was primarily driven by increased commissions, salaries and benefits for the Company's sales and customer service teams.\nResearch and development expenses during the first quarter of 2018 were RMB346.4 million (US$55.1 million), an increase of 10.1% from RMB314.5 million in the same quarter of 2017.

One ADS represents two Class A ordinary shares.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on the Company's current operations, total revenues for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be between RMB3,100 million and RMB3,200 million. This represents a year-over-year increase of 19.6% to 23.4% in Renminbi amounts. These estimates reflect the Company's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, this press release presents non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to 58.com Inc., non-GAAP net margin and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share and per ADS by excluding share-based compensation expenses of the group (net of the amount allocated to noncontrolling interests), amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, share-based compensation expenses included in share of results of equity investees and income tax effects of above GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important to help investors understand the Company's operating and financial performance, compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and assess the Company's core operating results, as they exclude certain expenses that are not expected to result in cash payments. The use of the above non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. Share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, non-cash gain or loss and income tax effects resulting from GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items have been and will continue to be incurred in the future and are not reflected in the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures, but should be considered in the overall evaluation of the Company's results. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of its share-based compensation expenses of the group (net of the amount allocated to noncontrolling interests), amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, share-based compensation expenses included in share of results of equity investees and income tax effects of above GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is set forth at the end of this release.\nConference Call\n58.com's management will host an earnings conference call on Thursday, May 24, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (8:00 p.m. Beijing / Hong Kong time on the same day).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nInternational:\n+1-412-317-5225\nU.S. Toll Free:\n+1-866-235-9918\nHong Kong:\n800-905945\nChina:\n4001-201203\nPasscode:\nWUBA\nPlease dial in 15 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin and provide the passcode to join the call.\nA telephone replay of the call will be available after the conclusion of the conference call through 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time, May 31, 2018.

Company's employees were expected to be settled in cash and were classified as liabilities. The share-based compensation expenses recognized for this type of awards amounted to RMB5.3 million and RMB5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 , respectively, were excluded from the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation accordingly.\n[6] This is to exclude the income tax benefits related to amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions calculated at PRC statutory income tax rate of 25% and income tax expense related to dispose of business. Other GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items have no income tax effect.\n releases/58com-reports-first-quarter-2018-unaudited-financial-results-300653587.html\nSOURCE 58.com",
