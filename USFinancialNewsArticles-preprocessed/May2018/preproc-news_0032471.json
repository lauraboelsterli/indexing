    "text": "May 14, 2018 / 2:19 AM / Updated 3 minutes ago China's stock exchanges tighten supervision on booming ABS market Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s stock exchanges have stepped up their scrutiny of the booming asset-backed securities (ABS) market, publishing new rules that require prompt information disclosure and risk management updates from issuers. FILE PHOTO: A statue of a bull is displayed outside the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen October 23, 2009. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo\nChina’s ABS market has exploded over the past few years as the government’s crackdown on shadow banking pushed borrowers to alternative sources of finance.\nIssuance of ABS jumped to 1.5 trillion yuan ($236.84 billion) last year, from almost zero in 2013, according to consultancy China Securities Analytics.\nThe Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges said at the weekend that regulators supported the development of the market, but also scrutinised its potential risks.\nThe exchanges stipulate “timely and effective disclosure” on ABS products, on which better-informed investment decisions can be made.\nThe exchanges also published rules to mitigate default risks, requiring ABS issuers to submit risk-management reports to the stock exchanges every six months.\nABS have been a preferred alternative source of finance for companies struggling to cope with China’s official deleveraging campaign, which has made conventional debt finance harder to get.\nSecuritisation allows the cash flow from a wide range of assets such as loans, real estate, toll ways and scenic parks to be used as collateral for bond-like securities that are sold to investors.
