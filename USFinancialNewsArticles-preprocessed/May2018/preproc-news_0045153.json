Soccer Football - Carabao Cup Fourth Round - AFC Bournemouth vs Middlesbrough - Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth, Britain - October 24, 2017 Bournemouth's Artur Boruc in action Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien\nThe former Celtic and Southampton shot-stopper has kept 34 clean sheets in 112 appearances across all competitions for Bournemouth since joining the south coast club in 2015.\n\"I'm very pleased and happy to stay here for another year,\" the 39-year-old told Bournemouth's website www.afcb.co.uk .\n“It is never easy to watch the team playing when you are not involved but I am fighting every day for the number one spot and whenever the manager gives me a chance, I give it 100 per cent.\n“I am settled here, I love this club and my family love it here too. I believe I still have a part to play and that is why I signed a new deal.”\nBoruc has been ousted as Bournemouth’s first-choice goalkeeper by Asmir Begovic, who played in all 38 league matches as Eddie Howe’s side finished 12th in their most recent campaign.
