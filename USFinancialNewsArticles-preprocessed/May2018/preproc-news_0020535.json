    "text": "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. (GBT) (NASDAQ:GBT) today reported recent business progress and the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"During the first quarter of 2018, we continued to remain focused on the clinical development of voxelotor for the treatment of sickle cell disease, and we have invested further in our commercial infrastructure with the appointment of David L. Johnson as chief commercial officer,” said Ted W. Love, M.D., president and chief executive officer of GBT. “We remain on track to announce top-line clinical data from Part A of our Phase 3 HOPE Study in the first half of this year.”\nRecent Business Progress\nVoxelotor\nClinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation published results from a preclinical study demonstrating that voxelotor preserves normal blood flow properties in sickled red blood cells. Two poster presentations highlighting results from the Phase 1 Basecamp (GBT440-011) study, which evaluated the physiologic effects of voxelotor in healthy volunteers under hypoxemic conditions, will be presented at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Conference 2018, which will be held May 18-23, 2018, in San Diego.\nCorporate\nRaised approximately $240.5 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, from an underwritten public offering and related exercise of the over-allotment option in March 2018. Expanded the management team with the appointment of David L. Johnson as chief commercial officer. Mr. Johnson is an accomplished leader with more than 25 years in the biopharmaceutical industry including most recently serving as vice president, sales and marketing, Liver Disease Business Unit, at Gilead Sciences, Inc.\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $544.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $329.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $41.6 million compared with $23.3 million for the same period in 2017. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $0.87 compared with $0.60 for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $29.9 million compared with $17.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in R&D expenses is primarily attributable to increased expenses for the Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study and the Phase 3 HOPE Study, including increased expenses related to a higher level of manufacturing activities to support these studies. Total R&D stock-based compensation expense incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $3.0 million, compared with $1.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $12.8 million compared with $6.4 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in G&A is primarily attributable to increased employee-related costs, including $1.7 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the achievement of certain milestones in the first quarter of 2018, and increased professional and consulting services associated with the growth of the Company's operations. Total G&A stock-based compensation expense incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $4.8 million, compared with $1.5 million for the same period in 2017.\nAbout GBT\nGBT is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company determined to discover, develop and deliver innovative treatments that provide hope to underserved patient communities.
