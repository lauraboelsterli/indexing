    "text": "HOUSTON, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Halcón Resources Corporation (NYSE:HK) (“Halcón” or the “Company”) today announced its first quarter 2018 financial and operating results, provided an operational update and revised 2018 guidance.\nNet production for the three months ended March 31, 2018 averaged 10,967 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), which was a 75% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 production level of 6,283 Boe/d. Additionally, the first quarter production rate is more than 100% higher than Halcón’s fourth quarter 2017 production rate pro forma for the Williston Non-Op asset sale. Production was comprised of 70% oil, 15% natural gas liquids (NGLs) and 15% natural gas for the first quarter.\nHalcón generated total revenues of $49.3 million for the first quarter of 2018. The Company reported a net loss available to common stockholders of $(2.6) million or a net loss per basic and diluted share of $(0.02) for the same period. After adjusting for selected items (see Selected Item Review and Reconciliation table for additional information), the Company generated a net loss of $(8.7) million, or $(0.06) per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA (see EBITDA Reconciliation table for additional information) totaled $18.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nExcluding the impact of hedges, Halcón realized 99% of the average NYMEX oil price, 41% of the average NYMEX oil price for NGLs and 87% of the average NYMEX natural gas price during the first quarter of 2018. Halcón realized hedge losses of approximately $5.2 million during the first quarter.\nLiquidity and Capital Spending\nThe Company recently received approval on its senior secured revolving credit facility for a borrowing base of $200 million effective May 1, 2018. This represents a 100% increase in Halcón’s borrowing base vs. its previous level of $100 million. As of March 31, 2018, Halcón’s liquidity was $380 million pro forma for the closing of its West Quito Draw acquisition and the new borrowing base. This liquidity consisted of $182 million of pro forma cash on hand plus $200 million of undrawn revolver availability, less letters of credit outstanding.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Halcón incurred capital costs of approximately $116 million on drilling and completions, $112 million on acquisitions and $38 million on infrastructure, seismic and other.\nHedging Update\nAs of May 2, 2018, Halcón had 10,673 barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil hedged for the last nine months of 2018 at an average price of $52.92 per barrel. For 2019, the Company has 14,000 bbl/d of oil hedged at an average price of $55.76 per barrel.\nAs of May 2, 2018, Halcón had 7,500 MMBtu/d of natural gas hedged for the last nine months of 2018 at an average price of $3.16 per MMBtu. For 2019, the Company has 5,000 MMBtu/d of gas hedged at an average price of $2.81 per MMBtu.\nOperations Update\nHalcón is currently producing in excess of 13,500 Boe/d net. The Company expects second quarter 2018 production to average between 13,000 and 14,000 Boe/d net. Halcón is currently running three operated rigs in the Delaware Basin with a fourth operated rig coming in the next few weeks. These four rigs will spend most of the remainder of 2018 in Monument Draw and West Quito Draw. The Company also has one full-time frac crew operating and plans to source a spot frac crew in the second half of 2018.\nHalcón currently holds 22,479 net acres in its Monument Draw area. The Company has five horizontal lower Wolfcamp wells producing in this area. Additionally, Halcón has two wells waiting on completion and another three wells currently being drilled in this area. Halcon’s average 30 day peak IP rate for its first five operated horizontal wells in Monument Draw was 1,575 Boe/d (average completed lateral length of 8,706 feet). This area is currently producing approximately 3,850 Boe/d, net.\nHalcón currently holds 10,622 net acres in its West Quito Draw area. The Company plans to spud its first operated horizontal Wolfcamp well in this area this summer. This area is currently producing approximately 1,350 Boe/d, net.\nHalcón currently holds 27,115 net acres in its Hackberry Draw area. The Company has drilled and completed 14 horizontal wells (twelve Wolfcamp, one 2 nd Bone Spring and one 3 rd Bone Spring). Additionally, Halcón has three wells flowing back after frac, one well being drilled out and another well currently being frac’d in this area. Halcon’s average 30 day peak IP rate for its first 9 operated Wolfcamp horizontal wells with 30 day rates available in Hackberry Draw was 936 Boe/d. The Company’s first 2 nd Bone Spring horizontal well in Hackberry Draw, the Berkley State West 2H, is one of the three wells currently flowing back after frac. This area is currently producing approximately 8,250 Boe/d, net.\nRevised 2018 Guidance\nThe guidance table below has been updated from previous 2018 guidance to reflect the addition of a fourth operated rig in May, 2018 as well as the inclusion of the Company’s recently acquired West Quito Draw properties. This guidance also assumes a second spot frac crew is operating from mid-August to October, 2018.\n2Q 2018 4Q 2018 Full Year 2018 Production (Boe/d) Total 13,000 - 14,000 23,000 - 25,000 15,000 – 20,000 % Oil 68% - 72% % Gas 14% - 16% % NGL 14% - 16% Capex ($MM) D&C Capex (1) $425 - $475 Infrastructure, Seismic and Other Capex $70 - $90 Operating Costs and Expenses Lease Operating & Workover ($/Boe) $4.25 – $5.25 Gathering, Transportation & Other ($/Boe) $3.00 – $4.00 Cash G&A ($MM) $40 - $45 Production Taxes (% of Revenue) 6% – 7% (1) Excludes capitalized G&A. Floyd C. Wilson commented “Our revised 2018 guidance includes the impact of our recently acquired West Quito properties and the addition of a fourth rig in May. It’s important to note that our revised 2018 production guidance assumes we don’t bring a second spot frac crew in until Mid-August of 2018. This timing results in back-end weighted production growth for us in 2018 with a fourth quarter production rate expected to be around 24,000 boe/d. This sets us up nicely as we head into 2019. I also want to emphasize that our 2018 drilling plan consists of almost entirely long laterals in excess of 9,000 feet. Although long lateral development results in longer cycle times, long laterals are a more capital efficient way to develop assets over the long-run. We are well positioned to withstand any takeaway issues in the Permian through 2019 with takeaway contracts in place for oil and gas. We are evaluating ways to create value and have options available to us including joint venture and infrastructure divestiture opportunities. We continue to focus on execution and efforts to control costs while optimizing drilling and completion programs.”\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nHalcón Resources Corporation (NYSE:HK) has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 a.m. CDT).
