    "text": "Late Milwaukee lineup addition Jonathan Villar contributed a homer, two singles and three runs, Tyler Saladino had an inside-the-park homer, and Christian Yelich hit a tiebreaking single in the seventh inning of the Brewers’ 7-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday in Phoenix.\nVillar, added when Ryan Braun was scratched due to right mid-back tightness, homered in the ninth inning after singling and scoring in the second and seventh innings. He helped the Brewers win for the fourth time in five games and the fifth time in seven.\nSaladino homered with one out in the ninth inning, a play on which Arizona center fielder A.J. Pollock dived for the ball but could not get it as it rolled to the fence. Pollock left the game with an apparent wrist injury. He ranks second in the NL with 33 RBIs.\nSteven Souza Jr. had two singles and an RBI, and Paul Goldschmidt singled and scored for the Diamondbacks, who have lost six in a row and nine of 12. They have scored 12 runs in the losing streak.\nManny Pina and Yelich had two hits apiece and Orlando Arcia had a two-run double to help right-hander Junior Guerra (3-3) break a three-game losing streak. Guerra gave up three hits and two runs in six innings, with three strikeouts and four walks.\nPina and Villar singled to open the seventh inning off Patrick Corbin (4-1), who was replaced by Yoshihisa Hirano. Pina was thrown out at the plate on Arcia’s grounder before Andrew Chafin entered and gave up an RBI single to Yelich for a 3-2 lead.\nLorenzo Cain walked to load the bases off reliever Jimmie Sherfy, and Domingo Santana’s sacrifice fly made it 4-2.\nCorbin gave up six hits and four runs in six-plus innings, with eight strikeouts and one walk.\nPina doubled with two outs in the second inning and took third on Villar’s single to left. Corbin picked Villar off first for what would have been the third out, but Villar made it safely to second when first baseman Goldschmidt hesitated and looked toward third before holding the ball. Arcia doubled in both for a 2-0 lead.\nArizona broke up Guerra’s no-hitter while scoring twice in the fourth inning. Daniel Descalso walked and Goldschmidt singled to break a 3-for-47 skid before Souza doubled in Descalso. Nick Ahmed’s sacrifice fly tied it at 2.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. ",
