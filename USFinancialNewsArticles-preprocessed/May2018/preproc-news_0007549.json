    "text": "NEW YORK, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ: CRTO), the leading commerce marketing technology company, today announced financial results ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenue increased 9% (or 3% at constant currency 1 ) to $564 million. Revenue excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs, or Revenue ex-TAC 2 , grew 14% (or 8% at constant currency) to $240 million, or 42.6% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA 2 grew 38% (or 22% at constant currency) to $78 million, or 32.4% of Revenue ex-TAC. Cash flow from operating activities increased 91% to $85 million. Free Cash Flow 2 increased 224% to $52 million. Net income increased 45% to $21 million. Adjusted net income per diluted share 2 increased 30% to $0.60.\n\"I am pleased with our execution and results in the first quarter, which track quite well with our upcoming priorities for the year,\" said JB Rudelle, CEO.\n\"We delivered another quarter of healthy growth, increased profitability and cash flow,\" said Benoit Fouilland, CFO. \"These results once again highlight the strengths and scalability of our business model.\"\nOperating Highlights\nWe ended the quarter with more than 18,500 commerce and brand clients, a 20% increase year-over-year, while maintaining client retention at close to 90% for all products. With about 1.4 billion individual users in our Identity Graph worldwide, we already operate one of the largest user graphs in the industry. Criteo Direct Bidder, our header bidding technology, is now connected to 2,000 large publishers. We drove stable growth in same-client Revenue ex-TAC 3 despite some user coverage limitations.\nRevenue and Revenue ex-TAC\nRevenue grew 9%, or 3% at constant currency, to $564 million (Q1 2017: $517 million). Revenue ex-TAC grew 14%, or 8% at constant currency, to $240 million (Q1 2017: $210 million). This increase was primarily driven by continued innovation, a broader product portfolio, improved access to publisher inventory and new clients across regions. Revenue ex-TAC margin as a percentage of revenue was 42.6%, above the prior year.\nIn the Americas, Revenue ex-TAC grew 3%, or 3% at constant currency, to $81 million and represented 34% of total Revenue ex-TAC. In EMEA, Revenue ex-TAC grew 26%, or 11% at constant currency, to $103 million and represented 43% of total Revenue ex-TAC. In Asia-Pacific, Revenue ex-TAC grew 15%, or 10% at constant currency, to $57 million and represented 24% of total Revenue ex-TAC.\nNet Income and Adjusted Net Income\nNet income increased 45% to $21 million (Q1 2017: $15 million). Net income available to shareholders of Criteo S.A. was $20 million, or $0.29 per share on a diluted basis (Q1 2017: $12 million, or $0.18 per share on a diluted basis). Adjusted net income, or net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, restructuring costs and the tax impact of these adjustments, increased 31% to $41 million, or $0.60 per share on a diluted basis (Q1 2017: $31 million, or $0.46 per share on a diluted basis).\nAdjusted EBITDA and Operating Expenses\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 38%, or 22% at constant currency, to $78 million (Q1 2017: $56 million). This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by sustained Revenue ex-TAC performance across all regions, as well as proceeds from a disposal and temporary savings in expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of Revenue ex-TAC was 32.4% (Q1 2017: 26.9%), a 550-basis point improvement year-over-year.\nOperating expenses increased 9% to $176 million (Q1 2017: $162 million). Operating expenses, excluding the impact of equity awards compensation expense, pension costs, restructuring costs, depreciation and amortization and acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, which we refer to as Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, increased 7% to $148 million (Q1 2017: $137 million).\nCash Flow and Cash Position\nCash flow from operating activities increased 91% to $85 million (Q1 2017: $44 million). Free Cash Flow, defined as cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and change in accounts payable related to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, grew 224% to $52 million (Q1 2017: $16 million).\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following reflect Criteo's expectations as of May 2, 2018.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance:\nWe expect Revenue ex-TAC to be between $226 million and $230 million. We expect Adjusted EBITDA to be between $53 million and $57 million.\nFiscal Year 2018 Guidance:\nWe expect Revenue ex-TAC growth for fiscal year 2018 to be between 3% and 8% at constant currency. We expect Adjusted EBITDA margin for fiscal 2018 to be between 28% and 30% of Revenue ex-TAC.\nThe above guidance for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, assumes the following exchange rates for the main currencies impacting our business: a U.S. dollar-euro rate of 0.813, a U.S. dollar-Japanese Yen rate of 108, a U.S. dollar-British pound rate of 0.72 and a U.S. dollar-Brazilian real rate of 3.32.\nThe above guidance assumes no acquisitions are completed during the quarter ending June 30, 2018, and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.\nReconciliation of Revenue ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding U.S. GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of equity awards compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our share price. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and its attachments include the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"): Revenue ex-TAC, Revenue ex-TAC by Region, Revenue ex-TAC margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per diluted share, Free Cash Flow and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses. These measures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nRevenue ex-TAC is our revenue excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs (\"TAC\") generated over the applicable measurement period and Revenue ex-TAC by Region reflects our Revenue ex-TAC by our geographies. Revenue ex-TAC, Revenue ex-TAC by Region and Revenue ex-TAC margin are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the elimination of TAC from revenue can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business and across our geographies. Accordingly, we believe that Revenue ex-TAC, Revenue ex-TAC by Region and Revenue ex-TAC margin provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Adjusted EBITDA is our consolidated earnings before financial income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop shortâ€‘ and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that by eliminating equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted Net Income is our net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, restructuring costs and the tax impact of these adjustments. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that by eliminating equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, restructuring costs and the tax impact of these adjustments, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and change in accounts payable related to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash. Accordingly, we believe that Free Cash Flow permits a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our available cash flows.\nNon-GAAP Operating Expenses are our consolidated operating expenses adjusted to eliminate the impact of depreciation and amortization, equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration. The Company uses Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short-term and long-term operational plans, and to assess and measure our financial performance and the ability of our operations to generate cash. We believe Non-GAAP Operating Expenses reflects our ongoing operating expenses in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. As a result, we believe that Non-GAAP Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our core operating performance and trends in the same manner as our management and in comparing financial results across periods. In addition, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses is a key component in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, which is one of the key measures the Company uses to provide its quarterly and annual business outlook to the investment community.\nPlease refer to the supplemental financial tables provided in the appendix of this press release for a reconciliation of Revenue ex-TAC to revenue, Revenue ex-TAC by Region to revenue by region, Adjusted EBITDA to net income, Adjusted Net Income to net income, Free Cash Flow to cash flow from operating activities, and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to operating expenses, in each case, the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 1) other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may address the impact of TAC differently; and 2) other companies may report Revenue ex-TAC, Revenue ex-TAC by Region, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Free Cash Flow, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently or over different regions, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider these measures alongside our U.S. GAAP financial results, including revenue and net income.\nForward-Looking Statements Disclosure\nThis press release contains , including projected financial results for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, our expectations regarding our market opportunity and future growth prospects and other statements that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: failure related to our technology and our ability to respond to changes in technology, uncertainty regarding our ability to access a consistent supply of internet display advertising inventory and expand access to such inventory, investments in new business opportunities and the timing of these investments, whether the projected benefits of acquisitions materialize as expected, uncertainty regarding international growth and expansion, the impact of competition, uncertainty regarding legislative, regulatory or self-regulatory developments regarding data privacy matters and the impact of efforts by other participants in our industry to comply therewith, failure to enhance our brand cost-effectively, recent growth rates not being indicative of future growth, our ability to manage growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, our ability to grow our base of clients, and the financial impact of maximizing Revenue ex-TAC, as well as risks related to future opportunities and plans, including the uncertainty of expected future financial performance and results and those risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in the Company's SEC filings and reports, including the Company's K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 that will be filed with the SEC, as well as future filings and reports by the Company.

Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region are not measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the elimination of TAC from revenue and review of these measures by region can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may address the impact of TAC differently; (b) other companies may report Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region or similarly titled measures but define the regions differently, which reduces their effectiveness as a comparative measure; and (c) other companies may report Revenue ex-TAC or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region alongside our other U.S. GAAP financial results, including revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the elimination of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our U.S. GAAP financial results, including net income.\nCRITEO S.A.\nReconciliation from Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to Operating Expenses under GAAP\n(U.S. dollars in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\n2018\nYoY\nChange\nResearch and Development expenses\n$\n(39,521)\n$\n(45,318)\n15\n%\nEquity awards compensation expense\n3,916\n4,555\n16\n%\nDepreciation and Amortization expense\n2,944\n2,221\n(25)\n%\nPension service costs\n146\n220\n51\n%\nAcquisition-related deferred price consideration\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n%\nRestructuring\nâ€”\n(348)\n(100)\n%\nNon GAAP - Research and Development expenses\n(32,515)\n(38,670)\n19\n%\nSales and Operations expenses\n(90,730)\n(95,649)\n5\n%\nEquity awards compensation expense\n6,710\n7,832\n17\n%\nDepreciation and Amortization expense\n4,961\n4,454\n(10)\n%\nPension service costs\n59\n79\n34\n%\nRestructuring\nâ€”\n107\n100\n%\nNon GAAP - Sales and Operations expenses\n(79,000)\n(83,177)\n5\n%\nGeneral and Administrative expenses\n(31,516)\n(34,591)\n10\n%\nEquity awards compensation expense\n4,314\n6,916\n60\n%\nDepreciation and Amortization expense\n1,171\n1,722\n47\n%\nPension service costs\n85\n135\n59\n%\nAcquisition related costs\n6\nâ€”\n(100)\n%\nRestructuring\nâ€”\n(11)\n(100)\n%\nNon GAAP - General and Administrative expenses\n(25,940)\n(25,829)\nâ€”\n%\nTotal Operating expenses\n(161,767)\n(175,558)\n9\n%\nEquity awards compensation expense\n14,940\n19,303\n29\n%\nDepreciation and Amortization expense\n9,076\n8,397\n(7)\n%\nPension service costs\n290\n434\n50\n%\nAcquisition-related costs\n6\nâ€”\n(100)\n%\nRestructuring\nâ€”\n(252)\n(100)\n%\nTotal Non GAAP Operating expenses (1)\n$\n(137,455)\n$\n(147,676)\n7\n%\n(1) We define Non-GAAP Operating Expenses as our consolidated operating expenses adjusted to eliminate the impact of depreciation and amortization, equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration. The Company uses Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short-term and long-term operational plans, and to assess and measure our financial performance and the ability of our operations to generate cash. We believe Non-GAAP Operating Expenses reflects our ongoing operating expenses in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. As a result, we believe that Non-GAAP Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our core operating performance and trends in the same manner as our management and in comparing financial results across periods. In addition, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses is a key component in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, which is one of the key measures we use to provide our quarterly and annual business outlook to the investment community.\nCRITEO S.A.\nDetailed Information on Selected Items\n(U.S. dollars in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\n2018\nYoY Change\nEquity awards compensation expense\nResearch and development\n$\n3,916\n$\n4,555\n16\n%\nSales and operations\n6,710\n7,832\n17\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n4,314\n6,916\n60\n%\nTotal equity awards compensation expense\n14,940\n19,303\n29\n%\nPension service costs\nResearch and development\n146\n220\n51\n%\nSales and operations\n59\n79\n34\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n85\n135\n59\n%\nTotal pension service costs\n290\n434\n50\n%\n expense\nCost of revenue\n11,091\n15,249\n37\n%\nResearch and development\n2,944\n2,221\n(25)\n%\nSales and operations\n4,961\n4,454\n(10)\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n1,171\n1,722\n47\n%\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense\n20,167\n23,646\n17\n%\nAcquisition-related costs\nGeneral and administrative\n6\nâ€”\n(100)\n%\nTotal acquisition-related costs\n6\nâ€”\n(100)\n%\nRestructuring\nCost of revenue\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n%\nResearch and development\nâ€”\n(348)\n(100)\n%\nSales and operations\nâ€”\n107\n100\n%\nGeneral and administrative\nâ€”\n(11)\n(100)\n%\nTotal restructuring\n$\nâ€”\n$\n(252)\n(100)\n%\nCRITEO S.A.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to Net Income\n(U.S. dollars in thousands except share and per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\n2018\nYoY Change\nNet income\n$\n14,518\n$\n21,090\n45\n%\nAdjustments:\nEquity awards compensation expense\n14,940\n19,303\n29\n%\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n4,674\n3,457\n(26)\n%\nAcquisition-related costs\n6\nâ€”\n(100)\n%\nRestructuring costs\nâ€”\n(252)\n(100)\n%\nTax impact of the above adjustments\n(3,317)\n(3,079)\n(7)\n%\nTotal net adjustments\n16,303\n19,429\n19\n%\nAdjusted net income (1)\n$\n30,821\n$\n40,519\n31\n%\nWeighted average shares outstanding\n- Basic\n64,189,194\n66,160,375\n- Diluted\n67,283,012\n67,469,738\nAdjusted net income per share\n- Basic\n$\n0.48\n$\n0.61\n27\n%\n- Diluted\n$\n0.46\n$\n0.60\n30\n%\n(1) We define Adjusted Net Income as our net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments.
