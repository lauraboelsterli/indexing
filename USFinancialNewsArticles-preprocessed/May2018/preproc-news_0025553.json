    "text": "Transformation Continues To Drive Profit Growth\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DJO Global, Inc. (“DJO” or the “Company”), a leading global provider of medical technologies designed to get and keep people moving, today announced financial results for its public reporting subsidiary, DJO Finance LLC (“DJOFL”), for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nNet sales were $292.6 million, up 1.5% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Operating income increased 501.9% to $33.5 million from $6.7 million in the prior year period. Net loss attributable to DJOFL was $17.6 million, compared to a net loss of $40.0 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.2% over the prior year quarter to $64.8 million.\nBusiness Transformation Outcomes\nBusiness Transformation continues to drive profitability expansion and remains on track to deliver 7% to 10% annual cost reductions by end of 2018. Transformation actions taken to date expected to contribute $21.8 million in savings over the next four quarters.\n“After starting the quarter with slow revenue trends reflecting the overall market performance, we saw improvement later in the quarter, particularly in March. In line with our annual plan, we expect to build revenue momentum throughout the year as growth investments that began late in 2017 begin to materialize,” said Brady Shirley, DJO’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Overall performance was highlighted by continued, strong earnings growth and significant margin expansion.”\n“From a bottom-line perspective, we continue to demonstrate that our multi-year transformation is working, delivering 13% Adjusted EBITDA growth and over 200 basis point improvement in margin. The growth in Adjusted EBITDA is a product of improving gross margins and strong control of operating expenses, reflecting the hard work our team has put into our transformation initiatives,” commented Mike Eklund, DJO’s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. “Additional operations initiatives are already underway focused on enhancing customer satisfaction as well as financial metrics. We remain confident in our ability to continue the improvement we have seen since the start of this journey early last year.”\nSales Results\nNet sales for DJOFL for the first quarter of 2018 were $292.6 million, an increase of 1.5% compared to the first quarter of 2017. On the basis of constant currency rates, sales declined 1.7%. The number of selling days in the first quarter of 2018 was unchanged from the prior year period in the US but there was one less selling day outside the US.\nNet sales for DJO’s Surgical Implant segment grew 8.1% in the first quarter of 2018 to $53.6 million, reflecting greater than 20% growth in our large shoulder implant product line and single digit growth in our knee and hip implant product lines.\nNet sales for DJO’s International segment grew 13.3% in the first quarter of 2018 to $88.6 million, or 1.5% on a constant currency basis with one less selling day. There was strong sales growth in France, Scandinavia and Australia, partially offset by slower sales in the UK, Spain and Benelux region.\nNet sales for DJO’s Recovery Sciences segment were $35.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, down 6.8% compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven by softness in the segment’s Chattanooga product line.\nNet sales for DJO’s Bracing and Vascular segment were $114.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decline of 6.2% compared to the first quarter of 2017, reflecting challenges in the segment’s Dr. Comfort product line and a decline in our US bracing business.\nEarnings Results\nOperating income improved to $33.5 million from $6.7 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to a significant reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. Net loss attributable to DJOFL in the first quarter of 2018 was $17.6 million compared to a net loss of $40.0 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 grew 13.2% to $64.8 million from $57.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Including projected future savings of $21.8 million from cost savings programs currently underway as permitted under our credit agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding notes, Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 was $297.5 million.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income attributable to DJOFL plus net interest expense, income tax provision (benefit), and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-recurring items and other adjustment items as permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the Company’s secured term loan and revolving credit facilities (“Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) and the indentures governing its 8.125% second lien notes and its 10.75% third lien notes. A reconciliation between net loss attributable to DJOFL and Adjusted EBITDA is included in the attached financial tables.\nNet cash provided by continuing operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $12.2 million compared to $38.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decline in cash flow was attributable to higher inventory balances to allow for the transition of suppliers and modernization of distribution facilities as part of the Company’s transformation initiative, and to the payment of one-time costs accrued in the prior year.\nConference Call Information\nDJO has scheduled a conference call to discuss this announcement beginning at 4:30 pm, Eastern Time Thursday, May 10, 2018.

Under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we are required to maintain a specified senior secured first lien leverage ratio, which is determined based on our Adjusted EBITDA. If we fail to comply with the senior secured first lien leverage ratio under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we would be in default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and under the notes. Any acceleration under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would also result in a default under the Indentures governing the notes, which could lead to the note holders electing to declare the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the then outstanding notes immediately due and payable. In addition, under the Indentures governing the notes, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, refinancing subordinated indebtedness, paying dividends and entering into certain merger transactions is governed, in part, by our ability to satisfy tests based on Adjusted EBITDA. Our ability to meet the covenants specified in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing those notes will depend on future events, some of which are beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those covenants.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL plus interest expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-recurring items and other adjustment items as permitted in calculating covenant compliance and other ratios under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the notes. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants and other ratios in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the notes. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these calculations.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL or other performance measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), or as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. In particular, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the notes allows us to add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL. However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.\nThe following table provides reconciliation between net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTwelve Months Three Months Ended Ended\nMarch 31, April 1, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 Net loss attributable to DJO Finance LLC $ (17,568 ) $ (39,969 ) $ (13,493 ) Income loss from discontinued operations, net (144 ) (58 ) (395 ) Interest expense, net 43,922 42,687 175,473 Income tax provision (benefit) 5,385 4,078 (59,413 ) Depreciation and amortization 25,505 29,774 106,992 Non-cash charges (a) 226 571 4,753 Non-recurring and integration charges (b) 5,546 18,389 56,420 Other adjustment items (c) 1,928 1,769 5,415 64,800 57,241 275,752 Permitted pro forma adjustments (see note 1) Future Cost Savings 21,774 Adjusted EBITDA $ 64,800 $ 57,241 $ 297,526 Note 1 — Permitted pro forma adjustments include future cost savings from cost reduction actions related to our business transformation initiative, recognized as permitted under our credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes.
