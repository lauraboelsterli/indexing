    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 11:33 AM / Updated 9 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX futures up on rising gold prices Reuters Staff 4 Min Read May 2 (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada's main stock index on Wednesday as bullion prices rose and the U.S. dollar edged lower ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate decision. The Fed is likely to announce at 2:00 p.m. E.T. that it is holding interest rates steady. June futures on the S&P TSX index were up 0.39 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. Canada's main stock index edged higher on Tuesday as gains for the materials group offset declines for railroad shares and for Shopify Inc after it reported quarterly results. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were up 0.19 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were up 0.2 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were up 0.46 percent. (Morning News Call newsletter here ; The Day Ahead newsletter here ) TOP STORIES U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Tuesday that if a deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement cannot be reached with Canada and Mexico in about three weeks, its approval by the U.S. Congress could be in jeopardy. U.S. officials are pushing for quotas and \"other restrictions\" on steel and aluminum imports, a top trade official said on Tuesday after the White House announced a month-long extension of tariff exemptions for Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Suncor Energy Inc , Canada's second-largest energy producer, posted a first-quarter profit that beat analyst expectations, as improved crude oil pricing and higher refining margins outweighed lower production. Canada's Loblaw Cos Ltd beat profit estimates, helped by a rise in same-store sales in its food and drug retail businesses.
