The first company founded was Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1901.\nThe data will be presented later this week at the MIXiii Biomed conference in Tel Aviv.\n“The data indicate that the areas of focus of the Israeli life science industry are aligned with the current trends in the global life sciences industry,” a report from MIXiii said, noting that cancer and neurodegenerative, fibrotic and anti-inflammatory diseases are the most active therapeutic areas.
