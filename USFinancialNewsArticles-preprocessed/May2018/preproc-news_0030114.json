Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - AS Monaco vs AS Saint-Etienne - Stade Louis II, Monaco - May 12, 2018 St Etienne's Mathieu Debuchy in action with Monaco's Thomas Lemar REUTERS/Jean-Pierre Amet\nFabinho found the back of the net from the spot one minute into stoppage-time after Thomas Lemar was brought down by Mathieu Debuchy.\nThe result put Monaco on to 77 points, two ahead of Olympique Lyonnais who slumped to a last-second 3-2 defeat at Racing Strasbourg, and three ahead of Olympique de Marseille who were held 3-3 at En Avant Guingamp on Friday.\nThe top two teams qualify for the Champions League group stage while the third-placed side reach the third qualifying round. Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - AS Monaco vs AS Saint-Etienne - Stade Louis II, Monaco - May 12, 2018 Monaco's Fabinho celebrates scoring their first goal with team mates REUTERS/Jean-Pierre Amet\nChampions Paris St Germain, who have 92 points, had their title celebrations spoiled by visiting Stade Rennais as they suffered a 2-0 defeat at the Parc des Princes, their first in Ligue 1 since March 2016.\nRennes secured fifth place and will play the Europa League next season. Slideshow (6 Images)\nSt Etienne, Girondins de Bordeaux and Nice will battle it out for sixth place and the last Europa League spot in the last round of matches next Saturday.\nItalian striker Mario Balotelli, who looks set to leave Nice at the end of the season, shone at the Allianz Riviera, scoring a double in a 4-1 home win against Caen.\nLille saved their place in the elite with a 2-1 home win against Dijon.\nIn Strasbourg, Lyon seemed en route to virtually secure second place when goals by Nabil Fekir from the penalty spot and Hassem Aouar had put them 2-1 up against the hosts, who had opened the scoring in the first half through Stephane Bahoken.\nBut an 88th-minute goal by Nuna Da Costa and a superb free kick by Dimitri Lienard four minutes into injury time gave Strasbourg all three points as the Alsace club saved their place in the top flight.\nMonaco made the most of Lyon’s defeat in the closing stages at Louis II when Fabinho netted his seventh Ligue 1 goal this season with a penalty.\nPSG, who were handed the Ligue 1 champions trophy at home, were never in the mix against Rennes, who prevailed thanks to goals by Benjamin Bourigeaud and Adrien Hunou after the break.
