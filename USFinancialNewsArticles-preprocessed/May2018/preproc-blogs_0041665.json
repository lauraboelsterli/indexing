    "text": "0 COMMENTS Brian Behlendorf, executive director of the Hyperledger project, in New York City, May 16, 2018. Photo: Steven Norton / The Wall Street Journal\nBrian Behlendorf, a driving force behind the Apache web server and longtime supporter of open source software, now spends his time thinking about blockchain technology in the enterprise.\nAs the executive director of the Hyperledger project, an open source blockchain initiative hosted by the Linux Foundation, Mr. Behlendorf is working to create enterprise-ready distributed ledger technologies and develop a community of corporate blockchain developers.\nBlockchain is still nascent in the enterprise, but the conversation has evolved beyond basic technology questions to more involved discussions about scale, interoperability and governance, Mr. Behlendorf said.\nCompanies ranging from FedEx Corp . to J.P. Morgan Chase and Co . are experimenting with blockchain to help cut costs, facilitate smoother transactions and track items through supply chains. Many firms today participate in a number of industry consortia and are testing different blockchain implementations, such as those overseen by Hyperledger, Ethereum and R3.\nAs more applications move into production inside large companies, new questions have arisen about how to manage communication and conduct transactions across blockchains, Mr. Behlendorf said. He predicts the industry will begin to consolidate among a core set of technology stacks. “At a certain point the investor community will realize that lightning might not strike more than a couple of times,” he said.\nCIO Journal spoke with Mr. Behlendorf this week in New York. Edited excerpts below:\nHow do you see enterprise blockchain discussions shaping up this year?\nEvery company will be on multiple ledgers, except for the smallest ones, for the same reason that retailers are plugged into multiple payment rails. Up to 2017, (blockchain) was ‘let’s get some of the plumbing together and prove this stuff works.’ In 2018 and in the next few years, it will be about directories, how to discover these and how to conduct transactions across ledgers.\nSo companies are thinking about interoperability?\nNow that we have running systems and there is real value on these different networks, figuring out how to wire them together is a greater priority now than it was a few years ago. But even outside the blockchain space, interoperability is always a process, never a destination.\nPeople are starting to finally ask how do we get out of a simplistic mode of saying everyone should all be on the same public ledger, and instead get to a more sophisticated set of questions, like what does interoperability actually mean. It might mean wiring these things together with common software underneath. It might also mean common software on top.\nHow long do you think this period will last and what comes next?\nAnother characteristic of this period is there is a lot of capital slushing around. A lot of (companies) are trying to come up with the next Ethereum. It’s kind of like chasing after Google and trying to say we want to be the next Google a few years later. There’s a certain naivete around that. But it’s creating a lot of money, some of which, not all of it, is being used to write code and to test out how smart contracts, discovery, and cross-chain communication should look.\nBut at a certain point the investor community will realize that lightning might not strike more than a couple of times. That’s not to say Ethereum is the last public ledger. There will be others, these things will have life spans. But it’s not as efficient to try to build 20 different universes as it is to pick a few universes with a few common platform pieces and invest there. That means the investment climate kind of dries up, which means there’s less free money to spend on fancy conferences, but also less money on the technology.\nAs that consolidation happens, people will try to look for what people are actually using, what works, what people are putting into production and generating value from. If there’s a good idea in outlier technology that’s worth harvesting and bringing into the ecosystem let’s do that, but otherwise we don’t need 40 different blockchain stacks out there. We might need three, we might need two, but we don’t need 40. That consolidation phase, I don’t know if it starts in 2018, but I think that is something that is imminent.\nHow does that conversation happen inside enterprises?\nThe more ambitious enterprises have done one or two things. They’ve gone broad and said we want to evaluate all the leading candidates. So you’ll see lots of banks, for example, that are members of R3, have been playing with Ethereum technology, playing with Fabric and maybe even Sawtooth, and maybe even doing pilots on all these. That’s really right now the only way to know what they do.\nOthers that are more platform companies, like IBM, Oracle, or others, there is what they think of as a leading candidate. They will wrap their product and services strategy around that, and they’ll also be self-critical enough to know when they need to acquire rather than build in house.\nMost (companies) are waiting to see what happens. This industry can either present itself as a set of horses in a horse race, place your bets. I think that would be kind of harmful and lead to a lot of wasted effort and more marketing spend to tear each other down. (It would be positive) If we can spend our money figuring out how we can talk about convergence in a way that still gives us all a business model going forward, and migrate our users, and go upstream. There’s not much money to be made, in my opinion, in the foundation layer.\nWhat are the biggest implementation challenges that enterprises are working through?\nI don’t think it’s the tech. I think the tech is ready for the volume of transactions people want to throw at it and the flexibility of programming models that they want. It’s really the governance. It’s hard enough for one organization to launch any new product. Getting multiple parties to agree on anything — like a time of day for a meeting, let alone a common application — will end up being a bigger challenge.\nStandards are hard. These things are alive and humming like a benzene ring. They depend upon everybody running the right thing at all times. That I think operationally will be the big challenge.\nWrite to steven.norton@wsj.com\nShare this: BLOCKCHAIN BRIAN BEHLENDORF HYPERLEDGER Previous The Morning Download: JP Morgan Tests Blockchain Use in Capital Markets",
