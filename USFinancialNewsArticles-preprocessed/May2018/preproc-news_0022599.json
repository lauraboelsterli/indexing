    "text": "Record Revenues of $85.4 million 31% Decrease in Operating Expenses Upwardly Revised Annual Revenue Guidance of $108 million to $118 million\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ: IMMR), the leading developer and licensor of touch feedback technology, today reported financial results for the first 2018.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the company adopted a new revenue recognition standard (“ASC 606”), which impacted the company’s recognition of revenue from certain of its fixed-fee and per-unit license agreements. The company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method, which means that the total amount of revenue reported for first quarter 2017 has not been revised in the current financial statements. In the interest of comparability during the transition year to ASC 606, the company has provided revenue, net income and earnings per share information for the first quarter of 2018 in accordance with both ASC 606 and revenue recognition rules in effect prior to the adoption of ASC 606 (“ASC 605”).\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were a record $85.4 million. Royalty and license revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $85.3 million.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $69.9 million, or $2.29 per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $71.5 million, or $2.34 per diluted share. (See attached table for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.)\nAs of March 31, 2018, Immersion’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $139.0 million, compared to $46.5 million as of December 31, 2017.\nManagement Commentary and Business Outlook\n“We are very pleased with the progress Immersion has made over the past six months,” said Carl Schlachte, interim CEO and Chairman of the Board. “While we still have work to do, the company’s restructuring and renewed focus on our underlying fundamentals is showing strong early returns. We remain confident in Immersion’s continued ability to monetize our technology across the trends we see happening in the haptic ecosystem today.”\n“With the revenue treatment of certain of our fixed license fee agreements in the first quarter under ASC 606, the success in licensing new customers in the automotive market and the strength of our pipeline as we see it today, we now expect revenue in 2018 to be between $108 million and $118 million. We anticipate Non-GAAP net income of $59 million to $67 million. Our guidance remains independent of possible litigation outcomes,” concluded Mr. Schlachte.\nRecent Business Highlights\nEntered into a settlement and license agreement with Apple Inc. for certain Immersion patents. Signed a multi-year license agreement with Robert Bosch Car Multimedia GmbH, a subsidiary of Robert Bosch GmbH, providing Bosch with access to Immersion’s patented haptic technology for use in its automotive solutions. Signed a license agreement with Panasonic Corp. providing Panasonic with access to Immersion’s patented haptic technology for use in its automotive solutions.\nConference Call and Audio Webcast Information\nImmersion will host a conference call with company management on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern time) to discuss financial results for the first 2018.

Learn more at www.immersion.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nImmersion reports all financial information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult to understand if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Immersion discloses this non-GAAP information, such as Non-GAAP net loss and Non-GAAP net loss per share, because it is useful in understanding the company’s performance as it more closely reflects its cash tax rate and excludes certain non-cash expenses and other special charges, such as deferred tax assets valuation allowance and restructuring costs, that many investors feel may obscure the company’s true operating performance. Likewise, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” that involve risks and uncertainties as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause the results of Immersion Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nAll statements, other than the statements of historical fact, are statements that may be deemed forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, our expectation that revenues for 2018 will be in the range of $108 million to $118 million and non-GAAP net income for 2018 ranging from $59 million to $67 million and statements regarding litigation outcomes.\nImmersion’s actual results might differ materially from those stated or implied by such forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with Immersion’s business, which include, but are not limited to, potential and actual claims and proceedings, including litigation involving Immersion’s intellectual property; the impact of litigation developments on existing and potential customers; delay in or failure to achieve commercial demand for Immersion’s or its licensees’ products; the impact of new accounting standards that will affect key items such as revenue recognition and sales commissions; unexpected difficulties in monetizing the patent portfolio; the commercial success of applications or devices into which Immersion’s technology is licensed; the continued popularity of mobile games and wearables; potentially lengthy sales cycles and design processes; unanticipated difficulties and challenges encountered in development efforts; unexpected costs; the fact that certain target markets are still relatively nascent; risks associated with doing business internationally; litigation costs in any current or future litigation; failure to retain key personnel; ability to retain personnel; competition; the inherently uncertain nature of litigation which makes future outcomes and timing difficult to predict; the impact of global economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond the control of Immersion.\nFor a more detailed discussion of these factors, and other factors that could cause actual results to vary materially, interested parties should review the risk factors listed in Immersion’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2017, which is on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements in this press release reflect Immersion’s beliefs and predictions as of the date of this release. Immersion disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements as a result of financial, business, or any other developments occurring after the date of this release.\nImmersion, the Immersion logo and TouchSense are trademarks or registered trademarks of Immersion Corporation in the United States and other countries.
