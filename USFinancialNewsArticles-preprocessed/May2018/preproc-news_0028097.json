    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 4:00 PM / Updated 30 minutes ago Toxic gas alert for Hawaii volcano eruption; new areas at risk Terray Sylvester 5 Min Read\nPAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Residents on the Big Island of Hawaii were alerted on Thursday to rising levels of toxic gas from lava-oozing fissures, and geologists warned that new areas east of the erupting Kilauea volcano may be at risk of molten rock bursting from the ground.\nHawaii County authorities sent a text message to residents of the southeast corner of the island warning them of a wind change that would bring rising levels of sulphur dioxide gas, which can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities.\n“It’s just horrible. You can’t breathe in there,” said evacuated resident Robynn Stagg, 58, who drove through the thick, orange sulphur dioxide haze earlier this week in a failed attempt to check on her home.\nHawaii’s governor has warned that mass evacuations may be required as more fissures open in the ground and spew lava and gas into semi-rural residential areas on the east flank of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes.\nDuring an evening meeting with community members, an official with the United States Geological Survey’s Hawaii Volcano Observatory said that while no new fissures have opened during the last 24 hours, there has been “quite a bit” of ground cracking over the last day and that they were releasing steam.\n“Because the lava intrusion is still active and earthquakes are still occurring, we still think there’s a decent chance of new eruptive activity at the surface,” Steven Brantley said.\nAuthorities on Thursday completed the removal of highly flammable chemicals from a nearby geothermal power plant that was in the path of creeping lava.\nThe latest upheaval at Kilauea began last week after the crater floor of a long-active side vent collapsed suddenly in a cloud of ash, triggering a similar plunge in the molten lake inside the larger crater at the volcano’s summit.\nWhat followed was a flurry of earthquakes as huge volumes of magma — the term for lava beneath the surface — drained back through deep-underground passages that carried the molten rock far downslope. The lava then forced its way back to the surface through large cracks, or fissures, that opened at ground level in a residential area miles (km) away. ‘BALLISTIC BLOCKS’\nGeologists said Kilauea may be entering a new phase of explosive eruptions not seen in nearly a century that could hurl “ballistic blocks” weighing up to 12 tons for half a mile (800 meters), and rain pebble-sized fragments for another mile or two (1.8 to 3.2 km).\nHowever, the immediate vicinity around the summit, an area controlled by the National Park Service, was to be closed to visitors indefinitely, starting on Thursday night.\nSuch blasts would likely also eject plumes of volcanic ash that could be carried farther downwind into neighbouring communities, creating a nuisance and potential respiratory irritant, but not a life-threatening hazard, officials said.\nThe Leilani Estates community remains in greatest danger, with 15 volcanic fissures so far having destroyed 36 structures, most of them homes, and forcing the evacuation of about 2,000 residents. Deposits are seen on a road in Puna, Hawaii.

SURFING IN THE VOG\nLocal meteorologists said the change in prevailing winds could send Kilauea’s volcanic smog, or vog, northwest to Maui and other islands in Hawaii.\nSurfers bobbing in the ocean off Kona on the west side of the Big Island complained of the smog that could be seen in a haze over the coast.\n“Does that hat protect against vog?” one surfer was heard quipping to another about the floppy sun hat he was wearing.\nIn Pahoa, the nearest village to Kilauea, some schools remained closed after the area was hit by a 6.9 magnitude earthquake on Friday, the biggest since 1975.\nThe closures have added to a sense of disarray and ramped up stress levels, said gallery owner Amedeo Markoff, 49.\n“It’s like our version of a snow day — a lava day,” joked Markoff.\n(For graphic on scorched earth, click tmsnrt.rs/2IldVyS ) An ash column rises from the Overlook crater at the summit of Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii.
