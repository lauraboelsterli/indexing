    "text": "LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters said on Tuesday it had applied to the Irish central bank to move its foreign exchange derivative trading facility to Dublin because of Brexit.\n“Thomson Reuters has commenced the process of applying to the Central Bank of Ireland for authorisation to operate its FX Multilateral Trading Facility from Dublin rather than London as a result of the UK’s planned departure from the European Union,” it said.\n“It is our intention to transfer all existing client relationships of the Thomson Reuters MTF and Dealing, as well as Fixed Income Callouts and Auctions, from RTSL to our new Irish legal entity ahead of the Brexit date.”\nThomson Reuters, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, is the parent of Reuters News.
