    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s cabinet agreed on Wednesday to grant compensation of up to around 1 billion euros to utilities RWE ( RWEG.DE ) and Vattenfall VATN.UL for income lost due to the nuclear phase out, the environment ministry said.\nFILE PHOTO: RWE logo in Essen, Germany, March 14, 2017. Reuters/Thilo Schmuelgen The move follows a Constitutional Court ruling in 2016 which stated that a decision in 2011 to decommission nuclear power stations by the end of 2022 violated some property rights, clearing the way to compensation but leaving the amount open.\nA draft law seen by Reuters was drawn up last month, stating that the amount would probably be in the high three-digit-million euros ballpark.\nReporting by Madeline Chambers; Editing by Michael Nienaber\n ",
