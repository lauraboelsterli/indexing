(NYSE: AWK) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are off to a strong start this year with first quarter 2018 earnings per share up 13.5 percent compared to last year. Our first quarter results demonstrate that American Water employees continue to grow our business through the consistent execution of our strategies,” said Susan Story, president and CEO of American Water. \"Reflecting the company’s strong performance, the Board of Directors approved a 9.6 percent increase in our quarterly dividend to 45.5 cents per share, marking the sixth year in a row that the dividend increases at or above the top of the long-term EPS compound annual growth range.\n“During the quarter, we saw growth in both our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses. We invested $343 million to better serve our customers and added approximately 5,200 customers to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We also recently announced our agreement to acquire the Alton, Illinois Regional Wastewater System, \" added Story. \"Our employees have lived, worked and served water in this great city for over 140 years and we welcome these 23,000 new wastewater customers when we close, expected in the first quarter of 2019.\n“In our Market-Based Businesses, we recently announced the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions, a leading provider of home warranty protection products and services that is highly complementary to our Homeowner Services Group. We have been in this business for 16 years, and we are excited to welcome the great men and women of Pivotal into the American Water family upon close of the transaction expected in the second quarter.”\nConsolidated Results\nIn the first quarter 2018, income from continuing operations increased $0.07 per diluted share compared to the prior year. Net income from the Regulated Businesses increased $0.05 per diluted share or 9.4 percent from an increase in authorized revenue driven by capital investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Net income from the Market-Based Businesses increased $0.03 per diluted share, primarily from stronger results in the Homeowner Services Group, compared to the prior year and the Parent decreased $0.01 per diluted share from the lower tax shield on interest expense.\nFor the first three months of 2018, the company made capital investments of approximately $343 million, including $302 million dedicated primarily to improving infrastructure in the Regulated Businesses, and $8 million for regulated acquisitions. American Water plans to invest in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, including the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions (“Pivotal”), across its footprint in 2018, with the majority dedicated to providing safe, clean and reliable service to its customers.\nOn April 11, 2018, AWE entered into an agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of Pivotal from a Southern Company subsidiary. Pivotal is a leading provider of home warranty protection products and services, operating in 18 states with approximately 1.2 million customer contracts. The purchase price is approximately $365 million, including an estimated $7 million of working capital. This transaction, which is subject to obtaining regulatory consents and approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and be financed with approximately 50% debt and 50% equity. American Water entered into an equity forward transaction that substantially eliminates future equity market price risk, while mitigating immediate share dilution resulting from the transaction until funds are needed in connection with the closing of the acquisition.\nRegulated Businesses\nIn the first quarter of 2018, net income in the Regulated Businesses was $104 million, compared to $94 million for the same period in 2017. Regulated revenue increased $7 million driven by a $39 million increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions, and organic growth; partially offset by $32 million of deferred revenue resulting from the lower federal tax rate under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") that is estimated to be refunded to customers. This increase was partially offset by higher O&M expense of $19 million which includes higher production expense of $6 million due to purchased water price and usage increases in our California subsidiary and the remaining $13 million is to support regulated acquisition growth and higher main breaks from the harsh frigid weather conditions across several regulated states. In addition, depreciation expense increased $5 million from infrastructure investment growth. Income taxes were lower by $22 million from the lower federal tax rate under the TCJA.\nThrough May 2, 2018, the company received additional annualized revenues of approximately $95 million from general rate cases and approximately $15 million from infrastructure surcharges. The company is awaiting final orders for general rate cases in three states for a total annualized revenue request of approximately $165 million, adjusted for certain impacts of the TCJA. The extent to which requested rate increases will be granted by the applicable regulatory agencies will vary.\nFor the 12-month period ended March 31, 2018, the company's adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) improved to 35.6 percent, compared to 36.6 percent for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2017. For period-to-period comparability purposes, both of these ratios present the estimated impact of the TCJA on operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses on a pro forma basis, as if the lower federal corporate income tax rate was in effect for these periods. By reducing O&M expense as a proportion of revenue, American Water is able to make investments in needed capital improvements without significantly impacting customer bills.\nMarket-Based Businesses\nIn the first quarter of 2018, net income in the Market-Based Businesses was $12 million, compared to $7 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the Homeowner Services Group through customer growth and cost management and the impact of the lower federal income tax rate under the TCJA.\nOn April 11, 2018, American Water announced the signing of an agreement to acquire Pivotal Home Solutions, which is the home warranty business owned by Southern Company subsidiary Southern Gas. With this acquisition, Homeowner Services will be the second largest provider of utility home warranty products in the United States. In addition, the highly complementary acquisition strengthens American Water's platform for cross selling products and organic growth.\nDividends\nOn Apr. 20, 2018, American Water’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.455 per share of common stock, payable on Jun. 1, 2018, to all stockholders of record as of May 11, 2018.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nAmerican Water has affirmed its 2018 earnings guidance to a GAAP range of $3.22 - $3.32 per diluted share. The company’s earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below and under “Risk Factors” in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes a presentation of the adjusted Regulated O&M efficiency ratio, which, in addition to the pro forma adjustment for the impact of the TCJA, excludes from its calculation estimated purchased water revenues and purchased water expenses, the impact of certain Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill settlement activities recognized in 2016 and 2017, the impact of the company’s adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2017-07 related to net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs for 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes. This item constitutes a \"non-GAAP financial measure\" under SEC rules. This item is derived from American Water's consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure supplements and should be read in conjunction with the company's GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to any GAAP measure.\nManagement believes that the presentation of this measure is useful to investors because it provides a means of evaluating the company's operating performance without giving effect to items that are not reflective of management's ability to increase efficiency of the company's regulated operations. In preparing operating plans, budgets and forecasts, and in assessing historical performance, management relies, in part, on trends in the company's historical results, exclusive of estimated revenues and expenses related to purchased water, the Freedom Industries chemical spill settlement activities and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs. The company's definition of this metric may not be comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure may have significant limitations on its use.\nSet forth in this release is a table that reconciles each of the components used to calculate adjusted O&M efficiency ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call\nThe first quarter 2018 earnings conference call will take place on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 9 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Interested parties may listen to the conference call over the Internet by logging on to the Investor Relations page of the company’s website at https://amwater.com . Presentation slides that will be used in conjunction with the earnings conference call will also be made available online.
