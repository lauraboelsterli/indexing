    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Around two million diesel car owners in Germany could join legal moves in a class action to seek compensation from Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), German Justice Minister Katarina Barley said on Wednesday.\nGerman Minister Katarina Barley attends a news conference in Berlin, Germany June 26, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke “There are estimates that some two million diesel car owners\ncould benefit from this legal action,” she said.\nShe made the remarks after the German cabinet approved a draft law that paves the way for class action against the carmaker, which in 2015 admitted it had used illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests.\nReporting by Hans-Edzard Busemann; Writing by Joseph Nasr\n ",
