    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 12:08 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago IDG Capital fires manager in China after sexual messages posted online Shu Zhang , Julie Zhu 2 Min Read\nBEIJING/HONG KONG, May 24 (Reuters) - Venture capital firm IDG Capital has fired a top investment manager in China, following leaked messages on social media purporting to show he had made sexual advances toward several women in the course of his work.\nJiang Zuo, also known as Douglas Jiang, joined IDG in 2013 to lead the firm’s cryptocurrency investments.\nIn an internal email dated Tuesday and verified by Reuters, the firm said it fired the executive immediately after it found “his words and actions have seriously violated the values IDG represents and the ethical standards IDG requires”.\nIt did not give further details in the email.\nThe case emerged following a series of screenshots first leaked on WeChat, a Chinese social media app.\nReuters could not immediately independently verify the authenticity of the messages, nor could it reach Jiang for comment.\nSeveral IDG employees and a company spokeswoman told Reuters that Jiang could not be reached by mobile telephone.\nIDG would “improve its management system and enhance staff ethics to prevent similar events from happening”, the Beijing-based spokeswoman of the firm told Reuters.\nPowerful men from Hollywood to Silicon Valley have been ensnared in the #MeToo movement, triggered by accusations by dozens of women of sexual misconduct by U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein, but similar public cases in China remain rare due to cultural taboos and censorship.
