    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Investment advisory firm Hermes EOS on Wednesday called on Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) investors to vote against the election of supervisory board members at the annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.\nFILE PHOTO: A car with the Volkswagen VW logo badge is seen on display at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo The proposed re-election of board member Wolfgang Porsche and the election of Marianne Heiss would contradict a move towards more independent representation on the 20-member controlling panel and undermine corporate governance principles, Hermes, which represents large institutional investors, said in a written statement.\nHeiss has been nominated by Volkswagen (VW) to replace Annika Falkengren, a Swedish banker who has switched jobs, while Porsche, chairman of VWâ€™s majority stakeholder Porsche SE ( PSHG_p.DE ), is seeking a new term on the VW board.\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Tom Sims\n ",
