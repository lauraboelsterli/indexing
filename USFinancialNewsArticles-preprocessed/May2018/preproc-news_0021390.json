    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trican Well Service Ltd. (“Trican” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce its first quarter results for 2018 and announces its second half 2018 capital program. The following news release should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes of Trican for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as well as the Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2017. The documents described above are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nHIGHLIGHTS\nConsolidated revenue from continuing operations for Q1 2018 was $306.7 million, an increase of 105% compared to Q1 2017. Adjusted EBITDA 1 for the quarter was $54.9 million, which is net of $8.6 million expenses for stainless steel fluid ends 1 , compared to $26.0 million in Q1 2017, which had no charges for fluid ends 1 . Net loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $28.4 million (Q1 2017 – net loss of $48.9 million). Loss in the quarter on the Company's Investments in Keane of $54.4 million (Q1 2017 – loss of $52 million) primarily due to the decrease in Keane’s share price to US$14.80 per share at March 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 – US$19.01 per share). The acquisition of Canyon, combined with an increase in fracturing intensity led to significant growth in the volume of proppant pumped this quarter, increasing 106% when compared to Q1 2017. In Q1 2018, approximately 83% of Trican’s revenue came from customers focused on oil or liquids rich gas plays, whereas 17% came from customers focused on dry gas plays. (Q1 2017 - oil and liquids rich gas plays: 70% of revenue; dry gas wells: 30% of revenue). During Q1 2018, the Company purchased and cancelled 7,781,100 common shares at a weighted average price per share of $3.69 under the Normal Course Issuer Bid (“NCIB”). Since the inception of the NCIB, the Company has purchased and cancelled 18,593,589 common shares at a weighted average price per share of $3.89.\nFirst quarter financial results improved dramatically from the same period in 2017. Some of the key factors positively affecting the first quarter 2018 results include higher activity levels, as evidenced by the volume of proppant pumped, the acquisition of Canyon, and significantly improved services pricing.\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS – FINANCIAL REVIEW\nThree months ended ($ millions, except per share amounts; total proppant pumped 1 (thousands); internally sourced proppant pumped 1 (thousands); total job count 1 ; and HHP 1 (thousands); (unaudited) March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Revenue $ 306.7 $149.4 $280.5 Gross profit 38.9 17.8 30.7 Adjusted EBITDA 1 54.9 26.0 47.0 Net income / (loss) (28.4 ) (48.9) 17.2 Per share – basic ($ 0.08) ($0.25) $0.05 Per share – diluted ($ 0.08) ($0.25) $0.05 Total proppant pumped (tonnes) 1 484 235 397 Internally sourced proppant pumped (tonnes) 1 263 130 281 Total job count 1 3,943 3,554 2,909 Hydraulic Pumping Capacity: 672 424 680 Active crewed HHP 1 433 254 455 Active, maintenance/not crewed HHP 1 162 59 114 Parked HHP 1 77 111 111\n($ millions) As at March 31, 2018 As at December 31, 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.6 $12.7 Working capital 1 $ 212.6 $148.8 Current portion of loans and borrowings $ 21.0 $20.4 Long-term loans and borrowings $ 84.8 $83.3 Total assets $ 1,441.6 $1,506.2 OUTLOOK\nDespite weak AECO 1 natural gas prices, strong oil and NGL pricing could result in incremental oilfield services activity during the second half of 2018. In the short term we anticipate customers will continue to exercise caution before they increase their capital expenditure plans. We are encouraged by the increase in most of our customers’ cash flows and are positioning the Company to increase our active fleet if our customers increase their capital programs.\nWhile our fracturing equipment is fully committed from June until September, we do not anticipate third quarter fracturing utilization levels to reach those experienced in the third quarter of 2017. Weak AECO pricing has shifted customer spending away from natural gas completions, and towards oil and NGL completions activity such as the East Duvernay and other more exploratory liquids rich plays. This shift will result in more single well hydraulic fracturing jobs in Q3 2018 relative to Q3 2017, which activity was weighted to high intensity multi-well pad hydraulic fracturing jobs.\nThird quarter demand for our fracturing fleets exceeds our capacity of active crewed fracturing equipment and we are in the process of adding one more fracturing fleet to meet this demand. Improving fundamentals for oil and NGLs has resulted in early stage customer interest beyond this additional crew. Therefore, we intend to activate all of our idled fracturing equipment during the second half of 2018. Activating all of our idled fracturing equipment in advance of hiring crews will allow the Company to more efficiently service our existing customers by having additional equipment rotating through our fleet. Additionally, we will have the flexibility to increase the number of fleets more rapidly should customer demand materialize. The cost related to these reactivations was previously planned in our first half 2018 capital program and remains at $3 to $4 million dollars for all parked fracturing equipment.\nFor Q4 2018, one half of our fracturing fleets remain hard committed with long-term customers. The remaining fleets are soft committed to customers based on their Q4 2018 well completion plans. We anticipate these soft committed arrangements will be firmed up due to the aforementioned improving customers’ cash flows.\n2018 second half activity for our cementing service line will remain strong and similar to last year. Strong demand for our coil services should result in the Company activating two additional coiled tubing units from our existing available idled equipment.\nSecond quarter activity levels are usually difficult to predict given the nature of operational challenges that result during spring break-up 1 . Predicting our activity levels during Q2 2018 will be even more challenging given the high snow fall levels 1 in a number of our operating regions, which could prolong road bans and other seasonal operating challenges. Notwithstanding potential second quarter seasonal challenges, the Company has customers assigned for each of its hydraulic fracturing crews starting in June and approximately 25% of its hydraulic fracturing crews will work through April and May. We do not anticipate Q2 2018 activity to be as strong as last year due to a weaker spot market, which is primarily a result of the aforementioned Q2 2018 weather challenges.\nPricing for the remainder of 2018 is expected to remain comparable to first quarter pricing levels. We have seen some inflation on transportation charges for sand delivery, trucking, fuel, and certain chemicals. We will work with our clients to pass on cost increases during the second half of the year.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company’s 2018 capital expenditure program is now projected to be $70 million for the full year, an increase of $37 million from the previously disclosed $33 million first half of 2018 capital program. The incremental capital program for the full year is comprised of the following:\nAdditional Growth Capital 1 : $19 million Additional Maintenance Capital 1 : $17 million Additional Infrastructure and other Capital 1 : $1 million\nGrowth capital primarily relates to the addition of sand storage equipment and other equipment required to service our clients as the type of work moves to larger completion activities. Maintenance capital expenditures are anticipated to be consistent in the second half of 2018 relative to the first half. The Company has seen an increase in maintenance capital expenditures as the intensity of hydraulic fracturing increases; however, this increase was anticipated and reflected in our current pricing levels.\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS – COMPARATIVE QUARTERLY INCOME STATEMENTS\n($ thousands, except total job count 1 , and revenue per job, unaudited) March 31, % of March 31, % of December 31, % of Three months ended 2018 Revenue 2017 Revenue 2017 Revenue Revenue $ 306,719 100 % $149,403 100% $280,495 100% Cost of sales Cost of sales – other 238,111 78 % 117,212 78% 218,420 78% Cost of sales – depreciation and amortization 29,729 10 % 14,366 10% 31,330 11% Gross profit 38,879 13 % 17,825 12% 30,743 11% Administrative expenses – other 15,834 5 % 9,519 6% 17,874 6% Administrative expenses - depreciation 814 -% 888 1% 371 -% Asset impairment - -% - -% 6,523 2% Other (income)/expenses 357 -% (1,935) (1%) - Results from operating activities 21,874 7 % 9,359 6% 5,975 2% Finance income - -% (926) (2%) (2,148) (1%) Finance costs 2,771 1 % 3,728 2% 4,212 2% Loss/(gain) on investments in Keane 54,446 18 % 51,997 35% (20,651) (7%) Foreign exchange (gain)/loss (5,377 ) (2 %) (1,231) (1%) 399 -% (Loss)/profit before income tax (29,966 ) (10 %) (44,215) (30%) 24,163 9% Income tax expense / (recovery) (1,554 ) (1 %) 4,637 3% 10,161 4% (Loss)/profit from continuing operations ($ 28,412) (9 %) ($48,852) (33%) $14,002 5% Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 54,850 18 % $26,030 17% $46,990 17% Total job count 1 3,943 3,554 2,909 Revenue per job 1 77,247 41,601 96,354 Total proppant pumped (tonnes) 1 484,000 235,000 397,000 1 Certain financial measures in this news release – namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA percentage and working capital are not prescribed by IFRS and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and should not be viewed as a substitute for measures reported under IFRS. These financial measures are reconciled to IFRS measures in the Non-GAAP Disclosures section of this news release. Other non-standard measures and common industry terms are also described in the Non-Standard Measures section of the this news release.\nNON-GAAP DISCLOSURE\nCertain terms in this news release, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA percentage and working capital, do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS and, therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. This news release does not discuss previously used non-GAAP measures Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income. The non-GAAP measures used in this news release, combined with IFRS measures, are currently the most appropriate measures for reviewing and understanding the Company’s financial results.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP term and has been reconciled to profit / (loss) for the financial periods, being the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Management relies on adjusted EBITDA to better translate historical variability in our principal business activities into future forecasts. By isolating incremental items from net income, including income / expense items related to how the Company chooses to manage financing elements of the business, management can better predict future financial results from our principal business activities. The items included in this calculation have been specifically identified as they are either non-cash in nature, subject to significant volatility between periods, and / or not relevant to our principle business activities. Items adjusted in the non-GAAP calculation of adjusted EBITDA, are as follows:\nnon-cash expenditures, including depreciation, amortization, and impairment expenses; and equity-settled stock based compensation; consideration as to how we chose to generate financial income and incur financial expenses, including foreign exchange expenses, and gains/losses on Investments in Keane; taxation in various jurisdictions; transaction costs, as this cost is subject to significant volatility between periods and is dependent on the Company making significant acquisitions and divestitures which may be less reflective, and/or useful in segregating, for the purposes of evaluating the Company’s ongoing financial results; Costs resulting for payment of the legal claims made against the Company as they can give rise to significant volatility between periods that are less likely to correlate with changes in the Company’s activity levels; and Costs that result from the significant changes in employee levels. This is particularly prevalent from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 due to the decrease in the employee count from 6,741 employees on January 1, 2015 to 2,067 employees on December 31, 2017.\n($ thousands; unaudited) Three months ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Profit/ (loss) from continuing operations (IFRS financial measure) ($ 28,412) ($48,852) $14,002 Adjustments: Cost of sales - depreciation and amortization 29,729 14,366 31,330 Administrative expenses - depreciation 814 888 371 Income tax expense/(recovery) (1,554 ) 4,637 10,161 Loss/(gain) on Investments in Keane 54,446 51,997 (20,651) Finance loss/(income) - (926) (13) Finance costs 2,771 3,728 4,212 Asset impairment - 11 6,512 Foreign exchange (gain)/loss (5,377 ) (1,231) 399 Other expense/(income) 357 (1,935) (2,148) Administrative expenses - transaction costs - 1,862 747 Administrative expenses - amortization of debt issuance costs 683 652 677 Administrative expenses - equity-settled share-based compensation 1,393 843 1,365 Adjusted EBITDA $ 54,850 $26,030 $46,990 Adjusted EBITDA %\nAdjusted EBITDA % is determined by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue from continuing operations. The components of the calculation are presented below:\n($ thousands; unaudited) Three months ended March 31,\n2018 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 Adjusted EBITDA $ 54,850 $26,030 $46,990 Revenue $ 306,719 $149,403 $280,495 Adjusted EBITDA % 18% 17% 17% Working Capital\nWorking capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities, excluding cash and current portion of loans and borrowings. Management believes working capital is a useful supplemental measure as it aligns items that are adjustments to operating activities in the statement of cash flows which aids users in understanding changes in cash flows from operating activities. By calculating working capital, and changes in working capital, the Company is able to better monitor its ability to meet its short term obligations.\n($ thousands; unaudited) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 Current assets $ 339,769 $292,082 Less: cash and cash equivalents (4,565 ) (12,739) Current liabilities (143,615 ) (150,942) Less: current portion of loans and borrowings 20,976 20,408 Working capital $ 212,565 $148,809 Other Non-Standard Financial Terms\nIn addition to the above non-GAAP financial measures, this news release makes reference to the following non-standard financial terms. These terms may differ and may not be comparable from similar terms used by other companies.\nTransaction costs\nTransaction costs and/or Trican acquisition costs are costs incurred to complete a transaction in subsequent integration, including costs to assist in evaluating and completing the acquisition of Canyon, including legal, advisory, accounting related fees, and severance costs that directly relate to the transaction.\nRevenue per job\nCalculation is determined based on total revenue from continuing operations divided by total job count. This calculation may fluctuate based on both pricing, sales mix and method with which the customer requests its invoices.\nCommon Industry Terms\nCommon Business Terms :\nAECO The CDN$ Alberta natural gas price traded on the Natural Gas Exchange. The price is generally Quote: d per thousand cubic feet of natural gas (MCF). WTI The US$ Quote: d price on the New York Stock Exchange for West Texas Intermediate crude oil is a trading classification of crude oil and a benchmark in oil prices. The price is generally Quote: d per barrel (bbl). Rig count The estimated average number of drilling rigs operating in the WCSB at a specified time reported in this news release as annual and quarterly averages, sourced from Nickles Daily Oil Bulletin. Spring break-up In the WCSB during the spring season, provincial governments and rural municipalities (or counties) ban heavy equipment from roads to prevent damage. It becomes difficult, and in some cases impossible, to continue to work during this period and therefore activity in the oilfield is often reduced. High snowfall levels High snowfall levels are measured by comparing November through April snow fall levels in Grande Prairie compared to the average for that time frame ( source: Data compiled by management from information included on The Weather Network, shows snow levels approximately 20% above historical average) . The ultimate effect of the high seasonal snowfall levels on Q2 activity levels will be dependent on a number of incremental factors which cannot be predicted as of the date of this news release. Fluid end Hydraulic fracturing pumpers have a multiplex pump that pressurizes fracturing fluid for transfer down the wellbore. The multiplex pump consists of a power end and a fluid end. The power end houses a crankshaft that is connected to a spacer block that contains connecting rods that drive the individual plungers contained in the fluid end. The abrasive sand and fluid mixture is pumped through the fluid end at pressures of up to 15,000 pound-force per square inch (PSI), or 103 megapascals (MPA), which will cause wear on the fluid end. It is a modular unit that can be replaced independent of the power end and spacer block.\nAs a result of the change in estimated useful life, effective December 2017, fluid ends were no longer capitalized to property plant and equipment or expensed as cost of sales - depreciation. Expenses related to fluid ends are now expensed as part of cost of sales – other. Company Specific Industry Terms: Proppant A solid material, typically sand, treated sand or man-made ceramic materials, designed to keep an induced hydraulic fracture open during and following a fracturing treatment. Total Proppant Pumped The Company uses this as one measure of activity levels of hydraulic fracturing activity. The correlation of proppant pumped to Pressure Pumping activity may vary in the future depending upon changes in fracturing intensity, weight of proppant used, and job mix. Internally Sourced Proppant Pumped Certain of the Company’s customers purchase proppant directly from third party suppliers. As the Company does not generate revenue from selling proppant to these customers, this metric assists in evaluating changing job mix with changing revenue levels. Total Job count A job is essentially represented by an invoice. The frequency of invoices may differ as to how often the customer requests to be billed during a project. Additionally, the size and scope of a job can impact the length of time and cost on a job. Therefore, a job can vary greatly in time and expense. HHP Hydraulic horse power which is generally the measure of an individual hydraulic fracturing pump and a company’s hydraulic fracturing fleet size. Hydraulic Pumping Capacity Refers to the total available HHP in the Trican hydraulic fracturing fleet. The figures are presented in both the average available during the given period and the HHP available at the end of a specified period. Active crewed HHP Represents the total HHP that Trican has been activated or is currently operating. This figure is presented as at the end of a specified period. Active, maintenance/not crewed HHP This is fracturing equipment that is in the periodic maintenance cycle, which includes equipment that has completed a routine maintenance period and is ready for work, but no available crew is available to operate the equipment. Parked HHP Fracturing equipment that is not included in the Active Crewed HHP category or the Active, Maintenance/not crewed HHP category and would require minimal reactivation costs to move into the Active Crewed HHP category. Period average active, crewed HHP Fracturing equipment that has, on average, been active and crewed for the period. Growth capital Capital expenditures primarily for items that will expand our revenue and/or reduce our expenditures through operating efficiencies. Maintenance capital Capital expenditures primarily for the replacement or refurbishment of worn out equipment. Infrastructure capital Capital expenditures primarily for the improvement of operational and base infrastructure.
