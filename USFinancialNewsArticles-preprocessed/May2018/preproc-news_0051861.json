    "text": "2:58 PM EDT\nThe Northern Hemisphere could see up to four major hurricanes during the 2018 season, experts are predicting.\nThe 2018 Atlantic hurricane season begins on June 1, peaks from August to October, and extends to November 30.\nThere’s a 35% chance that this hurricane season will be above normal, a 40% chance for a near-normal season, and a 25% chance for a below-normal season, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) , which released its forecast for the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season on Thursday.\nOverall, NOAA predicts that there will be 10-16 named storms, of which 5-9 could become hurricanes, and 1-4 of those could be major hurricanes. JUST IN: Atlantic #HurricaneSeason Outlook 2018 — 70% likelihood of 10-16 named storms of which 5-9 could become hurricanes, including 1-4 major #hurricanes https://t.co/yXpag4nQ2R pic.twitter.com/lgzoVaxDK4\n— NOAA (@NOAA) May 24, 2018\nFor 2017, NOAA forecasted “a 70 percent likelihood of 11 to 17 named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), of which 5 to 9 could become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 2 to 4 major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5; winds of 111 mph or higher).”\nThis was close to reality : There were 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, of which 6 were a category three or higher, during the 2017 hurricane season.

Here are the names for 2018 Atlantic #TropicalCyclones , per the World Meteorological Organization, @WMO : https://t.co/yXpag4nQ2R pic.twitter.com/AAmb8oL6Vn\n— NOAA (@NOAA) May 24, 2018\nFEMA officials were already warning Americans to prepare.\n“It only takes one storm to devastate a community so now is the time to prepare,” acting FEMA Deputy Administrator Daniel Kaniewski said in a statement. “Do you have adequate insurance, including flood insurance? Does your family have a communication and evacuation plan? Stay tuned to your local news and download the FEMA app to get alerts, and make sure you heed any warnings issued by local officials.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT",
