    "text": "BOTHELL, Wash., May 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BioLife Solutions , Inc. (NASDAQ: BLFS), the leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of proprietary clinical-grade biopreservation media, (\"BioLife\" or the \"Company\"), today announced it has redeemed 25% of the 4,250 shares of Series A Redeemable Preferred stock outstanding for $1,063,000. There are 3,187 Series A shares remaining for future redemption, with a value of $1,000 per share.\nThe Series A shares were issued to WAVI Holdings AG, the Company's largest shareholder, in June 2017 in exchange for a previously issued promissory note.\nRoderick de Greef, BioLife Solutions' CFO commented, \"With cash proceeds of $5.7 million from the exercise of common stock warrants since April 1 st , combined with $7 million in cash at March 31 st , we believe it is prudent management of our capital structure to redeem a portion of the Series A shares earlier than planned. This redemption will save the Company $106,000 per year in cash dividend payments. We intend to make future redemptions as our cash flow and cash balance warrant.\"\nAbout BioLife Solutions\nBioLife Solutions is the leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of proprietary, clinical-grade biopreservation media for cells and tissues.
