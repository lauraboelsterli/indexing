(\"Spin Master\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: TOY; www.spinmaster.com ), a leading global children's entertainment company, today announced its financial results for the first 2018. The Company's full Management's Discussion and Analysis and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 are available on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ) and posted on the Company's web site at www.spinmaster.com/financial-info.php .\n\"Spin Master delivered very strong Q1 2018 financial results characterized by record revenue and profitability,\" said Ronnen Harary, Spin Master's Chairman and Co-CEO. \"Our results not only reflect our innovative products and brands resonating with consumers but they are also a testament to the team's effort in effectively managing the business through the industry-wide disruption caused by the Toys\"R\"Us U.S. liquidation. Our entertainment properties continue to be major drivers of growth and we have some exciting new themes, formats and content to introduce in 2018 and 2019. We are particularly pleased to have closed the Gund acquisition, and are looking forward to driving Gund's global growth potential as well as leveraging its plush expertize in Spin Master's business.\"\nQ1 2018 Financial Highlights as compared to the same period in 2017 2\nRevenue of US$285.7 million increased 25.5% from US$227.7 million. In Constant Currency 1 terms, revenue increased by 23.5%. Gross Product Sales 1 increased 25.7% to US$288.0 million, compared to US$229.1 million, driven by sales of Hatchimals, Luvabella and the games portfolio including Cardinal, which more than offset declines in Air Hogs and Zoomer. Gross Product Sales 1 increased 19.5% in North America, 33.4% in Europe and 49.8% in the Rest of World. International Gross Product Sales 1 on a combined basis were 35.9% of total Gross Product Sales 1 , increasing from 32.5% in Q1 2017. Other Revenue, which primarily reflects merchandising royalty and television distribution income from products marketed by third parties using Spin Master's owned intellectual property, as well as app revenue from Toca Boca and Sago Mini, was US$29.8 million compared to US$20.5 million. Gross profit increased 31.3% to US$148.8 million, representing 52.1% of revenue, compared with US$113.3 million, or 49.8% of revenue in Q1 2017. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by the positive impact of foreign exchange and higher Other Revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\"), excluding share-based compensation expenses associated with equity participation agreements and the grants of restricted share units to employees at the initial public offering, represented 46.7% of revenue compared to 41.6%. Product development, selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased compared to Q1 2017, offset by increased marketing costs and the bad debt expense related to the Toys\"R\"Us U.S. bankruptcy. Excluding the Toys\"R\"Us bad debt expense, SG&A represented 42.1% of revenue. Net income was US$8.7 million, or US$0.09 per share, compared with US$10.1 million, or US$0.10 per share in Q1 2017. Net Income was reduced by the impact of the Toys\"R\"Us bad debt expense referred to above. Adjusted Net Income 1 was US$22.0 million, or US$0.22 per share, compared to US$13.6 million, or US$0.13 per share in Q1 2017. Adjusted EBITDA 1 was US$43.3 million compared with US$30.8 million in Q1 2017. Adjusted EBITDA Margin 1 increased to 15.1% compared to 13.5% . The increase was largely driven by higher gross margins. Free Cash Flow 1 was US$(28.3) million compared to US$5.0 million in Q1 2017 primarily due to lower cash flow from operating activities and increased capital expenditures. On March 5, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets relating to the Gund line of business from Enesco LLC for approximately $76.0 million net of closing adjustments. The purchase price was financed from internally generated cash resources and the Company's credit facility. The transaction closed on April 2, 2018. Gund will be included in the Activities, Games & Puzzles and Fun Furniture business segment. On March 15, 2018, Toys\"R\"Us, Inc. filed a motion seeking U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval to begin the process of conducting a wind-down of its U.S. business and liquidation of inventory in all of its U.S. stores. In addition, Toys\"R\"Us International closed and liquidated most of its UK business during the first quarter of 2018. As a result, the Company recorded a bad debt expense of $15.2 million, which is included in administrative expenses.\n\"Despite current industry volatility caused by Toys\"R\"Us, we remain focused on the execution of our key growth strategies as we navigate the shifting retail landscape,\" said Ben Gadbois, Spin Master's President & COO. \"Operational efficiencies and our disciplined approached to retail inventories continue to be fundamental to our positive financial results. Our market-leading innovation is attracting the attention of existing and new retailers looking to expand their presence in the toy space. We are experiencing very strong growth in many of our international markets with exceptional performance in established markets such as Mexico and Germany and from our most recent direct sales markets in Australia, China and Central Eastern Europe. We are now hard at work integrating Gund, ensuring we build a strong platform for our future success.\"\nQ1 2018 Gross Product Sales by Business Segment (US$ millions)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\n% Change\nActivities, Games & Puzzles and Fun Furniture\n$57.6\n$48.0\n20.0%\nRemote Control and Interactive Characters\n$91.1\n$46.5\n95.9%\nBoys Action and High-Tech Construction\n$16.7\n$13.2\n27.1%\nPre-School and Girls\n$82.6\n$84.7\n(2.5)%\nOutdoor\n$40.0\n$36.7\n8.9%\nGross Product Sales 1\n$288.0\n$229.1\n25.7%\nOther Revenue\n$29.8\n$20.5\n45.5%\nSales Allowances 1\n$32.1\n$21.9\n47.2%\nRevenue\n$285.7\n$227.7\n25.5%\nQ1 2018 Business Segment Gross Product Sales 1 as compared to the same period in 2017\nGross Product Sales 1 in the Activities, Games & Puzzles and Fun Furniture segment increased 20.0% in Q1, primarily driven by sales of the Cool Maker branded products, Kinetic Sand, and the Games portfolio, which includes Cardinal, offset by decreases in Rube Goldberg, Bunchems and Build-A-Bear products. Gross Product Sales 1 in the Remote Control and Interactive Characters segment increased 95.9% in Q1, primarily due to sales of Hatchimals Colleggtibles and Luvabella, offsetting a decline in Air Hogs and Zoomer. Gross Product Sales 1 in the Boys Action and High-Tech Construction segment increased 27.1% in Q1, primarily due to increased in sales of Tech Deck as well as Flush Force, offset by decreased sales of Minecraft and Pirates of the Caribbean licensed products. Gross Product Sales 1 in the Pre-School and Girls segment decreased 2.5% in Q1, from higher sales of PAW Patrol more than offset by lower sales of Teletubbies and Power Puff Girls licensed products. Gross Product Sales 1 in the Outdoor segment increased 8.9% in Q1.\nOutlook\nFor the full year 2018, organic Gross Product Sales 1 are now expected to grow in the mid-single digit range relative to 2017 as compared to the mid-to-high single digit growth rate announced in connection with the release of Q4 2017 results in March 2018. Including Gund, Spin Master expects Gross Product Sales 1 growth in the mid to high single digit range compared to 2017. This growth is in line with the Company's long-term target of mid-to-high single digit growth. Seasonality of Gross Product Sales 1 for 2018 is expected to be approximately 31%-33% in H1 compared to the seasonality announced in March 2018 of 32%-35% in H1. The Toys\"R\"Us liquidation is expected to impact second quarter 2018 Gross Product Sales 1 , which results in a lower growth rate overall as well as less of a shift in Gross Product Sales 1 from the second half of 2018 to the first half than we had previously expected, prior to the liquidation. Adjusted EBITDA Margins 1 in 2018, both including and excluding Gund, are expected to be in line with prior guidance, which was for 2018 Adjusted EBITDA Margins 1 to increase by approximately 100 basis points over 2017. Adjusted EBITDA Margins 1 are calculated as a percentage of Revenue and not Gross Product Sales 1 .\nConference call\nRonnen Harary, Co-Chief Executive Officer, Ben Gadbois, Global President & Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Segal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will host a conference call to discuss Q1 2018 results on Wednesday May 9, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. EST.\nThe call-in numbers for participants are (647) 427-7450 or (888) 231-8191. A live webcast of the call will be accessible via Spin Master's website at: http://www.spinmaster.com/events.php . Following the call, both an audio recording and transcript of the call will be archived on the same website page and will be available indefinitely.\nAbout Spin Master\nSpin Master (TSX:TOY; www.spinmaster.com ) is a leading global children's entertainment company that creates, designs, manufactures, licenses and markets a diversified portfolio of innovative toys, games, products and entertainment properties.

Non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA (i.e., net earnings before borrowing costs, taxes and depreciation and amortization) excluding one time or other non-recurring items that do not necessarily reflect the Company's underlying financial performance, including share based compensation expenses, foreign exchange gains or losses, restructuring costs, public offering costs and write downs, among other items. Adjusted EBITDA is used internally as the key benchmark for incentive compensation and by management as a measure of the Company's profitability.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA Margin to evaluate the Company's performance compared to internal targets and to benchmark its performance against key competitors.\nAdjusted Net Income is calculated as net income excluding one time or other items that do not necessarily reflect the Company's underlying financial performance including foreign exchange gains or losses, restructuring costs, the accounting effect of the phantom equity expense and write downs, among other items and the corresponding impact these items have on income tax expense. Management uses Adjusted Net Income to understand the underlying financial performance of the business on a consistent basis over time.\nConstant Currency represents Revenue and Gross Product Sales results that are presented excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The current period and prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the US dollar are translated using consistent exchange rates, rather than using the actual exchange rate in effect during the respective periods. The difference between the current period and prior period results using the consistent exchange rates reflects the changes in the underlying performance results, excluding the impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nFree Cash Flow is calculated as cash flows provided by/used in operating activities before changes in net working capital and after cash flows used in investing activities before cash used in license, brand and business acquisitions. Management uses the Free Cash Flow metric to analyze the cash flow being generated by the Company's business.\nGross Product Sales represent sales of the Company's products to customers, excluding the impact of marketing, incentive and Sales Allowance adjustments. Changes in Gross Product Sales are discussed because, while Spin Master records the details of such Sales Allowances (in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale in order to calculate revenue, such Sales Allowances are generally not associated with individual products, making revenue less meaningful when comparing its product category and geographical segment results to highlight trends in Spin Master's business. For a reconciliation of Gross Product Sales to Revenue, please see the table \"Q1 2018 Gross Product Sales by Business Segment\" in this press release.\nSales Allowances represent marketing and sales credits requested by customers relating to factors such as co-operative advertising, contractual discounts, negotiated discounts, customer audits, volume rebates, defective products, and costs incurred by customers to sell the Company's products and are booked as a reduction to Gross Product Sales. Management uses Sales Allowances to identify and compare the cost of doing business with individual retailers, different geographic markets and amongst various distribution channels.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Free Cash Flow and Gross Product Sales are important supplemental measures of operating performance and highlight trends in the core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Free Cash Flow, Gross Product Sales and Sales Allowances allow for assessment of the Company's operating performance and financial condition on a basis that is more consistent and comparable between reporting periods. The Company believes that lenders, securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use these non-IFRS financial measures in the evaluation of issuers.\nThe following tables presents a reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, and Cash provided by Operations to Free Cash Flow for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
