    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 12:49 AM / Updated 24 minutes ago Fears over growth, U.S.-China trade prompt equities sell-off Laila Kearney 4 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks sold off while investors raced for the safety of the Japanese yen and some government bonds on Wednesday as concerns rose that setbacks to U.S.-China trade talks would undermine world economic growth. People walk past an electronic board showing exchange rate between Japanese Yen and U.S. Dollar outside a brokerage at a business district in Tokyo, Japan August 9, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\nU.S. President Donald Trump said trade discussions with China would need to be rerouted, saying the current track appeared “too hard to get done” and any agreement reached between the world’s two largest economies needed “a different structure.”\nThe remarks came a day after Trump said he was not pleased with U.S.-China talks, reversing a rally pegged to the White House’s optimistic comments about the discussions over the weekend that led to a strong rally on Monday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 107.45 points, or 0.43 percent, to 24,726.96, the S&P 500 lost 8.16 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,716.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.66 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,366.80.\nTrump also floated plans to fine China’s ZTE Corp and cast doubt on a planned June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nFears over the further dampening of U.S. relations with China and North Korea weighed on equities, and the Federal Reserve’s May meeting minutes due for release on Wednesday were also giving investors pause, analysts said.\n“A combination of the Fed and the trade worries will make today a rocky session,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.\nThe minutes, which could indicate the number of rate hikes likely this year, are expected to show the Fed taking a more hawkish tone, Cardillo said.\nBroad risk aversion hurt the dollar against the Japanese yen. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.75 percent at 110.08 per dollar.\nBut the greenback managed to rise to a six-month high against the euro on data indicating a slowdown in European business activity.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.17 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.67 percent.\nAnother reason for the euro’s woes is Italy, where an incoming coalition government comprised of the two anti-establishment parties - the League and 5-Star - looks likely to implement big-spending policies.\nThat could add to the country’s big debt pile and see Rome clash with the European Union.\nItalian bonds fell in value, reversing the modest gains seen on Tuesday and 10-year yields rose 11 basis points (bps) to a new 14-month high. The premium investors demand to hold Italian debt versus safer German bonds rose sharply to 192 bps.\nInvestors were also eyeing Turkey, which is seemingly headed for a full-blown economic crisis as the Turkish lira plunged to record lows.\nElsewhere, oil fell after an unexpected build in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories despite strong demand, and as traders weighed the possibility of an increase in OPEC crude output to cover any shortfalls in supply from Iran and Venezuela.\nU.S. crude fell 0.98 percent to $71.49 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.89, down 0.85 percent on the day.
