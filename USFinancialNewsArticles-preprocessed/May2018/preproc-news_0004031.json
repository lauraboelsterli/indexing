    "text": "Declares Quarterly Dividend\nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc. (\"USPH\" or the “Company”) (NYSE: USPH), a national operator of outpatient physical therapy clinics, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, USPH’s Operating Results increased 10.6% to $7.1 million, or $.56 per diluted share, as compared to $6.4 million, or $.51 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Operating Results, a non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”) measure, for the 2018 first quarter equals net income attributable to USPH shareholders. For the 2017 first quarter, Operating Results, is defined as net income attributable to common shareholders prior to interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests – change in redemption value, net of tax.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, USPH’s net income attributable to its shareholders, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), was $7.1 million as compared to $4.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. Earnings per diluted share of $0.27 in the first quarter of 2018 compares to $0.38 per diluted share for the 2017 first quarter. For 2018, in accordance with current accounting guidance, the revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest, net of tax, which is charged directly to retained earnings, is included in the earnings per basic and diluted share calculation. See the schedule on page 11 for a computation of diluted earnings per share and a reconciliation of net income attributable to USPH shareholders to Operating Results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017\nNet revenues increased $10.8 million or 11.0% from $97.6 million in the 2017 first quarter to $108.3 million in the 2018 first quarter, primarily due to a 7.4% increase in net patient revenues from the physical therapy operations, an increase of 20.4% in revenue from management contracts and an increase in the revenue from the industrial injury prevention business due to a full quarter of operations versus one month in the 2017 period. The industrial injury prevention business was acquired in March 2017. Net patient revenues from physical therapy operations increased approximately $6.9 million, or 7.4%, to $100.6 million in the 2018 first quarter from $93.7 million in the 2017 first quarter due to an increase in total patient visits of 7.2% from 892,000 to 956,000 and an increase in the average net patient revenue per visit to $105.15 from $105.04. Of the $6.9 million increase, $5.9 million related to clinics opened or acquired after March 31, 2017 (“New Clinics”) and an increase of $1.0 million in net patient revenues related to clinics opened or acquired prior to April 1, 2017 (“Mature Clinics”). Revenue from management contracts was $2.2 million in the 2018 first quarter as compared to $1.9 million for the 2017 first quarter. The revenue from the industrial injury prevention business was $4.9 million for the 2018 first quarter compared to $1.5 million in the 2017 first quarter. Other revenue was $0.7 million in the 2018 first quarter and $0.5 million in the 2017 period. Total operating costs were $85.1 million, or 78.6% of net revenues, in the 2018 first quarter as compared to $76.8 million, or 78.7% of net revenues, in the 2017 first quarter. The $8.3 million increase was attributable to $5.5 million in operating costs related to New Clinics, an increase of $2.8 million related to the industrial injury prevention business due to a full quarter of operations and an increase of $0.3 million related to management contracts while costs of Mature Clinics were reduced by $0.3 million. Total salaries and related costs, including those from New Clinics, were 57.5% of net revenue in the recent quarter versus 57.2% for the 2017 first quarter. Rent, supplies, contract labor and other costs as a percentage of net revenue were 20.1% for the recent quarter versus 20.6% for the 2017 first quarter. The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue was 1.0% for the 2018 first quarter as compared to 0.9% in the 2017 first quarter. The gross profit for the 2018 first quarter grew by $2.5 million, or 11.9%, to $23.2 million, as compared to $20.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The gross profit percentage was 21.4% of net revenue in the recent period as compared to 21.3% for the 2017 first quarter. The gross profit percentage for the Company’s physical therapy clinics was 21.9% in the recent quarter as compared to 21.5% in the 2017 first quarter. The gross profit percentage on management contracts was 13.8% in the 2018 first quarter as compared to 14.8% in the 2017 first quarter. The gross profit percentage for the industrial injury prevention business was 15.8% for the recent quarter as compared to 14.3% for the one month of operation in the 2017 period. Corporate office costs were $10.2 million in the 2018 first quarter compared to $8.5 million in the 2017 first quarter. Corporate office costs were 9.4% of net revenues for the 2018 first quarter compared to 8.8% for the 2017 first quarter. Operating income for the recent quarter increased 7.0% to $13.1 million as compared to $12.2 million in the 2017 first quarter. The Company no longer has mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest. See discussion following – Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests. Interest expense – debt and other was $0.6 million in the 2018 first quarter and $0.4 million in the 2017 first quarter. The provision for income tax for the 2018 first quarter was $2.5 million and for the 2017 first quarter was $1.8 million both of which are inclusive of the reduction of $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the excess tax benefit, which is a component of the provision for income taxes, related to equity compensation. The provision for income tax as a percentage of income before taxes less net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 25.8% and 27.3%, respectively, for the 2018 and 2017 first quarters. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (permanent equity) was $1.2 million in the 2018 first quarter as compared to $1.2 million in the 2017 first quarter. Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests (temporary equity) was $1.7 million in the 2018 first quarter. Same store revenues for de novo and acquired clinics open for one year or more increased 1.9%. Visits increased 1.4% for de novo and acquired clinics open for one year or more and the same store net rate increased by approximately 0.5%.\nOther Financial Measures\nFor the first quarter of 2018 the Company's Adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.8% to $14.0 million from $13.3 million in the comparable 2017 quarter. See definition and explanation of Adjusted EBITDA in the schedule on pages 10 and 11.\nManagement’s Comments\nChris Reading, Chief Executive Officer, said, “We built a good, sturdy foundation this first quarter to start off the year on solid footing. Our core physical therapy business as well as our industrial injury prevention initiatives are growing and realizing margin expansion despite the extreme weather experienced in the first part of the year. Our leadership and operations team additions are working well and their impact should increase as the year progresses. Finally, we are excited about our newest acquisition within our industrial injury prevention business and the opportunities we are seeing to continue to grow and scale that part of our service offering.”\nLarry McAfee, Chief Financial Officer, noted, “The Company’s net cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2018 was strong as evidenced by the $12.7 million or 21% reduction in debt as compared to year-end 2017.”\nRedeemable Non-Controlling Interests\nEffective December 31, 2017, the Company entered into amendments to its acquired limited partnership agreements replacing the mandatory redemption feature. No monetary consideration was paid to the partners to amend the agreements. The amended Partnership Agreements provide that, upon certain events, the Company has a call right (the “Call Right”) and the selling entity has a put right (the “Put Right”) for the purchase and sale of the limited partnership interest held by the partner. Once the terms are triggered, the Put Right and the Call Right do not expire, even upon an individual partner’s death, and contain no mandatory redemption feature. The purchase price of the partner’s limited partnership interest upon the exercise of either the Put Right or the Call Right is calculated per the original terms of the respective agreements. The Company accounted for the amendment of its Partnership Agreements as an extinguishment of the outstanding Seller Entity Interests classified as liabilities through the issuance of new Seller Entity Interests classified in temporary equity. Pursuant to ASC 470-50-40-2, the Company removed the outstanding liability-classified Seller Entity Interests at their carrying amounts and recognized the new temporary-equity-classified Seller Entity Interests at their fair value. In summary, the redemption values of the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest (previously classified as liabilities) were reclassified as redeemable non-controlling interest (temporary equity) on the December 31, 2017 consolidated balance sheet. For 2018, in accordance with current accounting guidance, the revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest, net of tax, will be charged directly to retained earnings and will be included in the earnings per basic and diluted share calculation.\nU.S. Physical Therapy Declares Quarterly Dividend\nThe second quarterly dividend for 2018 of $0.23 per share will be paid on June 8, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2018. U.S. Physical Therapy began paying quarterly dividends in 2011 and has increased the dividend amount every year since.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nU.S. Physical Therapy's Management will host a conference call at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time, 9:30 a.m. Central Time, on May 3, 2018 to discuss the Company's Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 results.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOPERATING RESULTS AND ADJUSTED EBITDA\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\n(unaudited)\nThe following tables provide a detail of the diluted earnings per share computation and reconcile net income attributable to USPH shareholders calculated in accordance with GAAP to Operating Results and Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes providing Operating Results and Adjusted EBITDA to investors is useful information for comparing the Company's period-to-period results.\nFor 2018, Operating Results equal net income attributable to USPH shareholders and, in accordance with current accounting guidance, the revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest, net of tax, charged directly to retained earnings is included in the earnings per diluted share calculation. For the 2017 first quarter, Operating Results, a non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”) measure, is defined as net income attributable to common shareholders prior to interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests – change in redemption value, net of tax. Operating Results for the two periods are comparable, however, the calculations differ. Management uses Operating Results, which eliminates this current non-cash item that can be subject to volatility and unusual costs, as one of the principal measures to evaluate and monitor financial performance period over period. Management believes that Operating Results is useful information for investors to use in comparing the Company's period-to-period results as well as for comparing with other similar businesses since most do not have mandatorily redeemable instruments and therefore have different liability and equity structures.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest income, interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests – change in redemption value, interest expense – debt and other, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity-based awards compensation expense. Management believes reporting Adjusted EBITDA is useful information for investors in comparing the Company’s period-to-period results as well as comparing with similar businesses which report adjusted EBITDA as defined by their company.\nOperating Results and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income attributable to USPH shareholders presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Computation of earnings per share - USPH shareholders Net income attributable to USPH shareholders $ 7,117 $ 4,816 Charges to retained earnings: Revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest $ (5,081 ) $ - Tax effect at statutory rate (federal and state) of 26.25% 1,334 - $ 3,370 $ 4,816 Basic and diluted per share $ 0.27 $ 0.38 Adjustments: Interest expense MRNCI * - change in redemption value - 2,669 Revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest 5,081 - Tax effect at statutory rate (federal and state) of 26.25% and 39.25%, respectively (1,334 ) (1,048 ) Operating results $ 7,117 $ 6,437 Basic and diluted operating results per share $ 0.56 $ 0.51 Shares used in computation - basic and diluted 12,616 12,528 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to USPH shareholders $ 7,117 $ 4,816 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 2,468 2,356 Interest income (32 ) (24 ) Interest expense MRNCI * - change in redemption value - 2,669 Interest expense - debt and other 553 415 Provision for income taxes 2,476 1,812 Equity-based awards compensation expense 1,381 1,280 Adjusted EBITDA $ 13,963 $ 13,324 * Mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest\nU.S. PHYSICAL THERAPY, INC.
