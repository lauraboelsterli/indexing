    "text": "- Continued execution and achievement of planned milestones across three wholly-owned clinical programs in rare endocrine diseases -\n- Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time -\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ascendis Pharma A/S (Nasdaq:ASND), a biopharmaceutical company that utilizes its innovative TransCon technology to address significant unmet medical needs, today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Our endocrinology pipeline is moving forward with strong momentum and three wholly-owned TransCon technology product candidates in the clinic. We continue to execute on our Phase 3 program for TransCon Growth Hormone in pediatric growth hormone deficiency (GHD), we have completed the phase 1 trial for TransCon PTH, and we recently initiated dosing of subjects with TransCon CNP in a phase 1 trial as planned,” said Jan Mikkelsen, Ascendis Pharma’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “With ongoing success advancing our broad pipeline, we are building out our commercial team with the hiring of Tom Larson as our Chief Commercial Officer. We are thrilled about the continued clinical validation of our TransCon technology and its potential application to other disease areas with unmet needs beyond endocrinology.”\nRecent Corporate Highlights\nContinued execution of the TransCon Growth Hormone (GH) phase 3 program, with the observed aggregate data from the heiGHt Trial continuing to demonstrate a safety profile consistent with the published safety profile of the active comparator, Genotropin. Completed the TransCon PTH phase 1 trial, and presented new data at the European Congress of Endocrinology. These data from the complete multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts continue to support the differentiated target product profile of TransCon PTH as a true parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism. Initiated dosing of healthy adult subjects in a phase 1 trial for TransCon CNP, a long-acting prodrug of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in development as a therapeutic option for achondroplasia and potentially for other fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-related skeletal disorders. Announced appointment of Thomas A. Larson as Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Larson brings 25 years of experience building and leading commercial organizations, as well as successfully launching products across the orphan drug and specialty markets. Ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of €348.4 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the first quarter, Ascendis Pharma reported a net loss of €41.4 million, or €1.07 per share (basic and diluted) compared to a net loss of €25.1 million, or €0.78 per share (basic and diluted) for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and development (R&D) costs for the quarter were €30.5 million compared to €20.6 million in the same quarter of 2017. Increased R&D costs in the 2018 quarter reflect costs for preparation of the manufacturing of validation batches for TransCon Growth Hormone, and increasing costs of the ongoing clinical trials for this product candidate, as well as costs of the ongoing clinical programs for TransCon PTH and TransCon CNP.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were €4.7 million compared to €3.3 million in the same quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher personnel costs.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of €348.4 million compared to €195.4 million as of December 31, 2017. This includes net proceeds to the company of $242.5 million, or approximately €196.8 million at the time from an underwritten public offering of 4,539,473 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) completed in February 2018. As of March 31, 2018, Ascendis had 41,523,765 ordinary shares outstanding.\nConference Call and Webcast information\nAscendis Pharma will host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results.
