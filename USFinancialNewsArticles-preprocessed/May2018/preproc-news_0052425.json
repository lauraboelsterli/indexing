    "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s presidential chief of staff Eliseu Padilha said on Thursday night that the government had reached a deal with protesting truckers to suspend for 15 days a nationwide strike that has paralyzed several vital sectors of Latin America’s biggest economy.\nPadilha was joined by representatives of several truckers’ groups in making the announcement, and said it was expected that truckers would start getting back to work and end blockades on key roadways within hours.\nPadilha confirmed that the government would begin a new pricing regime for diesel supplied by state-led Petroleo Brasileiro SA, with price changes taking place monthly instead of on a daily basis as they have for the past year.\nReporting by Lisandra Paraguassu; Writing by Brad Brooks; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
