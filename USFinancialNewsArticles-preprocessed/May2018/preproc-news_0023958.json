    "text": "HOUSTON, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EEP) (EEP or the Partnership) today reported first quarter 2018 financial results and provided a quarterly business update. EEP reported net income of $172 million, including net income from controlling interests of $74 million, for the first with earnings per limited partner unit of $0.15. The first quarter results included non-recurring special items of $44 million, which increased earnings per limited partner unit by $0.10.\nFIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nSolid quarter supported by strong Lakehead and North Dakota System volumes\nLine 3 Replacement Project construction well underway in Canada and complete in Wisconsin; Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) permit decisions expected in the second quarter of 2018; Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) confirms need for project but recommends alternative route\nAnnounced quarterly distribution of $0.35 per unit, or $1.40 on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018\nFirst quarter 2018 cash provided by operating activities of $322 million, compared with $234 million in the first quarter 2017. Distributable cash flow (DCF) was $212 million, compared with $198 million in the prior year quarter. EEP's coverage ratio was 1.30x as declared in the first quarter 2018 and 1.24x as declared in the first quarter 2017.\nFor the quarter, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $430 million, compared with $414 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income from controlling interests was $118 million for the quarter, or $0.25 earnings per limited partner unit, compared with $69 million, or $0.16 earnings per limited partner unit in the prior year quarter. Net income from controlling interests was $74 million for the quarter, or $0.15 earnings per limited partner unit, compared with $65 million, or $0.15 earnings per limited partner unit in the prior year quarter.\nPRESIDENT'S COMMENT\n\"First quarter 2018 results are solid and in line with our expectations,\" commented Mark Maki, President of the Partnership. \"Volumes remained strong on both the Lakehead and North Dakota Systems as we continue to focus on maximizing throughput and operating efficiencies as a means to enhance unitholder value.\n\"Turning to significant events since last quarter, the Partnership has been materially affected by the complete shift in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) long-standing policy on income tax allowances for Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). The Partnership has taken action to request reconsideration by FERC on this new policy with an objective to see the restoration of the income tax allowance for MLPs. At the same time, we are evaluating options within our control to mitigate the negative impact of the policy change for EEP. \"\nFERC ACTIONS\nIn March, the FERC changed its long-standing policy on the treatment of income tax amounts included in the rates of pipelines and other entities subject to cost of service rate regulation within a MLP. FERC revised a policy in place since 2005 to no longer permit entities organized as MLPs to recover an income tax allowance in their cost of service rates. The change in FERC's policy has had a negative impact on the MLP sector. EEP, along with other MLPs and trade associations, filed comments to request clarification, reconsideration and rehearing of FERC's Revised Policy Statement in April and expects to file comments in response to the Notice of Inquiry later this month.\nAs previously disclosed, the 2018 financial impact to EEP from the combination of US Tax Reform and FERC policy actions is expected to be a $125 million reduction to distributable cash flow (DCF), net of noncontrolling interests, and exclusive of a payback of accumulated deferred income taxes. While many uncertainties remain in regard to the implementation of the recent FERC actions, we continue to evaluate options to mitigate the negative impact of this policy change.\nPROJECT EXECUTION\nThe U.S. Line 3 Replacement Program (U.S. L3R Program), along with the Canadian Line 3 Replacement Program, will support the safety and operational reliability of the mainline system, enhance system flexibility, and allow EEP to optimize throughput on the mainline.\nConstruction on the Wisconsin portion of the U.S. L3R Program commenced in late June 2017, was mechanically completed in February 2018, and is expected to be commissioned in May 2018.\nOn April 23, 2018, an ALJ issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Recommendation (the ALJ Report) to the MPUC in connection with the Partnership's applications for a Certificate and Route Permit. The ALJ recommended that the MPUC grant the Partnership's application for a Certificate, but only if the MPUC also selects a route that would require in-trench replacement of the existing Line 3, which is not the Partnership's preferred route. The ALJ's recommendation is not binding on the MPUC. The MPUC is expected to issue a ruling in the Certificate and Route Permit dockets late in the second quarter of 2018. EEP intends to continue its efforts to secure MPUC approval for its preferred route. On May 9, 2018, EEP filed its exceptions to the ALJ Report with the MPUC. EEP set out proposed revisions to the ALJ's summary of the evidentiary record, as well as its points of disagreement with the ALJ's conclusions and route recommendation.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nFor purposes of evaluating performance of the Partnership, the Partnership makes adjustments for unusual, non-recurring or non-operating factors to reported earnings, segment EBITDA, and cash flow provided by operating activities, as it allows Management and its investors to more accurately compare the Partnership's performance across periods and the factors being adjusted for are not indicative of the underlying performance and cash flows of the business. Schedules reconciling adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA by segment, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per common share and distributable cash flow to their closest GAAP equivalent are available as an Appendix to this news release.\nLiquids\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by $36 million over the comparable period in 2017 primarily due to the following items:\nHigher EBITDA from the Lakehead System resulting from the timing of operating expenses, and the net effect of recognizing the Return on Equity (ROE) component of revenue under-collection in 2017, partially offset by the lower tax rate pursuant to United States Tax Reform, which decreased revenue collected in our rates EBITDA from the Partnership's interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which was placed into service in June 2017 Higher EBITDA from the Mid-Continent System resulting from higher storage revenue and lower operating costs at the Cushing Storage Terminal, partially offset by lower transportation revenues due to the sale of the Ozark Pipeline on March 1, 2017\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA excludes a $35 million special item in relation to an impairment charge on the Partnership portion of Line 10, a component of the Lakehead System located in the state of New York, resulting from the classification as held for sale.\nOther\nOther primarily reflects the results of the Midcoast gas gathering and processing assets. This business was sold in the second quarter of 2017. Remaining amounts in Other represent unallocated corporate costs.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nThe Partnership will host a joint conference call and webcast at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (7 a.m. Mountain Time) on May 10, 2018, with Enbridge Inc. (TSX: ENB) (NYSE: ENB), Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. (TSX: ENF), and Spectra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: SEP) to provide an enterprise wide business update and review 2018 first quarter results.

The derivative non-cash losses and gains result from marking to market certain financial derivatives used by the Partnership for hedging purposes that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance as prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nAdjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measurement to manage the performance of the entity. Distributable cash flow is used as a supplemental financial measurement to assess liquidity and the ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and make cash distributions to unitholders. The following reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA and net cash provided by operating activities to distributable cash flow are provided because adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not financial measures recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nAPPENDIX A\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nEEP reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, as summarized in the tables below:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(unaudited;
