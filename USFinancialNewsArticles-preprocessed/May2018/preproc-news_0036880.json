Lithium is a major ingredient used in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.\nNutrien, which owns about 30 percent of SQM, plans to sell 20.2 million B shares of the company in the future.\nSQM’s U.S.-listed shares rose 1.44 percent to $59.00 in premarket trading on Thursday.\nReuters reported earlier this week that Tianqi and SQM were in talks for a deal.
