    "text": "May 30, 2018 / 4:24 PM / Updated 33 minutes ago Minnesota sues opioid manufacturer Insys over drug marketing Nate Raymond 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - The state of Minnesota on Wednesday sued Insys Therapeutics Inc, accusing the drugmaker of illegally marketing a powerful fentanyl-based pain medicine intended for cancer patients for other uses.\nThe lawsuit by Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson added to the drugmakerâ€™s legal woes as it seeks to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe into its promotion of the opioid product Subsys and fights similar lawsuits by other states.\nThe latest lawsuit, which was filed in Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis, comes as state attorneys general are increasingly seeking to hold drugmakers responsible for the national opioid epidemic.\nInsys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOpioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths nationwide in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSubsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients, contains fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine.\nFederal prosecutors in Boston have accused seven former executives and managers at Insys, including billionaire founder John Kapoor, of participating in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys and to defraud insurers into paying for it.\nProsecutors said Kapoor, former Insys Chief Executive Michael Babich and others schemed to bribe medical practitioners, using payments for sham speaker programs ostensibly meant to educate healthcare professionals about Subsys.\nThey have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled to face trial in January.
