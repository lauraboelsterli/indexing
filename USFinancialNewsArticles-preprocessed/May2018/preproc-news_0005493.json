    "text": "LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - The Chief Executive of British lender TSB, Paul Pester, will not receive a bonus that he was due and which was linked to the bank’s botched computer system migration, TSB’s chairman Richard Meddings told lawmakers on Wednesday.\nA systems migration at TSB over the weekend of April 21-22 left up to 1.9 million customers unable to access their accounts, with many complaining they could not pay vital bills.\nCustomers were still complaining on Wednesday, more than a week later.\nReporting By Emma Rumney and Lawrence White, editing by Silvia Aloisi\n ",
