    "text": "LONDON, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Condor Gold (AIM:CNR) (OTCQX:CNFGF) (TSX:COG) announces that it has today published its unaudited financial results for the three month period ending March 31, 2018 and the Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the same period.\nBoth of the above have been posted on the Company’s website www.condorgold.com and are also available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nHIGHLIGHTS\nSuccessful secondary listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange Amendment of Environmental and Social Impact Assessment involving a re-designed mine infrastructure to avoid resettlement was submitted to the Nicaraguan Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources applying for the Environmental Permit to construct and operate a 2,800tpd processing plant with capacity to produce 100,000 oz gold per annum. £2.5 million raised through a private placement Positive rock chip assay results and detailed geological mapping progress the plan to define a major gold district around La India Project Appointment of Andrew Cheatle as a director based in Canada with 30 years industry experience, strengthens the Board\nMark Child, Chairman and CEO, said, “This has been a very encouraging start to the year for the Company and we have made good progress in our permitting process and proving up a major Gold District. I am confident that the re-designed mine site infrastructure to avoid resettlement will facilitate the grant of the main permit. We are on track and have had encouraging meetings with key Ministries. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near future.”\nOn January 15, 2018 the Ordinary Shares of the Company commenced trading on the TSX. The Ordinary Shares of the Company remain listed on AIM and trade on the OTCQX.\nOn January 18, 2018 the Company announced Mr. Roger Davey’s retirement from the Company’s board of directors and the appointment of Mr. Andrew Cheatle.\nCondor announced, on February 26, 2018, that it had formally submitted a 130 page amendment to its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (“ ESIA ”) that, significantly, does not require the resettlement of approximately 330 houses occupied by 1,000 people to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in Nicaragua. The ESIA is part of an Environmental Permit (“ Environmental Permit ” or “ EP ”) application to permit and construct a processing plant with capacity to process up to 2,800 tonnes per day of mineral ore.\nOn March 13, 2018 the “Inter-Institutional Committee” comprising of ten technicians from three Ministries: the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Ministry of Forestry conducted a final site visit inspection of the re-designed mine site infrastructure, which avoids resettlement.\nOn March 23, 2018, the Company announced a private placement (the “ March 2018 Placement ”) of 5,197,674 units of the Company at a price of 43 pence per unit, together with a subscription by directors of the Company for 616,279 units, to raise in aggregate gross proceeds of £2,500,000. The March 2018 Placement price of 43 pence per unit represented a discount of 7.5 per cent to the closing price of the Ordinary Shares on AIM of 46.5 pence per share on March 22, 2018.\nThe March 2018 Placement closed on March 28, 2018, and each unit issued consisted of one Ordinary Share and one-half of one ordinary share purchase warrant (a “ 2018 Warrant ”). Each such 2018 Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share at a price of 65 pence until March 28, 2020. In the event that the 2018 Warrant is exercised in full, the Company would receive gross proceeds of £1,889,534. Following the March 2018 Placement, the Company had 67,179,335 Ordinary Shares at 20 pence each in issue.\nIn the first quarter of the year, the main activity of the Company’s geology team was a re-logging of the stratigraphy, mineralisation and mine depletion voids in the La India and America drill core, as the strategy of proving a major Gold District continues. Detailed geological mapping and vein characterisation continued along several veins, which included the collection of over 150 rock chip samples. On the America Vein Set, 24 rock chip samples returned gold values greater than 5.0g/t including 24.6g/t and 32.0g/t gold on the Guapinol vein and 27.2g/t gold on the Alfonso Vega vein. On a new prospect, the El Derrumbado prospect, an area of multiple east-west striking veins, immediately north of the Tatascame vein, six samples returning gold greater than 5 g/t, including a 24.3 g/t gold rock chip\nEvents subsequent to March 31, 2018\nOn the May 2nd, 2018, the Chairman and senior management of the Company held a meeting with the Inter-Institutional Committee at the offices of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to discuss additional information required by the Inter-Institutional Committee following their site visit inspection on March 13th, 2018. The Company intends to submit the technical information by May 31 st , 2018.\nExtracts from the Condensed, Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are set out on the following pages.\nCONDOR GOLD PLC\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS TO 31 MARCH 2018\nThree months to 31 March\n2018 unaudited\n£ Three months to 31 March\n2017 unaudited\n£ Revenue -
