    "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabiaâ€™s energy minister said on Wednesday top oil producers would maintain supply curbs until the end of 2018 while continuing to monitor oil markets and adjust plans if needed, al-Eqtisadiah newspaper reported.\nKhalid al-Falih, speaking to the Arabic-language business newspaper, said oil prices are determined by the market and volatility does not serve producers or customers.\nOPEC and non-OPEC countries struck a production supply agreement in January 2017 to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from global markets and end a supply glut.\nReporting By Aziz El Yaakoubi in Dubai and Ahmed Tolba in Cairo; Writing by Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and Elaine Hardcastle\n ",
