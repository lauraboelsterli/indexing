    "text": "-- EXPAREL® net product sales of $74.0 million up 9% over prior year first quarter --\n-- Conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET --\nPARSIPPANY, N.J., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCRX) today announced consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“2018 is off to a terrific start with EXPAREL daily sales volumes accelerating from 6 percent in January to 15 percent in March, as well as a recently expanded label that now includes interscalene brachial plexus block,” said Dave Stack, chairman and chief executive officer of Pacira Pharmaceuticals. “As the only long-acting, single-dose nerve block commercially available, EXPAREL has the potential to eliminate cumbersome delivery technologies, like catheters and pumps, and shift more procedures to the outpatient setting. We believe this expanded label along with our robust educational initiatives and strong coalition of like-minded collaborators, including Johnson & Johnson, will fuel positive sales trends as we continue to drive meaningful change toward eliminating the role of the operating room as a gateway to opioid use and abuse.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nEXPAREL net product sales were $74.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 9% increase over the $67.7 million reported for the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal operating expenses were $81.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $83.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net loss was $10.7 million, or $(0.26) per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a GAAP net loss of $19.9 million, or $(0.52) per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income was $0.9 million, or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted) in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $7.3 million, or $(0.19) per share (basic and diluted) in the first quarter of 2017.\nPacira ended the first quarter of 2018 with cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments (“cash”) of $361.5 million.\nPacira had 40.7 million basic weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in the first quarter of 2018.\nFor non-GAAP measures, Pacira had 41.6 million diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in the first quarter of 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nPacira reiterated its full year 2018 financial guidance as follows.

The call can be accessed by dialing 1-877-845-0779 (domestic) or 1-720-545-0035 (international) ten minutes prior to the start of the call and providing the Conference ID 6585169.\nA replay of the call will be available approximately two hours after the completion of the call and can be accessed by dialing 1-855-859-2056 (domestic) or 1-404-537-3406 (international) and providing the Conference ID 6585169. The replay of the call will be available for two weeks from the date of the live call.\nThe live, listen-only webcast of the conference call can also be accessed by visiting the “Investors & Media” section of the company’s website at investor.pacira.com . A replay of the webcast will be archived on the Pacira website for two weeks following the call.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains financial measures that do not comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP cost of goods sold, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expense and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, because such measures exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount, loss on early extinguishment of debt and exit costs related to the discontinuation of DepoCyt(e) production.\nThese measures supplement the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Pacira management uses these measures to better analyze its financial results, estimate its future cost of goods sold, gross margins, R&D expense and SG&A expense outlook for 2018 and to help make managerial decisions. In management’s opinion, these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements by providing greater transparency into the operating performance at Pacira and the company’s future outlook. Such measures should not be deemed to be an alternative to GAAP requirements or a measure of liquidity for Pacira. Non-GAAP measures are also unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP disclosures released by other companies. See the tables below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP 2018 financial guidance for gross margins, R&D expense and SG&A expense.\nAbout Pacira\nPacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCRX) is a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing and improving postsurgical outcomes for acute care practitioners and their patients. The company’s flagship product, EXPAREL ® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), is redefining pain management after surgery as an opioid-free alternative indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. EXPAREL utilizes DepoFoam ® , a unique and proprietary product delivery technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure, and releases them over a desired period of time. To learn more about Pacira, including the corporate mission to reduce overreliance on opioids, visit www.pacira.com .\nAbout EXPAREL®\nEXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is indicated for single-dose infiltration in adults to produce postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia. The product combines bupivacaine with DepoFoam®, a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period. EXPAREL represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri- or postsurgical setting. By utilizing the DepoFoam platform, a single dose of EXPAREL delivers bupivacaine over time, providing significant reductions in cumulative pain scores with up to a 78 percent decrease in opioid consumption; the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated. Additional information is available at www.EXPAREL.com .\nImportant Safety Information\nEXPAREL is contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% following EXPAREL administration via infiltration were nausea, constipation, and vomiting; adverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% following EXPAREL administration via interscalene brachial plexus nerve block were nausea, pyrexia, and constipation. If EXPAREL and other non-bupivacaine local anesthetics, including lidocaine, are administered at the same site, there may be an immediate release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL. Therefore, EXPAREL may be administered to the same site 20 minutes after injecting lidocaine. EXPAREL is not recommended to be used in the following patient population: patients <18 years old and/or pregnant patients. Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized by the liver, EXPAREL should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease.\nWarnings and Precautions Specific to EXPAREL\nAvoid additional use of local anesthetics within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL. EXPAREL is not recommended for the following types or routes of administration: epidural, intrathecal, regional nerve blocks other than interscalene brachial plexus nerve block , or intravascular or intra-articular use. The potential sensory and/or motor loss with EXPAREL is temporary and varies in degree and duration depending on the site of injection and dosage administered and may last for up to 5 days, as seen in clinical trials.\nWarnings and Precautions for Bupivacaine-Containing Products\nCentral Nervous System (CNS) Reactions: There have been reports of adverse neurologic reactions with the use of local anesthetics. These include persistent anesthesia and paresthesia. CNS reactions are characterized by excitation and/or depression.\nCardiovascular System Reactions: Toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conductivity and excitability which may lead to dysrhythmias, sometimes leading to death.\nAllergic Reactions: Allergic-type reactions (eg, anaphylaxis and angioedema) are rare and may occur as a result of hypersensitivity to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients.\nChondrolysis: There have been reports of chondrolysis (mostly in the shoulder joint) following intra-articular infusion of local anesthetics, which is an unapproved use.\nForward Looking Statements\nAny statements in this press release about the company’s future expectations, plans, outlook and prospects, and other statements containing the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may” and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
