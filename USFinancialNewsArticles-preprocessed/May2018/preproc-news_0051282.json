    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 5:01 PM / Updated 32 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Golf-McIlroy one off lead after first round at PGA Championship Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\n(Updates with McIlroy)\nLONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Former champion Rory McIlroy recovered from a poor start with seven birdies to put himself in contention after the first round of the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth on Thursday.\nTeeing off at lunchtime on a murky but tranquil day, McIlroy bogeyed the third hole but hit back impressively to card a five-under-par 67 to move one off the lead.\nSouth African duo Dean Burmester and Darren Fichardt led for most of the day on six-under before Thailand’s Kiradech Aphibarnrat threatened to steal their thunder.\nHe sank a long birdie putt on the 16th to move into the outright lead but leaked away two shots on the next hole and ended with a bogey at the last to finish on four under.\nMcIlroy joined England’s Richard Bland and Matthew Fitzpatrick on five-under after they both impressed in the early starters at the European Tour’s flagship event.\nHe rolled in an excellent putt on the 14th to make it three birdies in five holes and sunk a 10-footer at the 16th to move to within a shot of the lead.\nMcIlroy almost chipped in for an eagle on the 18th, the ball grazing the cup, but he missed his short birdie putt to end a solid day on a downbeat note.\nThe former world number one is playing at the tournament for the first time since 2015, the year after he fired a six-under 66 in the final round to snatch victory.\n“I played really well and walking on the 16th at five under is always good after being one over after three,” he said.\n“I hit my irons better than the last couple of weeks. It felt pretty good out there today.”\nFitzpatrick saved par on the last with a chip and a putt after hitting his ball into the water.\nBland, whose best career result came at Wentworth in 2006 when he was fifth, made six birdies during his round, dropping one shot at the par-four sixth.\n“I know the results are not showing it but I felt It was trending back in the right direction,” Bland said after shooting his lowest score in 29 rounds at Wentworth.\n“It’s just nice to finally see something red for the hours you’ve put in on the range.”\nNorthern Ireland’s former Open champion Darren Clarke pulled out late on after injuring his ankle the day before.
