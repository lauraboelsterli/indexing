PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Patterson Companies (Nasdaq: PDCO) today announced additions to further enhance the Company’s leadership team. Patterson has appointed Donald J. Zurbay as Chief Financial Officer, effective June 29, 2018. Patterson also announced that Andrea Frohning has joined the Company as Chief Human Resources Officer, effective May 21, 2018.\n“The addition of talented leaders like Don and Andrea is an important part of our efforts to realize the full potential of Patterson and continue building a deeply engaged and committed team,” said Mark Walchirk, President and CEO of Patterson Companies. “The ability to attract exceptional leaders is also a testament to the strength of our platform and the opportunity to improve our growth and profitability.”\nZurbay joins the organization with more than 28 years of leadership experience in various accounting and finance positions. Most recently, he served as Vice President and CFO at leading global medical device manufacturer St. Jude Medical, Inc. until the company’s sale to Abbott. In this role, Zurbay developed strategic and operating plans during a time when St. Jude Medical grew annual revenues from $1 billion to more than $6 billion, optimized its cost structure and oversaw a significant SAP implementation.\n“Don’s strong track record of successfully leading finance teams, particularly during periods of growth and change, will be instrumental as we focus on improving our execution and results,” said Walchirk. “We look forward to benefiting from his experience and expertise in implementing ERP systems, creating a more efficient cost structure and driving cash flow growth, as we continue to build value for our customers and shareholders.”\nZurbay said, “Patterson offers a compelling value proposition across strong end markets. I am excited about the opportunity to work with Mark and the rest of the team to continue the Company’s transformation and support Patterson’s growth initiatives.”\nZurbay will succeed Dennis W. Goedken, who has been serving as interim CFO and will continue to serve as Corporate Controller.\nWalchirk continued, “I want to thank Dennis for providing a seamless transition as interim CFO while we conducted our search. He has played an important role in supporting our near-term actions and remains a valued member of our team going forward.”\nAndrea Frohning joined Patterson as Chief Human Resources Officer on May 21, 2018. Frohning brings more than 20 years of experience in leading numerous human resource departments across a diverse set of business environments and industries. She most recently served as the Chief Human Resources Officer at Snyder’s-Lance, a global manufacturer and marketer of snack foods, where she helped execute operational improvements, accelerate positive culture changes and grow leadership capabilities.\n“Andrea’s background and experience leading people at public, Fortune 500 companies, especially through transformations, will be significant as we continue to align our people and resources to our strategic priorities and future vision,” said Walchirk.\nFrohning said, “I am thrilled to join Patterson at such an exciting time in the Company’s history. I look forward to supporting Patterson’s transformation, continuing our efforts to attract and retain the best talent and elevating the performance of our team.”\nDonald Zurbay Biography\nDonald Zurbay, 50, most recently served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at St. Jude Medical, Inc., where he was responsible for all accounting, financial and business development activities.
