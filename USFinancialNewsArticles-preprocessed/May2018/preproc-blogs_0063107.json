Photo: AP\nThe debt taken on by global companies has eclipsed pre-crisis levels, and credit quality has sunk as finance chiefs take advantage of low interest rates and strong investor demand, according to a report by Moody’s Investor Service.\nRoughly 4,000 non-financial firms rated by Moody’s say their leverage is about 20% higher now than in 2007. The total share of companies with an investment grade Aaa- to A-rating has fallen to 15% from 21% before the financial crisis in 2007. Baa-ratings — at the lower end of the investment-grade spectrum — have increased to 63% from 55% in 2007.\nAt the same time, about 60% of companies are considered speculative grade, with over 40% rated B1 or lower, according to Moody’s. Their median ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization is about 10% higher than in 2007, while that ratio is around 30% higher at investment grade companies than in 2007.\n“The average credit quality has gone down,” said Mariarosa Verde, group credit officer at Moody’s. “Companies have increased their leverage, many of them to pursue mergers and acquisitions,” she said.\nThis is also reflected in the rise in number of so-called fallen angels, companies that were downgraded to speculative grade from investment grade. There were eight such companies in the first quarter of 2018, the highest since the first quarter of 2016, according to Moody’s.\nLoose monetary policy and investors’ search for yield has provided companies with good financing conditions and increasingly weak debt covenants, Ms. Verde said. Finance chiefs are making use of current conditions to borrow more instead of reducing debt levels, she added.\nMore companies have been able to access the capital markets, even those with weak underlying financials. This poses a risk to investors during the next financial downturn, when earnings shrink and debt comes due, she added.\nTighter monetary policy could also result in more defaults further down the road, said Ms. Verde. The default rate for speculative grade companies was 3% at the end of April, down from 3.2% in the prior month. It is set to fall to 1.7% at the end of the year, said Ms. Verde. “Credit conditions will remain benign in the near term,” she said.\nIn some sectors, including retail and high-tech industries, around 70% or more of companies are rated speculative grade instead of investment grade. In the U.S., speculative grade ratings represent 67% of issues and 38% of outstanding debt, higher than in other regions. Moody’s did not provide a detailed breakdown for other regions.\nDebt levels at companies have grown since 2011, according to Moody’s, rising to a median debt to ebitda-ratio of 2.6 times for investment grade rated entities and 4.9 times for speculative grade entities at the end of 2017.\nThose companies that have reduced their debt ratios most often grew their earnings instead of paying back debt, said Ms. Verde. “Most companies wait for their earnings to go up,” she said. “They rarely pay down debt.”\nShare this: DEBT FINANCIAL CRISIS LEVERAGE RATINGS Previous The Weekend Reader: Three Must-Reads Next CFO Moves: Diago, Essentra, HP, Advance Publications, [24]7.ai and RBS Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte Executive Transitions: Your Team Is Your Brand Incoming executives are usually hired to improve performance and drive change, not to maintain the status quo.
