    "text": "BRENTWOOD, Tenn., May 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Argentum honored Brookdale's Celebrate Aging Film Festival at their Senior Living Executive Conference in San Diego, May 14-16, 2018. The first annual film festival won the Argentum Best of the Best Award, which recognizes innovative new programs and services that are working to improve the future of senior living. Argentum is a leading senior living trade organization.\n\"We established the Celebrate Aging Film Festival to change the perception of aging, and it is doing just that,\" said Carol Cummings, senior director of Optimum Life engagement at Brookdale. \"It is an honor to receive the esteemed Best of the Best Award, which affirms the innovative work we are doing at Brookdale.\"\nBrookdale invited residents and associates from each of its communities to submit a five-minute short film, made using only an iPad, which paints aging in a positive light. Each community has at least one iPad available for residents to keep up-to-date with technology. Seventy-four films were submitted to the Celebrate Aging Film Festival and nine received nominations for Best Acting, Best Technical Design, Best Writing, Best Picture and the Courage Award. All nine films were up for the Ecolab People's Choice Award, with voting open to the public. Residents and associates gathered in Franklin, Tennessee for a red-carpet awards ceremony in October .\n\"The Celebrate Aging Film Festival gives our residents and associates an opportunity to work together creatively using the iPad technology,\" said Cummings. \"I am still in awe of the films our communities created. I can't wait to see what they come up with this year!\"\nThe 2018 Celebrate Aging Film Festival is scheduled for Wednesday, October 3 , at the historic Franklin Theatre in Franklin, Tennessee. The event is generously sponsored by Ecolab.\nAbout Brookdale Senior Living\nBrookdale Senior Living Inc. is the leading operator of senior living communities throughout the United States.
