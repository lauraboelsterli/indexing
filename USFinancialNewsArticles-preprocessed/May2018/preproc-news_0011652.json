    "text": "DALLAS, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) today announced fiscal first quarter financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the Fiscal First Quarter 2018 compared to the Fiscal First Quarter 2017*:\nSystem-wide sales increased 20.4% to $313.0 million System-wide restaurant count increased 12.2% to 1,157 global locations Domestic same store sales increased 9.5% Total revenue increased 11.9% to $37.4 million Net income of $6.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, comparable to $6.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA**, a non-GAAP measure, increased 31.0% to $12.5 million Adjusted net income**, a non-GAAP measure, increased 16.4% to $7.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share\n* In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which changed the timing of recognition of initial franchise fees, development fees, territory fees for our international business and renewal and transfer fees, as well as the reporting of advertising fund contributions and related expenditures. See the “Adoption of New Accounting Guidance” section below for additional information. Amounts presented for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2017 have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09.\n** Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per diluted share are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer Charlie Morrison stated, “Our strong start in 2018 is another example of the strength of our model and the outstanding performance of our franchisees and team members. This strong start gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 2018 results that are above our long term targets. The strong top line momentum in the first quarter of 2018 led to adjusted EBITDA growth of 31.0% and adjusted net income growth of 16.4%.”\nMorrison continued, “We remain focused on executing against our four growth strategies: building awareness of the Wingstop brand; innovating across our technological platforms; optimizing delivery in our three test markets as we build a foundation for a national delivery rollout; and developing Wingstop internationally. These efforts are proving successful in strengthening our ‘category of one’ brand and helping position Wingstop to become a top 10 global restaurant brand.”\nKey Operating Metrics for the Fiscal First Quarter 2018 Compared to the Fiscal First Quarter 2017\nThirteen Weeks Ended March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Number of system-wide restaurants open at end of period 1,157 1,031 Number of domestic franchise restaurants open at end of period 1,021 927 Number of international franchise restaurants open at end of period 112 83 System-wide sales (in thousands) $ 312,981 $ 259,925 System-wide domestic same store sales growth 9.5 % (1.1 )% Net income (in thousands) $ 6,168 $ 6,257 Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) $ 12,492 $ 9,535 Fiscal First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fiscal first quarter 2018 increased 11.9% to $37.4 million from $33.4 million in the fiscal first quarter last year.\nRoyalty revenue, franchise fees and other increased $0.2 million to $17.8 million from $17.6 million in the fiscal first quarter last year. Royalty revenue increased $2.7 million due to 123 net franchise restaurant openings since April 1, 2017 and domestic same store sales growth of 9.5%. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in other revenue of $2.5 million, primarily due to a one-time payment received in conjunction with a vendor agreement executed during the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2017.\nAdvertising fees and related income increased $1.3 million to $8.6 million from $7.3 million in the fiscal first quarter last year. Advertising fees increased primarily due to the increase in system-wide sales during the thirteen weeks ended March 31, 2018, versus the prior year fiscal first quarter.\nCompany-owned restaurant sales increased $2.5 million to $11.0 million from $8.5 million in the fiscal first quarter last year. The increase was the result of the acquisition of two restaurants from a franchisee in July 2017 and the acquisition of one restaurant from a franchisee in February 2018, resulting in combined sales of $1.3 million in the current fiscal first quarter, and company-owned domestic same store sales growth of 12.5%, which was driven equally by an increase in transactions and an increase in average transaction size.\nCost of sales increased to $7.4 million from $6.6 million in the fiscal first quarter last year. As a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales, cost of sales decreased 1,000 basis points to 67.2% from 77.2%. The decrease was driven primarily by an 11.3% decrease in the cost of bone-in chicken wings as compared to the prior year period, as well as our ability to leverage costs as a result of the 12.5% increase in company-owned restaurant same store sales.\nAdvertising expenses decreased to $8.6 million from $9.3 million in the fiscal first quarter last year. Under the new accounting guidance, advertising expenses are recognized at the same time the related revenue is recognized, which does not necessarily correlate to actual timing of the advertising spend. In the prior year period, we received a one-time payment from a vendor, which was used to fund the launch of national advertising, and resulted in a corresponding increase in advertising expense of approximately $1.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2017.\nSelling, general & administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 31.4% to $10.8 million compared to $8.2 million in the fiscal first quarter last year. The increase in SG&A expense is primarily due to nonrecurring costs of $1.5 million related to the refinancing of our credit agreement and subsequent special dividend payout, which occurred in the fiscal first quarter 2018. The remaining increase is primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefit expenses related to planned headcount additions, as compared to the prior year period.\nNet income was $6.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which is comparable to net income of $6.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the fiscal first quarter last year.\nAdjusted net income increased to $7.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $0.21 per diluted share, in the prior year’s first quarter, an increase of 19%. A reconciliation between net income and adjusted net income is included in the schedules accompanying this release.\nAdoption of New Accounting Guidance\nThe Company adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018, using the full retrospective transition method, which resulted in adjusting each prior reporting period presented and a recording a cumulative effect adjustment as of the first day of 2016. The adoption changed the timing of recognition of initial franchise fees, development fees, territory fees for our international business and renewal and transfer fees, as well as the reporting of advertising fund contributions and related expenditures. Additional information regarding the Company's adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance and the impact to historical financial results is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's filing on Form 8-K, filed with the Commission on February 22, 2018.\nRestaurant Development\nAs of March 31, 2018, there were 1,157 Wingstop restaurants system-wide. This included 1,045 restaurants in the United States, of which 1,021 were franchised restaurants and 24 were company-owned. Our international presence consisted of 112 franchised restaurants across eight countries. During the fiscal first quarter 2018, there were 24 net system-wide Wingstop restaurants opened, including 6 international franchised locations.\nQuarterly Dividend\nIn recognition of the Company’s strong cash flow generation, confidence in the business, and commitment to returning value to stockholders, our Board of Directors has authorized and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share of common stock, totaling approximately $2.1 million. This dividend will be paid on June 18, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 4, 2018.\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the fiscal year ending December 29, 2018, the Company is reiterating previous guidance, which is consistent with its long-term targets:\n10%+ system-wide unit growth Low single digit domestic same store sales growth Adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% - 15% Effective tax rate of approximately 23% Stock-based compensation expense of approximately $3 million Fully diluted Adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.75, which reflects 29.6 million diluted shares outstanding. This estimate is comparable to fully diluted Adjusted earnings per share of $0.69 for fiscal year 2017, which has been restated to reflect the new revenue recognition standards. Fiscal year 2017 included a benefit of $0.08 to Adjusted earnings per share associated with the new accounting rules for excess tax benefits for stock options exercised. No excess tax benefits from stock option exercises have been contemplated in our 2018 guidance.\nFiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.71 Adjustments: Transaction costs (a) 0.05 Tax impact of adjustments (b) (0.01 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 0.75 (a) Represents costs and expenses related to the refinancing of our credit agreement (b) Tax impact of adjustment calculated at a 23% effective tax rate The following definitions apply to these terms as used in this release:\nSame store sales reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base. We define the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for at least 52 full weeks. This measure highlights the performance of existing restaurants, while excluding the impact of new restaurant openings and closures.\nSystem-wide sales represents net sales for all of our company-owned and franchised restaurants, as reported by franchisees.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) further adjusted for transaction costs, gains and losses on the disposal of assets, and stock-based compensation expense. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income plus transactions costs minus related adjustments to income tax expense.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share is defined as adjusted net income divided by weighted average diluted share count.\nConference Call and Webcast\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Charlie Morrison, and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Skipworth, will host a conference call today to discuss the fiscal first quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.\nThe conference call can be accessed live by dialing 201-689-8562.
