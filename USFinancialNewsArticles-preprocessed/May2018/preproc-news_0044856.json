    "text": "Published: May 19, 2018 3:53 p.m. ET Share Reuters Seoul was concerned that tensions with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, shown here bidding farewell to South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone, would be aggravated by the U.S.–South Korea–Japan exercise.\nBy Michael R. Gordon Nancy A. Youssef\nA planned training exercise involving U.S. B-52 bombers and South Korean planes was scrapped earlier this week after the South Korean government expressed concerns that it could generate tensions before a planned summit meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, according to U.S. officials.\nKey Words: Trump follows lead of South Korea’s Moon: What matters is the peace, not the prize\nThe move follows repeated assertions by the Trump administration that it is keeping up a campaign of maximum economic and military pressure until North Korea gives up its nuclear-weapons programs and that the U.S. hasn’t changed the scope of its exercises.\nBut the South Koreans asked not to participate in what was intended to be a three-nation air drill involving the U.S., South Korea and Japan, the U.S. officials said. The U.S., which has sought to maintain political solidarity with Seoul during a turbulent period of diplomacy with North Korea, hasn’t commented publicly on the South Korean decision. ",
