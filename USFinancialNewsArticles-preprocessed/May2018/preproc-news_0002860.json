(NYSE: WGL):\nConsolidated Results\nWGL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: WGL), the parent company of Washington Gas Light Company (Washington Gas) and other energy-related subsidiaries, today reported net income applicable to common stock determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, of $135.6 million, or $2.63 per share, an improvement of $12.5 million, or $0.24 per share, over net income applicable to common stock of $123.1 million, or $2.39 per share, reported for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, net income applicable to common stock was $273.6 million, or $5.31 per share, an improvement of $92.6 million, or $1.79 per share, over net income applicable to common stock of $181.0 million, or $3.52 per share for the same period of the prior fiscal year.\nDuring the six months ended March 31, 2018, we are reflecting a decrease in current year tax expense from the year-over-year reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) enacted in December 2017. As a result, Washington Gas began passing on to customers approximately $39.5 million, on an annual basis, through reduced rates beginning in the second fiscal quarter. We have also remeasured our accumulated deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which resulted in recording a $60.3 million income tax benefit (net) in GAAP net income. Non-GAAP operating earnings (described below) have been adjusted to eliminate the re-measurement impact on deferred income taxes of the legislation.\nOn a consolidated basis, WGL uses non-GAAP operating earnings (loss) to evaluate overall financial performance, and evaluates segment financial performance based on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and adjusted EBIT. Operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT are non-GAAP financial measures, which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance. Both non-GAAP operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT adjust for the accounting recognition of certain transactions that we believe are not representative of the ongoing earnings of the company. Additionally, we believe that adjusted EBIT enhances the ability to evaluate segment performance because it excludes interest and income tax expense, which are affected by corporate-wide strategies such as capital financing and tax sharing allocations. Refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” attached to this news release, for a more detailed discussion of management’s use of these measures and for reconciliations to GAAP financial measures.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, operating earnings were $109.5 million, or $2.12 per share, an improvement of $13.4 million, or $0.25 per share, over operating earnings of $96.1 million, or $1.87 per share, for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, operating earnings were $204.4 million, or $3.96 per share, an improvement of $49.0 million, or $0.94 per share, over operating earnings of $155.4 million, or $3.02 per share, for the same period of the prior fiscal year.\nResults by Business Segment\nRegulated Utility\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ (In millions) 2018 2017 (Decrease) 2018 2017 (Decrease) EBIT $\n151.1\n$ 165.2 $ (14.1 ) $\n249.4 $ 267.9 $ (18.5 ) Adjusted EBIT $\n143.6\n$ 150.2 $ (6.6 ) $ 245.0 $ 241.6 $ 3.4 For the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, EBIT reflects lower unrealized margins associated with our asset optimization program, partially offset by the effects of colder-than-normal weather in the District of Columbia.\nThe comparisons of both EBIT and adjusted EBIT for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 reflect increases related to higher customer growth and new base rates in Virginia and the District of Columbia. These comparisons reflect decreases related to: (i) lower billed and estimated utility rates associated with the pass-through of tax savings from the Tax Act*; (ii) higher operation and maintenance expenses primarily related to uncollectible accounts; and (iii) higher depreciation and amortization expense.\n* This decrease is offset in income tax expense.\nRetail Energy-Marketing\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ (In millions) 2018 2017 (Decrease) 2018 2017 (Decrease) EBIT $\n15.1\n$ 9.3 $ 5.8 $\n18.8 $ 38.4 $ (19.6 ) Adjusted EBIT $\n20.0\n$ 13.1 $ 6.9 $ 26.5 $ 23.0 $ 3.5 For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the increase in both EBIT and adjusted EBIT reflects higher realized gas margins due to increased portfolio optimization margins, partially offset by lower realized electric margins due to lower average selling prices and lower sales volume along with higher operating expenses.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018, EBIT was reduced by unrealized commodity margin losses in the current year compared to gains in the prior year. The comparisons of both EBIT and adjusted EBIT reflects higher realized gas margins due to higher portfolio optimization margins, offset by lower realized electric margins due to lower average selling prices and lower sales volume, along with higher operating expenses.\nCommercial Energy Systems\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ (In millions) 2018 2017 (Decrease) 2018 2017 (Decrease) EBIT $\n3.6\n$ 8.5 $ (4.9 ) $\n9.2 $ 13.2 $ (4.0 ) Adjusted EBIT $\n5.2\n$ 10.3 $ (5.1 ) $ 12.5 $ 16.4 $ (3.9 ) For the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, the decrease in both EBIT and adjusted EBIT reflects lower earnings due to a decline in active projects in our energy efficiency business and higher operating expenses in our commercial distributed generation business. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the decrease in both EBIT and adjusted EBIT also reflects lower earnings from our investment distributed generation business, including investments in tax equity partnerships.\nMidstream Energy Services\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ (In millions) 2018 2017 (Decrease) 2018 2017 (Decrease) EBIT $\n7.3\n$ 42.0 $ (34.7 ) $\n29.5 $ 13.5 $ 16.0 Adjusted EBIT $\n(2.2\n) $ (1.3 ) $ (0.9 ) $ 26.2 $ 1.4 $ 24.8 The EBIT comparisons for both periods reflect lower mark-to-market valuations associated with long-term transportation strategies. Additionally, both the EBIT and adjusted EBIT comparisons for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 include a $34.0 million impairment related to our investment in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution).\nThe three months ended March 31, 2018 EBIT comparison also reflects lower realized margins related to storage inventory and economic hedging transactions, which along with the lower mark-to-market valuations described above are mostly offset by higher transportation margins. The three months ended March 31, 2018 adjusted EBIT comparison reflects higher margins on both our transportation and storage strategies that mostly offset the impairment of Constitution.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018 EBIT and adjusted EBIT comparisons, higher margins on our transportation and storage strategies more than offset the impairment of Constitution.\nOther Activities\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ (In millions) 2018 2017 (Decrease) 2018 2017 (Decrease) EBIT $\n(2.2\n) $ (15.1 ) $ 12.9 $\n(6.4 ) $ (16.3 ) $ 9.9 Adjusted EBIT $\n(2.0\n) $ (1.1 ) $ (0.9 ) $ (5.6 ) $ (2.3 ) $ (3.3 ) For the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, the increase in EBIT relates to lower costs related to the planned merger with AltaGas Ltd. (AltaGas). For the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, the decrease in adjusted EBIT reflects higher internal costs related to the planned merger with AltaGas.\nIntersegment Eliminations\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ Six Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/ (In millions) 2018 2017 (Decrease) 2018 2017 (Decrease) EBIT $\n(4.1\n) $ (1.5 ) $ (2.6 ) $\n(2.4 ) $ (0.4 ) $ (2.0 ) Adjusted EBIT $\n(4.1\n) $ (1.4 ) $ (2.7 ) $ (2.4 ) $ 0.1 $ (2.5 ) For the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, the variance in intersegment eliminations relates primarily to timing differences between the revenue and expense recognition of renewable energy credits by Commercial Energy Systems and Retail Energy-Marketing.\nOther Information\nDuring the pendency period of the proposed merger between WGL and AltaGas, WGL will not conduct earnings calls and will not give forward year guidance.

Management believes that operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT provide a meaningful representation of our earnings from ongoing operations on a consolidated and segment basis, respectively. These measures facilitate analysis by providing consistent and comparable measures to help management, investors and analysts better understand and evaluate our operating results and performance trends, and assist in analyzing period-to-period comparisons. Additionally, we use these non-GAAP measures to report to the board of directors and to evaluate management’s performance.\nTo derive our non-GAAP measures, we adjust for the accounting recognition of certain transactions (non-GAAP adjustments) based on at least one of the following criteria:\nTo better match the accounting recognition of transactions with their economics; To better align with regulatory view/recognition; To eliminate the effects of:\ni. Significant out of period adjustments;\nii. Other significant items that may obscure historical earnings comparisons and are not indicative of performance trends; and\niii. For adjusted EBIT, other items which may obscure segment comparisons.\nThere are limits in using operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT to analyze our consolidated and segment results, respectively, as they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, using operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT to analyze our results may have limited value as they exclude certain items that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. We compensate for these limitations by providing investors with the attached reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe following tables present the unaudited reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings to GAAP net income (loss) applicable to common stock (consolidated by quarter):\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nFiscal Year 2018 Quarterly Period Ended (1) (In thousands, except per share data) Dec. 31 Mar. 31 Jun. 30 Sept. 30 Fiscal Year Operating earnings (loss) $ 94,923 $ 109,485 $ 204,408 Non-GAAP adjustments (2) (14,351 ) 10,287 (4,064 ) De-designated interest rate swaps (3) (354 ) 13,183 12,829 Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (4) 4,956 (4,839 ) 117 Re-measurement impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (5) 52,866 7,434 60,300 Net income (loss) applicable to common stock $ 138,040 $ 135,550 $ — $ — $ 273,590 Diluted average common shares outstanding 51,549 51,577 51,561 Operating earnings (loss) per share $ 1.84 $ 2.12 $ 3.96 Per share effect of non-GAAP adjustments 0.84 0.51 1.35 Diluted earnings (loss) per average common share $ 2.68 $ 2.63 $ 5.31 Fiscal Year 2017 Quarterly Period Ended (1) (In thousands, except per share data) Dec. 31 (6) Mar. 31 Jun. 30 Sept. 30 Fiscal Year Operating earnings (loss) $ 59,362 $ 96,087 $ 155,449 Non-GAAP adjustments (2) (2,324 ) 38,468 36,144 De-designated interest rate swaps (3) — 2,516 2,516 Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (4) 934 (14,007 ) (13,073 ) Net income (loss) applicable to common stock $ 57,972 $ 123,064 $ — $ — $ 181,036 Diluted average common shares outstanding 51,445 51,476 51,458 Operating earnings (loss) per share $ 1.15 $ 1.87 $ 3.02 Per share effect of non-GAAP adjustments (0.02 ) 0.52 0.50 Diluted earnings (loss) per average common share $ 1.13 $ 2.39 $ 3.52 (1) Quarterly earnings per share may not sum to year-to-date or annual earnings per share as quarterly calculations are based on weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding, which may vary for each of those periods.\n(2) Refer to the reconciliations of adjusted EBIT to EBIT below for further details on our non-GAAP adjustments. Note that non-GAAP adjustments associated with interest expense or income taxes are shown separately and are not included in the reconciliation from adjusted EBIT to EBIT.\n(3) Non-GAAP adjustment related to mark-to-market valuations on forward starting interest rate swaps associated with anticipated future financing. Due to certain covenants in our merger agreement with AltaGas, it is no longer probable that the 30-year debt issuance that the swaps were originally intended to hedge will occur. However, we believe that some form of financing will continue to be required. The hedges were de-designated in January 2017 and settled in January 2018 for $13.8 million.\n(4) Non-GAAP adjustments are presented on a gross basis and the income tax effects of those adjustments are presented separately. The income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments, both current and deferred, are calculated at the individual company level based on the applicable composite tax rate for each period presented, with the exception of transactions not subject to income taxes. Additionally, the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments includes investment tax credits related to distributed generation assets.\n(5) In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, resulting in, among other effects, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This resulted in a net deferred tax benefit of $52.9 million. An additional true up provision of $7.4 million was recorded in March 2018. This adjustment only reflects the re-measurement impact and not the effect on ongoing earnings of the lower tax rate.\n(6) Non-GAAP measures for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 have been recast to include $6.8 million of losses associated with the index price used in certain gas purchases from Antero. The index price used to invoice these purchases had been the subject of an arbitration proceeding; however, in February 2017, the arbitral tribunal ruled in favor of Antero.\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nThe following tables summarize non-GAAP adjustments by operating segment and present reconciliations of adjusted EBIT to EBIT. EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and taxes, less amounts attributable to non-controlling interest. Items we do not include in EBIT are interest expense, inter-company financing activity, dividends on Washington Gas preferred stock, and income taxes.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 (In thousands) Regulated Utility\nRetail Energy- Marketing\nCommercial Energy\nSystems\nMidstream Energy\nServices\nOther Activities\nEliminations\nTotal Adjusted EBIT 143,604 20,000 5,232 (2,231 ) (2,049 ) (4,103 ) $ 160,453 Non-GAAP adjustments: Unrealized mark-to-market valuations on energy-related derivatives(a) 12,292 (4,896 ) — 2,122 — (13 ) 9,505 Storage optimization program(b) (2,968 ) — — — — — (2,968 ) DC weather impact(c) (1,859 ) — — — — — (1,859 ) Distributed generation asset related investment tax credits(d) — — (1,670 ) — — — (1,670 ) Change in measured value of inventory(e) — — — 7,415 — — 7,415 Merger related costs(f) — — — — (136 ) — (136 ) Total non-GAAP adjustments $ 7,465 $ (4,896 ) $ (1,670 ) $ 9,537 $ (136 ) $ (13 ) $ 10,287 EBIT $ 151,069 $ 15,104 $ 3,562 $ 7,306 $ (2,185 ) $ (4,116 ) $ 170,740 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 (In thousands) Regulated Utility\nRetail Energy- Marketing\nCommercial Energy\nSystems\nMidstream Energy\nServices\nOther Activities\nEliminations\nTotal Adjusted EBIT $ 150,223 $ 13,149 $ 10,312 $ (1,252 ) $ (1,061 ) $ (1,412 ) $ 169,959 Non-GAAP adjustments: Unrealized mark-to-market valuations on energy-related derivatives(a) 21,050 (3,894 ) — 23,658 — (60 ) 40,754 Storage optimization program (b) 866 — — — — — 866 DC weather impact(c) (6,968 ) — — — — — (6,968 ) Distributed generation asset related investment tax credits(d) — — (1,765 ) — — — (1,765 ) Change in measured value of inventory(e) — — — 19,587 — — 19,587 Merger related costs (f) — — — — (11,905 ) — (11,905 ) Third-party guarantee (g) — — — — (2,101 ) — (2,101 ) Total non-GAAP adjustments $ 14,948 $ (3,894 ) $ (1,765 ) $ 43,245 $ (14,006 ) $ (60 ) $ 38,468 EBIT $ 165,171 $ 9,255 $ 8,547 $ 41,993 $ (15,067 ) $ (1,472 ) $ 208,427 WGL Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nSix Months Ended March 31, 2018 (In thousands) Regulated Utility\nRetail Energy- Marketing\nCommercial Energy\nSystems\nMidstream Energy\nServices\nOther Activities\nEliminations\nTotal Adjusted EBIT $ 244,954 $ 26,534 $ 12,546 $ 26,226 $ (5,563 ) $ (2,436 ) $ 302,261 Non-GAAP adjustments: Unrealized mark-to-market valuations on energy-related derivatives(a) 10,846 (7,688 ) — 2,243 — 9 5,410 Storage optimization program(b) (3,429 ) — — — — — (3,429 ) DC weather impact(c) (2,937 ) — — — — — (2,937 ) Distributed generation asset related investment tax credits(d) — — (3,337 ) — — — (3,337 ) Change in measured value of inventory(e) — — — 1,022 — — 1,022 Merger related costs(f) — — — — (793 ) — (793 ) Total non-GAAP adjustments $ 4,480 $ (7,688 ) $ (3,337 ) $ 3,265 $ (793 ) $ 9 $ (4,064 ) EBIT $ 249,434 $ 18,846 $ 9,209 $ 29,491 $ (6,356 ) $ (2,427 ) $ 298,197 Six Months Ended March 31, 2017 (In thousands) Regulated Utility\nRetail Energy- Marketing\nCommercial Energy\nSystems\nMidstream Energy\nServices\nOther Activities\nEliminations\nTotal Adjusted EBIT $ 241,603 $ 23,044 $ 16,384 $ 1,409 $ (2,259 ) $ 93 $ 280,274 Non-GAAP adjustments: Unrealized mark-to-market valuations on energy-related derivatives(a) 36,486 15,396 — 13,981 — (457 ) 65,406 Storage optimization program (b) 202 — — — — — 202 DC weather impact(c) (10,403 ) — — — — — (10,403 ) Distributed generation asset related investment tax credits(d) — — (3,174 ) — — — (3,174 ) Change in measured value of inventory(e) — — — (1,881 ) — — (1,881 ) Merger related costs (f) — — — — (11,905 ) — (11,905 ) Third-party guarantee (g) — — — — (2,101 ) — (2,101 ) Total non-GAAP adjustments $ 26,285 $ 15,396 $ (3,174 ) $ 12,100 $ (14,006 ) $ (457 ) $ 36,144 EBIT $ 267,888 $ 38,440 $ 13,210 $ 13,509 $ (16,265 ) $ (364 ) $ 316,418 Footnotes:\n(a)\nAdjustments to eliminate unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses) for our energy-related derivatives for our regulated utility and retail energy-marketing operations as well as certain derivatives related to the optimization of transportation capacity for the midstream energy services segment. With the exception of certain transactions related to the optimization of system capacity assets as discussed in footnote (b) below, when these derivatives settle, the realized economic impact is reflected in our non-GAAP results, as we are only removing interim unrealized mark-to-market amounts.\n(b)\nAdjustments to shift the timing of storage optimization margins for the regulated utility segment from the periods recognized for GAAP purposes to the periods in which such margins are recognized for regulatory sharing purposes. In addition, lower-of-cost or market adjustments related to system and non-system storage optimization are eliminated for non-GAAP reporting because the margins will be recognized for regulatory purposes when the withdrawals are made at the unadjusted historical cost of storage inventory.\n(c)\nEliminates the estimated financial effects of warm or cold weather in the District of Columbia, as measured consistent with our regulatory tariff. Washington Gas has regulatory weather protection mechanisms in Maryland and Virginia designed to neutralize the estimated financial effects of weather. Utilization of normal weather is an industry standard, and it is our practice to evaluate our rate-regulated revenues by utilizing normal weather and to provide estimates and guidance on the basis of normal weather.\n(d)\nTo reclassify the amortization of deferred investment tax credits from income taxes to operating income for the commercial energy systems segment. These credits are a key component of the operating success of this segment and therefore are included within adjusted EBIT to help management and investors better assess the segment’s performance.\n(e)\nFor our midstream energy services segment, adjustments to reflect storage inventory at market or at a value based on the price used to value the physical forward sales contract that is economically hedging the storage inventory. Adjusting our storage optimization inventory in this fashion better aligns the settlement of both our physical and financial transactions and allows investors and management to better analyze the results of our non-utility asset optimization strategies. Additionally, this adjustment also includes the net effect of certain sharing mechanisms on the difference between the changes in our non-GAAP storage inventory valuations and the unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not subject to non-GAAP adjustments.\n(f)\nAdjustment to eliminate external costs associated with the proposed merger with AltaGas.\n(g)\nGuarantee on behalf of a third party associated with a solar investment.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006815/en/\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nNews Media\nBrian Edwards, 202-624-6620\nor\nFinancial Community\nDouglas Bonawitz, 202-624-6129\nSource: WGL Holdings, Inc.",
