    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 9:19 AM / Updated 15 minutes ago Investment plans at UK services firms edge down ahead of Brexit - BoE Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Investment intentions across services companies that make up the bulk of Britain’s economy have weakened slightly, reflecting uncertainty around Brexit, a Bank of England survey showed on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: The Canary Wharf financial district is seen at dusk in London, Britain, November 17, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nThe BoE’s Agents’ Summary showed consumer-facing services companies did not expect to recoup sales lost from a weak start to the economy.\nIt described moderate growth in business services companies.\nOverall, the survey added to a run of data suggesting Britain’s economy is growing at a lacklustre pace.\n“Investment intentions remained modest, reflecting continued uncertainty around Brexit,” the BoE survey said.\nPlans for spending in manufacturing companies were unchanged from March, despite the fact capacity constraints hit a record high.\nThe survey showed growth in labour costs had edged up, reflecting “slightly higher” pay settlements than in 2018.\nThe BoE surveyed businesses between late February and mid-April.
