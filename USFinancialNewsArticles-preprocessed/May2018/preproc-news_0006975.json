    "text": "Plane maker Boeing said on Tuesday it would buy aerospace parts company KLX for about $3.2 billion in cash to expand its aircraft services business.\nThe $63-per-share offer gives KLX an enterprise value of $4.25 billion, including about $1 billion of net debt.\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said last week its services growth would be complemented by strategic acquisitions.\nThe plane maker said there will be no change to its 2018 guidance or capital deployment strategy and expects annual cost savings of about $70 million by 2021.\nLast year, Boeing launched a services business, which announced deals worth nearly $1 billion in February, as it looks to capture more of the higher-margin services and spare-parts revenue after a plane is sold.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the news on Friday.",
