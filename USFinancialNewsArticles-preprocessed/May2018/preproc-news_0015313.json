Tennis - ATP World Tour - The BMW Open Semifinals - MTTC Iphitos, Munich, Germany - May 5, 2018 Germany's Alexander Zverev celebrates after winning his semi final match against South Korea's Chung Hyeon REUTERS/Michael Dalder\nThe German, who won his first title on home soil in Munich in 2017, will face Kohlschreiber in the final after the veteran eased to a 6-2 6-4 win over Maximilian Marterer in the other semi-final.\nMarterer, 22, had not lost a set en route to the last four but was no match for Kohlschreiber, who used his experience to cruise to victory in little over an hour.\nKohlschreiber, who is 34th in the world rankings, was slow to get off the mark as Marterer took a 2-1 lead in the first set but the 34-year-old settled into his stride to win 20 of the next 23 available points and eventually, seal the set.\nThe three-times Munich Open champion took a 5-2 lead in the second set before Marterer attempted a comeback. Kohlschreiber was unfazed by his opponent’s spirited efforts and closed out the match by winning four straight points.\nZverev, who was defeated by American John Isner at the Miami Open final in April, and Kohlschreiber will be targeting their first ATP title of the year.
