    "text": "Fourth Quarter Net Income Increased 36%\nFourth Quarter EPS $0.50 per share vs $0.37 per share\nDELRAY BEACH, Fla., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PetMed Express, Inc. (NASDAQ:PETS) today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $67.3 million, compared to $63.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 6.8%. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 net sales were $273.8 million, compared to $249.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 9.9%. The increase in sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 can be attributed to a 9.4% increase in reorder sales. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $10.2 million, or $0.50 diluted per share, compared to net income of $7.5 million, or $0.37 diluted per share, for the same quarter the prior year, an increase to net income of 36%. Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was $37.3 million, or $1.82 diluted per share, compared to net income of $23.8 million, or $1.17 diluted per share, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, an increase to net income of 57%. The Company’s online sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were approximately 85% of all sales, compared to 83% for the same quarter the prior year.\nMenderes Akdag, President and CEO, commented: “We were pleased with increases in sales during the fiscal year, along with an accelerated increase to net income. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 37.0% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 35.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase to gross profit margin can be attributed to a continued product mix shift to higher margin items. In addition, our net income growth was also boosted by the Tax Reform Act of 2017, where we saw a decline in our federal tax rate from 35% to a fiscal year 2018 blended rate of 31.5%. We expect a further reduction to our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019, to approximately 24%. Average order value was $89 for the March quarter compared to $86 for the same quarter the prior year. In fiscal 2019, we will look to build on past successes by focusing on sales growth and further improving our customer service levels.”\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share on its common stock. The dividend will be payable on May 25, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 18, 2018. The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends; however the declaration and payment of future dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a determination by the Board of Directors each quarter following its review of the Company’s financial performance.\nThis morning at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time, Mr. Akdag will host a conference call to review the year-end financial results. To access the call which is open to the public, dial (888) 455-1758 (toll free) or (203) 827-7025.
