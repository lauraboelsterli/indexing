    "text": "NEW ORLEANS, May 18, ClaimsFiler, a FREE shareholder information service, reminds investors that they have until June 25, 2018 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation (NYSE: MIC), if they purchased the Company's shares between February 22, 2016 and February 21, 2018, inclusive (the \"Class Period\").
