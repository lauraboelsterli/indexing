    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Air France ( AIRF.PA ) unions do not intend to renew their strike notice, two union officials said during a meeting on Monday, after the French carrier was plunged into turmoil by the resignation of its top boss.\nShares in parent Air France-KLM closed nearly 10 percent lower on Monday, after striking airline staff rejected a wage deal offered by managers and CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said on Friday he would step down. [nL8N1SE17N]\nStaff walked out again on Monday and were due to press on with planned stoppages on Tuesday, but unions did not intend to call for more strike days following their meeting, the officials said.\nInstead, labor representatives will demand to meet with Air France management, they said.
