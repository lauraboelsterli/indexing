    "text": "Total Votes:\nNot a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nSmall-cap stocks typically benefit when the dollar gains in value, whereas larger-cap stocks and multinational companies tend to feel the heat under the same conditions. Smaller companies deal with more domestic sales, typically without the burden of having to translate overseas revenue from foreign currencies back into dollar terms.\n\"Looking at the relative ratio between the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, you're seeing small caps begin to outperform versus the large caps, in conjunction with that turn in the dollar, and we think that continues. We're especially bullish on small-cap growth,\" Wald said.\nThe dollar is certainly going to be a headwind for the S&P 500 over small-cap stocks, said Stacey Gilbert, head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna. Small-cap companies also should feel benefits from tax reform, Gilbert said Tuesday on \"Trading Nation.\"\nOptions in the IWM , an ETF tracking the Russell 2000 and the SPY , an ETF tracking the S&P 500, are trading relatively close to the same price as a percent of their underlying index price, Gilbert said. This is a notably rare occurrence, and one that prompts Gilbert to suggest playing the options in small caps.\n\"Relative to the risk that's being priced into large caps, I think it's very attractive on the small-cap side,\" on a risk-reward basis, she said.\nThe Russell 2000 was up half a percent Wednesday.",
