    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 6:13 AM / Updated 32 minutes ago UK house price growth weaker than expected - Nationwide Reuters house prices rose more weakly than expected in May, figures from mortgage lender Nationwide showed on Thursday, the latest sign of how the countryâ€™s housing market has slowed since the 2016 Brexit vote.\nHouse prices were up by 2.4 percent in the year to May, down from a rise of 2.6 percent in April. It was a smaller increase than the median forecast of a 3.0 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists.\nPrices fell by 0.2 percent from April, the third time this year that they have declined on a monthly basis, the figures from Nationwide showed.
