    "text": "WETHERSFIELD, Conn., May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Seniorlink, Inc., a leading tech-enabled health services company, named Ross Davis, MSPT, MBA as the new Connecticut State Director for the company's subsidiary, Caregiver Homes. Serving nearly 500 families across Connecticut, Caregiver Homes is an intensive, in-home care program that connects caregivers with a dedicated team of trained clinicians, HIPAA-secure technology and a daily stipend â€“ all to ensure that their loved ones can receive care in the comfort of their home.\nDavis brings more than 20 years of experience working in health care, and focused his career on developing deep expertise in the safety and care of elders in their homes and communities. He most recently served as Area Director for Caregiver Homes of Massachusetts, which supports over 1500 families in the western and northern regions of the state. He also assisted with the rollout of Vela, Seniorlink's HIPAA-secure care collaboration platform that connects patients and their family caregivers with a professional care team and allows them to share real-time access to care plans.\nPrior to joining Seniorlink, Davis worked as a Director for Hartford HealthCare at Home, one of the largest Home Care Agencies in New England. As a recognized expert in treating those patients who are at risk of falls and helping to improve their functional mobility, Davis has taught clinical courses and seminars on fall management across the Northeast, further highlighting his commitment to helping seniors remain safe in the community.\n\"We're excited to have Ross lead our efforts in Connecticut, as we believe his expertise and dedication to helping caregivers and their loved ones will have a positive impact on patients and their family caregivers,\" said Thomas Riley, Chief Executive Officer of Seniorlink.\nSeniorlink provides care collaboration solutions that integrate and activate consumers, caregivers, payers and providers to deliver high-touch, person-centered care. The company's Caregiver Homes program is the first home and community-based service in the nation to receive the National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) highest level of Accreditation for Case Management, and is the only NCQA-approved provider for case management in all six states where the company operates today.\n\"I wholeheartedly believe that family caregivers are the backbone of how we can keep our loved ones in the home and help them maintain the highest quality of life. The healthcare system would be broken without the support of caregivers, and with Caregiver Homes, I look forward to supporting these remarkable individuals with the coaching, resources, and guidance they need to give them confidence in their role,\" said Davis. \"I am excited to work with both our organizational teams and community organizations in Connecticut to help local families not just live, but thrive.\"\nMore information about Seniorlink can be found at www.seniorlink.com .
