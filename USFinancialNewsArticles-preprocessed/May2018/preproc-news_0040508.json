    "text": "ALPINE, Utah, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Purple Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPL) (\"Purple\"), a comfort technology company known for creating the \"World's First No Pressure â„¢ Mattress,\" today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Summary\nNet revenue increased 102.4% to $61.0 million, compared to $30.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 43.3% as compared to 47.5% in the first quarter of 2017. Operating loss was $(2.9) million as compared to operating loss of $(2.0) million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating loss was $(0.6) million compared to adjusted operating loss of $(1.9) million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was $(3.6) million for the first quarter 2018 compared to a net loss of $(2.0) million in the year ago period. EBITDA was $(2.5) million compared to $(1.9) million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $(0.1) million compared to $(1.9) million in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"The strong top-line performance we delivered to start the year underscores our progress gaining share in the competitive direct-to-consumer mattress category,\" commented Terry Pearce, Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO. \"We experienced continued strong demand for the original Purple mattress as well as a positive response to the newer, higher-priced models that we introduced on our website during the first quarter. At the same time, we are pleased with the results of our test with Mattress Firm. Following solid sell-through of our product in the initial 51 test stores, we have increased our presence to 117 locations including three new geographies and have an additional 73 store expansion planned for the third quarter.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Review\nFirst quarter 2018 net revenue increased 102.4% to $61.0 million, compared to $30.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher direct-to-consumer demand for mattresses, including new higher-priced offerings launched online in February 2018, fueled by increased marketing investments and an improved manufacturing capacity to fulfill orders. The first quarter of 2018 also benefitted from contributions from mattress sales in the wholesale channel, which launched in the fourth quarter 2017.\nGross margin for the first quarter 2018 was 43.3% compared to 47.5% in the year ago period, and 43.7% for the full year 2017. The decrease was driven by inventory adjustments related to inefficiencies we experienced in quality control and the manufacturing process as we scaled the production of the new mattresses to meet higher than expected demand. In addition, we also experienced higher freight costs during the first quarter 2018 associated with the new model mattress launch as we initially flat-packed the new models as opposed to rolling them to achieve our February launch date. These additional costs were partially offset by the higher product margins of our new models.\nOperating expenses were $29.3 million in the first quarter 2018 compared to $16.3 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to higher marketing investments to expand brand awareness and drive direct-to-consumer demand for the Company's product portfolio as well as $2.4 million of one-time, non-recurring costs related to the business combination transaction with Global Partner Acquisition Corp and severance costs.\nOperating loss was $(2.9) million, compared to a loss of $(2.0) million in the prior year. Adjusted operating loss was $(0.6) million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $(1.9) million in first quarter 2017. First quarter 2018 excludes the one-time business combination transaction and severance costs.\nNet loss was $(3.6) million for the first quarter 2018 compared to a net loss of $(2.0) million in the year ago period.\nEBITDA for the first quarter 2018 was $(2.5) million compared to $(1.9) million in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes one-time, non-recurring costs related to the business combination transaction with Global Partner Acquisition Corp and severance costs was $(0.1) million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $(1.9) million last year.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $26.8 million compared to $3.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017. Inventories as of March 31, 2018 totaled $26.6 million compared with $13.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\n2018 Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects net revenue to be between $70.0 million and $73.0 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $(3.0) million to $(1.0) million.\nFor 2018, the Company now expects net revenue to be between $290.0 million and $310.0 million, an increase of between 47% and 57% over annual 2017, and adjusted EBITDA of approximately breakeven.\nTerry Pearce added, \"We continue to be very optimistic about the long-term prospects for Purple. In the near-term, we have adopted a more conservative top-line outlook to reflect increased pressure from online competition, lower online conversion rates in conjunction with the higher-priced models, and a slower than expected rollout of our wholesale business. Our revised revenue guidance is also based on the rising costs of digital advertising and marketing activities combined with our commitment to managing the business to breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis for 2018.\"\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nPurple Innovation, Inc. will host a live conference call to discuss financial results today, May 15, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

Statements based on historical data are not intended and should not be understood to indicate the Company's expectations regarding future events. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events or determinations. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside the Company's control, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ discussed in the forward-looking statements.

These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nA reconciliation of GAAP net loss to the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is provided below.
