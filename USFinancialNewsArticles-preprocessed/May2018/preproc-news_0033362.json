Bierkan, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We also made significant progress on our key strategic initiatives, particularly in terms of asset sales and debt reduction. During the quarter, we completed the sale of the Sheraton Philadelphia at an attractive valuation and successfully redeemed the legacy FelCor secured bonds. With an active disposition pipeline and other key initiatives on track, we expect to build on this momentum as we continue to unlock meaningful value going forward.”\nFinancial and Operating Results\nPerformance metrics such as Occupancy, Average Daily Rate (“ADR”), Revenue Per Available Room (“RevPAR”), Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA Margin are Pro forma. The prefix “Pro forma” as defined by the Company, denotes operating results which include results for periods prior to its ownership and excludes sold hotels. Pro forma RevPAR and Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin are reported on a comparable basis and therefore exclude any hotels sold during the period and non-comparable hotels that were not open for operation or were closed for renovation for comparable periods. Explanations of EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA Margin, FFO, and Adjusted FFO, as well as reconciliations of those measures to net income or loss, if applicable, are included within this release.\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased $2.1 million to $23.9 million, representing a 9.7% increase over the comparable period in 2017.\nPro forma RevPAR for the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased 0.7% over the comparable period in 2017, driven by a Pro forma ADR decrease of 0.8%, and by a Pro forma Occupancy increase of 0.1%. Excluding the headwinds from the Super Bowl in Houston, inauguration events in Washington DC, and renovation displacement, RevPAR would have been up 170 basis points. Three of the Company's markets achieved double digit RevPAR growth, Philadelphia, Orlando, and Chicago, which experienced RevPAR growth of 16.8%, 11.7%, 11.0%, respectively.\nPro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased 177 basis points over the comparable period in 2017 to 29.3%. Increases in real estate taxes and insurance impacted Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin by approximately 80 basis points.\nPro forma Hotel EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased $8.3 million to $124.0 million, representing a 6.3% decrease over the comparable period in 2017.

A complete listing of non-recurring items is provided in the Non-GAAP reconciliation tables located in this press release.\nNet cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, totaled $51.0 million, compared to $49.9 million for the comparable period in 2017.\nDispositions\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company sold the 229-room Embassy Suites Boston - Marlborough for $23.7 million in February 2018 and the 364-room Sheraton Philadelphia Society Hill for $95.5 million in March 2018. In aggregate, the Company has sold three legacy FelCor hotel properties since the merger with FelCor closed for almost $300 million at a combined 2017 EBITDA multiple of 15.2x.\nBalance Sheet\nOn January 25, 2018, the Company amended three of its unsecured term loans with an aggregate amount of $775.0 million. The maturity dates on the Company's $400.0 million unsecured term loan initially due March 2019, and $225.0 million unsecured term loan initially due November 2019, were extended to January 2023 and both term loans were amended with more favorable pricing. The Company's $150.0 million unsecured term loan due January 2022 was also amended with more favorable pricing.\nOn March 9, 2018, the Company completed the early redemption of all of the outstanding 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 issued by FelCor Lodging Limited Partnership in the principal amount of $524.0 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $401.9 million of unrestricted cash on its balance sheet, $300.0 million available on its revolving credit facility, and $2.6 billion of debt outstanding.\nThe Company’s ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month period ended March 31, 2018, was 4.0 times (excluding preferred equity).\nDividends\nThe Company’s Board of Trustees declared a cash dividend of $0.33 per common share of beneficial interest in the first quarter. The dividend was paid on April 13, 2018, to shareholders of record as of March 29, 2018.\nThe Company's Board of Trustees declared a preferred dividend of $0.4875 on its Series A cumulative convertible preferred shares.

Following the payment, the remaining outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was $250.0 million.\nOn April 10, 2018, the Company announced that President and Chief Executive Officer Ross H. Bierkan will retire from the Company, effective at the end of the term of his existing employment agreement on August 22, 2018. In alignment with the Board’s executive succession planning, the Board of Trustees has named Leslie D. Hale as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective August 22, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company’s outlook includes all hotels owned as of May 9, 2018. Potential future acquisitions or dispositions could result in a material change to the Company’s outlook. The 2018 outlook is also based on a number of other assumptions, many of which are outside the Company’s control and all of which are subject to change.\nKey revisions to the Company's full year 2018 guidance reflect:\nAn increase to the low-end of the Pro forma RevPAR growth range by 50 basis points based on first quarter operating performance. A net reduction to Pro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by $5 million at the midpoint driven by: A $4 million increase to the low-end of Pro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA based on first quarter operating performance. A $7 million reduction to Pro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA due to the sale of the Sheraton Philadelphia Society Hill Hotel.\nAdditionally, key assumptions underlying the Company's full year 2018 guidance that remain unchanged:\nApproximately 100 basis points of renovation related RevPAR disruption. RevPAR headwinds related to tough comps from last year's hurricane recovery efforts of approximately 50 basis points. Margin impact from property real estate taxes and insurance increases, partially driven by the impact from Proposition 13 on FelCor's California hotels, of approximately 60 to 70 basis points.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company anticipates:\nCurrent Outlook Prior Outlook Pro forma RevPAR growth -0.5% to +1.0% -1.0% to +1.0% Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin 31.25% to 32.5% 31.25% to 32.5% Pro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA $562M to $593M\n$565M to $600M\nAdjusted EBITDA $524M to $555M\n$527M to $562M\nCorporate Cash General & Administrative $37M to $39M\n$37M to $39M\nEarnings Call\nThe Company will conduct its quarterly analyst and investor conference call on May 10, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).

These generally are identified by the use of the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “will continue,” “intend,” “should,” or similar expressions. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such are based upon reasonable assumptions, beliefs, and expectations, such are not predictions of future events or guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the . Some factors that might cause such a difference include the following: the current global economic uncertainty, increased direct competition, changes in government regulations or accounting rules, changes in local, national, and global real estate conditions, declines in the lodging industry, seasonality of the lodging industry, risks related to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, hostilities, including future terrorist attacks or fear of hostilities that affect travel, the Company’s ability to obtain lines of credit or permanent financing on satisfactory terms, changes in interest rates, access to capital through offerings of the Company’s common and preferred shares of beneficial interest, or debt, the Company’s ability to identify suitable acquisitions, the Company’s ability to close on identified acquisitions and integrate those businesses, and inaccuracies of the Company’s accounting estimates. Given these uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The Company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on these and urges investors to carefully review the disclosures the Company makes concerning risks and uncertainties in the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report, as well as risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFor additional information or to receive press releases via email, please visit our website:\nhttp://www.rljlodgingtrust.com\nRLJ Lodging Trust\nNon-GAAP and Accounting Commentary\nNon-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) Financial Measures\nThe Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (4) EBITDAre, (5) Adjusted EBITDA, (6) Hotel EBITDA, and (7) Hotel EBITDA Margin. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of its operating performance. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA Margin as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company.\nFFO\nThe Company calculates Funds from Operations (“FFO”) in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\nThe Company’s calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing the Company to non-REITs. The Company presents FFO attributable to common shareholders, which includes unitholders of limited partnership interest (“OP units”) in RLJ Lodging Trust, L.P., the Company’s operating partnership, because the OP units are redeemable for common shares of the Company. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common shares and OP units.\nEBITDA and EBITDAre\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA\") is defined as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sales of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. The Company considers EBITDA useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from its operating results. In addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.\nIn addition to EBITDA, the Company presents EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, which defines EBITDAre as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDAre provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).\nAdjustments to FFO and EBITDAre\nThe Company adjusts FFO and EBITDAre for certain items that the Company considers outside the normal course of operations or extraordinary. The Company believes that Adjusted FFO and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income or loss, FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDAre, are beneficial to an investor’s understanding of its operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO and EBITDAre for the following items:\nTransaction Costs: The Company excludes transaction costs expensed during the period. Non-Cash Expenses: The Company excludes the effect of certain non-cash items such as the amortization of share-based compensation and non-cash income taxes. Other Non-Operational Expenses: The Company excludes the effect of certain non-operational expenses. The Company excludes hurricane-related costs not reimbursed by insurance, property-level severance costs, debt modification and extinguishment costs, and other income and expenses outside the normal course of operations.\nThe Company previously presented Adjusted EBITDA in a similar manner, with the exception of the adjustments for noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures, which totaled less than $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The rationale for including 100% of Adjusted EBITDA for consolidated joint ventures with noncontrolling interests is that the full amount of any debt of these consolidated joint ventures is reported in our consolidated balance sheet and metrics using debt to EBITDA provide a better understanding of the Company’s leverage. This is also consistent with NAREIT’s definition of EBITDAre.\nHotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA Margin\nWith respect to Consolidated Hotel EBITDA, the Company believes that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and certain non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. The Company believes property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operational performance of the Company’s hotels and the effectiveness of its third-party management companies.\nPro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA includes prior ownership information provided by the sellers of the hotels for periods prior to our acquisition of the hotels, which has not been audited and excludes results from sold hotels as applicable. Pro forma Hotel EBITDA and Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin exclude the results of any non-comparable hotels that were under renovation or not open for the entirety of the comparable periods. The following is a summary of pro forma hotel adjustments:\nPro forma adjustments: Acquired hotels\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, no hotels were acquired.\nThe Company acquired the following hotels in August 2017 in conjunction with the FelCor merger:\nDoubleTree Suites by Hilton Austin DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Orlando - Lake Buena Vista Embassy Suites Atlanta - Buckhead Embassy Suites Birmingham Embassy Suites Boston - Marlborough Embassy Suites Dallas - Love Field Embassy Suites Deerfield Beach - Resort & Spa Embassy Suites Fort Lauderdale 17th Street Embassy Suites Los Angeles - International Airport/South Embassy Suites Mandalay Beach - Hotel & Resort Embassy Suites Miami - International Airport Embassy Suites Milpitas Silicon Valley Embassy Suites Minneapolis - Airport Embassy Suites Myrtle Beach - Oceanfront Resort Embassy Suites Napa Valley Embassy Suites Orlando - International Drive South/Convention Center Embassy Suites Phoenix - Biltmore Embassy Suites San Francisco Airport - South San Francisco Embassy Suites San Francisco Airport - Waterfront Embassy Suites Secaucus - Meadowlands Hilton Myrtle Beach Resort Holiday Inn San Francisco - Fisherman's Wharf San Francisco Marriott Union Square DoubleTree by Hilton Burlington Vermont, formerly the Sheraton Burlington Hotel & Conference Center Sheraton Philadelphia Society Hill Hotel The Fairmont Copley Plaza The Knickerbocker, New York The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel, Charleston The Vinoy Renaissance St. Petersburg Resort & Golf Club Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill Wyndham Houston - Medical Center Hotel & Suites Wyndham New Orleans - French Quarter Wyndham Philadelphia Historic District Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center Wyndham San Diego Bayside Wyndham Santa Monica At the Pier\nPro forma adjustments: Sold hotels\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the following hotels were sold:\nEmbassy Suites Boston - Marlborough was sold in February 2018 Sheraton Philadelphia Society Hill Hotel was sold in March 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the following hotel was sold:\nThe Fairmont Copley Plaza was sold in December 2017\nRLJ Lodging Trust\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\n(unaudited) Assets Investment in hotel properties, net $ 5,636,933 $ 5,791,925 Investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 23,254 23,885 Cash and cash equivalents 401,943 586,470 Restricted cash reserves 76,380 72,606 Hotel and other receivables, net of allowance of $577 and $510, respectively 76,833 60,011 Deferred income tax asset, net 57,457 56,761 Intangible assets, net 128,794 133,211 Prepaid expense and other assets 85,412 69,936 Total assets $ 6,487,006 $ 6,794,805 Liabilities and Equity Debt, net $ 2,621,737 $ 2,880,488 Accounts payable and other liabilities 192,352 225,664 Deferred income tax liability 5,547 5,547 Advance deposits and deferred revenue 37,337 30,463 Accrued interest 15,059 17,081 Distributions payable 65,574 65,284 Total liabilities 2,937,606 3,224,527 Equity Shareholders’ equity: Preferred shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares, $0.01 par value, 12,950,000 shares authorized; 12,879,475 shares issued and outstanding, liquidation value of $328,266, at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 366,936 366,936 Common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value, 450,000,000 shares authorized; 175,205,952 and 174,869,046 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively 1,752 1,749 Additional paid-in capital 3,210,185 3,208,002 Accumulated other comprehensive income 26,703 8,846 Distributions in excess of net earnings (123,144 ) (82,566 ) Total shareholders’ equity 3,482,432 3,502,967 Noncontrolling interest: Noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures 11,540 11,700 Noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership 10,998 11,181 Total noncontrolling interest 22,538 22,881 Preferred equity in a consolidated joint venture, liquidation value of $45,458 and $45,430 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively 44,430 44,430 Total equity 3,549,400 3,570,278 Total liabilities and equity $ 6,487,006 $ 6,794,805 Note:\nThe corresponding notes to the consolidated financial statements can be found in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
