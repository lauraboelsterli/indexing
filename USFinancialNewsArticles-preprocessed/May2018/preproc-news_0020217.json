    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ASV Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASV), a leading provider of rubber-tracked compact track loaders and wheeled skid steer loaders in the compact construction equipment market, today announced First Quarter 2018 results.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported Net Sales of $29.9 million and a Net Loss of $(0.3) million or $(0.03) per share compared to Net Sales of $28.0 million and Net Income of $0.2 million or $0.03 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\n$29.9 million in Net Sales represented a year-over-year increase of 6.8% over $28.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Machine sales revenues to North American distribution grew 31% compared to first quarter 2017. Approximately 50% of this growth was from dealers signed before December 31, 2017. Total machine sales revenues increased year-over-year by 13.5% to $21.2 million. Adjusting for the costs of relocating the distribution center, adjusted first quarter 2018 net income* of $0.2 million or $0.02 per share, compared to first quarter 2017 adjusted pro forma C Corporation net loss of $(0.1) million or $(0.02) per share. EBITDA of $1.3 million or 4.2% of sales compared to $2.3 million or 8.3% of sales of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA* of $2.0 million or 6.7% of sales compared to first quarter 2017 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 million or 7.1% of sales. Completed relocation of aftermarket parts distribution center to Grand Rapids, MN. Added 26 additional dealer / rental locations in the quarter.\n*The Glossary at the end of this press release contains further details regarding reconciliation of GAAP items and Adjusted and Pro-forma items.\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Rooke commented, “Our focus on rebuilding the North American ASV dealership network resulted in 31% year-over-year growth in North American ASV machine sales, and we anticipate continued strength in North America throughout the year. Australia’s record Q1 performance last year did not repeat, however, we anticipate this region to generate healthy sales and growth in 2018. We expect bottom line improvement throughout the year through higher net sales, product mix improvement, and the cost benefits from higher plant utilization, and from engineering and manufacturing efficiencies. Although the possible effect on demand of recently implemented surcharge pricing to offset higher steel and aluminum costs is a potential headwind, our products continue to see a healthy level of demand, and our dealer network continues to grow. We are working hard to achieve gradual margin expansion and higher levels of EBITDA margin and profitability as we scale and grow the business.”\nMissi How, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “Adjusting for relocation costs that were incurred in the quarter, we were able to achieve a positive adjusted net income of 2 cents per share versus a loss last year. While this is satisfactory, we understand there is more work to do. We believe that cost and efficiency savings from relocating the parts distribution facility will start in the second quarter and we have already achieved the projected $200,000 quarterly reduction in our interest expense from our recent debt restructuring, which will continue throughout the year. Our current ratio of 2.1 remains healthy, our leverage ratio at 2.6x trailing adjusted EBITDA is well within target range, and we will continue to pay down debt with our cash flow during the year.”\nConference Call:\nManagement will host a conference call at 4:30 PM Eastern Time today to discuss the results with the investment community.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less the gain or loss related to non-recurring events. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of our operating performance and provide meaningful measures of overall corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method and timing of expenditures associated with building and placing our products. EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it is frequently used by investment analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it provides a measure of our recurring core business.\nHowever, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized earnings measures under generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as alternatives to net income or loss or other income statement data (which are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP) as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity and cash flows. Management’s method of calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may the method used by other companies and accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nReconciliation of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA (in millions except percentages)\nFor the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net (loss) income ($0.3 ) $ 0.2 Interest expense 0.5 0.9 Depreciation & amortization 1.2 1.2 Income tax benefit (0.1 ) - EBITDA (1) $ 1.3 $ 2.3 % of Sales 4.2 % 8.3 % EBITDA $ 1.3 $ 2.3 Costs of ConExpo trade show (2) - 0.1 Revision to accrual for legal proceeding expenses less legal costs (3)\n- (0.2 ) Stock compensation and transaction related compensation costs (4) 0.1 0.1 Aftermarket parts distribution center relocation (5) 0.6 - Adjusted EBITDA (6) $ 2.0 $ 2.4 Adjusted EBITDA as % of net revenues 6.8 % 8.5 % Pro-forma adjustment for public company costs - (0.4 ) Pro-forma Adjusted EBITDA* (7) $ 2.0 $ 2.0 % of Sales 6.7 % 7.1 % The Company converted to a C corporation in May 2017, so the three months ended March 31, 2017 include a pro forma adjustment for approximately $0.4 million of public company costs not included in EBITDA.\n(1) EBITDA is defined as income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The table above reconciles net income to EBITDA. See “—Cautionary Statements Regarding Non-GAAP Measures” for further information regarding EBITDA.\n(2) Costs associated with the 2017 ConExpo trade show. The ConExpo show, which is held every three years, was held in Las Vegas in March of this year. This show is an international gathering place for the construction industries. It is estimated that 130,000 professionals from around the world attended the show.\n(3) Revision to accrual for legal proceeding expenses is included in Adjusted EBITDA since it is an adjustment in the period to an accrual established at the formation of the Joint Venture and is not representative of the operating activity in the reported period. This adjustment was due to the settlement of a legal claim lower than the accrued cost.\n(4) Stock compensation and IPO transaction related compensation costs.\n(5) Aftermarket Parts Distribution Center relocation costs are restructuring costs related to the movement of the ASV aftermarket parts operation from Southaven Memphis to a facility adjacent to the Company principal premises in Grand Rapids MN, which commenced in quarter four of 2017 and was completed in quarter one of 2018.\n(6) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less the gain or loss related to non-recurring events. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The table above reconciles EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. See “—Cautionary Statements Regarding Non-GAAP Measures” for further information regarding EBITDA.\n(7) 2017 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less public company costs.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted Net Income (in millions except shares and EPS) For the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net (loss) income as reported ($0.3 ) $ 0.2 Revision to legal costs accrual - - Aftermarket parts distribution center relocation- net of tax effect 0.5 - Loss on debt extinguishment - - Pro-forma adjustment for public company costs - (0.4 ) Pro-forma income before tax 0.2 (0.2 ) Pro forma (C corporation basis) tax $ 0.0 $ 0.1 Adjusted net income (loss) $ 0.2 ($0.1 ) Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 9,816,000 8,000,000 Basic and Diluted (loss) earnings per share as reported ($0.03 ) $ 0.03 Total EPS Effect $ 0.05 ($0.05 ) Adjusted (pro forma C Corporation) earnings (loss) per share $ 0.02 ($0.02 ) *Pro forma adjustments for public company costs and (C corporation basis) tax expense: The company converted from a LLC to a corporation on May 11, 2017. The pro forma adjustments reflect the actual public company costs incurred in 2018 as if the company had been a corporation for the same period in 2017, and a pro forma (C corporation basis) tax charge on 2017 income at a tax rate of 36%.\nCurrent Ratio\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Current Assets $46,432 $46,533 Current Liabilities $22,079 $23,406 Current Ratio 2.1 2.0 Days Sales Outstanding, (DSO), is calculated by taking the sum of net trade and related party receivables divided by annualized sales per day (sales for the quarter, multiplied by 4, and the sum divided by 365).\nDays Payables Outstanding, (DPO), is calculated by taking the sum of net trade and related party payables divided by annualized cost of sales per day (cost of goods sold for the quarter, multiplied by 4, and the sum divided by 365).\nDebt net of deferred financing costs is calculated using the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet amounts for 1) deferred financing costs – revolving loan facility, 2) note payable – short term, 3) revolving loan facility and 4) note payable – long term net. Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated by dividing total debt at the balance sheet date by trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA.\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Note payable – short term 2,000 2,000 Deferred financing costs – revolving loan facility (280) (298) Revolving loan facility 13,594 12,511 Note payable – long term -net 12,181 12,664 Debt $27,495 $26,877 Inventory turns are calculated by multiplying cost of goods sold for the referenced three-month period by 4 and dividing that figure by inventory as at the referenced period.\nNet working capital as a % of annualized last quarter’s sales is the sum of accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable divided by the last quarter’s sales annualized (x4).\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Accounts receivable 17,077 18,352 Inventory 28,029 26,691 Accounts payable (15,800) (16,237) Net working capital $29,306 $28,806 Last quarters annualized sales (LQS) 119,480 121,820 Net working capital % of LQS 24.5% 23.6% Working capital is calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities.\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Total Current Assets $46,432 $46,533 Less: Total Current Liabilities 22,079 23,406 Working Capital $24,353 $23,127\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508005637/en/\nASV Holdings, Inc.\nAndrew Rooke, 218-327-5389\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nandrew.rooke@asvi.com\nor\nInvestor Relations:\nDarrow Associates Inc.\nPeter Seltzberg, 516-419-9915\nManaging Director\npseltzberg@darrowir.com\nSource: ASV Holdings, Inc.",
