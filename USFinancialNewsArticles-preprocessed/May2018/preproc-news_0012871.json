This compares to the Company’s portfolio as of December 31, 2017, as of which date the fair value of our investments was approximately $1,967,531, comprised of 107 investments in 90 portfolio companies/investment fund across 28 industries with 57 sponsors.\nAs of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, investments consisted of the following:\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Type—% of Fair Value Fair Value % of\nFair Value Fair Value % of\nFair Value First Lien Debt (excluding First Lien/Last Out) $ 1,242,310 64.92 % $ 1,293,641 65.75 % First Lien/Last Out Unitranche 233,564 12.21 237,635 12.08 Second Lien Debt 217,707 11.38 246,233 12.51 Equity Investments 18,812 0.98 17,506 0.89 Investment Fund 201,066 10.51 172,516 8.77 Total $ 1,913,459 100.00 % $ 1,967,531 100.00 % The following table shows our investment activity for the three month period ended March 31, 2018:\nFunded Sold/Repaid Principal amount of investments: Amount % of Total Amount % of Total First Lien Debt (excluding First Lien/Last Out) $ 65,783 54.39 % $ (117,619 ) 68.38 % First Lien/Last Out Unitranche 1,231 1.02 (394 ) 0.23 Second Lien Debt 25,582 21.15 (53,990 ) 31.39 Equity Investments 500 0.41 — — Investment Fund 27,850 23.03 — — Total $ 120,946 100.00 % $ (172,003 ) 100.00 % Overall, total investments at fair value decreased by 2.7%, or $54,072, during the three month period ended March 31, 2018 after factoring in repayments, sales, net fundings on revolvers and delayed draws and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation).\nTotal investments at fair value held by Middle Market Credit Fund (“Credit Fund”) increased by 10.7%, or $105,575, during the three month period ended March 31, 2018 after factoring in repayments, sales, net fundings on revolvers and delayed draws and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation). As of March 31, 2018, Credit Fund had total investments at fair value of $1,090,348, which was comprised 99.4% of first lien senior secured loans and 0.6% of second lien senior secured loans at fair value. All investments in the Credit Fund portfolio were floating rate debt investments with interest rate floors.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the weighted average yields for our first and second lien debt investments on an amortized cost basis were 9.01% and 10.82%, respectively, with a total weighted average yield of 9.24%. Weighted average yields include the effect of accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums and are based on interest rates as of March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, on a fair value basis, approximately 0.8% of our debt investments bear interest at a fixed rate and approximately 99.2% of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors.\nAs part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as “Internal Risk Ratings”:\nInternal Risk Ratings Definitions\nRating Definition 1 Performing—Low Risk: Borrower is operating more than 10% ahead of the base case. 2 Performing—Stable Risk: Borrower is operating within 10% of the base case (above or below). This is the initial rating assigned to all new borrowers. 3 Performing—Management Notice: Borrower is operating more than 10% below the base case. A financial covenant default may have occurred, but there is a low risk of payment default. 4 Watch List: Borrower is operating more than 20% below the base case and there is a high risk of covenant default, or it may have already occurred. Payments are current although subject to greater uncertainty, and there is moderate to high risk of payment default. 5 Watch List—Possible Loss: Borrower is operating more than 30% below the base case. At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have occurred. Loss of principal is possible. 6 Watch List—Probable Loss: Borrower is operating more than 40% below the base case, and at the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have already occurred. Additionally, the prospects for improvement in the borrower’s situation are sufficiently negative that impairment of some or all principal is probable. Our Investment Adviser’s risk rating model is based on evaluating portfolio company performance in comparison to the base case when considering certain credit metrics including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA and net senior leverage as well as specific events including, but not limited to, default and impairment.\nOur Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. In connection with our quarterly valuation process, our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings on a regular basis. The following table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings of our debt portfolio as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Fair Value % of Fair Value Fair Value % of Fair Value (dollar amounts in millions) Internal Risk Rating 1 $ 66.3 3.91 % $ 73.7 4.15 % Internal Risk Rating 2 1,324.3 78.20 1,399.6 78.74 Internal Risk Rating 3 142.1 8.39 170.2 9.57 Internal Risk Rating 4 134.6 7.95 103.3 5.81 Internal Risk Rating 5 26.3 1.55 30.7 1.73 Internal Risk Rating 6 — — — — Total $ 1,693.6 100.00 % $ 1,777.5 100.00 % As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of our debt investment portfolio was 2.3 and 2.2, respectively.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nTotal investment income for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $47,483 and $49,510, respectively. This $2,027 net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income and other income from our debt portfolio and a decrease in interest income from Credit Fund, partially offset by an increase in dividend income from Credit Fund, during the three month period ended March 31, 2018.\nTotal expenses for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $22,353 and $22,994, respectively. This $641 net decrease during the three month period ended March 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in management fees as a result of an decrease in investments, a decrease in incentive fees, and a decrease in professional fees.\nDuring the three month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net realized loss and change in unrealized depreciation of $(4,041). This was primarily due to net change in unrealized depreciation on our debt investments from changes in various inputs utilized under our valuation methodology, including, but not limited to, market spreads, leverage multiples and borrower ratings, and the impact of exits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $45,610, notes payable (before debt issuance costs) of $273,000, and secured borrowings outstanding of $527,865. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $285,135 of remaining commitments and $178,258 available for additional borrowings on its revolving credit facilities, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions.\nDividend\nOn May 2, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, which is payable on July 17, 2018 to stockholders of record as of June 29, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. EDT on Friday, May 4, 2018 to discuss these quarterly financial results.
