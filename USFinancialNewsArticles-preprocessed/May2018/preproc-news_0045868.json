Most countries have their Israel embassies in Tel Aviv, arguing that the status of Jerusalem must be determined in future talks.\nOn the day the United States opened its new embassy, Israeli troops killed 60 Palestinian demonstrators at the border in Gaza. Israel says the violence was incited by Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza. Hamas denies blame.\nThe Rabat city council had previously planned to vote on a twinning project with Guatemala City last week. Guatemala opened an embassy in Rabat, its second in Africa, in November 2017. Reporting by Ahmed ElJechtimi; Editing by Ulf Laessing and Peter Graff",
