If he is going to impose sanctions similar to those the U.S. had in 2012, that would likely to cause a shortage in oil,\" said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity economist at Nomura Securities.\nIn addition, falls in Venezuelan oil production due to problems at the country's oil company PDVSA also added to the rally.\nU.S. crude futures last traded at $70.04 per barrel, down 1.0 percent from Monday's settlement price.\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude futures stood at $75.62 per barrel, down 0.7 percent, having risen as high as $76.34 on Monday.\nWhile caution on Trump's statement kept many investors on edge, Asian shares made small gains, led by technology firms.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.2 percent, with information technology shares rising 0.4 percent. Japan's Nikkei was almost flat.\nOn Wall Street on Monday, the S&P 500 gained 0.35 percent, boosted by Apple's sixth straight day of gains.\nIn currency markets, the dollar broadly held firm on the prospect of solid U.S. economic growth, helped partly by Trump's tax cuts and spending, pointed to further rises in U.S. interest rates down the road.\nThat prompted investors to buy back dollars they had sold earlier this year on worries about Trump's protectionist trade policies.\nThe euro hit a four-month low of $1.1897 on Monday and last stood at $1.1924.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar stood little changed at 109.07 yen, off its three-month high of 110.05 yen.\nThe combination of higher oil prices, a strong dollar and higher U.S. rates is risky for some emerging market assets as it could significantly worsen their trade balance and also encourage investors to shift funds to higher-yielding U.S. assets.\nJPMorgan's emerging market bond index hit the lowest level in more than a year.\nThe Indian rupee hit a 15-month low while the Indonesian rupiah hit its lowest level in 2-1/2 years on Monday.\nThe divergence between developed and emerging markets was also visible in equity prices. Brazil's Bovespa hit three-month lows while Germany's Dax hit three-month highs and Italian shares hit 8-1/2-year highs.\n(Editing by Sam Holmes)",
