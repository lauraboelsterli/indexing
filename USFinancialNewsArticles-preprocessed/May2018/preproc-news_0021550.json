    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will diversify its international reserves further, President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin walks before an inauguration ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow. Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool via REUTERS “The monopoly of the U.S. dollar is not reliable enough, it is dangerous for many,” Putin told Russia’s lower house of parliament.\nRussia held 45.8 percent of its reserves in U.S. dollars as of Jan. 1, 2018, the central bank data showed last week.\nThe central bank also holds other currencies in state reserves, which last stood at $460.4 billion. A significant part of the reserves is held in gold.\nReporting by Denis Pinchuk; Writing by Katya Golubkova; Editing by Andrey Ostroukh\n ",
