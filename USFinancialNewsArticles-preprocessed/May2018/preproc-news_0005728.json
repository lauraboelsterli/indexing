    "text": "(Reuters) - Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co have sided with German producer of building materials Gebr Knauf KG in its $5.9 billion bid for U.S. gypsum manufacturer USG Corp ( USG.N ), Knauf said on Monday.\nThe firms have issued reports recommending that USG shareholders vote against all four of USG’s director nominees at USG’s annual shareholder meeting on May 9, to send a message that the company must engage in negotiations.\nUSG is under pressure to enter into discussions with Knauf after rejecting a $42 per share offer in March. USG shares ended trading on Monday at $40.23.\nUSG has argued Knauf’s bid undervalued the company despite USG’s largest shareholder, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ), offering to sell its 31 percent stake at that price.\n“Progressive engagement between the parties has stalled due to the USG board’s response, namely its refusal to either make a clear counteroffer (one that will not intensify shareholder skepticism) or structure and initiate appropriate limited diligence,” Knauf said in a statement, citing ISS’s report.\nTo be sure, even a resounding vote against the company would not be in any way binding for USG, which has a staggered board, meaning only four of its 10 directors face a shareholder vote this year. It also has a “poison pill” defense available, preventing Knauf from launching a hostile bid.\nReporting by Harry Brumpton in New York; Editing by Chris Reese\n ",
