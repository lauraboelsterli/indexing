    "text": "NORFOLK, Va., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PRA Group (Nasdaq:PRAA), a global leader in acquiring and collecting nonperforming loans, today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2018. The Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.47 compared to $1.03 in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 included a net, after-tax gain of approximately $27 million on the sale of the Government Services business.\nFirst Quarter Business Highlights\nRecord global cash collections of $426.6 million, an increase of 12% compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven by operational efforts and portfolio purchasing. Nearly 3,100 full-time U.S. based collectors, an increase of 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Record Estimated Remaining Collections (ERC), driven by portfolio purchases and increases in cash collection estimates.\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\nERC of $5.78 billion which increased $634.5 million from the prior year quarter and $73.7 million sequentially. Net finance receivable revenue of $217.7 million compared to $194.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Income from operations of $53.6 million compared to $53.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to PRA Group, Inc. of $21.1 million compared to $48.2 million in the prior year quarter. The first quarter of 2017 included a net, after-tax gain of approximately $27 million on the sale of Government Services. Investment in portfolios of $168.3 million compared to $227.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, including an increase of 14% in Americas Core.\n“Since the middle of 2016, PRA has been hiring U.S. based collectors and has opened two new call centers to meet the needs of our existing portfolios and future purchases. This quarter shows the results of those efforts with a 22% increase in cash collections in the U.S. call centers and a record quarter of global cash collections,” said Kevin Stevenson, president and chief executive officer of PRA Group. “Hiring and operational improvements, together with record portfolio purchases in 2017, continue to drive increases in cash collections. The hiring of additional collectors has done exactly what we communicated it would – allowed us to address our portfolios more appropriately, and that is reflected in our results. I am impressed, but not surprised, that our team has been able to accommodate this growth.”\nCash Collections and Revenues\nThe following table presents cash collections by quarter and by source on an as reported and currency-adjusted basis:\nCash Collection Source 2018 2017\n($ in thousands) Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Americas-Core $ 246,237 $ 204,245 $ 212,756 $ 217,020 $ 226,906 Americas-Insolvency 55,280 59,103 60,436 53,163 49,813 Europe-Core 118,109 107,124 102,681 99,121 98,081 Europe-Insolvency 6,954 5,794 5,961 5,371 5,030 Total Cash Collections $ 426,580 $ 376,266 $ 381,834 $ 374,675 $ 379,830 Cash Collection Source - Constant Currency Adjusted 2018 2017 ($ in thousands) Q1 Q1 Americas-Core $ 246,237 $ 226,405 Americas-Insolvency 55,280 49,997 Europe-Core 118,109 111,143 Europe-Insolvency 6,954 5,699 Total Cash Collections $ 426,580 $ 393,244 Cash collections in the quarter increased 12% compared to the first quarter of 2017. U.S. call center cash collections increased 22% primarily from record portfolio acquisitions in 2017 and reaching appropriate staffing levels in the U.S. call centers. This was partially offset by decreases in Brazil cash collections and U.S. legal cash collections. Americas Insolvency cash collections increased 11% primarily as a result of record portfolio purchases in 2017. Cash collections on fully amortized pools were $15.6 million, an increase of $2.1 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. Cash collections on nonaccrual pools were $17.5 million. Net finance receivable revenue increased 12% compared to the prior year period due to yield increases on certain pools in Americas Core and Europe Core, as well as record portfolio purchases in the Americas during 2017. Fee income declined $4.5 million primarily as a result of the sale of two fee-based subsidiaries in 2017.\nExpenses\nOperating expenses in the quarter increased largely due to compensation and employee services and communication expenses. The increase in compensation and employee services expense is due to the hiring of U.S. based collectors as the Company accommodates growth in the U.S. supply of nonperforming loans. Communication expenses increased largely due to higher letter and call volume associated with record portfolio purchases in the U.S. during 2017 and approximately 1,100 additional collectors operating during the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, the Company recorded $5.4 million in pre-tax, noncash interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs, a $3.7 million gain on interest rate swap agreements, and $1.2 million in amortization of intangible assets. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.9% reflecting the effects of U.S. tax reform and changes in mix of projected taxable income among jurisdictions.\nPortfolio Acquisitions\nPRA Group invested $168.3 million in finance receivables in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, the Company had in place forward flow commitments in the amount of $351.3 million.\nPortfolio Purchase Source 2018 2017\n($ in thousands) Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Americas-Core $ 131,427 $ 160,278 $ 115,572 $ 144,871 $ 115,166 Americas-Insolvency 13,436 44,195 73,497 100,040 67,123 Europe-Core 18,000 152,417 14,695 42,876 39,505 Europe-Insolvency 5,392 17,698 7,146 7,860 6,020 Total Portfolio Purchasing $ 168,255 $ 374,588 $ 210,910 $ 295,647 $ 227,814 Conference Call Information\nPRA Group will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss results with institutional investors and stock analysts.
