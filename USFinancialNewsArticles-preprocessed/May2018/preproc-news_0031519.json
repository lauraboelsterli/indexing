Mobile cranes prepare to stack containers at Thar Dry Port in Sanand, Gujarat October 1, 2012. REUTERS/Amit Dave/Files\nMerchandise exports for April rose 5.2 percent from a year ago to $25.9 billion.\nGoods imports last month were $39.6 billion, a gain of 4.6 percent from a year ago, data from the commerce and industry ministry showed.\nThe trade deficit for 2017/18 fiscal year ending in March grew to $156.8 billion from $105.72 billion in the previous year, mainly driven by a rising oil import bill - a growing concern for the central bank.
