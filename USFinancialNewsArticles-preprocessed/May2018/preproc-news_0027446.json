    "text": "TORONTO, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Granite Real Estate Investment Trust (\"Granite\") (TSX: GRT.UN) (NYSE: GRP.U) announced today that it has agreed to acquire a portfolio of four Class A, single tenanted buildings totaling approximately 3.8 million square feet on 78 acres of land near Columbus, Ohio (the \"Acquisition\") at a purchase price of US$232.5 million, representing an in-going stabilized yield of approximately 6.0%. The properties are located in West Jefferson which is approximately 20 miles west of Columbus. Key highlights of the Acquisition include:\nLocated in the greater Columbus industrial market, which has emerged as a major distribution corridor in the United States due to its central location, excellent interstate highway system and strong labour base; A diverse tenant base comprised of large public and global private entities; The buildings are modern e-commerce distribution facilities with an average age of approximately 7 years; Tenants in two of the buildings have expansion options of at least 200,000 square feet; The buildings are single tenanted and are currently 100% occupied; and While one of the tenants is currently in liquidation and may vacate the building 743,600 square foot building, Granite believes the re-leasing prospects for this building are strong.\nThe Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and closing is anticipated to take place later in May 2018. Granite expects to fund the purchase through a combination of cash on hand, largely from the proceeds of the dispositions that occurred in January 2018, and a drawdown of its unsecured credit facility.\nSummary of property details:\nAddress\nGLA\nLease Term\nTenant Industry\n15 Commerce Parkway\n1,305,000\n4.0\nPet Food Distribution\n10 Enterprise Parkway\n534,040\n6.4\nHardware Distribution\n100 Enterprise Parkway\n1,223,780\n10.4\nHome Furnishing Distribution\n115 Enterprise Parkway\n743,600\n7.3\nConsumer Retail Distribution\nWALT (1)\nTotal\n3,806,420\n7.0\n(1) Weighted average lease term (WALT) includes the lease term of the tenant in liquidation\nMichael Forsayeth, Granite's CEO, commented that \"This acquisition will be immediately accretive to funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations and is another strategic milestone in Granite's transformation from a largely single tenanted REIT to a broadly tenanted, globally diversified industrial real estate business. As a result of this acquisition and initiatives announced earlier in the year, significant progress has been made towards Granite's strategic priorities including a reduction in Magna concentration from 61% at the beginning of the year to 52% as measured by gross leasable area. Also, on a run rate basis, Granite will have made substantial progress towards replacing the cash flow from the 10 properties sold earlier in the year.\"\nABOUT GRANITE\nGranite is a Canadian-based REIT engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership and management of predominantly industrial, warehouse and logistics properties in North America and Europe. Granite owns over 85 rental income properties representing approximately 30 million square feet of leasable area.
