    "text": "\"There's no time like the present to modify our current missile defense posture,\" Karako added, saying it was \"unfortunate that we have let Russia come this far.\"\nThe Russians are expected to conduct a fourth test sometime this summer.\nSources familiar with the U.S. intelligence reports assess that the Russian hypersonic glide vehicles are equipped with onboard countermeasures that are able to defeat even the most advanced missile-defense systems. The weapons are also highly maneuverable and, therefore, unpredictable, which makes them difficult to track.\nThe intelligence reports, which were curated this spring, calculate that Russia's hypersonic glide vehicles are likely to achieve initial operational capability by 2020, a significant step that would enable the Kremlin to surpass the U.S. and China in this regard. Putin goes all-in on hypersonic weapons\nDuring a state-of-the-nation address in March , Putin boasted about an arsenal of hypersonic nuclear weapons that he described as \"invincible.\"\nPutin claimed Avangard was capable of reaching targets at a speed of 20 times the speed of sound and strikes \"like a fireball.\"\nHe also said that the hypersonic warhead had already entered serial production. RU-RTR Russian Television via AP In this video grab provided by RU-RTR Russian television via AP television on Thursday, March 1, 2018, a computer simulation shows the Avangard hypersonic vehicle en route to target.\n\"I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country's development: You have failed to contain Russia,\" Putin said.\nPutin added that the new capabilities were \"not a bluff.\"\nIn an effort to back his bellicose rhetoric, Putin spoke in front of a projection showing video clips of the weapons as well as a simulated strike on the U.S. homeland. The U.S. is concerned about Russian hypersonics\nAmerica's top nuclear commander told lawmakers in March that U.S. forces are unable to shield against a hypersonic weapon.\n\"We don't have any defense that could deny the employment of such a weapon against us,\" Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee . \"Both Russia and China are aggressively pursuing hypersonic capabilities,\" he added, noting that the U.S. has \"watched them test those capabilities.\" EJ Hersom/Department of Defense photo\nHyten, who has previously called Russia the \"most significant threat\" to the U.S. , emphasized the need for the U.S. to add another type of nuclear weapon to its arsenal.\n\"I strongly agree with the need for a low-yield nuclear weapon,\" he said of the Pentagon's request for a low-yield warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles.\nWhile the Defense Department's latest budget request of $686 billion emphasizes a plan to offset emerging threats from Russia and China, it is clear that the U.S. lacks sufficient means to combat hypersonics.\nPresident Donald Trump touted the defense-friendly spending bill as a \"matter of national security\" and highlighted not only big-ticket defense procurements but also the significant increase in missile defense funding.\nHowever, even the $11.5 billion allocated for the Missile Defense Agency, the largest amount ever, may not be enough to fully modernize U.S. missile defense systems.\nKarako said the funding is a step in the right direction but emphasized that the U.S. must field systems in space and integrate them with land- and sea-based platforms in order to counter the full spectrum of missile threats.\n\"The thing that is missing from the FY18 omnibus and the FY19 request is space sensors,\" Karako said in a prior interview with CNBC. \"So tick tock, people, time is running out. The time for studies is over. Where is the plan to actually field some space sensors?\"\nKarako added that the missile-rich threat environment is getting more powerful and will put U.S. forces at risk.
