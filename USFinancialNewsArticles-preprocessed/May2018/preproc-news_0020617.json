    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 7:45 PM / in 6 minutes Nadal breaks McEnroe's record to reach Madrid quarters Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nMADRID (Reuters) - World number one Rafa Nadal set a new record of winning 50 consecutive sets on a single surface by beating Argentine Diego Schwartzman 6-3 6-4 on Thursday to reach the Madrid Open quarter-finals. Tennis - ATP 1000 - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 10, 2018 Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates winning his third round match against Argentina's Diego Schwartzman REUTERS/Susana Vera\nThe Mallorcan surpassed John McEnroe’s previous record of 49 consecutive sets on carpet which had stood since 1984 by seeing off 13th seed Schwartzman and claiming a 21st consecutive win on clay.\nNadal will face Austrian Dominic Thiem in the last eight on Friday in pursuit of a sixth Madrid Open title after beginning the claycourt season by winning an 11th Monte Carlo Masters and lifting the Barcelona Open trophy for the 11th time.\nWorld number six Juan Martin del Potro crashed out of the tournament after Serbia’s Dusan Lajovic came back from a set down to beat the Argentine 3-6 6-4 7-6(6) in the third round.\nDel Potro looked in complete control as he converted two break-point opportunities to take the opening set but Lajovic, ranked 95th in the world, dug deep to stay in the contest.

Tennis - ATP 1000 - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 10, 2018 Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates winning his third round match against Argentina's Diego Schwartzman REUTERS/Susana Vera\nBritain’s Kyle Edmund followed up his surprise win over Novak Djokovic by defeating world number 10 David Goffin to reach the last eight of an ATP Masters 1000 event for the first time in his career.\nThe 23-year-old broke his Belgian opponent’s serve twice in the opening set and once in the second, to seal a 6-3 6-3 victory in an hour and 12 minutes.\n“I managed my game very well,” the Briton said. “My game is better the better I manage it and pick the moments not to be aggressive.\n“If I don’t pull the trigger too often, then I play well. It’s about being controlled and relaxed and not worrying too much. Goffin is a top player so I’m very pleased.\n“My new trick is to try and continue that momentum and not just have a good win and not back it up.”\nEdmund will next face Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov, who achieved a 6-4 6-4 win over compatriot Milos Raonic.\n“It was definitely one of my best days on clay,” said 19-year-old Shapovalov, who is ranked 43rd in the world, 19 places below Raonic. “To be on the court against such a legend for me, and for my country, it was an honor.\n“What (Raonic) does for our country, for tennis, for these past couple years, it’s incredible. To beat him, it was a huge confidence booster for me.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru,; Editing by Neville Dalton and Ed Osmond",
