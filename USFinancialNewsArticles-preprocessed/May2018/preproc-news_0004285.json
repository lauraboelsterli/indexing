It is extremely rewarding to see our investments in LiveEngage, our go-to-market strategy, and our development capabilities pay off and translate into renewed double-digit growth.\"\n\"We are also achieving new records across multiple key performance indicators,\" added CFO Chris Greiner, \"including revenue retention, average revenue per customer, mobile interactions and deferred revenue, which further validates our opportunity in the multi-billion dollar Conversational Commerce space.\"\nCustomer Expansion\nDuring the first quarter, the Company signed contracts with the following new customers:\nA top U.K. mortgage provider with more than 15 million customers The credit card services arm for one of North America's largest luxury retailers A multi-billion dollar online gaming company A global payment processing and cash management software provider A national automotive and home insurance provider\nThe Company also expanded business with:\nSeveral large multinational telecommunications providers One of the 20 largest global financial institutions A leading European entertainment company A top 10 automotive manufacturer A multi-billion dollar designer of audio equipment\nNet Loss and Adjusted Net Income\nNet loss of 2018 was $3.2 million or $0.06 per share, as compared to a net loss of $5.7 million or $0.10 per share 2017. Adjusted net income of 2018 was $0.7 million or $0.01 per share, as compared to adjusted net income of $0.5 million or $0.01 per share 2017. Adjusted net income excludes amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, acquisition costs, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, other non-recurring charges and the related income tax effect of these adjustments.\nNet loss in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 included non-recurring expenses of $1.4 million ($0.03 per share) and $2.1 million ($0.04 per share), respectively, primarily associated with IP litigation.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of 2018 was $4.1 million or $0.07 per share, as compared to $3.3 million or $0.06 per share 2017. Adjusted EBITDA excludes provision for (benefit from) income taxes, other (income)/expense, net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, acquisition costs and other non-recurring charges.\nA reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release. An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company's cash balance was $57.7 million at March 31, 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company utilized approximately $0.7 million of cash from operations, and incurred capital expenditures of approximately $4.6 million. The Company also repurchased $1.3 million of stock and has $17.1 million remaining on its repurchase authorization.\nFinancial Expectations\nFollowing a strong start to the year, the Company is raising the midpoint of its 2018 revenue guidance. The 2018 revenue guidance range is now $239 million to $243 million, as compared to previously issued guidance of $237 million to $243 million.\nThe Company is also increasing guidance for net income, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA profit measures. Adjusted EBITDA guidance is increasing by $2 million to a range of $22 million to $25 million, from a previously issued range of $20 million to $23 million. The midpoint now equates to a 9.8% margin, which is 140 basis points higher than in 2017.\nUpdated profit guidance incorporates the Company's final view on ASC 606, which is immaterial to revenue, but is anticipated to benefit commission expenses due to a shift in the amortization period from over the contract life to over the average customer life, which is estimated as 3 to 5 years.\nThe Company's detailed financial expectations are as follows:\nSecond Quarter 2018\nGuidance\nRevenue (in millions)\n$59.0 - $60.0\nGAAP net loss per share\n$(0.13) - $(0.11)\nAdjusted net income per share\n$0.00 - $0.01\nDiluted adjusted EBITDA per share\n$0.06 - $0.07\nAdjusted EBITDA (in millions)\n$3.5 - $4.1\nFully diluted share count\n59.2 million\nFull Year 2018\nUpdated\nGuidance\nPrevious\nGuidance\nRevenue (in millions)\n$239.0 - $243.0\n$237.0 - $243.0\nGAAP net loss per share\n$(0.29) - $(0.23)\n$(0.35) - $(0.29)\nDiluted adjusted net income per share\n$0.11 - $0.15\n$0.07 - $0.10\nDiluted adjusted EBITDA per share\n$0.37 - $0.42\n$0.34 - $0.39\nAdjusted EBITDA (in millions)\n$22.0 - $25.0\n$20.0 - $23.0\nFully diluted share count\n59.0 million\n59.0 million\nOther Full Year 2018 Assumptions\nEstimated non-recurring expenses primarily tied to litigation of $6.2 million ($0.11 per share) Amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $3.0 million Stock-based compensation expense of approximately $13.5 million Depreciation of approximately $13.7 million Cash taxes paid of $2.0 million to $4.0 million.
