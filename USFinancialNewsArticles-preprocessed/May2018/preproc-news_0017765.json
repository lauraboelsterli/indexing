    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), a leader in storage, networking and connectivity semiconductor solutions, today announced that Ms. Bethany Mayer, former President and CEO of Ixia, and Ms. Donna Morris, Executive Vice President, Customer and Employee Experience at Adobe, have been appointed to the board.\n\"Marvell's solutions address the growing demand for greater network bandwidth and data access, areas in which Bethany brings deep expertise,\" said Matt Murphy, Marvell President and CEO. \"Her insights into the networking, high-speed communications and security markets will be great assets.\"\n\"Donna is a recognized expert in using customer and employee experience to drive business results,\" Murphy added. \"Marvell is focused on delivering a differentiated experience for both our customers and employees, which makes Donna's perspective immensely helpful as we continue to evolve and grow.\"\nIn addition, incumbent directors Ms. Gerri Elliott, who recently joined Cisco Systems as its new Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, and Mr. Peter Feld have notified Marvell that they will not be standing for re-election at the company's 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders to be held on June 28, 2018.\n\"I would like to thank both Gerri and Peter for their service on the Marvell board. I wish Gerri the best of luck in her new role at Cisco and wish Peter continued success at Starboard Value. Peter joined Marvell at a critical time for the Company and drove crucial changes that were needed to get the company back on track. His insights and influence as a director have catalyzed the changes that have transformed Marvell into a healthy, well-functioning company with strong financial results,\" said Murphy.\nPeter Feld stated, \"I am incredibly proud of the outstanding progress that Marvell has made over the past two years under the guidance of our renewed board and management team. From the beginning of our involvement, we believed that Marvell was a world class technology company with significant opportunity, but in need of improved leadership, focus, and financial discipline. Today, Marvell is in a very different place. The company is thriving and delivering outstanding results. It has been an absolute pleasure working with my fellow directors and our extremely capable management team and I will leave the board knowing that our investment is in strong hands. We remain confident in Marvell's future and intend to remain shareholders.\"\nAbout Bethany Mayer\nBethany Mayer is currently an executive partner with Siris Capital Group LLC.
