REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo/File Photo\nThe brand, which chief executive Marco Gobbetti is repositioning in a higher luxury segment, reported group revenue of 2.73 billion pounds ($3.7 billion), down 1 percent. Comparable same store sales rose 3 percent, in line with market forecasts.\n“While the task of transforming Burberry is still before us, the first steps we implemented to re-energise our brand are showing promising early signs,” Gobbetti said.\n“With Riccardo Tisci now on board and a strong leadership team in place, we are excited about the year ahead and remain fully focused on our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable value.”\nTisci replaced Burberry’s creative chief Christopher Bailey, who turned the trench coat maker into a global brand. His first collection will be shown in September.\nHis designs are key to Gobbetti’s strategy to reinvigorate Burberry, where sales have lagged luxury rivals.\nGobbetti set out a plan in November to take the label further up-market, but the company said there would be little, if any, growth in revenue and operating profit until its 2021 financial year as the program was implemented.\nBurberry said it had traded in line with its guidance since the start of its financial year on April 1.\nAnalysts were expecting the company to report adjusted operating profit of 453 million pounds, according to a company-provided consensus of 19 analyst forecasts.
