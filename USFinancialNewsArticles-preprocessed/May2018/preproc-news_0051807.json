    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 8:44 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago Top Greek court grants Turkish soldier asylum, rejects government appeal Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nATHENS (Reuters) - A Turkish soldier who fled with seven others to Greece after a failed coup attempt against President Tayyip Erdogan in 2016 should be granted asylum, a Greek court ruled on Wednesday, prompting an angry response from Ankara.\nThe Council of State, Greece’s top administrative court, rejected an appeal by the leftist-led government against an administrative decision by an asylum board to grant asylum to the Turkish soldier, a judicial source said.\nThe case has posed a dilemma for Athens, keen to keep relations with Ankara on an even keel but also demonstrate respect for the independence of the judiciary.\nTurkey has demanded the eight soldiers are handed over, accusing them of involvement in the abortive coup. The soldiers have denied wrongdoing and say they fear for their lives.\nGreek courts have dismissed the Turkish demands, saying there were not convinced the eight would face a fair trial in their country.\nTurkish EU Minister Omer Celik called the Council of State ruling “the most embarrassing decision a country can make”.\n“The justice system of Greece, an EU member, decided to defend the terrorists who attempted a coup to overthrow democracy in Turkey,” he said on Twitter.\nThe soldiers - three majors, three captains and two sergeant majors - flew to Greece by helicopter on July 16, 2016, as the coup attempt against Erdogan crumbled.\nThe Greek government had appealed against the asylum board verdict on one of the soldiers, winning a temporary injunction suspending his asylum status “for reasons of public interest” until a formal court hearing.\nThe other soldiers’ asylum cases are still pending.\nOnce the Council of State ruling is officially registered, the Turkish soldier will be freed, the judicial source said.
