    "text": "The following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS.\nU.S. President Donald Trump waves at the conclusion of a joint news conference with Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements or confirmed their accuracy.\n@realDonaldTrump :\n- So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were “leaked” to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice! [0647 EDT]\n- Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country. Very much like North Korea, this should have been fixed years ago, not now. Same with other countries and NAFTA...but it will all get done. Great Potential for USA! [0700 EDT]\n- It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt! [0734 EDT]\n- Yesterday, it was my great honor to welcome President @MBuhari of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the @WhiteHouse! [1123 EDT]\n- Today I had the great honor of awarding the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy, for the first time in 21 years, to the @ArmyWP_Football Black Knights at the @WhiteHouse. Congratulations! [1257 EDT]\n- Congratulations @ArmyWP_Football! [1414 EDT]\n- Today, it was my great honor to thank and welcome heroic crew members and passengers of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 at the @WhiteHouse! [1542 EDT]\n-- Source link: ( bit.ly/2jBh4LU ) ( bit.ly/2jpEXYR )\nCompiled by Bengaluru bureau\n ",
