    "text": "WINDSOR, Conn., May 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Talcott Resolution (the \"Company\"), The Hartford's run-off life and annuity businesses, announced today the completion of the Company's acquisition by an investor group led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safra Group. Although Talcott Resolution is no longer affiliated with The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, The Hartford will retain a 9.7 percent ownership interest in Talcott Resolution.\n\"We are pleased to have successfully completed this acquisition,\" said Richard Carbone, Chairman and Independent Director of Talcott Resolution. \"In addition to continuing to manage the Company's existing businesses, we expect that over time Talcott Resolution will explore opportunities to acquire legacy blocks from other insurers, enter into reinsurance agreements and evaluate the potential to be a service provider for the life and annuity insurance industry.\"\nTalcott Resolution will now be an independent stand-alone insurance company, headquartered in Windsor, Connecticut, with an office in Woodbury, Minnesota. As part of the transaction, approximately 375 employees of The Hartford are now employees of Talcott Resolution. After closing, the Company expects to reinsure approximately $9 billion of its fixed annuity, payout annuity and structured settlement businesses with a subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group.\n\"Working in partnership with the investor group, we are excited about the opportunity to run and grow our platform of nearly $90 billion in assets and more than 700,000 contract holders,\" said Pete Sannizzaro, President and Chief Operating Officer of Talcott Resolution. \"Together we will maintain our reputation for high quality risk management, continue to honor our obligations and operate with integrity.\"\n\"I speak on behalf of the Board when I say that Talcott Resolution's talented employees, wide array of capabilities and reputation for exceptional customer service strongly position the Company to pursue a broader strategy while providing continuity for existing contract holders, partners and employees,\" Mr. Carbone added.\nAbout Cornell Capital\nCornell Capital LLC is a private investment firm that takes a value-driven approach to investing.
