    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 7:28 AM / Updated 37 minutes ago European shares make timid gains while autos stocks stall Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window)\nLONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - A bounce across miners and oil stocks helped European stocks nudge higher in early trading on Thursday, though carmakers’ shares came under pressure after the U.S. launched a probe into auto imports.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.1 percent by 0719 GMT, after falling more than 1 percent from a 3 1/2-month peak in the previous session as worries over spending plans from Italy’s new coalition and global trade weighed on risky assets.\nConcerns over a U.S.-China trade deal continued after U.S. President Donald Trump said that any deal would need “a different structure”.\nGerman carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen dropped 1.7 to 2.3 percent after the U.S. launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs.\nGermany’s benchmark DAX index declined 0.1 percent and Europe’s autos sector was the worst-performing, losing 1.1 percent.\nHowever, a bounceback among miners and big oil stocks helped European indexes secure gains, with the FTSE 100 trading flat. Italy’s FTSE MIB was up 0.7 percent after Italy’s president invited political novice Giuseppe Conte to be prime minister.\nAryzta was a standout faller among individual stocks. Shares in the Swiss food company slumped 26 percent after the firm cut its full year earnings outlook once more.\nElsewhere shares in Deutsche Bank inched 0.3 percent higher after the bank said it would cut thousands of staff in a revamp of its investment bank.
