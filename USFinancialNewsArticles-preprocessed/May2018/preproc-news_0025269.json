    "text": "BEIJING, China, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ATA Inc. (\"ATA\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq:ATAI), a leading provider of advanced testing technologies and testing-related services in China, today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and provided an update on the sale of ATA Online (Beijing) Education Technology Co., Ltd. (“ATA Online”), the Company’s subsidiary that operates the testing services and delivery business.\nManagement Commentary\nMr. Jack Huang, ATA’s President, stated, “We are pleased to be making continued progress on the ATA Online transaction (the 'Transaction') and are now working to complete the second closing after having completed the first closing on April 4, 2018. In the meantime, we also continue to explore and evaluate acquisition opportunities within the education sector. One such opportunity we recently announced was ATA’s strategic investment in Beijing Biztour International Travel Service Co., Ltd. (‘Beijing Biztour’), one of China’s largest providers of B2B educational tour services. Beijing Biztour is well known for its international educational study tour services for students in China who are interested in overseas study tours primarily in the U.S., United Kingdom, and Australia. We continue working closely with the Beijing Biztour team and look forward to leveraging the many synergies between our two companies to better position Beijing Biztour for success and accelerated growth of its business.”\nMr. Huang continued, “Our strategy continues to focus on leveraging ATA’s existing competency-focused assessment and education service capabilities and the strategic opportunities that we have been working on to transform our company into a leading international education service provider. We continue to explore the possibility of using the proceeds from the Transaction to fund potential M&A opportunities within the education sector.”\nTransaction Update\nAs previously announced in a press release on February 6, 2018 , ATA entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with a group of investors including two entities affiliated with funds managed by CDH Investments, a major Chinese alternative asset management firm based in Beijing; New Beauty Holdings Limited, a company controlled by Mr. Kevin Xiaofeng Ma, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ATA; and four holding companies controlled by certain management members of ATA Online, with respect to the Transaction (collectively, the “Buyer Group”).\nUnder the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Buyer Group agreed to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of ATA Online, which was then held directly or indirectly by ATA, for a total consideration of US$200.0 million in cash. The US$200.0 million in cash consideration payable by the Buyer Group for ATA Online represents an 87.4% premium over ATA’s market capitalization (calculated based on the closing trading price of ATA’s ADSs on February 5, 2018).\nMr. Ma paid a cash deposit in the amount of US$20.0 million to ATA as collateral and security for the payment obligations of the Buyer Group as agreed under the Share Purchase Agreement.\nThe closing of the Transaction is expected to take place in three stages subject to the satisfaction of various conditions precedent in the Share Purchase Agreement. The first of the three closings was completed on April 4, 2018. The Company currently expects the second closing to take place in early third quarter of 2018 with the Transaction to be completed later in the third quarter of 2018. The Company will continue to provide updates throughout the process but cautions investors that there are no assurances that all of the conditions for the closing stated in the Share Purchase Agreement will be satisfied or that the Transaction will ultimately be completed.\nIf the Transaction is not completed, ATA will continue to conduct ATA Online-related businesses and may consider and evaluate other strategic opportunities. In such a circumstance, there can be no assurances that ATA’s continued operation of the ATA Online-related businesses or any alternative strategic opportunities will result in the same or greater value to shareholders as with the sale of ATA Online.\nThe Company also filed a Form 6-K on February 6, 2018, and a Form 20-F on April 12, 2018, containing additional information regarding the Transaction, which investors may access on the SEC Filings page on ATA’s website or on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website at www.sec.gov .\nGAAP Results\nImpact of ATA Online Transaction on the Company’s Financial Statements\nBecause the Transaction represents a strategic shift and has a major effect on ATA’s results of operations, the disposed business lines have been reclassified as discontinued operations. For the periods presented in this press release, the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets, and the results of the discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes, are reported as a separate component of income, discontinued operations, on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n2018 First Quarter\nATA’s total net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were RMB218,499 (US$34,834), compared to RMB2.3 million in the prior-year period. This decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of approximately RMB1.4 million in rental income from net revenues to other operating income, net, as a result of the adoption of new revenue guidance ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018. The related costs were also reclassified from cost of revenues to other operating income, net.\nNet loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, improved to RMB11.1 million (US$1.8 million) from net loss of RMB35.1 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to an RMB26.8 million decrease in income tax expenses specifically related to withholding taxes from prior-year period.\nNet loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was RMB27.5 million (US$4.4 million), compared to RMB18.8 million in the prior-year period. This was primarily due to increased test monitoring costs and operating expenses related to licensing fees and labor costs associated with new hires and salary increases in the first quarter of 2018.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAs of March 31, 2018, ATA’s cash and cash equivalents were RMB173.7 million (US$27.7 million), working capital was RMB262.8 million (US$41.9 million), and total shareholders’ equity was RMB327.1 million (US$52.1 million); compared to RMB53.5 million, RMB225.1 million, and RMB365.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nConference Call and Webcast Information (With Accompanying Presentation)\nATA will host a conference call at 9 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, May 10, 2018, during which management will discuss the results of the quarter ended March 31, 2018.

The filings are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and at ATA’s website at www.atai.net.cn . For additional information on the risk factors that could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects, please see the \"Risk Factors\" section of the Company's Form 20-F for the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 2017.\nThe preliminary results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, remain subject to the finalization of the Company’s year-end closing and reporting processes.\nThe forward-looking statements in this release involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates, and projections about ATA and the markets in which it operates. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release, to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, or changes in its expectations, except as may be required by law. Although the Company believes that its expectations and assumptions expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot assure you that its expectations and assumptions will turn out to be correct, and investors are cautioned that actual results may differ materially from the anticipated results.\nCurrency Convenience Translation\nThe Company's financial information is stated in Renminbi (“RMB”), the currency of the People’s Republic of China. The translation of RMB amounts for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, into U.S. dollars are included solely for the convenience of readers and have been made at the rate of RMB6.2726 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate as of March 31, 2018, in New York for cable transfers in RMB per U.S. dollar as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. Such translations should not be construed as representations that RMB amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that rate or any other rate, or to be the amounts that would have been reported under U.S. GAAP.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement ATA's consolidated financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), ATA uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss, and basic and diluted earnings (losses) per common share and ADS excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. ATA believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information about its performance by excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss, which may not be indicative of its operating performance.\nATA believes that both management and investors benefit from these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to ATA's historical performance. ATA computes its non-GAAP financial measures using a consistent method from period to period. ATA believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using non-GAAP net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss and basic and diluted earnings (losses) per common share and per ADS excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss is that share-based compensation charges and foreign currency exchange gain or loss have been, and are expected to continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in ATA's business.\nManagement compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The table captioned \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Most Comparable GAAP Measures\" shown at the end of this news release has more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures used by ATA.\nFor more information on our company, please contact the following individuals:\nAt the Company Investor Relations ATA Inc.
