    "text": "LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LivaNova PLC (NASDAQ:LIVN) (“LivaNova” or the “Company”), a market-leading medical technology and innovation company, today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, worldwide sales from continuing operations were $250.4 million, an increase of 10.4 percent on a reported basis and an increase of 5.3 percent on a constant currency basis, as compared to the same quarter of the previous year. On the basis of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), first quarter 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.36. First quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.68.\n“We are continuing our positive momentum into 2018. Since the beginning of the year, we announced the commencement of 4 new clinical studies, received approval for 2 products, completed a strategic acquisition and executed a divestiture. We delivered solid top-line growth, invested in marketing, product development and clinical activities, and grew our earnings,” said Damien McDonald, LivaNova's Chief Executive Officer. “Our Neuromodulation business benefited from strong demand for our newest VNS Therapy ® System, SenTiva ® , which received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in October 2017 and CE Mark approval in April 2018. Cardiac Surgery also experienced strong growth, driven by sales of our S5 ® heart-lung machine and our Perceval ® sutureless aortic heart valve. We completed our acquisition of TandemLife and the divestiture of our Cardiac Rhythm Management business to MicroPort Scientific Corporation. We will now focus on the next stage of our growth strategy for our Cardiac Surgery and Neuromodulation portfolios, where we have strength and market leadership. While we continue to deliver quality care to patients around the world, this focus will allow us to deliver long-term value to our stakeholders.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nWorldwide sales from continuing operations for the first quarter were $250.4 million, up 5.3 percent on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2017. The following table highlights worldwide sales for the first quarter of 2018 by business:\n$ in millions Three months ended March 31, % Change Constant\nCurrency\n% Change\nBusiness / Product Line: 2018 2017 Cardiopulmonary $125.1 $107.3 16.6 % 9.1 % Heart Valves 31.0 31.9 (2.7 %) (9.5 %) Cardiac Surgery 156.2 139.2 12.2 % 4.9 % Neuromodulation 93.8 87.2 7.7 % 6.2 % Other 0.4 0.5 — % — % Total Net Sales $250.4 $226.8 10.4 % 5.3 % Note: Numbers may not add up precisely due to rounding. Constant currency % change is considered a non-GAAP metric.\nFor discussion purposes, all sales growth rates below reflect comparable, constant currency growth. Constant currency growth accounts for the impact from fluctuations in the various currencies in which the Company operates as compared to reported growth.\nCardiac Surgery\nCardiac Surgery sales, which include cardiopulmonary products and heart valves, were $156.2 million, representing a 4.9 percent increase versus the first quarter of 2017.\nSales in cardiopulmonary products were $125.1 million, representing a 9.1 percent increase versus the first quarter of 2017. Growth in heart-lung machines was the major contributor to favorable performance in every region, primarily due to customer upgrades from legacy S3 ® to current S5 machines.\nHeart valve sales for both tissue and mechanical heart valves, were $31.0 million, a decrease of 9.5 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017. Strong growth in demand for the Perceval sutureless aortic heart valve was more than offset by the expected loss of a contract manufacturing customer and by continued declines in mechanical and traditional tissue valves.\nNeuromodulation\nNeuromodulation sales were $93.8 million in the first quarter, representing a 6.2 percent increase versus the first quarter of 2017, driven by strong demand for the SenTiva VNS Therapy System.\nCardiac Rhythm Management\nOn November 20, 2017, LivaNova entered into a binding Letter of Intent for the sale of the company’s Cardiac Rhythm Management business to MicroPort Scientific Corporation. The transaction closed on April 30, 2018. All current quarter and historical financial results for this business are captured on the income statement under Discontinued Operations.\nFinancial Performance\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, first quarter 2018 operating income from continuing operations was $12.5 million. Adjusted operating income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $41.5 million, a decrease of 9.6 percent as compared to the first quarter of 2017. This was primarily due to increased investments in sales and marketing activities, product innovation and clinical trials to support sales growth and gross margin expansion, and a negative impact from foreign currency.\nOur adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.7 percent, an improvement from 23.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of ongoing tax efforts and the recent changes in U.S. and U.K. tax laws.\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, first quarter 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.36. First quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.68, an increase of 1.5 percent as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\n2018 Revised Guidance\nAligned with LivaNova’s strategic growth initiatives, we completed the acquisition of TandemLife on April 4, 2018. As a result of this acquisition and changes in the tax laws, certain guidance for full-year 2018 is being revised.\nLivaNova worldwide net sales for full-year 2018 are now expected to grow between 6 and 8 percent on a constant currency basis. Full-year 2018 effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 18 to 20 percent. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2018 are now expected to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.70.\nWebcast and Conference Call Instructions\nThe Company will host a live audio webcast for interested parties commencing at 2 p.m. London time (9 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 that will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the LivaNova corporate website at www.livanova.com .

Headquartered in London, LivaNova has a presence in more than 100 countries worldwide. The Company currently employs more than 3,500 employees.

Company management uses these measurements as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter and year to year on a regular basis and for benchmarking against other medical technology companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the operating performance measure as prescribed by GAAP.\nUnless otherwise noted, all sales growth rates in this release reflect comparable, constant currency growth. Management believes that referring to comparable, constant currency growth is the most useful way to evaluate the sales performance of LivaNova and to compare the sales performance of current periods to prior periods on a consistent basis. Constant currency growth, a non-GAAP financial measure, measures the change in sales between current and prior-year periods using average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period.\nThe Company also believes adjusted financial measures such as adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted operating income and adjusted tax rate are meaningful and allow investors to evaluate the Company’s performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by adjusting for items that are not related to the ongoing operations of the Company.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain statements in this press release, other than purely historical information, are “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
