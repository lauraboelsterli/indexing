    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Italy’s political woes pose a threat to synchronized global growth and stand out as a risk worth watching as the Federal Reserve continues to gradually raise U.S. rates in the face of big government stimulus at home, one of the most influential Fed policymakers said on Thursday.\nFILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard speaks at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., March 1, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Fed Governor Lael Brainard said that while she was vigilant to possible threats from abroad, the U.S. economy is on a “quite positive” path thanks to tax cuts and fiscal spending that should boost growth this year and beyond.\nHer nod to Italy however was the first from the U.S. central bank, which in recent years has at times delayed policy-tightening plans in the face of financial market turmoil. After tumbling earlier this week over the prospect of a new Italian election dominated by debate over Italy’s future in the euro zone, markets have recovered over the past two days.\n“Global growth has been synchronized over the past year, but recent developments pose some risk. Political developments in Italy have reintroduced some risk, and financial conditions in the euro area have worsened somewhat in response,” Brainard told the Forecasters Club of New York.\nRelated Coverage Oil price rise hurts consumers, helps sector in U.S.: Fed official “I continue to view gradual increases in the federal funds rate as the appropriate path, although I will remain vigilant for the emergence of risks and prepared to adjust if conditions change,” she added.\nThe Fed has raised interest rates six times since late 2015 and is expected to hike another notch in June, to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. That would bring policy closer to the Fed’s estimated “neutral” level of about 2.9 percent, even while other estimates from central bankers see rates rising to about 3.4 percent by 2020.\nBrainard, who leans dovish and has a permanent vote on policy, said she expects rates to gradually rise “modestly beyond neutral.” But she noted that over the longer run, as the fiscal stimulus fades, that neutral policy estimate should remain at historically low levels.\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
