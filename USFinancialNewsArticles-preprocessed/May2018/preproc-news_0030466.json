    "text": "(Adds details about lawsuit)\nNEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court on Thursday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's bid to halt a defamation lawsuit by a former contestant on his reality TV show \"The Apprentice\" who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances on her.\nIn a one-page order, the Appellate Division in Manhattan did not explain why it denied Trump's motion to stay the lawsuit by Summer Zervos.\nThe White House was not immediately available for comment.\nTrump has been challenging a March 20 ruling by Justice Jennifer Schecter of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, which rejected his claim that as president he was immune from lawsuits over private conduct predating his entering the White House.\nZervos first came forward in October 2016, a month before the presidential election, following the release of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women.\nWhile Trump apologized for his comments, Zervos accused him of having kissed her against her will at a 2007 meeting in New York, and later groped her at a Beverly Hills hotel.\nDuring his campaign, Trump repeatedly said all accusations made by women after the \"Access Hollywood\" recording became public were \"lies,\" and republished on Twitter a post that called Zervos' accusations a hoax.\nZervos has said those denials amounted to defamation.
