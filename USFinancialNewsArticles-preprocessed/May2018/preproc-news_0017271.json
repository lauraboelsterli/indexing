S&P 500 e-minis were up 10.5 points, or 0.39 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 43 points, or 0.63 percent.\nMajor U.S. stock indexes ended up more than 1 percent on Friday after weaker-than-expected U.S. wage growth calmed investor fears about rising interest rates and inflation.\nU.S. corporates have performed strongly in the first quarter, with nearly 80 per cent of the 400 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far topping profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThat is well above the long-term average of 64 percent and the average of 75 percent over the past four quarters.\nKeeping geopolitics in focus this week, President Donald Trump is set to decide by May 12 whether to pull out of the Iran deal.
