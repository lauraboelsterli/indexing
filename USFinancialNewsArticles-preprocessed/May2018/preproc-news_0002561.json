    "text": "0 COMMENTS OTTAWA—Canada posted its largest trade deficit on record in March, as a surge in imports—in particular motor vehicles and parts—more than offset a solid gain in exports.\nCanadian two-way trade with non-U.S. countries flourished in March. Meanwhile, Canada’s merchandise trade surplus with the U.S. shrank for a fifth straight month and now sits at its lowest level in nearly two years.\nCanada’s merchandise trade deficit with the rest of the world unexpectedly widened in March to 4.14 billion Canadian dollars ($3.22 billion), Statistics Canada said Thursday. The consensus call was for the trade deficit to narrow to C$2.25 billion, according to economists at Royal Bank of Canada.\nThe previous month’s trade deficit was revised higher to C$2.93 billion.\nCanada’s monthly trade report covers the purchase and sale of goods and, unlike the U.S. data, doesn’t incorporate services.\nIn March, imports climbed 6% to a record C$51.72 billion, while exports rose 3.7% to C$47.58 billion. On a 12-month basis, exports rose 1.9% and imports climbed by a faster 9.2%.\nIn volume, or price-adjusted, terms, imports rose 5.3% in March while exports advanced 3%.\nAlso on Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department released its monthly trade report, and indicated the U.S. international trade deficit in goods and services shrank 15.2% in March to a seasonally adjusted $48.96 billion.\nCanada’s total trade—incorporating exports and imports—with countries other than the U.S. climbed to a record C$31.17 billion. Exports to non-U.S. markets rose 11.4% in March, while imports climbed 11.5%.\nAs for Canada’s trade with the U.S., exports climbed 1.2% and imports increased 3.1%. In terms of trade in goods, Canada’s trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed in March to C$1.68 billion, or the smallest since June 2016.\nPresident Donald Trump has made the reduction of trade deficits a centerpiece of his trade policy. The U.S., Canada and Mexico are in the midst of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said this week that a revamped deal would be on “thin ice” unless an agreement was reached by mid-May .\nCanada’s business investment and exports have suffered due to U.S. trade policy uncertainty and may not immediately recover even in the event of a successful Nafta renegotiation, Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz told The Wall Street Journal last month.\nAs for the Canada’s March trade report, imports of motor vehicles and parts climbed 8.3% to C$10.34 billion, or the biggest one-month increase since 2011. On the export side, sales abroad of aircraft and aerospace products rose 24.3%. Excluding energy products—Canada’s top export—Canadian sales abroad climbed 3.6%.\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com",
