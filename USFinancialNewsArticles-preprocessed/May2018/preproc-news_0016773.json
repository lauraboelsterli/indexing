    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 4:11 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Half a million Turks say 'Enough' to Erdogan on social media Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nANKARA (Reuters) - More than half a million Turks piled onto social media to call time on President Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday, making the word “Tamam” (“Enough”) a trending topic worldwide after he promised to step down if the people wanted it.

REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n“If one day our nation says ‘enough’, then we will step aside,” he said in a speech in parliament.\nThe most popular - and divisive - politician in recent Turkish history, Erdogan has ruled for 15 years, overseeing a period of sharp economic growth and a widespread crackdown against his opponents. Last month he declared snap elections for June 24, bringing the polls forward by more than a year.\nSoon after the speech, the #Tamam hashtag swept across Turkish-language Twitter, then became a global trending topic.\n“We want democracy so we say #enough to Erdogan. Please leave your seat, you did insane things to our country and people. Enough,” said one user.\n“You will not step aside quietly. You will give account for the things you did. Enough!” said another.\nErdogan’s rivals in the presidential polls also jumped in, with the “Tamam” tweets from three of his main opponents together garnering more than 10,000 retweets.\n“Time is up. Enough!” tweeted Muharrem Ince, the candidate of the main opposition CHP.\nSocial media has become the primary platform for opposition against the government in Turkey, where traditional media is saturated with coverage of Erdogan and his ministers. Erdogan’s speeches, usually two or three a day, are all broadcast live on major channels, while opposition parties get little to no coverage.\nThe “Tamam” tweets also provided a rare moment of opposition unity with all major parties, including the pro-Kurdish opposition uniting behind the hashtag. Pro-Kurdish politicians and nationalists rarely find common ground.\n“Enough: It’s very strange that Erdogan has offered the opposition a uniting slogan,” tweeted journalist Rusen Cakir.\nRights groups and Turkey’s Western allies have criticized Ankara for its deteriorating record on civil rights and have voiced concerns that the NATO member has been sliding further into authoritarianism under Erdogan.\nThe government says the measures are necessary due to the security threats it faces.\nAfter the vote, Turkey will switch to the powerful, executive presidential system narrowly approved in a referendum last year.
