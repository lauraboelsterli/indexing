    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. Facebook’s F8 annual developer conference takes place today and Wednesday in San Jose. The social network restricted developer access to many its APIs in the wake of its Cambridge Analytica scandal, so the tone might be more conciliatory this time around. The schedule suggests there’ll be lots of topics Tuesday for marketers to pay attention to, including a session on “why bidding matters,” updates to Facebook app ads and a section on building your video business.\nEasy Koum, Easy Go How’s this for timing? On the eve of F8, the Washington Post reported the billionaire chief executive of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, is planning to leave Facebook . He sold the messaging app to Facebook for more than $19 billion in 2014. Mr. Koum, who also reportedly plans to leave Facebook’s board of directors, apparently clashed with Facebook’s executives over its strategy to share data across Facebook’s platforms and its end-to-end encryption policy. You might remember WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton left the company late last year, then quickly endorsed the #DeleteFacebook campaign. Both Mr. Koum and Mr. Acton weren’t the biggest advocates of advertising, writing in a 2012 blog post that ads were a “disruption to aesthetics, an insult to your intelligence, and the interruption of your train of thought.” (Tell us how you really feel!) One wonders whether, without WhatsApp’s resistant founders, Facebook may now find it easier to introduce ad products to the messaging app. Indeed, the WSJ reports Mr. Koum’s departure followed an internal debate about introducing ads to WhatsApp’s “Status” feature.\nOh, We’re Not Gonna Take It Back in March I reported Google was asking its publisher partners to get consent on its behalf to gather data on European users and target ads using its popular ad-tech tools once the forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in May. Among the requirements, Google wants publishers to accept it is a “co-controller” of their users’ data, rather than a “processor,” under the GDPR rules. Some publishers aren’t best-pleased with those suggestions. Ad Age reports four U.S. trade associations—Digital Content Next, European Publishers Council, News Media Alliance and the News Media Association—released a letter Monday addressed to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, criticizing the company’s GDPR policy . The letter reprimands Google for waiting “until the last-minute” to announce the proposals, which the trade groups say “undermine the fundamental purposes of the GDPR.” In response, Google says it always asked publishers to get user consent for the use of its ad tech on their sites and said operating as a “controller” won’t give the company any more rights to publisher data than before.\nAutomatic Love Amazon’s ad business has quietly grown into a multi-billion dollar revenue beast. To help get more ad dollars flowing through its platforms, Amazon plans to lean heavily on automated, self-service offerings , according to this detailed piece from Ad Age’s Garrett Sloane. While Amazon still intends to run a premium managed-service offering for its top clients, the e-commerce company is busy building out its programmatic tools. Ad Age’s sources say Amazon is running a test with some brands and their agencies to tag ads with a pixel to track whether their ads running outside Amazon properties lead to sales on the e-commerce site. Amazon is also reportedly building a video ad platform, similar to what Roku offers, for its Fire TV device. On the sell-side, Ad Age says Amazon is “undercutting Google [DoubleClick for Publishers] on ad-tech fees” to recruit more publishers for its Amazon Publisher Services and offering to spend its own ad dollars—promoting its original shows from Prime, for example—on their sites if they sign up for its marketplace. As Amazon continues to move its way up the media plan, expect to see lots more Amazon-specialist agencies popping up, offering to help marketers get their heads around its growing portfolio of ad services.\nSisters Are Doin’ It For Themselves Twitter said during its first-quarter earnings last month that video accounts for more than half of its revenue. Hoping to build on that momentum, Twitter is exploring whether to let publishers sell pre-roll ads that run at the start of their video clips on the platform themselves , CMO Today’s Ben Mullin reports. Just as with Facebook’s Instant Articles format or Snap’s Discover, giving publishers the option to sell Twitter pre-rolls would allow them the opportunity to pitch marketers broader ad packages across a range of different platforms. The new offering, which is still in development, doesn’t look as though it would change the financial split of ad sales Twitter keeps, a person familiar with the matter said. Currently publishers keep 70% of the revenue from ads sold against their Twitter content. Elsewhere in Twitter news, the company held its NewFront event Monday night. Twitter touted its positioning around “live,” and particularly live video. As Broadcasting and Cable reported, Twitter announced 30-plus content deals and renewals at the presentation, including tie-ups with NBCUniversal, ESPN and Viacom.\nBest of the rest The New York Times is making a big push into television, having signed a deal with Anonymous Content earlier this year. The newspaper is looking to create a show similar to its popular “The Daily” podcast and programs around other popular content, such as its “Modern Love” column, the company said at its NewFront presentation on Monday.

[ Digiday ]\nFacebook plans to “reduce the visual prominence” of fake news stories in the mobile news feed by making them show up as smaller than accurate news links. [ TechCrunch ]\nWPP has taken full ownership of a handful of agencies in the Asia-Pacific region in a share swap with Dentsu, for an undisclosed price. The deal includes WPP taking full control of the Y&R and Wunderman joint-venture agency assets across Southeast Asia and in Taiwan, plus Dentsu Sudler & Hennessey in Japan. Meanwhile, Dentsu has acquired full control of Dentsu Y&R and Wunderman Dentsu in Japan. [ MarketWatch ]\nInternet-radio service Pandora carried out a study that found that higher ad loads can push users to pay for an ad-free version. But subscriptions don’t make up for the lost ad revenue from those who listen less or leave the service altogether. [ Wired ]\nAt the BBC News NewFront, the British broadcaster pushed its global reach and “trust factor.” The company said it has access to 450 million households with BBC World News a month. [ Adweek ]\nViacom announced at its NewFront it plans to bring the video creator conference VidCon to London next year. It also unveiled a slate of talent deals and content partnerships.
