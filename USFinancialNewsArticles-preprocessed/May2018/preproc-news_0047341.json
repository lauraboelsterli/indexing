    "text": "Little expenses, like a daily smoothie or a few cab rides a week, can add up. If you can get in the habit of saving on the small stuff, you may be surprised with the long-term benefits.\nAs self-made millionaire Chris Reining tells CNBC , \"I know there are some people out there that say you shouldn't worry about the $5 latte, but the more I think about it, cutting out the $5 latte was a good place to start.\" Starting with small changes helped Reining work his way up to saving 54 percent of his income, which allowed him to retire at age 37 .\n\"If you try to downsize your house , get rid of all your cars and make all of these drastic changes, it's so overwhelming and you're not going to do any of it,\" he says.\nHere are 6 relatively small and easy things to give up, besides the morning latte, that could increase your savings rate significantly over time.\nshow chapters Build more wealth by breaking these bad money habits 8:14 AM ET Fri, 30 Dec 2016 | 01:05 Impulse buys From grocery stores to department stores, retailers have a way of tricking you into spending money mindlessly . One tactic is loading the checkout aisle with tempting products: cold sodas, candy bars and 99-cent knick-knacks.\nSkip the candy and soda. Your wallet will thank you.\nUnused subscriptions How many 30-day free trials have you signed up for and forgotten to cancel? Are you getting your money's worth from the gym membership you signed up for at the beginning of the year?\nLook over your last couple of credit card statements and figure out exactly what you're paying for in terms of magazines, video or music streaming services, meal subscription boxes or iCloud storage. Ask yourself which you could eliminate and cancel them on the spot to save a couple hundred dollars a year .\nYou could also use apps like Truebill and Trim that will cancel unwanted subscriptions for you.\nshow chapters This simple one-minute money hack could save you hundreds each month 6:07 PM ET Fri, 18 May 2018 | 01:04 Buying lunch every day Dining out can add up quickly . It doesn't help that apps like Seamless let you place a delivery order with the touch of a finger. The more food you can prepare at home , the better off your food budget will be.\nOf course, it's OK to treat yourself and buy the occasional meal, but keep in mind that going homemade is one of the simplest ways to cut back without making dramatic sacrifices.\nWhile you're getting into the habit of packing your lunch, start filling up a water bottle, too. It'll save you a few bucks every time you're parched and tempted to hit up the closest convenience store.\nshow chapters This simple going-out rule saves this reporter $3,600 each year 9:51 AM ET Tue, 23 May 2017 | 00:47 Excessive bar tabs Like buying lunch, the occasional happy hour or night out is fine, but if you're looking to free up some cash, skipping drinks will do the trick. And, let's face it, ordering one drink usually leads to ordering two or three, which often leads to ordering food.\nTo still enjoy nights out without breaking the bank, consider using CNBC Make It reporter Emmie Martin's strategy , which saves her $300 a month: Either order alcohol or food, but not both.\n\"If I choose to go out to dinner, I skip the wine,\" she says. \"If I head to the bar, I commit to cooking dinner myself when I get home.\"\nCable These days, cable is costing Americans more than $100 a month . That's a large sum to pay for a service that people often don't take full advantage of.\nConsider cutting the cord and getting your TV via the internet, through services like Netflix (starting at $8 a month), Hulu ($8 a month) or HBO Now ($15 a month).\nshow chapters I'm only spending $60 a week for 8 weeks. Here's exactly what I'm buying 3:16 PM ET Wed, 10 May 2017 | 02:39 Trying to show up your friends Trying to live up to your friends' standards is a tempting but costly habit. In fact, it's sending a surprising percentage of millennials into debt .\nIf you stop choosing where to live, what to wear and what gadgets to buy based on what your friends do, chances are you'll save a ton of money.\nThis is an update of a previously published story.\nLike this story?
