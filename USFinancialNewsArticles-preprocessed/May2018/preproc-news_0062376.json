All statements other than statements of present or historical fact are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate\", \"achieve\", \"could\", \"believe\", \"plan\", \"intend\", \"objective\", \"continuous\", \"ongoing\", \"estimate\", \"outlook\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"should\", \"potential\" or similar words, including negatives thereof, suggesting future outcomes. In particular, this News Release contains forward-looking statements relating to the Arrangement, including but not limited to: the anticipated benefits of the Arrangement to Aveda shareholders; that Aveda will be able to complete the Arrangement as expected or on the timeline expected; the amount of consideration payable under the Arrangement, and that Aveda will be able to obtain all necessary court and regulatory approvals for the Arrangement. Aveda believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date hereof but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements should not be unduly relied upon.\nForward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are described herein. Such forward-looking statements necessarily involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause Aveda’s actual performance and financial results in future periods to differ materially from any projections of future performance or results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk that the Arrangement is delayed or is not completed for any reason, the risk that the anticipated benefits of the Arrangement are not realized, the risk that the Earnout does not become payable for any reason, including the actual results of Aveda’s future operations, factors beyond Aveda’s control, and the risks identified in the Information Circular and Aveda’s management discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the \"MD&A\"), both of which are available for viewing on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . In addition, the terms of the Earnout should not be construed as a financial projection. There is no assurance that any amount will become payable under the Earnout. Any forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and, except as required by law, Aveda assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise such statements to reflect new information, subsequent or otherwise.\nThis news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. Persons unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThis press release contains the term \"EBITDA\" which does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of financial information of Aveda or similar measures for other entities. As used herein, EBITDA is defined as Aveda’s net income (or loss) (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation for the relevant period, subject to certain other additions and reductions as described in the arrangement agreement dated April 13, 2018 between, among others, Daseke and Aveda.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource: Aveda Transportation and Energy Services Inc",
