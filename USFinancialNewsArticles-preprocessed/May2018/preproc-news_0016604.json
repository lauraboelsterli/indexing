    "text": "CHICAGO, May 4 (Reuters) - Exchange-operator CME Group Inc is weighing an increase in the storage rates for its corn and soybean futures to address concerns the contractsâ€™ prices are not accurately reflecting the underlying U.S. cash grain markets.\n* CME may raise the fixed maximum storage rate that regular warehouses can charge holders of its outstanding shipping certificates, according to a notice the company sent to customers.\n* CME contacted market participants for their views, and most support an adjustment to contract storage rates to make sure that futures converge with cash prices, the notice says.\n* The current maximum storage rate that regular warehouses can charge is about 5 cents per bushel per month.\n* Traders told Reuters in February that CME was talking with them about potential adjustments to the contracts.
