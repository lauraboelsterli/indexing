Members of the Joint Investigation Team, comprising the authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine, present interim results in the ongoing investigation of the 2014 MH17 crash that killed 298 people over eastern Ukraine, during a news conference in Bunnik, Netherlands, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\nDutch prosecutors investigating the disaster said earlier on Thursday that a missile system from the 53rd anti-aircraft brigade of the Russian Armed Forces had been used to shoot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. All 298 people on board - two thirds of whom were Dutch - were killed.\nThe Russian military denied that any Russian missile complex had ever crossed the border between Russia and Ukraine, TASS news agency reported.
