    "text": "Passive investing hums with activity as ETFs evolve\nThe demand for alternatives in the form of hedge funds also has moderated in the past two years, though the interest picked up marginally last year. After seeing outflows of $112 billion in 2016, the hedge fund universe took in $9.8 billion in new assets last year and managed a record high of more than $3.2 trillion at the end of December, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.\nWhile several large institutional investors — most notably, the California Public Employees' Retirement System — abandoned hedge fund investing programs in the last few years because they were too costly and complicated to manage, many large institutions remain committed to the asset class.\nThe industry also has had to improve its offering in terms of cost. The \"Two And Twenty\" compensation model for hedge funds (2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits) has gone by the wayside for all but the best performers. Institutions and high-net-worth investors are much more apt to negotiate hard on fees for hedge funds now.\nThe interest is still there, however.\n\"We still see consistent growth across investor groups,\" said Matt Jiannino, head of Quantitative Equity Product Management at Vanguard. \"Some are interested for diversification purposes, others for risk reduction or return enhancement.\"\nVanguard's Quantitative Equity Product Management group manages $38 billion across a number of funds predominantly running market neutral and long/short equity strategies. They are marketed to institutions and financial advisors and are intended to diversify the risks of holding bonds and cash. The funds are accessible to individual investors, with most having a minimum investment threshold of $3,000.\nWith interest rates rising and the stock market increasingly volatile, Jiannino sees the demand for alternative investing strategies picking up. \"Equity and fixed-income return expectations are low, and people are looking for ways to diversify their returns,\" he said.

Privacy Policy .\nCost remains an issue in the liquid alternative funds market. The average fee for 1,645 alternative funds tracked by Morningstar Direct was 1.58 percent at the end of last year. Those costs are trending down, however, as demand for the funds has dropped and lower cost ETFs (average expense ratio 0.87 percent) become more popular with investors.\n\"A lot of these products tend to be high cost, and how much you pay can be crucial to the investment outcome,\" said Jiannino. As with hedge funds, the onus is on investors to do their research on both the costs and the risks being run in alt funds.\nThe collapse and liquidation of the $1.6 billion XIV exchange-traded note run by Credit Suisse in early February is a case in point. The vehicle made hay shorting futures on volatility (VIX contracts) last year but lost 90 percent of its value in the space of a few days when volatility spiked in February. The vehicle — since shut down — was intended for active traders.\nMorningstar currently tracks eight separate categories for alternative funds. They range from long/short equity funds that buy some stocks and short others, to managed futures that typically follow trends in commodities and futures markets, to multialternative strategies that combine various investing strategies. None of the strategies have outperformed the stock market for any length of time since the financial crisis, and they won't going forward if the market finds its feet again.\nIf the bull markets in stocks and bonds are over, however, an allocation to alternative funds could soften the blow. Just make sure you know what you're getting into.\n\"Investors need to understand the leverage used in a fund and the discipline of its investing strategy,\" said Morningstar's Ictel. \"Alternative funds are more complex, and they're not for people who don't like doing research.\"\n— By Andrew Osterland, special to CNBC.com Andrew Osterland Special to CNBC.com Fixed Income Strategies",
