    "text": "Manny Machado hit two home runs, including a grand slam, and drove in six runs as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 9-4 on Friday night at Oriole Park.\nThat gave the Orioles (11-27) their first three-game winning streak of the season. They hit four homers in the contest.\nMachado hit a two-run homer in the first and his grand slam in the seventh off Ryne Stanek. The shortstop has three homers in his past two games, and the grand slam was the 150th homer of his career, making the 25-year old the youngest Oriole to reach that milestone.\nOrioles starter Kevin Gausman (3-2) went 7 1/3 innings and gave up two runs while scattering 11 hits.\nThe Rays put runners in scoring position in five innings versus Gausman, but the right-hander repeatedly squirmed out of trouble. Tampa Bay outhit the Orioles, 15-10.\nAfter Adam Jones singled with one out in the first, Machado belted a two-run homer to left-center that gave Baltimore a 2-0 lead. Machado now has homered in the first inning in each of the last two games.\nTampa Bay cut the lead to 2-1 in the third on a C.J. Cron RBI single.\nThe Orioles then made it 3-1 in the sixth when Jonathan Schoop doubled. Mark Trumbo led off the seventh with a homer that gave the Orioles a 4-1 lead, and Baltimore then loaded the bases with no outs and chased starter Jake Faria (3-2).\nStanek came on, and after getting two outs, gave up the Machado grand slam.\nTampa Bay scored three in the eighth, two coming on a Carlos Gomez triple off Richard Bleier. Chance Sisco added a solo homer for the Orioles in the eighth for the final run.\nBrad Brach got the final four outs and earned his fifth save.\nBaltimore made a move before the game with struggling right-hander Chris Tillman (1-5, 10.46 ERA) going on the 10-day disabled list due to a low back strain. The Orioles called up right-hander Jimmy Yacabonis from Triple-A Norfolk.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ",
