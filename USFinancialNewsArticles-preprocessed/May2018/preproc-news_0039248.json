    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 10:09 AM / Updated 25 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Enbridge to consolidate assets in $8.94 bln restructuring Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Adds background, details)\nMay 17 (Reuters) - Pipeline operator Enbridge Inc said on Thursday it would bring its independent units and liquids and gas pipeline assets under a single listed entity as part of a move to streamline its corporate structure.\nEnbridge said it would buy in outstanding shares of its various corporate units, including Spectra Energy Partners and Enbridge Energy Partners, for a value of C$11.4 billion ($8.94 billion), or 272 million of its common shares.\nThe company, which has been trying to recast itself as a pure pipeline utility, has been under pressure to sell non-core assets and pare its debt pile of $60.87 billion as of Dec. 31.\nIts $28 billion takeover of U.S.-based Spectra Energy last year added the most to its debt burden. Earlier this month, Enbridge sold some assets worth $2.5 billion.\nThe transaction will not have any impact on its three-year financial guidance, the company said.\nCalgary-based Enbridge said after the restructuring all shareholders of its corporate units would hold the same stake.
