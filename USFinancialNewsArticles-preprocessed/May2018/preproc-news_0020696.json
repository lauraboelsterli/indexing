    "text": "CINCINNATI and LONDON, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Worldpay, Inc. (NYSE: WP, LSE: WPY) (\"Worldpay\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Worldpay, Inc. was formed on January 16, 2018 through Vantiv Inc.'s previously announced acquisition of Worldpay Group plc. Net revenue for Worldpay, Inc. increased 81% to $850.7 million as compared to $470.1 million in the prior year period. On a GAAP basis, net (loss) income per diluted share attributable to Worldpay, Inc. decreased (312)% to $(0.36) as compared to $0.17 in the prior year period. The GAAP loss is primarily due to acquisition and integration costs as well as amortization of intangible assets incurred in connection with the acquisition. Adjusted net income per share increased 19% to $0.81 as compared to $0.68 in the prior year period. (See Schedule 1 for net income per diluted share attributable to Worldpay, Inc. and Schedule 2 for adjusted net income per share.)\n\"Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations. It's rewarding to see our combined companies come together to create strong results so quickly,\" said Charles Drucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer and Philip Jansen, co-chief executive officer at Worldpay. \"Worldpay's scale, unrivaled technology offerings and dedicated people enable us to provide superior outcomes for our clients, positioning us to continue to win in the payments industry.\"\nWorldpay, Inc.

Under ASC 606, Network fees and other costs are now netted against Revenue and no longer appear as an expense between Revenue and Net revenue as they were shown in prior periods. As a result, Revenue and Net revenue are now equivalent. This change in presentation reduces Revenue by the amount of Network fees and other costs to an amount equivalent to Net revenue, but has no impact on Net income, Adjusted net income, or Adjusted EBITDA.\nEarnings Conference Call and Audio Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results today at 8:00 a.m. ET.

All statements other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or current conditions included in this release are forward-looking statements including any statements regarding guidance and statements of a general economic or industry specific nature. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, guidance, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"can have,\" \"likely\" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this release are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you review and consider information presented herein, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend upon future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual future performance or results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Certain of these factors and other risks are discussed in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and include, but are not limited to: (i) our ability to adapt to developments and change in our industry; (ii) competition; (iii) unauthorized disclosure of data or security breaches; (iv) systems failures or interruptions; (v) our ability to expand our market share or enter new markets; (vi) our ability to successfully integrate the businesses of our predecessor companies; (vii) our ability to identify and complete acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships; (viii) failure to comply with applicable requirements of Visa, MasterCard or other payment networks or changes in those requirements; (ix) our ability to pass along fee increases; (x) termination of sponsorship or clearing services; (xi) loss of clients or referral partners; (xii) reductions in overall consumer, business and government spending; (xiii) fraud by merchants or others; (xiv) a decline in the use of credit, debit or prepaid cards; (xv) consolidation in the banking and retail industries; (xvi) changes in foreign currency exchange rates; (xvii) the effects of governmental regulation or changes in laws; (xviii) geopolitical, regulatory, tax and business risks associated with our international operations; and (xix) outcomes of future litigation or investigations and our dual-listings with the NYSE and LSE. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. More information on potential factors that could affect the company's financial results and performance is included from time to time in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of the company's periodic reports filed with the SEC, including the company's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and its subsequent filings with the SEC.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this release speaks only as of the date of this release. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.

For the three months ended March 31, 2018, Revenue is equivalent to Net revenue as a result of the company's adoption of ASC 606. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Net revenue is equivalent to Revenue less Network fees and other costs.\n(2)\nNon-operating expense during the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily consists of expenses relating to the Company's financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Legacy Worldpay acquisition and the change in fair value of the Mercury tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\"), partially offset by a gain on the settlement of a deal contingent forward entered into in connection with the Company's acquisition of Legacy Worldpay. Non-operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily relate to the change in fair value of the Mercury TRA.\n(3)\nIncludes a credit of approximately $6.6 million and $8.6 million for three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 relating to excess tax benefits as a result of the Company adopting new stock compensation accounting guidance on January 1, 2017 which requires those benefits be recorded in income tax expense.\n(4)\nDue to our structure as a C corporation and Vantiv Holding's structure as a pass-through entity for tax purposes, the numerator in the diluted net income per share calculation is adjusted to reflect the Company's income tax expense at an expected effective tax rate assuming the conversion of the Class B units of Vantiv Holding into shares of our Class A common stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, approximately 15.3 million weighted-average dilutive Class B units of Vantiv Holding were excluded in computing diluted net income per share because including them would have an antidilutive effect. As the Class B units of Vantiv Holding were not included, the numerator used in the calculation of diluted net income per share was equal to the numerator used in the calculation of basic net income per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Additionally, due to the net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018, any remaining potentially dilutive securities were also excluded from the denominator in computing dilutive net income per share.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Loss) income before applicable income taxes\n$\n—\n$\n40.5\nTaxes\n—\n6.0\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(97.6)\n$\n34.5\nDiluted shares\n274,098,480\n197,496,680\nDiluted EPS\n$\n(0.36)\n$\n0.17\nSchedule 2\nWorldpay, Inc.\nAdjusted Net Income\n(Unaudited)\n(in millions, except share data)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nIncome before applicable income taxes\n$\n(111.5)\n$\n40.5\n(375)%\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nTransition, acquisition and integration costs (1) (3)\n177.4\n49.5\n258%\nShare-based compensation (3)\n17.2\n10.6\n62%\nIntangible amortization (2) (3)\n172.8\n51.9\n233%\nNon-operating expense (4)\n8.6\n4.1\n110%\nNon-GAAP adjusted income before applicable income taxes\n264.5\n156.6\n69%\nLess: Adjustments\nAdjusted tax expense (5)\n27.5\n21.7\n27%\nAdjusted tax rate\n10%\n14%\nOther (6)\n0.3\n0.2\n50%\nAdjusted net income\n$\n236.7\n$\n134.7\n76%\nAdjusted net income per share\n$\n0.81\n$\n0.68\n19%\nAdjusted shares outstanding (7)\n290,880,798\n197,496,680\nNon-GAAP and Adjusted Financial Measures\nThis schedule presents non-GAAP and adjusted financial measures, which are important financial performance measures for the Company, but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Such financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP, and such measures may not be comparable to those reported by other companies.\nAdjusted net income is derived from GAAP income before applicable income taxes and adjusted for the following items described below:\n(1)\nRepresents acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisitions, charges related to employee termination benefits and other transition activities. Included in Transition, acquisition and integration costs in the three months ended March 31, 2017 is a $38 million charge to G&A related to a settlement agreement stemming from legacy litigation of an acquired company.\n(2)\nRepresents amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations and customer portfolio and related asset acquisitions.\n(3)\nBelow are the adjustments to Other operating costs, General and administrative and Depreciation and amortization.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\nTransition,\nAcquisition &\nIntegration\nShare-Based\nCompensation\nAmortization Of\nIntangible Assets\nTransition,\nAcquisition &\nIntegration\nShare-Based\nCompensation\nAmortization Of\nIntangible Assets\nOther operating costs\n$\n10.2\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n3.2\n$\n—\n$\n—\nGeneral and administrative\n167.2\n17.2\n—\n46.3\n10.6\n—\nDepreciation and amortization\n—\n—\n172.8\n—\n—\n51.9\nTotal adjustments\n$\n177.4\n$\n17.2\n$\n172.8\n$\n49.5\n$\n10.6\n$\n51.9\n(4)\nNon-operating expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 primarily consists of expenses relating to the Company's financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Legacy Worldpay acquisition and the change in fair value of the Mercury tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\"), partially offset by a gain on the settlement of a deal contingent forward entered into in connection with the Company's acquisition of Legacy Worldpay. Non-operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily relate to the change in fair value of the Mercury TRA.\n(5)\nRepresents adjusted income tax expense to reflect an effective tax rate of 19.7% for 2018 and 34% for 2017, assuming the conversion of the Class B units of Vantiv Holding into shares of Class A common stock, including the tax effect of adjustments described above. The March 31, 2018 and 2017 effective tax rate includes the impact of the excess tax benefits relating to stock compensation as a result of the Company adopting new stock compensation accounting guidance on January 1, 2017, which requires those benefits to be recorded in income tax expense. Represents tax benefits due to the amortization of intangible assets and other tax attributes resulting from or acquired with our acquisitions, and to the tax basis step up associated with our separation from Fifth Third Bank and the purchase or exchange of Class B units of Vantiv Holding, net of payment obligations under tax receivable agreements.
