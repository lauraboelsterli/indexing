CEO Mark Zuckerberg will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and other European officials next week, as the Silicon Valley giant tries to calm tension with regulators and policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic.\nZuckerberg will meet with top European lawmakers in Brussels to discuss the social FB, -0.61% handling of its users’ personal information, and its potential impact on European elections, said European Parliament President Antonio Tajani. The hearing won’t be open to the public, an EU official said.\nIn Paris, Mr. Zuckerberg will participate in a lunchtime meeting next Wednesday at France’s Elysee Palace called “Tech for Good” that will include such tech executives as Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, a French official said. Mr. Zuckerberg will also have a private meeting directly with Mr. Macron, the official added.\n“We are looking forward to meeting next week with the president of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron,” the company said, adding of its meetings with EU lawmakers: “We … appreciate the opportunity for dialogue, to listen to their views and show the steps we are taking to better protect people’s privacy.” ",
