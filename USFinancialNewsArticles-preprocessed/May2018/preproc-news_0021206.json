(NASDAQ:XLRN), a leading biopharmaceutical company in the discovery and development of TGF-beta therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“2018 is an important year for our Company, as we prepare for the upcoming top-line results from our MEDALIST and BELIEVE Phase 3 trials with luspatercept expected mid-year. We and Celgene continue to invest heavily in the overall luspatercept opportunity by targeting myelodysplastic syndromes, beta-thalassemia, and myelofibrosis,” said Habib Dable, Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron. “The joint collaboration teams recently kicked off strategic preparations for the anticipated regulatory and commercial activities planned to follow the luspatercept Phase 3 results.”\nAdded Mr. Dable: “Our team continues to make meaningful progress in the advancement of our wholly-owned clinical programs. In neuromuscular disease, we presented preliminary results from our Phase 2 trial of ACE-083 in FSHD for the first time and recently initiated Part 2 of the trial. In pulmonary, we expect to initiate our first Phase 2 trial with sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension in the second quarter.”\nDevelopment Program Highlights\nHematology\nLuspatercept :\nMyelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), Beta-Thalassemia, and Myelofibrosis (MF)\nLuspatercept is a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent (EMA) designed to treat the late-stage red blood cell (RBC) maturation defect that results in chronic anemia and the need for regular RBC transfusions in adults with rare blood disorders. Luspatercept is being developed as part of the global collaboration between Acceleron and Celgene.\nTop-line results from the MEDALIST and BELIEVE Phase 3 trials in MDS and beta-thalassemia, respectively, are expected in mid-2018. The initiation of the COMMANDS Phase 3 trial in first-line, lower-risk MDS patients is planned for the first half of 2018. Enrollment and treatment are ongoing in the BEYOND Phase 2 trial in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and the Phase 2 trial in MF. The Company expects to provide updates from the ongoing long-term Phase 2 extension trials in MDS and beta-thalassemia at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and 23 rd Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA) in June.\nNeuromuscular Disease\nACE-083 :\nFacioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) Disease\nACE-083 is a locally-acting therapeutic designed to have a concentrated effect on muscle mass and strength in target muscles for diseases that cause focal muscle weakness. ACE-083 utilizes the \"Myostatin+\" approach to inhibit multiple TGF-beta ligands.\nPreliminary results from dose cohorts 1 and 2 in Part 1 of the ACE-083 Phase 2 trial in patients with FSHD were highlighted in a “Best of Neuromuscular Disease” clinical session at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 70 th Annual Meeting on April 26, 2018. The Company plans to present additional preliminary results from all Part 1 dose cohorts during the second half of 2018. Part 2 of the Phase 2 trial was recently initiated and preliminary results are expected in the second half of 2019. ACE-083 received FDA Fast Track designation in FSHD. Enrollment and treatment are ongoing in Part 1 of the Phase 2 trial in patients with CMT disease. The Company plans to present preliminary Part 1 results in the second half of 2018 and to initiate Part 2 of the Phase 2 trial by the end of 2018.\nACE-2494 :\nACE-2494 is designed to have a systemic effect on muscle mass and strength for diseases that cause muscle weakness throughout the body. ACE-2494 utilizes the \"Myostatin+\" approach to inhibit multiple TGF-beta ligands.\nEnrollment and treatment are ongoing in the Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial. Preliminary results from the Phase 1 trial are expected in the first half of 2019.\nPulmonary Disease\nSotatercept :\nPulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)\nSotatercept is a ligand trap for members in the TGF-beta superfamily involved in remodeling a variety of different tissues, including the vasculature and fibrosis. In multiple preclinical studies in PAH, sotatercept decreased vessel muscularization, improved pulmonary arterial pressures, and decreased indicators of right heart failure.\nThe Company expects to initiate the PULSAR Phase 2 trial during the second quarter of 2018. Preliminary results from the PULSAR Phase 2 trial are expected in the first half of 2020.\nFinancial Results\nCash position – Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of March 31, 2018 were $353.3 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $372.9 million. The Company believes that existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund projected operating requirements into 2021. Revenue – Collaboration revenue for the first quarter was $3.2 million. The revenue is all from Acceleron’s partnership with Celgene and is primarily related to expenses incurred by the Company in support of luspatercept. Costs and expenses – Total costs and expenses for the first quarter were $30.8 million. This includes R&D expenses of $23.4 million and G&A expenses of $7.4 million. Net loss – The Company's net loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $26.2 million.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss its first quarter financial results for 2018 and provide an update on recent corporate activities on May 8, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. EDT.\nThe webcast will be accessible under \"Events & Presentations\" in the Investors/Media page of the Company’s website at www.acceleronpharma.com . Individuals can participate in the conference call by dialing 877-312-5848 (domestic) or 253-237-1155 (international) and referring to the “Acceleron First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call.”\nThe archived webcast will be available for replay on the Acceleron website approximately two hours after the event.\nAbout Acceleron\nAcceleron is a Cambridge-based, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases.
