FILE PHOTO: The Twenty-First Century Fox Studios flag flies over the company building in Los Angeles, California U.S. on November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo\nShares of the media company, which agreed to sell the bulk of its film and TV assets to Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) last year in a $52.4 billion deal, were marginally up in extended trading.\nReuters reported on Monday that Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ) is preparing an all-cash rival offer for the assets, with the U.S. cable company also notifying regulators of plans to bid for Fox target Sky ( SKYB.L ).\nRevenue from Fox’s cable division, which houses the Fox News and FX channels among others, rose 9.8 percent to $4.42 billion, accounting for more than half of total revenue in the quarter.\nThat beat analysts’ average estimate of $4.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company reported a revenue of $3.51 billion in affiliate fee, a rise of 11 percent from a year earlier.\nRevenue at its television unit, which houses Fox Broadcasting, fell 32 percent to $1.15 billion, as the year-ago quarter included strong ratings during the Super Bowl, and missed analysts’ estimate of $1.28 billion.\nFox earlier in the day announced a deal for seven television stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group ( SBGI.O ) for about $910 million, expanding Fox Television Stations’ coverage to nearly half of all U.S. households.\nTotal revenue fell 2 percent to $7.42 billion, but beat estimates of $7.4 billion.\nNet income attributable to shareholders increased to $858 million, or 46 cents per share, in the third quarter ended March 31, from $799 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Fox earned 49 cents per share, missing analysts’ estimate of 53 cents per share.
