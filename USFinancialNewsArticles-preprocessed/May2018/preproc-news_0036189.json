    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 5:33 PM / Updated an hour ago FDA reports inaccuracy in IQVIA opioid sales data Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Food & Drug Administration said on Wednesday it found inaccuracies in sales data of opioid drug products provided by IQVIA Holdings Inc, a vendor it contracts.\nThe regulator said IQVIA overestimated past data on prescription opioid fentanyl due to an error in its weight-conversion methods, sending the shares of the company down as much as 10.3 percent to $91.57.\nThe data showed a more than 20 percent drop in the reported kilogram amount of fentanyl sold in the United States for at least the past five years, compared with what was previously reported, the regulator said.\nIQVIA collects data to measure the volume of drugs sold by manufacturers and wholesalers to pharmacies and hospitals.\nThe FDA uses IQVIA’s drug sales data to assess the scope of prescription opioid use and evaluate trends. It also aids the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to estimate future medical need for controlled substances.\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has asked the company to have a third-party auditor review the quality control measures on IQVIA drug sales data as well as all other products of the company used by the regulator.\nThe agency also said it will brief members of Congress on IQVIA’s data quality issues and their potential impact on public health.\nIQVIA did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
