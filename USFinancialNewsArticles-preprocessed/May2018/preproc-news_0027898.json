Soccer Football - Bundesliga - Hamburger SV v Borussia Moenchengladbach - Volksparkstadion, Hamburg, Germany - May 12, 2018 Hamburg players look dejected as they leave the pitch at the end of the match REUTERS/Morris Mac Matzen\nVfL Wolfsburg’s 4-1 win over bottom club Cologne meant Hamburg’s 2-1 home victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach, which was interrupted for 15 minutes due to the crowd trouble in stoppage-time, proved in vain.\n“This is an extremely painful moment for the entire Hamburg SV,” club President Bernd Hoffmann said. “The club has lost one of its uniquenesses.

Slideshow (6 Images)\nThe fires were put out and police gradually left the field so the game could resume and the final seconds be played out.\nHamburg had taken an early lead through Aaron Hunt and went in front again with a Lewis Holtby goal just past the hour after Gladbach had levelled before halftime.\nEven when Hamburg went down to 10 men after the dismissal of Bobby Wood in the 71st minute, they kept battling, hoping for a miracle but events at Wolfsburg ensured it never came.\nWith the stadium clock marking the club’s record stay in the Bundesliga and showing 54 years and 260 days, fans stayed in their seats and with tears in their eyes gave the players their last Bundesliga cheer.
