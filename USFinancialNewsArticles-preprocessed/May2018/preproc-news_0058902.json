So far the readouts from these meetings have been positive and we’ll continue to move forward in them,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a regularly scheduled briefing.\n“We’re going to continue to shoot for the June 12th and expect to do that,” she said, referring to the original date scheduled for the summit.
