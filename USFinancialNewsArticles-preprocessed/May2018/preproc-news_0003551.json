    "text": "Because of its strategy, Xiaomi has often been dubbed the \"Apple of China.\" How much money does Xiaomi make?\nXiaomi makes money from sales of its devices and services. In its IPO filing, Xiaomi showed its financials from the past few years.\nRevenue grew over 67 percent year-on-year in 2017 to 114.6 billion yuan ($18 billion).\nXiaomi made a net loss of 43.9 billion yuan in 2017, down from the 491.6 million profit it made in 2016. The company attributes this to the issuance of preferred shares to investors. But operating profit has been climbing over the years.\nWhile the company has continued to diversify its business, smartphones still account for over 70 percent of total revenue. But this is down from over 80 percent in 2015.\nMeanwhile, in the same period internet of things (IOT) and lifestyle products have increased their share of revenues from 13 percent to 20.5 percent. This highlights the company is trying to expand into new areas. Internet services, however, makes up less than 10 percent.\nXiaomi also still makes 72 percent of revenue from China and 28 percent from the rest of the world. It began expanding into new markets including India a few years ago, but is beginning to enter Western markets too.\nWang Xiang, the head of Xiaomi's international business, told CNBC in an interview earlier this year, that the company would eventually be in the U.S. How does Xiaomi stack up to Apple and Samsung?\nXiaomi is the fourth-largest smartphone player by market share. In 2017, it sold 91.4 million smartphones, according to its IPO filing. Here's how it stacks up to Apple , Samsung and Huawei, another Chinese brand.\nIt tries to compete on price. The average selling price of a Xiaomi smartphone is 881.3 yuan or $138.40. That is significantly lower than Apple's average selling price of $688 in 2017, and Samsung's at $230 in the same year, according to Counterpoint Research.\nXiaomi's highest priced phone is called the Mi MIX 2S and starts at 3,299 yuan or $518, way below the $999 starting price of Apple's iPhone X, and the $840 for Samsung's Galaxy S9 Plus.\nLei Jun, the CEO of Xiaomi, has committed the company to making more more than 5 percent on hardware net profit margins. Instead, it wants to make money from services.\nThe Chinese firm has a significantly lower operating margin. In 2017, this was 10.7 percent. In the first quarter of 2018, Apple reported an operating margin of 38.3 percent, while Samsung's was 47.3 percent. Samsung is helped by high margins on its semiconductor business.\nOn the services front, Xiaomi made around 9.9 billion yuan in revenues that equate to over $1.5 billion. In the first quarter of 2018 alone, Apple made over $9 billion. What are the risks?\nFor a primarily hardware business facing a slowing smartphone market, as well as intense competition, there are a number of risk factors.\n\"Smartphone sales account for a majority of our revenue, and any decrease in such sales or any increase in the costs associated with such sales may materially and adversely affect our business,\" Xiaomi says in its IPO filing.\nThat is a concern from many analysts too as well as the thin margins already highlighted. Neil Shah, research director of devices and ecosystems at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC that the lack of intellectual property means that Xiaomi's model could be replicated. show chapters 11 Hours Ago | 03:10\n\"The risk from investors is Xiaomi's gross margins and operating margins are weak and that doesn't instill much confidence, because the business model they are adopting is not based on intellectual property or significant R&D investment like Google, Apple, Huawei, so it's easily replicable,\" Shah said.\nXiaomi said that it has over 3,600 patents registered in China and 3,500 patents abroad. The company increased its research and development spend to 3.2 billion yuan in 2017 from 2.1 billion yuan the year before.\nOther risks the company has highlighted include not being able to continue making hit mobile games, the continued investment in physical retail stores, and any potential geopolitical tension that could affect its business.",
