    "text": "3 Hours Ago | 02:28\nHere's a breakdown of the biggest numbers in Friday's nonfarm payroll report for April:\n1. The good : The unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent during the month, the lowest level since December 2000, while black unemployment dropped to an all-time low 6.6 percent.\n2. The bad : Total job creation of 164,000 and wage growth of 2.6 percent on a year-over-year both were below economist expectations.\n3. The ugly : Another 410,000 folks dropped out of the workforce, bringing the total to 95.74 million â€” a big reason for the dropping headline unemployment rate.\n4. More numbers : Professional and business services led job creation with 54,000, manufacturing and health care contributed 24,000 each and mining increased by 8,000.\n5. Washington vs. Wall Street : The White House will focus on the jobless rate; investors will be more tuned into the low wage pressures, so the market's expectations of two more interest rate hikes this year likely will be unchanged.\nBreaking it down : AllianceBernstein senior economist Eric Winograd says: \"The market impact of today's number should be limited, but more positive than negative in my view.\"",
