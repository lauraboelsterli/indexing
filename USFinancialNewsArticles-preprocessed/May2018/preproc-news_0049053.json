    "text": "May 24 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the business pages of British newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.\nThe Times\nAviva Plc has told 50,000 customers that it overcharged them for their premiums and has promised to refund them in a bill that will run to millions of pounds.

( bit.ly/2s9oRWl )\nFalling demand for diesel cars and increased investment has dented profits at Jaguar Land Rover. Car sales rose 1.7 percent to 614,309 in the year to the end of March, a slowdown from 16 percent growth the year before, as trading in its key markets in the United Kingdom and Europe went into reverse. ( bit.ly/2s9pSxk )\nThe Guardian\nBovis Homes has suffered a sizeable shareholder revolt over the pay package it awarded its interim chief executive for fighting off two hostile takeover bids and steadying the business after a scandal over badly built homes. ( bit.ly/2xdxzZ8 )\nDairy Crest has announced plans to invest 85 million pounds ($113.67 million) in the expansion of its cheese factory in Cornwall to meet growing demand for cheddar in markets such as China. ( bit.ly/2x6TJwt )\nThe Telegraph\nBritish banking app Revolut is extending a push into cryptocurrencies, despite the Bitcoin boom subsiding and traditional lenders distancing themselves from the market. ( bit.ly/2s78Lwt )\nWater utility Severn Trent is preparing to splash out on a 100 million pound investment programme that will include leak-detecting robots, after earning financial rewards from the industry regulator for beating its delivery targets. ( bit.ly/2sbWKpA )\nSky News\nTalkTalk, the telecoms and broadband group, has struck a 175 million pound deal to offload part of its business-to-business customer base to Daisy Group, a privately owned rival. ( bit.ly/2x7bBHd )\nThe owner of the Gaucho restaurant chain is exploring a sale of the business as part of a review which includes the closure of its poorly performing Cau outlets.
