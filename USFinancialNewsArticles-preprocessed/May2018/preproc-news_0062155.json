    "text": "LONDON, May 29 (Reuters) - Britain’s Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday it was tripling capacity to fix problems with its Trent 1000 engines that have left some of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner planes grounded.\nRolls-Royce will set out full details on how it intends to speed up necessary inspections and repairs on Wednesday, a spokesman for the engine manufacturer said, confirming a development first reported by the Financial Times.\nTurbine blades in the Trent 1000 package C engines are not lasting as long as expected, requiring extra inspections and meaning airlines are having to ground some aircraft.\nAir New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic are among the airlines affected.
