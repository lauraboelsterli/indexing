(NASDAQ:LPLA) (the “Company”) today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018, reporting net income of $94 million, or $1.01 per share. This compares with $48 million, or $0.52 per share, in the first quarter of 2017 and $64 million, or $0.69 per share, in the prior quarter.\n“We started 2018 with another quarter of business and earnings growth,” said Dan Arnold, president and CEO. “Looking ahead, our strategic priorities remain growing our core business and executing with excellence. We continue our focus on making it easier for advisors to do business with us, investing in technology, and enhancing capabilities. We believe this focus will enable our advisors’ practices to thrive and drive future growth.”\n“This quarter our earnings continued to grow, nearly doubling from a year ago,” said Matt Audette, CFO. “We grew gross profit, remained disciplined on expenses, and drove operating leverage. Our share repurchases also increased from the prior quarter. Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain investing for organic growth, taking advantage of M&A opportunities if they arise, and returning capital to shareholders.\"\nAdditional First Quarter 2018 Financial and Business Highlights\nNPH Update\nOnboarded $36.0 billion in Total Brokerage and Advisory Assets, including $29.9 billion in brokerage assets and $6.2 billion in advisory assets in Q1. Q1 onboarding expenses were $16 million, including $6 million of Core G&A expense and $10 million of promotional expense. Total onboarding expense including 2017 and Q1 2018 was $36 million. Q1 financial assistance was $53 million, including $34 million provided as forgivable loans and $19 million provided as cash assistance. Total financial assistance including 2017 and Q1 2018 was $97 million. Finalized the purchase price of the NPH transaction at $325 million following the onboarding of the second wave of advisors, including $211 million of intangible assets. This increased Q1 amortization of intangible assets expense by $3 million sequentially.\nCapital Management\nThe Company returned capital to shareholders totaling $83 million in Q1 2018, translating to $0.90 per share. Deployed $61 million of capital to repurchase 968 thousand shares at an average price of $62.84 per share in Q1 2018. Paid dividends of $23 million on March 23, 2018. Capital expenditures were primarily driven by technology spend and totaled $23 million in Q1.\nCash available for corporate use was $474 million as of quarter-end, and Credit Agreement Net Leverage Ratio, which only applies to the revolving credit facility, was 2.46x, down 0.35x from the prior quarter. After applying $300 million of cash available for corporate use to Credit Agreement Net Debt, this left an additional $174 million of cash, which if applied to the debt, would further reduce the Credit Agreement Net Leverage Ratio to 2.25x.\nConference Call and Additional Information\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its results at 5:00 p.m. EDT on Thursday, May 3.

Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate operating performance and in formulating the budget for future periods. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures and metrics discussed below are appropriate for evaluating the performance of the Company.\nEPS Prior to Amortization of Intangible Assets is defined as GAAP EPS plus the per share impact of Amortization of Intangible Assets. The per share impact is calculated as Amortization of Intangible Assets expense, net of applicable tax benefit, divided by the number of shares outstanding for the applicable period. The Company presents EPS Prior to Amortization of Intangible Assets because management believes that the metric can provide investors with useful insight into the Company’s core operating performance by excluding non-cash items that management does not believe impact the Company’s ongoing operations. EPS Prior to Amortization of Intangible Assets is not a measure of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP EPS or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of EPS Prior to Amortization of Intangible Assets to GAAP EPS, please see footnote 32 on page 21 of this release.\nGross Profit is calculated as net revenues, which were $1,242 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, less commission and advisory expenses and brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees, which were $762 million and $16 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018. All other expense categories, including depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, are considered general and administrative in nature. Because the Company’s gross profit amounts do not include any depreciation and amortization expense, the Company considers its gross profit amounts to be non-GAAP financial measures that may not be comparable to those of others in its industry. Management believes that Gross Profit can provide investors with useful insight into the Company’s core operating performance before indirect costs that are general and administrative in nature.\nCore G&A consists of total operating expenses, which were $1,092 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, excluding the following expenses: commission and advisory, regulatory charges, promotional, employee share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangible assets, and brokerage, clearing, and exchange. Management presents Core G&A because it believes Core G&A reflects the corporate operating expense categories over which management can generally exercise a measure of control, compared with expense items over which management either cannot exercise control, such as commission and advisory expenses, or which management views as promotional expense necessary to support advisor growth and retention including conferences and transition assistance. Core G&A is not a measure of the Company’s total operating expenses as calculated in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of Core G&A against the Company’s total operating expenses, please see footnote 3 on page 19 of this release. The Company does not provide an outlook for its total operating expenses because it contains expense components, such as commission and advisory expenses, that are market-driven and over which the Company cannot exercise control. Accordingly a reconciliation of the Company’s outlook for Core G&A to an outlook for total operating expenses cannot be made available without unreasonable effort.\nEBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt. The Company presents EBITDA because management believes that it can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company’s earnings from operations. EBITDA is not a measure of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of profitability or liquidity. In addition, the Company’s EBITDA can differ significantly from EBITDA calculated by other companies, depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, and capital investments.\nCredit Agreement EBITDA is defined in, and calculated by management in accordance with, the Company's credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) as “Consolidated EBITDA,” which is Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and other adjustments, including unusual or non-recurring charges and gains, and to include future expected cost savings, operating expense reductions or other synergies from certain transactions, including the Company's acquisition of the broker/dealer network of National Planning Holdings, Inc. (\"NPH\"). The Company presents Credit Agreement EBITDA because management believes that it can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company’s debt capacity and covenant compliance under its Credit Agreement. Credit Agreement EBITDA is not a measure of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of profitability or liquidity. In addition, the Company’s Credit Agreement-defined EBITDA can differ significantly from adjusted EBITDA calculated by other companies, depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, capital investments, and types of adjustments made by such companies.\nNote on Pro Forma Calculations\nThis press release includes pro forma calculations, including EPS and net income prior to the impact of NPH and debt refinancing costs. 2018 pro forma amounts were calculated using a 28% effective tax rate, which is the mid-point of the Company’s expected effective tax rate between 27-29% for 2018. 2017 pro forma amounts were calculated using a 39.5% effective rate, which was the Company's prior expected effective tax rate\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release regarding the Company's future financial and operating results, outlook, growth, priorities and business strategies, including forecasts and statements relating to NPH annual run-rate EBITDA accretion, total anticipated asset transfer from NPH, future expenses, future capital allocation, as well as any other statements that are not related to present facts or current conditions or that are not purely historical, constitute These are based on the Company's historical performance and its plans, estimates, and expectations as of May 3, 2018.

Prior to Q4 2017, Management calculated Gross Profit ROA by dividing annualized Gross Profit for the period by Total Brokerage and Advisory Assets at the end of the period. Amounts in this release reflect this new methodology.\n(27) Represents annualized operating expenses for the period, excluding production-related expense, divided by average month-end Total Brokerage and Advisory Assets for the period. Production-related expense includes commissions and advisory expense and brokerage, clearing and exchange expense. For purposes of this metric, operating expenses includes Core G&A (FN 3), Regulatory, Promotional, Employee Share Based Compensation, Depreciation & Amortization, and Amortization of Intangible Assets. Prior to Q4 2017, Management calculated OPEX ROA by dividing annualized operating expenses for the period by Total Brokerage and Advisory Assets at the end of the period. Amounts in this release reflect this new methodology.\n(28) EBIT ROA is calculated as Gross Profit ROA less OPEX ROA.\n(29) Reflects retention of commission and advisory revenues, calculated by deducting the prior year production of the annualized year-to-date attrition rate, over the prior year total production.\n(30) Recurring Gross Profit Rate refers to the percentage of the Company’s gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, that was recurring for the period presented. Management tracks recurring gross profit, a characterization of gross profit and a statistical measure, which is defined to include the Company’s revenues from asset-based fees, advisory fees, trailing commissions, cash sweep programs, and certain other fees that are based upon client accounts and advisors, less the expenses associated with such revenues and certain other recurring expenses not specifically associated with a revenue line. Management allocates such other recurring expenses, such as non-GDC sensitive production expenses, on a pro-rata basis against specific revenue lines at its discretion.\n(31) Capital Allocation per Share equals the amount of capital allocated for share repurchases and cash dividends divided by the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.\n(32) EPS prior to amortization of intangible assets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see a description of EPS prior to amortization of intangible assets under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on page 3 of this release for additional information.
