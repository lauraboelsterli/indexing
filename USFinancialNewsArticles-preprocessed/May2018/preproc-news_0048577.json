(“Ceridian” or the “Company”) (NYSE:CDAY) (TSX:CDAY), a global human capital management (HCM) software company, announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. All financial results are reported in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in this press release, including the accompanying tables. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nDavid Ossip, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ceridian, commented, “Over the last five years, we have transformed Ceridian into a leading HCM cloud technology company. Our recent IPO was a significant milestone for us. Although we are very proud of all that we have achieved so far, we believe we have much more to accomplish and look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.”\nOssip continued, “We are pleased with our strong financial results for the first quarter of 2018. We believe that our focus on a culture of innovation and employee engagement creates successful outcomes for our customers and drives growth in our business.”\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter of 2018\nRevenue\nCloud revenue increased 38.0% to $125.2 million from $90.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Total HCM revenue, which includes revenue from both our Cloud and Bureau solutions, increased 11.8% to $187.2 million; and total revenue, which includes revenue from both the HCM and Lifeworks segments, increased 11.7% to $208.9 million from $187.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, Cloud revenue increased 35.6%, and total revenue increased 9.9%.\nOperating Profit (loss), Pretax Income (Loss) and Net Income (Loss)\nHCM operating profit increased to $27.3 million from $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, and total operating profit increased to $26.4 million from $12.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nPretax income was $4.2 million as compared to a pretax loss of $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net loss from continuing operations attributable to Ceridian was $2.1 million, compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Ceridian of $11.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Ceridian was $(0.11) for the first quarter of 2018 based on 65.3 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Net loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Ceridian was $(0.25) for the first quarter of 2017, based on 65.0 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\nHCM Adjusted EBITDA\nHCM Adjusted EBITDA increased 39.7% to $43.6 million from $31.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 23.3% from 18.6%, in the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nCash and cash equivalents were $62.2 million as of March 31, 2018. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was ($23.3) million compared to ($44.0) million for the first quarter of 2017.\nDayforce Live Customer Count\n3,154 Dayforce customers were live on the Dayforce platform at the end of the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 674 customers as compared to 2,480 Dayforce customers at the end of the first quarter of 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on information available as of May 22, 2018, Ceridian is issuing guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2018 as indicated below.\nSecond Quarter 2018\nCloud revenue is expected to be in the range of $123 million to $125 million. Total HCM revenue is expected to be in the range of $173 million to $175 million. HCM Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $27 million to $29 million.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018\nCloud revenue is expected to be in the range of $521 million to $524 million. Total HCM revenue is expected to be in the range of $730 million to $735 million. HCM Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $148 million to $152 million.\nWe have not reconciled the Adjusted EBITDA ranges for the second quarter of 2018 or the full fiscal year of 2018 to the directly comparable GAAP financial measure because applicable information for future periods, on which this reconciliation would be based, is not readily available due to uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other items. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these Adjusted EBITDA ranges to the directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call Details\nCeridian will host a conference call on May 22, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to discuss the financial results for the first quarter of 2018. The conference call can be accessed by dialing 1-877-407-0784 (U.S. & Canada) or 1-201-689-8560 (International).

Dayforce, our flagship cloud HCM platform, provides human resources, payroll, benefits, workforce management, and talent management functionality. Our platform is used to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle, including attracting, engaging, paying, deploying, and developing people. Ceridian has solutions for organizations of all sizes.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release including HCM Adjusted EBITDA, HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin, and revenue growth in a constant currency. We believe that HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP financial measures, are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are components of our management incentive plan and are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors. We define HCM Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations, LifeWorks EBITDA, sponsor management fees, non-cash charges for asset impairments, gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary, non-cash share-based compensation expense, severance charges, restructuring consulting fees, and environmental reserve charges. HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin is determined by calculating the percentage HCM Adjusted EBITDA is of Total HCM Revenue. Management believes that HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management.\nOur presentation of HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss), earnings per share, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity. Our presentation of HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by these items. HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance.\nHCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin are not defined under U.S. GAAP, are not measures of net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and are subject to important limitations. Our use of the terms HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nHCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nHCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any charges for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may need to be replaced in the future; HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect the impact of share-based compensation upon our results of operations; HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes.\nIn evaluating HCM Adjusted EBITDA and HCM Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation.\nWe present revenue growth in a constant currency to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis by applying a fixed 1.30 Canadian dollar to 1 U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in Canadian dollars and 0.75 British pound sterling to 1 U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in British pound sterling for all applicable periods.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or current conditions included in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements in this press release include statements relating to second quarter and full year fiscal 2018 total HCM revenue, cloud revenue and HCM Adjusted EBITDA, as well as those relating to future growth initiatives. These statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “seek,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “continue,” “likely,” “should,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events but not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you consider this press release, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. These assumptions and our future performance or results involve risks and uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control). These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: our inability to attain or to maintain profitability; significant competition for our solutions; our inability to continue to develop or to sell our existing Cloud solutions; our inability to manage our growth effectively; the risk that we may not be able to successfully migrate our Bureau customers to our Cloud solutions or to offset the decline in Bureau revenue with Cloud revenue; the market for enterprise cloud computing develops slower than we expect or declines; efforts to increase use of our Cloud solutions and our other applications may not succeed; we fail to provide enhancements and new features and modifications to our solutions; we fail to comply with the FTC’s ongoing consent order regarding data protection; system interruptions or failures, including cyber-security breaches, identity theft, or other disruptions that could compromise our information; our failure to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards; changes in regulations governing privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign data protection regulations; we are unable to successfully expand our current offerings into new markets or further penetrate existing markets; we are unable to meet the more complex configuration and integration demands of our large customers; our customers declining to renew their agreements with us or renewing at lower performance fee levels; we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure; we are unable to maintain necessary third party licenses or errors; our inability to protect our intellectual property rights, proprietary technology, information, processes, and know-how; we fail to keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards; changes in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself and general economic, political and market forces beyond our control. Additional factors or events that could cause our actual performance to differ from these forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual financial condition, results of operations, future performance and business may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. In addition to any factors and assumptions set forth above in this press release, the material factors and assumptions used to develop the forward-looking information include, but are not limited to: the general economy remains stable; the competitive environment in the HCM market remains stable; the demand environment for HCM solutions remains stable; our implementation capabilities and cycle times remain stable; the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada continue to increase interest rates as anticipated; foreign exchange rates, specifically USD to CAD and USD to GBP, remain stable at, or near, current rates; we will be able to maintain our relationships with our employees, customers and partners; we will continue to attract qualified personnel to support our development requirements and the support of our new and existing customers; and that the risk factors noted above, individually or collectively, do not have a material impact on the Company. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nCeridian HCM Holding Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Dollars in millions, except share data)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (unaudited) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and equivalents $ 62.2 $ 99.6 Trade and other receivables, net 81.1 79.9 Prepaid expenses 49.2 37.9 Other current assets 1.8 5.3 Total current assets before customer trust funds 194.3 222.7 Customer trust funds 4,293.9 4,099.7 Total current assets 4,488.2 4,322.4 Property, plant, and equipment, net 103.4 103.8 Goodwill 2,075.8 2,087.3 Other intangible assets, net 206.6 212.4 Other assets 5.5 4.0 Total assets $ 6,879.5 $ 6,729.9 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Current portion of long-term debt $ — $ — Accounts payable 47.6 48.8 Accrued interest 2.7 15.9 Deferred revenue 18.5 16.8 Employee compensation and benefits 55.7 70.0 Other accrued expenses 16.7 15.5 Total current liabilities before customer trust funds obligations 141.2 167.0 Customer trust funds obligations 4,313.2 4,105.5 Total current liabilities 4,454.4 4,272.5 Long-term debt, less current portion 1,120.5 1,119.8 Employee benefit plans 147.3 152.4 Other liabilities 53.8 56.2 Total liabilities 5,776.0 5,600.9 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity: Senior preferred stock, $0.01 par, 70,000,000 shares authorized, 16,802,144 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 190.1 184.8 Junior preferred stock, $0.01 par, 70,000,000 shares authorized, 58,244,308 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 0.6 0.6 Common stock, $0.01 par, 150,000,000 shares authorized, 65,374,309 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and 65,285,962 shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017 0.7 0.7 Additional paid in capital 1,568.3 1,565.4 Accumulated deficit (355.6 ) (348.2 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (337.7 ) (312.1 ) Total stockholders' equity 1,066.4 1,091.2 Noncontrolling interest 37.1 37.8 Total equity 1,103.5 1,129.0 Total liabilities and equity $ 6,879.5 $ 6,729.9\nCeridian HCM Holding Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited; dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nThree Months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenue: Recurring services $ 188.7 $ 171.4 Professional services and other 20.2 15.6 Total revenue 208.9 187.0 Cost of revenue: Recurring services 62.7 58.8 Professional services and other 32.8 33.9 Product development and management 15.4 12.8 Depreciation and amortization 8.8 7.7 Total cost of revenue 119.7 113.2 Gross profit 89.2 73.8 Costs and expenses: Selling, general, and administrative 65.6 60.7 Other (income) expense, net (2.8 ) 0.9 Interest expense, net 22.2 21.4 Total costs and expenses 85.0 83.0 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 4.2 (9.2 ) Income tax expense 6.8 2.5 Loss from continuing operations (2.6 ) (11.7 ) Income from discontinued operations — 0.5 Net loss (2.6 ) (11.2 ) Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (0.5 ) — Net loss attributable to Ceridian $ (2.1 ) $ (11.2 ) Net loss per share attributable to Ceridian -
