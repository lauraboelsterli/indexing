    "text": "GENEVA, May 21 (Reuters) - The spread of Ebola to a major city in Democratic Republic of Congo is worrying but the outlook is much more optimistic than when a major outbreak was reported in West Africa in 2014, the head of the World Health Organization said on Monday.\n“It’s concerning that we now have cases of Ebola in an urban centre, but we are much better placed to deal with this outbreak than we were in 2014,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom told health ministers at the start of the WHO’s annual assembly.\n“I’m pleased to say that vaccination is starting as we speak today.” (Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Toby Chopra)\n ",
