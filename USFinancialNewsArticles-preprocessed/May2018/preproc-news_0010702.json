    "text": "WALDORF, Md., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Recovery Centers of America (RCA), a community-based addiction treatment provider delivering evidence-based care, has hired Adam Brickner, MPA, as Chief Executive Officer of its 140-bed Waldorf, MD facility serving Southern Maryland and the Washington, D.C. area.\nBrickner, who has over 30 years of experience developing and implementing programs in diverse communities, has dedicated his life to ensure individuals and families suffering from substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health disorders receive the highest quality clinical and therapeutic care.\n\"I was attracted to Recovery Centers of America by its reputation and their commitment to getting people the level of care they need with 24/7 operations, door-to-door services and master's-level staff training,\" said Brickner. \"Integrity is key when delivering addiction treatment services and the level of service and work here is beyond reproach.\"\nAmong his accomplishments as a leader in treatment program implementation, Brickner most recently created and executed The Family Effect Foundation, a nonprofit corporation to fundraise for services at the Phoenix Center in South Carolina, where he worked as executive director. His work focuses on expanding addiction treatment services in communities who need affordable, accessible care and sees RCA as the best place to do that.\nBrickner also served as president and CEO of Baltimore City's Substance Use Systems where he managed a yearly budget of $50 million to provide uninsured and underinsured individuals access to addiction treatment. There, he oversaw the management of treatment services for the city, working among 70 treatment agencies.\nEarlier in his career Brickner was appointed as the city of Denver's first 'drug czar' serving as Director of the Office of Drug Strategy where he launched a program to provide housing and treatment for homeless young adults with SUD.\n\"We're thrilled to welcome Adam to our team,\" says RCA's Chief Operations Officer J.P. Christen. \"He is one of the most accomplished leaders in this industry. His passion for erasing the stigma of addiction and delivery of innovative treatment to families struggling with addiction will help thousands access the high-quality care that's desperately needed in Washington, D.C.\"\nBrickner holds two masters' degrees— one in public administration from Clemson University, and another in executive leadership from the University of Maryland, College Park. He received a bachelor's degree in sociology from the University of Colorado, Boulder.\nAbout Recovery Centers of America\nRecovery Centers of America provides a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to addiction treatment. We are in-network with most major insurance providers, which improves access to affordable care and reduces out of pocket expenses for individuals and families seeking addiction treatment.\nOur centers for addiction medicine are located in your neighborhood so it's easy for families to participate in the treatment process and to access care 24/7.
