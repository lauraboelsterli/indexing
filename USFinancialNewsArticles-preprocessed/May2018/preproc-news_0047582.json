    "text": "BERLIN/FRANKFURT, May 22 (Reuters) - The following are some of the factors that may move German stocks on Tuesday:\nU.S. TRADE German companies are concerned that U.S. President Donald Trump is increasingly thinking only of America rather than just putting his country first, the head of Germany’s DIHK Chambers of Commerce told media.\nIRAN The United States on Monday demanded Iran make sweeping changes — from dropping its nuclear program to pulling out of the Syrian civil war — or face severe economic sanctions as the Trump administration hardened its approach to Tehran.\nThe German government will help German firms with business in Iran where it can, but cannot entirely shield them from the U.S. decision to quit the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions against Tehran, the economy minister told a newspaper.\nDEUTSCHE BANK Postbank plans to close more than 100 of its 1,000 branches by the end of the year, a board member told Bild am Sonntag, in a move unrelated to the bank’s troubled parent company Deutsche Bank.\nSeparately, Deutsche Bank finance chief James von Moltke told Boersen-Zeitung he did not expect any more major restructuring costs next year comparable to the expenses for the integration of Postbank or the restructuring of the investment bank.\nRWE, UNIPER Germany could reduce its coal-fired power generation capacity by half in the coming years if planned grid expansion and the addition of new gas-fired plants come online on schedule, the head of its energy regulator said.\nDIALOG SEMICONDUCTOR Dialog Semiconductor Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli said in an interview that his company would remain an important supplier to Apple amid reports that the U.S. tech giant will develop its own chips, Euro am Sonntag reported.\nEVOTEC Evotec and Celgene have entered into a long-term strategic drug discovery and development partnership to identify new therapeutics in oncology, Evotec said late on Sunday.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Evotec will receive an upfront payment of $65 million and may be eligible to receive significant milestone payments as well as tiered royalties on each licensed programme, it said.\nINDEX CHANGES AS OF SEPT. 24 Deutsche Boerse is planning a major shakeup of the composition of the MDAX, SDAX and TecDAX that affects technology stocks. It will publish shadow indices on June 18.\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGS BET-AT-HOME.COM - 7.50 eur/shr dividend proposed\nEX-DIVIDEND\nFRESENIUS - 0.75 eur/shr dividend\nANALYSTS’ VIEWS MBB SE - Berenberg cuts target price to EUR 121 from Eur 122\nOVERSEAS STOCK MARKETS US markets closed.\nNikkei -0.1 pct, Shanghai stocks -0.4 pct.\nTime: 5.19 GMT.\nGERMAN ECONOMIC DATA No economic data scheduled.\nDIARIES REUTERS TOP NEWS (Reporting by Andreas Cremer, Tom Sims, Maria Sheahan and Caroline Copley)\n ",
