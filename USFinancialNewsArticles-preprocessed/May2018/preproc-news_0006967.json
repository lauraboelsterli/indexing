    "text": "BALTIMORE, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE: UA, UAA) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The company reports its financial performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). This press release refers to \"currency neutral\" and \"adjusted\" amounts, which are non-GAAP financial measures described below under the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" paragraph. References to adjusted financial measures exclude the impact of the company's restructuring plans. Reconciliations of non-GAAP amounts to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP are presented in supplemental financial information furnished with this release. All per share amounts are reported on a diluted basis.\n\"Our first quarter results demonstrate measured progress against our focus on operational excellence and becoming a better company,\" said Under Armour Chairman and CEO Kevin Plank. \"As we continue to build our global brand by delivering innovative performance products to our athletes, amplifying our story, further strengthening our go-to-market process, and leveraging our systems to create even deeper consumer connections - we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year targets.\"\nThe summary below provides both GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. On February 13, the company announced a 2018 restructuring plan, which detailed expectations to incur total estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges of approximately $110 million to $130 million. In the first quarter, we recognized pre-tax costs totaling $45 million consisting of $32 million in cash related charges and $13 million in non-cash charges. Adjusted financial measures exclude the impact of the restructuring and other related charges and the related tax effects.\nFirst Quarter Review\nRevenue was up 6 percent to $1.2 billion (up 4 percent currency neutral). Revenue to wholesale customers increased 1 percent to $779 million and direct-to-consumer revenue was up 17 percent to $352 million. The direct-to-consumer business represented 30 percent of global revenue in the quarter. North America revenue was relatively flat (down 1 percent currency neutral) and the international business continued to deliver strong growth with a 27 percent increase (up 19 percent currency neutral), representing 24 percent of total revenue. Within the international business, revenue in EMEA was up 23 percent (up 13 percent currency neutral), up 35 percent in Asia-Pacific (up 28 percent currency neutral) and up 21 percent in Latin America (up 14 percent currency neutral). Apparel revenue increased 7 percent to $766 million, driven by strength in men's training. Footwear revenue was up 1 percent to $272 million with strength in running tempered by team sports and global football. Accessories revenue increased 3 percent to $92 million led by men's training. Gross margin declined 120 basis points to 44.2 percent as benefits from changes in foreign currency rates were more than offset by accelerated inventory management initiatives. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes an $8 million impact related to restructuring efforts, was 44.8 percent, a decrease of 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Selling, General & Administrative expenses increased 3 percent to $515 million, or 43.4 percent of revenue driven by continued investments in the direct-to-consumer, footwear and international businesses. Restructuring and impairment charges were $37 million. Operating loss was $29 million. Adjusted operating income was $16 million. Net loss was $30 million. Excluding the impact of the restructuring plan, adjusted net income was $1 million. Diluted earnings per share was negative $0.07. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.00. Inventory increased 27 percent to $1.1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents increased 65 percent to $284 million.\nUpdated Fiscal 2018 Outlook\nThere are no changes to the company's full year 2018 outlook provided on February 13, 2018:\nNet revenue is expected to be up at a low single-digit percentage rate reflecting a mid-single-digit decline in North America and international growth of greater than 25 percent. Gross margin is expected to increase approximately 50 basis points to 45.5 percent due to benefits from lower planned promotional activity, product costs, channel mix and changes in foreign currency. Operating income is expected to reach $20 million to $30 million. Excluding the impact of continued restructuring efforts, adjusted operating income is expected to be $130 million to $160 million. Interest and other expense net is planned at approximately $45 million. Excluding the impact of the restructuring efforts, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.19; and, Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $225 million compared with $275 million in 2017.\nConference Call and Webcast\nUnder Armour will hold its first quarter 2018 conference call and webcast today at approximately 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The call will be webcast live at http://investor.underarmour.com and will be archived and available for replay approximately three hours after the live event.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release refers to \"currency neutral\" and \"adjusted\" results as well as \"adjusted\" forward looking estimates of the company's fiscal 2018 outlook. Currency neutral financial information is calculated to exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency. Management believes this information is useful to investors to facilitate a comparison of the company's results of operations period-over-period. Adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of restructuring and other related charges. Management believes this information is useful to investors because it provides enhanced visibility into the company's actual and expected underlying results excluding the impact of its restructuring plans. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation and should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAbout Under Armour, Inc.\nUnder Armour, Inc., headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland is a leading inventor, marketer and distributor of branded performance athletic apparel, footwear and accessories.

As a result of the 2018 restructuring plan, the company's GAAP net income for fiscal year 2018 is expected to be insignificant, and therefore the GAAP effective tax rate is subject to significant variability. Given this variability, the company cannot provide a meaningful outlook of the GAAP effective tax rate or diluted earnings per share without unreasonable effort. These non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of the 2018 restructuring plan.\nBRAND HOUSE AND FACTORY HOUSE DOOR COUNT\nAs of March 31, 2018\n2018\n2017\nFactory House\n160\n150\nBrand House\n18\n18\nNorth America total doors\n178\n168\nFactory House\n57\n38\nBrand House\n62\n39\nInternational total doors\n119\n77\nFactory House\n217\n188\nBrand House\n80\n57\nTotal doors\n297\n245\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/under-armour-reports-first-quarter-results-300639592.html\nSOURCE Under Armour, Inc.",
