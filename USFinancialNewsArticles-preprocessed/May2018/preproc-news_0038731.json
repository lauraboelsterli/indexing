FILE PHOTO: Anti-establishment 5-Star Movement Luigi Di Maio smiles during a news conference at the Foreign Press Club in Rome, Italy, March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile/File Photo/File Photo\nIf they receive the backing of their supporters in swift, informal ballots planned over the next three days, the coalition government could take office as early as next week, ending 11 weeks of political paralysis.\nHowever, the two parties have yet to announce who they want to put forward as prime minister and still need the blessing of President Sergio Mattarella.
