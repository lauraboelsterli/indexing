    "text": "FAIRFAX, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Freedom Bank of Virginia (OTCQX: FDVA), (the “Company” or “Freedom”), today reported net income of $2.69 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the full year 2017. Excluding a one-time tax adjustment of $603,331 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for 2017 was $3.30 million, or $0.48 per diluted share.\nThe Company also restated certain amounts in the December 31, 2016 and 2015 balance sheets and the 2016 statement of operations to correct errors related to accounting for stock compensation expense, deferred loan origination costs, interest rate lock commitments and deferred income taxes. Please see “Restatement Summary” below for more information.\nHighlights for 2017:\nNet income was $2.69 million, or $0.39 per diluted share for the full year 2017, compared to net income of $2.65 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the full year 2016; Excluding a one-time tax adjustment of $603,331 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, non-GAAP adjusted net income for 2017 was $3.30 million, or $0.48 per diluted share; Total assets were $533.1 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $36.2 million or 7.3% from the previous year; Available-for-sale securities increased by $32.9 million in 2017, as the Company increased its on-balance sheet liquidity; Loans receivable were flat in 2017 compared to 2016, as payoffs offset new loan originations; Deposits grew by $66.6 million during the year or 16.67% to $465.9 million at December 31, 2017, with the growth occurring in demand deposits. Time deposits declined in 2017 as the Company made the decision to reduce brokered certificates of deposits by $24 million; Federal Home Loan Bank advances declined by $33.3 million or 76.14% in 2017, as the Company paid off wholesale borrowings; Capital ratios were strong in 2017, and above regulatory minimums for well-capitalized banks, with increases in the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, the Tier 1 Capital ratio (based on risk weighted assets), and the Total Capital ratio, compared to 2016.\nCEO Craig Underhill said, “Freedom focused on better utilizing its banking centers in 2017 to increase core deposits. We were pleased with our results as transaction account balances increased by $76.7 million. The Company used the increase in core deposits to pay down brokered deposits and short term borrowings. Brokered CDs were reduced by $24 million and all short term borrowings were repaid in 2017.\n“The Company has consistently grown average loan balances over the past few years, with an increased concentration in commercial real estate (CRE) loans. In 2017, the Company diversified its loan portfolio by emphasizing other types of loans resulting in a decrease in CRE concentration (as measured by CRE loans relative to total capital) to 229% on Dec 31, 2017 from 301% on Dec 31, 2016. We believe in the long run, refining our model to grow a diversified loan portfolio funded with core deposits will enhance shareholder value.”\nRestatement Summary\nCertain amounts in the Company’s December 31, 2016 and 2015 balance sheets and in the Company’s 2016 statement of operations have been restated for the corrections of accounting errors related to interest rate lock commitments, deferred loan origination costs, stock based compensation and deferred income taxes related to unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale that were transferred to held-to-maturity. During 2017, the Company determined that it did not properly record interest rate lock commitments related to locked mortgage loans being held as of December 31, 2016 along with deferred loan origination costs. The initial recording of interest rate lock commitments and deferred loan origination costs as of January 1, 2016 increased other assets and loans, with an offsetting increase to retained earnings. The correction of the errors for 2016 activity related to the interest rate lock commitments and deferred loan origination costs reduced other assets and gain on loans held for sale and increased loans, interest and fees on loans and officer and employee compensation. Also, during 2017, the Company determined that several errors had been made in the calculation of stock based compensation. Historically the Company has utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The historical calculations were comprised of mathematical errors along with errors in the key assumptions of the model. The net effect of the correction of these errors was an increase to additional paid-in capital, an increase to stock based compensation and a decrease to retained earnings. The Company also determined that at December 31, 2016 the deferred tax asset related to the aforementioned transferred securities had not been recorded. The correction of this error increased other assets and decreased accumulated other comprehensive loss. The change to accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2015 resulted from the correction of the income tax rate used to measure deferred tax assets at that date. The effects of the corrections of these errors on the Company’s prior year financial statements are summarized below:\nPreviously Effect of Reported Restated Restatement Amounts Amounts Increase (Decrease) At December 31, 2015: Additional paid in capital $ 24,282,805 $ 24,774,323 $ 491,518 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (371,695 ) (377,412 ) (5,717 ) Retained earnings 1,442,485 1,105,662 (336,823 ) Stockholders' equity 42,580,925 42,729,903 148,978 At December 31, 2016: Loans receivable $ 402,941,879 $ 403,414,060 $ 472,181 Deferred tax asset 1,891,600 2,288,271 396,671 Other assets 1,597,333 1,078,706 (518,627 ) Total assets 496,537,149 496,887,374 350,225 Other accrued expenses 1,598,948 1,598,943 (5 ) Additional paid in capital 47,958,932 48,708,431 749,499 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (548,380 ) (523,402 ) 24,978 Retained earnings 4,184,269 3,760,022 (424,247 ) Stockholders' equity 51,656,614 52,006,844 350,230 Year ended December 31, 2016: Interest and fees on loans $ 19,287,266 $ 19,327,206 $ 39,940 Gain on sale of mortgage loans 4,986,961 4,982,058 (4,903 ) Officer and employee compensation 10,726,227 10,984,208 257,981 Income before income taxes 4,154,184 3,931,240 (222,944 ) Income tax expense 1,412,400 1,276,880 (135,520 ) Net income 2,741,784 2,654,360 (87,424 ) Earnings per common share - basic (1) $ 0.43 $ 0.42 ($0.01 ) Earnings per common share - diluted (1) 0.42 0.41 (0.01 ) (1) - retroactively restated for effects of the 5% stock dividend declared in 2017 Total Revenue\nInterest income was $23.13 million in 2017, compared to $20.51 million in 2016, an increase of 12.8%, primarily due to higher interest income from loans. Interest expense was $5 million in 2017, higher by $1.3 million compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing deposits in 2017 as the Company increased on-balance sheet liquidity during the year. Net interest income (before a provision for loan losses) was $18.13 million in 2017, higher by $1.3 million compared to 2016, or an increase of 7.8%.\nNon-interest income in 2017 was $4.64 million, compared to $5.26 million in 2016 (as restated), a decline of 11.9%, primarily due to lower gain-on-sale revenue from the sale of mortgage loans. Total revenue (comprising net interest income and non-interest income) was $22.77 million in 2017, flat relative to 2016.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for 2017 was $17.65 million, higher by 3.5% compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in fees paid for professional services during 2017 and higher franchise taxes. Compensation expenses were flat during the year. Occupancy expenses increased slightly as the Company opened a banking center in Chantilly, Virginia, during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAsset Quality\nAsset quality continued to be strong with total non-performing assets of $666,125 or 0.12% of total assets as of December 31, 2017, compared to $396,341 or 0.08% of total assets at December 31, 2016.\nAll of the non-performing loans in 2017 and 2016 were non-accrual loans. Consequently, non-accrual loans were $666,125 or 0.16% of total loans as of December 31, 2017, compared to $396,341 or 0.10% of total loans as of December 31, 2016. The Company’s allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) was $4.56 million or 1.12% of total loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $4.15 million or 1.02% of total loans at December 31, 2016. The Company experienced increased loss recoveries in 2017 and flat loan growth, which resulted in a modest $30,000 provision for loan losses in 2017, compared to a provision of $1.09 million in the prior year.\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $533.1 million, compared to $496.9 million at December 31, 2016 (as restated), an increase of $36.2 million during the year. Changes in major asset categories were as follows:\nCash balances and deposits with other banks increased by $29.6 million compared to December 31, 2016, and Fed Funds sold decreased by $24 million. Available-for-sale securities balances increased by $32.9 million compared to December 31, 2016, as the Company built up on-balance sheet liquidity.\nTotal Liabilities\nTotal liabilities at December 31, 2017 were $477.8 million, an increase of $33 million compared to December 31, 2016. Deposits grew by $66.6 million for the full year to $466 million as of December 31, 2017. Demand deposits increased by $76.7 million, offset by declines in savings and time deposits. The decrease in time deposits resulted from the Company’s decision to pay off maturing brokered certificates of deposits. Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances decreased by $33.3 million as the Company paid off wholesale borrowings.\nShareholders Equity and Capital\nShareholders equity at December 31, 2017 was $55.3 million, compared to $52.0 million at December 31, 2016 (as restated). Additional paid in capital at December 31, 2017 was $53.2 million compared to $48.7 million at December 31, 2016 (as restated), primarily due to a 5% stock dividend that was declared on May 29, 2017, which increased the average number of common shares outstanding by 167,067. The book value of the Company’s common stock at December 31, 2017 was $8.47 per share versus $8.42 per share at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, all of the Company’s capital ratios were well above regulatory minimum capital ratios for well capitalized banks. The Bank’s actual capital amounts and capital ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nMinimum to be Well Capitalized Under For Capital Prompt Corrective Actual Adequacy Purposes Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio December 31, 2017 Total Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 60,370,258 14.41 % $ 33,508,352 8.00 % $ 41,885,440 10.00 % Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 55,807,888 13.32 % $ 25,131,264 6.00 % $ 33,508,352 8.00 % Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 55,807,888 13.32 % $ 18,848,448 4.50 % $ 27,225,536 6.50 % Tier 1 Capital (to Adjusted Average Assets) $ 55,807,888 10.19 % $ 21,916,680 4.00 % $ 27,395,850 5.00 % December 31, 2016 Total Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 56,620,327 13.33 % $ 33,980,095 8.00 % $ 42,475,119 10.00 % Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 52,470,246 12.35 % $ 25,485,071 6.00 % $ 33,980,095 8.00 % Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 52,470,246 12.35 % $ 19,113,803 4.50 % $ 27,608,827 6.50 % Tier 1 Capital (to Adjusted Average Assets) $ 52,470,246 10.82 % $ 19,398,600 4.00 % $ 24,248,250 5.00 % About Freedom Bank\nFreedom Bank is a community-oriented bank with locations in Fairfax, Reston, Chantilly and Vienna, Virginia.
