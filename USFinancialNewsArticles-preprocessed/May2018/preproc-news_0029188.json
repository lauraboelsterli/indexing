FILE PHOTO: Sabine Lautenschlaeger, executive board member of the European Central bank (ECB), looks on during the Bundesbank Banking Congress \"Symposium on Financial Stability and the Role of Central Banks\" in Frankfurt, February 28, 2014. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\nBank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau and ECB board members Sabine Lautenschlaeger and Peter Praet all said a recent easing of price growth was likely to be temporary, signalling the central bank was still on course to withdraw its monetary stimulus.\nVilleroy went as far as saying the ECB could soon clarify the timing of its first increase in interest rates since 2011, which he expects to happen “some quarters” after the end of its bond-buying programme.\nMarkets broadly expect the stimulus programme to end in December and be followed by a rate hike towards the middle of next year, though some analysts have pushed back their forecasts after a run of subdued data.\nSo far, the ECB has said rates are to remain at current levels for an “extended period of time, and well past” the conclusion of its the 2.55 trillion euro (2.2 trillion pounds) money-printing scheme.\n“As far as the first rate hike is concerned, we could give additional guidance on its timing, ‘well past’ meaning at least some quarters but not years, and additional guidance on its contingency on the inflation outlook,” Villeroy said.
