Riley FBR in Boston.\n“The (retail sales) data is impressive, the yield on the 10-year is reflective of that, and that we get further noise on 3 percent and that becomes an issue.”\nThe losses were broad based with all the 11 major S&P sectors and all the 30 Dow components in the red.\nHome Depot Inc slipped 1.7 percent in premarket trading after the No.1 U.S. home improvement chain missed Wall Street forecasts for sales at established stores as an unusually long winter hit demand for typical spring products.\nSmaller rival Lowe’s was down 0.8 percent.\nAt 9:46 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 175.28 points, or 0.70 percent, at 24,724.13, the S&P 500 was down 20.54 points, or 0.75 percent, at 2,709.59 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 72.66 points, or 0.98 percent, at 7,338.66.\nAgilent Technologies dropped 9.1 percent after posting a disappointing quarterly forecast late on Monday.\nFord dipped 0.8 percent after Piper Jaffray cut its rating to “neutral” on the automaker’s shares.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.96-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.98-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 1 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 20 new lows.
