    "text": "MILAN, May 29 (Reuters) - French telecoms operator Iliad launched its Italian business on Tuesday with an offer that seeks to undercut its rivals.\nIliad’s Italian head Benedetto Levi said the group would offer a mobile package in Italy costing 5.99 euros per month with 30 gigabytes of traffic and unlimited SMS messages.\nThe offer starts today, Levi said.\nThe Italy launch, initially expected by the end of 2017 or early 2018, is Iliad’s first international venture. Entering the Italian telecoms market will be a major test for the French group, already pressured by fierce competition at home.
