    "text": "ALPHARETTA, Ga., May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Neenah, Inc. (NYSE: NP) today reported 2018 first quarter results.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nRevenues increased 10 percent to a record $266.5 million compared with $242.1 million in the prior year. Earnings per diluted common share (E.P.S.) of $0.95 decreased 8 percent compared with $1.03 per share in 2017. Adjusted E.P.S. of $1.04 increased 1 percent compared with $1.03 in 2017. Adjusted E.P.S. in 2018 excluded $0.05 per share for true-up of estimated one-time taxes on foreign earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") and excluded a SERP settlement charge of $0.04 per share ($0.8 million pre-tax). Cash generated from operations of $8.1 million reflected normal working capital seasonality and decreased from $22.0 million in 2017 largely as a result of a favorable change in vendor payment terms in 2017 and, in 2018, accelerated timing of employee retirement plan contributions, a SERP payment and higher receivables associated with increased sales. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.41 per share increased 11 percent compared to the prior year and marked an eighth consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases.\nSubsequent Event\nToday the Company announced that following an analysis of various initiatives to optimize the portfolio of products and the manufacturing footprint in the Fine Paper & Packaging segment, a process will be initiated to sell its manufacturing facility located in Brattleboro, Vermont. Historically, this mill has manufactured products primarily for the office supply category. Based on preliminary estimates, a second quarter non-cash impairment charge related to the mill and associated office and R&D facilities could be in the range of $30 to $40 million.\n\"Adjusted earnings\" is a non-GAAP measure used to enhance understanding and comparability of year-on-year results and are reconciled to GAAP figures later in this release.\n\"Our results in the first quarter reflected very strong performance in our Technical Products businesses, tempered by expected near term cost headwinds in Fine Paper & Packaging. As we communicated in February, impacts from these higher input and freight costs would be most significant in the first half of this year. Changes in costs are a normal part of business and our teams are implementing improvements to offset them, just as we have in the past. This includes ongoing evaluations of our product portfolio and asset footprint which has led to the announcement of the sale process for our mill in Vermont,\" said John O'Donnell, Chief Executive Officer. \"The actions we're taking to address costs will contribute to improved margins and profits as we move forward in the year. In addition, we're successfully executing our top line strategies to expand in profitable and growing markets like filtration, premium packaging and performance materials. Our financial position is strong and our teams are engaged as we continue to transform the growth trajectory of our company in ways that can deliver the maximum value to our shareholders.\"\nQuarterly Consolidated Results\nIncome Statement\nConsolidated net sales increased 10 percent to a record $266.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $242.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue gains resulted from higher volumes, both organic and with the November 2017 Coldenhove acquisition, a higher-priced sales mix, increased selling prices and favorable currency effects.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense of $26.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased from $24.6 million in the prior year primarily as a result of acquired SG&A.\nOperating income of $24.1 million in 2018 decreased 11 percent from $27.0 million in 2017. Income benefited from volume growth, a higher value mix, increased selling prices and currency, but was more than offset by higher input and distribution costs.\nNet interest expense of $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased slightly from $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increased expense in 2018 was primarily due to higher debt to finance the acquisition of Coldenhove.\nThe effective income tax rate of 22 percent in the first quarter of 2018 decreased from 26 percent in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the Tax Act, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Income tax expense in the first quarter of 2017 was lower than the 35% statutory corporate tax rate primarily due to higher tax benefits related to stock compensation. In the first quarter of 2018, income tax expense was reduced by $0.5 million as a result of pension contributions that benefited from the Tax Act, and increased by $0.8 million to true-up estimated taxes on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries following additional clarification of Tax Act regulations.\nIncome from continuing operations of $16.2 million decreased 8 percent compared with $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 and reflected lower operating income partly offset by benefits from the lower tax rate.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet Items\nCash provided from operations in the first quarter of 2018 was $8.1 million. Compared with $22.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, cash flow declined primarily due to improved payment terms with certain vendors that began in 2017, and in 2018, accelerated contributions for pension and postretirement benefit plans, a SERP payment and an increase in accounts receivable commensurate with higher sales.\nCapital spending of $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $11.5 million in the prior year, which included remaining spending on the North American filtration expansion project.\nDebt as of March 31, 2018 was $270.3 million compared to $255.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 were $6.4 million compared to $4.5 million as of December 31, 2017.\nQuarterly Segment Results\nTechnical Products record net sales of $149.0 million increased 22 percent, from $121.9 million in the prior year. Revenue growth resulted from double-digit organic increases in filtration and other categories, acquired volume, as well as a higher-priced mix and favorable currency exchange effects due to a stronger euro.\nOperating income of $17.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased $5.0 million compared with prior year income of $12.5 million. Increased income resulted from higher sales volumes, a higher-value mix, lack of downtime costs incurred in Germany in 2017, and favorable currency effects. These items more than offset higher input and distribution costs.\nFine Paper and Packaging net sales of $111.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 decreased 2 percent, from $114.3 million in the prior year. Volume declines primarily for marginal, non-branded grades, were partly offset by higher selling prices and double-digit volume increases in premium packaging.\nOperating income of $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 decreased $7.5 million from $20.3 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to higher distribution and input costs, as well as reduced operational efficiencies and lower sales volumes, partly offset by higher selling prices. Distribution costs increased significantly in the second half of 2017 as a result of a U.S. regulatory change that requires electronic logging devices to monitor miles and hours driven by freight carriers.\nUnallocated Corporate costs in the first quarter of 2018 were $6.2 million compared with $5.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was due to the SERP settlement charge in 2018.\nReconciliation to GAAP Measures\nThe Company will report adjustments to GAAP figures when they are believed to improve the comparability and understanding of results.
