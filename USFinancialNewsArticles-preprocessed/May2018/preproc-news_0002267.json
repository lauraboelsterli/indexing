See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for definitions and reconciliations.\nOperational Highlights\nDelaware Basin\nThe Boyd 28 11 1H Wolfcamp XY, our furthest south Delaware completion to date, established a peak 30-day average rate of 1,526 Boe/d or 324 Boe/d per 1,000' (71% oil) The State Rudd Draw 26-25-2H Wolfcamp XY well established a peak 30-day average rate of 2,289 Boe/d or 271 Boe/d per 1,000' (71% oil) The Ludeman 202H 2nd Bone Spring well established a peak 30-day average rate of 1,013 Boe/d or 141 Boe/d per 1,000' (73% oil) The Brunson D 3-well pad (1203H Wolfcamp A, 1201H Wolfcamp B and 1204H Third Bone Spring) is back online after being shut-in for offset operator completion activities and has achieved cumulative production of over 390 MBoe in less than 90 days\nMidland Basin\nThe Spanish Trail 4825, RSP's first horizontal Jo Mill completion, established a peak 15-day average rate of 1,048 Boe/d or 150 Boe/d per 1,000' (74% oil); this well is still cleaning up and increasing in rate The Parks Bell 3926H Wolfcamp A, another successful extension well on the west side of our acreage position, established a peak 30-day average rate of 1,440 Boe/d or 205 Boe/d per 1,000' (86% oil) The Woody 3-46 6H, our first Lower Spraberry well on the Woody lease in Glasscock County, established a peak 30-day average rate of 1,786 Boe/d or 236 Boe/d per 1,000' (86% oil)\nSteve Gray, Chief Executive Officer of RSP, commented on the results, “We had a very active quarter, picking up our third completion crew and completing 31 horizontal wells, the most wells we have completed during any quarter to date. As a result, we had a steep production ramp as we exited the first quarter and continuing into April, after experiencing a significant amount of production downtime in January and February when we shut-in a number of producing wells to accommodate elevated offset completion activity. As evidenced by our recent well highlights, we continue to see compelling well results from both our Delaware and Midland Basin positions and we are on track to deliver on our production guidance for the year.\"\nMr. Gray continued, “We are excited about our pending transaction with Concho, which creates one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin with the largest development program. I want to thank our Board, management team, employees, shareholders, vendors and all of our partners for the outstanding accomplishments we have achieved together and express my gratitude for the opportunity to lead this organization.”\nProposed Merger with Concho Resources\nAs previously announced, on March 27, 2018, RSP and Concho entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which Concho will acquire RSP in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9.5 billion, inclusive of RSP’s net debt. Stockholders of RSP will receive 0.320 shares of Concho common stock in exchange for each share of RSP's common stock, representing consideration to each stockholder of RSP of $50.24 per share based on the closing price of Concho common stock on March 27, 2018. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to the approval of both RSP and Concho stockholders, the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nIn light of the pending merger with Concho, we do not in general plan to provide or update guidance and long-term outlook information regarding our results of operations during the pendency of the merger. In addition, investors are cautioned not to rely on historical regarding guidance and long-term outlook information, which spoke only as of the date provided and were subject to the specific risks and uncertainties that accompanied such\nOperational Results\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Production data: Oil (MBbls) 4,073 3,032 Natural gas (MMcf) 4,254 2,926 NGLs (MBbls) 868 547 Total (MBoe) 5,650 4,067 Average net daily production (Boe/d) 62,778 45,189 Average prices before effects of hedges (1) (2): Oil (per Bbl) $ 61.87 $ 50.01 Natural gas (per Mcf) 1.98 2.52 NGLs (per Bbl) 18.33 19.96 Total (per Boe) $ 48.91 $ 41.78 Average realized prices after effects of hedges (1) (2): Oil (per Bbl) $ 58.50 $ 49.02 Natural gas (per Mcf) 1.98 2.59 NGLs (per Bbl) 18.33 19.96 Total (per Boe) $ 46.48 $ 41.09 Average costs (per Boe): Lease operating expenses (excluding gathering and transportation) $ 5.44 $ 5.40 Gathering and transportation (2) 0.25 0.85 Production and ad valorem taxes 2.88 2.33 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 13.47 15.01 General and administrative - recurring cash component 1.60 1.91 General and administrative - recurring stock comp (3) 0.94 0.96 (1) Average prices shown in the table reflect prices both before and after the effects of our cash payments/receipts on the Company's commodity derivative transactions. The calculation of such effects includes realized gains or losses on cash settlements for commodity derivative transactions and an adjustment to reflect premiums incurred previously or upon settlement that are attributable to instruments settled in the period, if applicable. (2) Average prices for oil are net of transportation costs. Average prices for natural gas and NGLs in the first quarter of 2018 were impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASC 606\"), which requires certain transportation, gathering, processing and compression fees paid to the Company's midstream processing entity to be recorded as a deduction to revenues. Prior to 2018, these fees were recorded as gathering and transportation which are included in lease operating expenses. (3) Represents compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and performance share awards granted as part of the Company’s compensation and retention programs. Production volumes for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 averaged 62,778 Boe/d, or a total of 5,650 MBoe, an increase of 39% over prior year’s first quarter of 45,189 Boe/d. Production for the first quarter of 2018 was comprised of 72% crude oil, 13% natural gas and 15% NGLs. RSP’s average realized oil price for the first quarter of 2018, before the effects of hedges, was $61.87 per barrel, a negative $1.00 differential compared to average NYMEX WTI pricing of $62.87 per barrel for the same period, or 98% of NYMEX WTI pricing. RSP’s average realized natural gas price for the first quarter of 2018, before the effects of hedges, was $1.98 per Mcf, a negative $1.02 differential compared to average NYMEX Henry Hub pricing of $3.00 per MMBtu for the same period, or 66% of NYMEX Henry Hub pricing. RSP’s average realized NGL price for the first quarter of 2018 was $18.33 per Bbl, or 29% of NYMEX WTI pricing for the same time period. RSP’s average realized commodity price per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2018, before the effects of hedges, was $48.91. Per unit cash operating expenses excluding interest expense but including lease operating expense, gathering and transportation expense, production and ad valorem taxes and recurring cash general and administrative expenses were $10.17 per Boe.\nOperational Update\nThe Company operated seven horizontal rigs and three full-time completion crews during the first quarter of 2018 (third crew added in late January). RSP drilled 22 gross operated horizontal wells and completed 31 gross operated horizontal wells (Midland: seven Lower Spraberry, seven Wolfcamp A, five Wolfcamp B, one Middle Spraberry; Delaware: five Wolfcamp A, four Wolfcamp XY, one Second Bone Spring and one Third Bone Spring). The Company began the quarter with 36 gross operated horizontal drilled but uncompleted wells (\"DUCs\") and exited the quarter with a total of 27 operated horizontal DUCs.\nFinancial Results\nThree Months Ended (in thousands, except per share data) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Total Revenues $ 276,322 $ 249,023 $ 169,931 Net Cash from Derivative Instruments (13,717 ) (8,566 ) (2,812 ) Adjusted Total Revenues 262,605 240,457 167,119 Net Income $ 89,573 $ 140,786 $ 38,934 Net Earnings per Common Share - Diluted 0.57 0.89 0.26 Adjusted Net Income (1) $ 79,033 $ 50,122 $ 24,212 Adjusted Net Earnings per Common Share - Diluted 0.50 0.32 0.16 Adjusted EBITDAX (1) $ 205,202 $ 182,425 $ 124,451 (1) Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income are non-GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted Net Income deducts from Adjusted EBITDAX depreciation, depletion, and amortization, accretion on asset retirement obligations, exploration expenses, interest expense, stock-based compensation, merger and acquisition costs and adjusted income tax expense.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income are useful because they allow the Company to more effectively evaluate its operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to financing methods or capital structure. The Company excludes the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the Company's industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance, such as Company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company's computations of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following tables include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income to the GAAP financial measure of net income.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDAX\nThree Months Ended (in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Net income $ 89,573 $ 140,786 $ 38,934 Interest expense 22,503 22,174 19,224 Income tax expense (benefit) 21,932 (153,450 ) 15,072 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 76,122 77,159 61,040 Asset retirement obligation accretion 205 151 153 Exploration expenses 246 825 2,580 Merger and acquisition costs 2,757 42 4,052 Impairments of oil and natural gas properties 4,200 52,935 125 (Gain) loss on derivative instruments (2,907 ) 46,968 (17,121 ) Net settled derivative instruments (13,717 ) (8,566 ) (2,812 ) Stock-based compensation 5,327 4,422 3,924 Other income, net (1,039 ) (1,021 ) (720 ) Adjusted EBITDAX $ 205,202 $ 182,425 $ 124,451 Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income\nThree Months Ended (in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Net income $ 89,573 $ 140,786 $ 38,934 Merger and acquisition costs 2,757 42 4,052 Impairments of oil and natural gas properties 4,200 52,935 125 (Gain) loss on derivative instruments (2,907 ) 46,968 (17,121 ) Net settled derivative instruments (13,717 ) (8,566 ) (2,812 ) Other income, net (1,039 ) (1,021 ) (720 ) Adjustment to income taxes for above items 166 (181,022 ) 1,754 Adjusted Net Income $ 79,033 $ 50,122 $ 24,212 Conference Call\nRSP will host a conference call for investors at 10:00 AM Central Time on Thursday, May 3, 2018, to discuss first quarter 2018 results.
