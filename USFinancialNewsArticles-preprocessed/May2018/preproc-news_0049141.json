    "text": "MIAMI, May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"SBS\") (OTCQX: SBSAA) today reported preliminary estimated financial results for the first quarter-ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nFor the first quarter 2018, the Company currently estimates consolidated Net Revenue to be between approximately $32.9 and $33.9 million, an increase of between 5% and 8% over 2017 and Adjusted OIBDA*, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation, to be between approximately $8.5 and $9.3 million, an increase of between 44% and 58% over 2017. Consolidated Operating Income is currently estimated to be between approximately $6.5 and $7.6 million, representing a growth rate of between 71% and 100% over 2017.\nDiscussion and Results\n\"Although extraordinary, unforeseen and non-recurring factors affected our Year End results for 2017, I am happy to report that our Q1 2018 results are the best in the Company's history. We are focused on growing our top line while maintaining strictly disciplined cost controls and delivering operating margins that are among the best in the industry.\nOur experience in addressing the needs of the growing Hispanic market, combined with our stable of heritage brands, will serve us well in identifying growth opportunities throughout 2018 and beyond,\" commented Raúl Alarcón, Chairman and CEO.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss) before Depreciation and Amortization, (Gain) Loss on the Disposal of Assets, net, and Impairment Charges and Restructuring Costs excluding non-cash stock-based compensation (\"Adjusted OIBDA\") is not a measure of performance or liquidity determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States. However, we believe that this measure is useful in evaluating our performance because it reflects a measure of performance for our stations before considering costs and expenses related to our capital structure and dispositions. This measure is widely used in the broadcast industry to evaluate a company's operating performance and is used by us for internal budgeting purposes and to evaluate the performance of our stations, segments, management and consolidated operations. However, this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Operating Income, Net Income, Cash Flows from Operating Activities or any other measure used in determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted OIBDA does not present station operating income as defined by our 12.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2017. In addition, because Adjusted OIBDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nIncluded below are tables that reconcile Adjusted OIBDA to operating income (loss) for each segment and consolidated operating income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018\n(Unaudited and in millions)\nConsolidated\nLow Range\nConsolidated\nHigh Range\nNet Revenue\n$\n32.9\n$\n33.9\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n8.5\n$\n9.3\nLess expenses excluded from Adjusted\nOIBDA, but included in operating income\n(loss):\nStock-based compensation\n$\n—\n$\n—\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n1.0\n$\n1.0\n(Gain) loss on the disposal of assets, net\n$\n—\n$\n—\nRecapitalization costs\n$\n1.0\n$\n0.7\nOperating Income (Loss)\n$\n6.5\n$\n7.6\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2017\n(Unaudited and in millions)\nConsolidated\nNet Revenue\n$\n31.4\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n5.9\nLess expenses excluded from Adjusted OIBDA, but\nincluded in operating income (loss):\nStock-based compensation\n$\n0.1\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n1.2\n(Gain) loss on the disposal of assets, net\n$\n—\nRecapitalization costs\n$\n0.8\nOperating Income (Loss)\n$\n3.8\nThe financial information summarized above has been presented as a range of estimates because it is preliminary and does not reflect the final, or definitive, financial statements of the Company for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2018. This preliminary estimated financial information has been prepared solely on the basis of information that is currently available to management. As a result, it is subject to change based on the completion of the Company's financial closing procedures, which includes final adjustments, completion of the Company's internal review and the review by its independent registered public accounting firm of its financial statements, among other things. The Company's final financial statements for this period may contain material changes from the financial information summarized above (including by any one financial result, or all of the financial results, being below or above the range indicated) and also what one might expect to be in the final financial statements based on the financial information summarized above. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm has not audited or reviewed, and does not express an opinion with respect to, this preliminary estimated financial information.\nAbout Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc.\nSpanish Broadcasting System, Inc. owns and operates 17 radio stations located in the top U.S. Hispanic markets of New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, San Francisco and Puerto Rico, airing the Spanish Tropical, Regional Mexican, Spanish Adult Contemporary, Top 40 and Latin Rhythmic format genres.
