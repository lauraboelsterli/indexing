    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rennova Health, Inc. (OTCQB: RNVA), (OTCQB: RNVAW) (“Rennova” or the “Company”), a vertically integrated provider of industry-leading diagnostics and supportive software solutions to healthcare providers that recently announced the acquisition of its second Rural Hospital, is pleased to announce it has confirmed June 1 st , 2018 as the expected closing date for its acquisition of an 85 bed hospital in Jamestown Tennessee.\nWhile closing is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions the Company believes these are all scheduled to complete timely. The hospital known as Tennova Healthcare - Jamestown, and its associated assets are being acquired from Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE: CYH). The transaction also includes a Jamestown based doctor’s practice and clinic.\n“We look forward to completing the acquisition of what will be our second hospital in the same geographic location at the end of this month and focusing on the successful integration with our existing business” said Seamus Lagan, Chief Executive Officer of Rennova. “We also look forward to completing the previously announced spin-offs of AMSG and our technology division in coming months. We continue to believe this will create additional value and opportunity for our shareholders and create separate public companies, each of which can focus on its own strengths and operational plans. We believe we can quickly achieve a cash-flow positive position in our new hospital division within the next few months and this combined with the spin-offs as planned should remove the need for additional capital to operate our business thereafter.”\nAbout Rennova Health, Inc.\nRennova provides industry-leading diagnostics and supportive software solutions to healthcare providers, delivering an efficient, effective patient experience and superior clinical outcomes. Through an ever-expanding group of strategic brands that work in unison to empower customers, we are creating the next generation of healthcare.
