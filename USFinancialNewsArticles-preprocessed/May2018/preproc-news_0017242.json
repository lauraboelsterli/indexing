(Nasdaq:NGHC) today reported first quarter 2018 net income of $60.3 million or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to net income of $29.0 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 operating earnings (1) was $67.6 million or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to $35.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights Versus First Quarter 2017*\nGross written premium grew $165.1 million or 14.1% to $1,337.0 million, driven by continued organic growth in our P&C segment of 12.6% and in our A&H segment of 21.8%. In the first quarter, our homeowners’ product experienced organic growth of 23.2% driven by strong results from strategic partnerships and the continued expansion in the high net worth market. Our personal auto product experienced organic growth of 12.1%. The overall combined ratio (9,13) was 90.7% compared to 94.8% in the prior year’s quarter, excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets. The P&C segment reported a decrease in combined ratio to 90.9% from 96.2% in the prior year’s quarter. The combined ratio includes $14.2 million of losses, or 2.0 P&C loss ratio points, from weather-related events from winter weather that impacted the Northeast in the first quarter 2018, compared to $8.9 million of losses, or 1.2 P&C loss ratio points, from events in the first quarter 2017. The A&H segment reported a combined ratio of 90.0% compared to 86.8% in the prior year’s quarter. Service and fee income grew 13.9% to $154.8 million, driven by organic growth in both our Accident & Health and Property & Casualty segments. Shareholders’ equity was $1.96 billion and fully diluted book value per share was $14.09 at March 31, 2018, growth of 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively, from December 31, 2017. Our trailing twelve month operating return on average equity (ROE) (14) was 9.9% as of March 31, 2018. First quarter 2018 operating earnings exclude the following material items, net of tax: $5.5 million or $0.05 per share of non-cash amortization of intangible assets and $1.2 million or $0.01 per share from equity in (earnings) losses of equity method investments. During today’s Board of Directors meeting, the Board appointed Robert Karfunkel and Barry Karfunkel to serve as Co-Chairmen of the Board. In addition, Robert Karfunkel will serve as President of the Company while Barry Karfunkel will continue his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, but no longer serve as President.\nBarry Karfunkel, National General’s CEO, stated: “This quarter we reported the strongest operating results in the history of the company and highlighted the earnings capabilities of the platform that we have built.\nI look forward to the dual leadership roles that Robert and I will have at National General as Co-Chairmen. We have worked alongside each other since the platform was acquired in 2010, though in different areas of the business. I think our diverse areas of expertise will complement each other and provide a well-rounded perspective for the Company moving forward.\nI would like to thank Barry Zyskind for his leadership as National General’s Chairman of the Board of Directors. He stepped into the position in a time of transition for the Company and his guidance was and continues to be of great importance for both myself and the entire organization.”\n*NOTE: Unless specified otherwise, discussion of our first quarter 2018 and 2017 results do not include financial results from the Reciprocal Exchanges, which are presented within our consolidated financial results within this release but are not included in net income available to NGHC common stockholders.\nOverview of First Quarter 2018 as Compared to First Quarter 2017 by Segment\nProperty & Casualty - Gross written premium grew by 12.6% to $1,103.3 million, net written premium decreased by 7.7% to $832.7 million and net earned premium decreased by 6.0% to $705.6 million.

Auto and $(524) in Homeowners Gross Written Premium in 2017, respectively.\nAdditional Disclosures\n(1) References to operating earnings and basic and diluted operating earnings per share (“EPS”) are non-GAAP financial measures defined by the Company as net income/loss and basic and diluted earnings per share excluding after-tax net gain or loss on investments (including foreign exchange gain or loss), other-than-temporary impairment losses, bargain purchase gains, earnings or losses of equity method investments (related parties), deferred tax asset impairment, non-cash impairment of goodwill and non-cash amortization of intangible assets. The Company believes operating earnings and basic and diluted operating EPS are relevant measures of the Company’s profitability because operating earnings and basic and diluted operating EPS contain the components of net income upon which the Company’s management has the most influence and excludes factors outside management’s direct control and non-recurring items. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(2) Total investments includes $241,801 and $347,548 in related parties at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\n(3) Reinsurance recoverable includes $11,399 and $15,688 from related parties at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\n(4) Other includes $1,174 and $2,334 from related parties at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\n(5) Accounts payable and accrued expenses includes $72,641 and $140,057 to related parties at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\n(6) Common stock: $0.01 par value - authorized 150,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 106,887,566 shares - March 31, 2018; authorized 150,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 106,697,648 shares - December 31, 2017.\n(7) Preferred stock: $0.01 par value - authorized 10,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 2,565,000 shares - March 31, 2018; authorized 10,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 2,565,000 shares - December 31, 2017.\n(8) Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is calculated by dividing loss and loss adjustment expense by net earned premium.\n(9) Operating expense ratio and combined ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because a component of those ratios, operating expense, is calculated by offsetting acquisition and other underwriting costs and general and administrative expenses by ceding commission income and service and fee income. Management uses operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) and combined ratio (non-GAAP) to evaluate against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. The Company believes this presentation enhances the understanding of our results by eliminating what we believe are volatile and unusual events and presenting the ratios with what we believe are the underlying run rates of the business. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(10) Operating expense ratio is a non-GAAP measure defined by the Company, that is commonly used in the insurance industry. The Company calculates the ratio by dividing operating expense by net earned premium. Operating expense consists of the sum of acquisition and other underwriting costs and general and administrative expenses less ceding commission income and service and fee income. The ratio is used as an indicator of the Company’s efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(11) Combined ratio is a non-GAAP measure defined by the Company, that is commonly used in the insurance industry. The Company calculates the ratio by adding the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) together. The ratio is used as an indicator of the Company’s underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business, and overall underwriting profit. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit, while over 100% an underwriting loss. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General.\n(12) Operating expense ratio before amortization and impairment is a non-GAAP measure defined by the Company, that is commonly used in the insurance industry. The Company calculates the ratio by dividing the operating expense before amortization and impairment by net earned premium. Operating expense before amortization and impairment consists of the sum of acquisition and other underwriting costs and general and administrative expenses less ceding commission income and service and fee income less non-cash amortization of intangible assets and non-cash impairment of goodwill. The ratio is used as an indicator of the Company’s efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(13) Combined ratio before amortization and impairment is a non-GAAP measure defined by the Company, that is commonly used in the insurance industry. The Company calculates the ratio by adding the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the operating expense ratio before amortization and impairment (non-GAAP) together. The ratio is used as an indicator of the Company’s underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business, and overall underwriting profit. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit, while over 100% an underwriting loss. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(14) Trailing twelve month operating return on average equity is the ratio of the previous twelve months operating earnings to average shareholders’ equity for the periods presented. Average shareholders’ equity is the sum of the shareholders’ equity excluding preferred stock at the beginning and end of the period presented divided by two. In the opinion of the Company’s management this ratio is an important indicator of how well management creates value for its shareholders through its operating activities and capital management. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of net income to operating earnings, which is the Non-GAAP component of the operating return on average equity.\n(15) Combined ratio excluding losses from various Q1’18 weather-related events, and is calculated by taking the combined ratio as defined in Note 13, and adjusting it to exclude the total net losses of $14.2 million from these events. The company believes this measure enhances investors’ understanding of our results by eliminating what we believe are volatile and unusual events.\nQ1’18 Combined\nRatio\nImpact of Q1’18\nWeather-related\nEvents\nQ1’18 Combined\nRatio Excluding\nWeather-related\nEvents P&C Segment 90.9% 2.0% 88.9% Overall NGHC 90.7% 1.7% 89.0% Investor Contact\nChristine Worley\nDirector of Investor Relations\nPhone: 212-380-9462\nEmail: Christine.Worley@NGIC.com\nSource:National General Holdings Corp",
