Photo: Steven Norton / The Wall Street Journal\nUnited Technologies Corp. is working to scale its digital and data analytics capabilities across the business, with employees in its Brooklyn office developing predictive maintenance applications for jet engines and smart-building tools that let workers hail an elevator using their smartphone.\nAbout 90 people work in the 67,000-square-foot primary space, located in the borough’s trendy DUMBO neighborhood. UTC expects to employ about 150 people in the digital accelerator, established in 2017 , by the end of the year, said Vince Campisi, United Technologies’ senior vice president for digital and CIO.\nUnited Technologies Senior Vice President for Digital and CIO Vince Campisi, top right, with team members in New York City, May 22, 2018.

New services may include the ability to track inventory changes in real-time, or to monitor the health of a piece of equipment while it’s in the field.\nAt the Brooklyn location, designers and engineers are developing an application that lets people call an elevator using a smartphone. They’re working to link the application to other services inside a building, such as getting in touch with a front-desk representative or seeing if a bike at a gym is available.\nA separate team working for the company’s aerospace systems group is creating a portal that makes it easier for UTC’s global network of suppliers to provide information about material availability. Jet engine-maker Pratt & Whitney is creating services that use data pulled from aircraft 50 times per second to help firms monitor engine health and manage maintenance schedules.\nThe company’s aerospace segment has taken past examples of unscheduled maintenance, run an analytics model, and found that if that model were running in real time, “we would have known 25 out of 26 times that this was coming,” Mr. Campisi said.\n“Those are proof points that tell me our predictive analytics capabilities are really starting to show up.”\nData scientists are working with information across the company, as well as external data such as weather and air quality information, to determine factors that may lead to unplanned maintenance. One analysis found that air quality correlated strongly with part degradation. Such information could lead a customer to rotate their fleets differently to reduce downtime.\nTo scale the company’s analytics efforts, Mr. Campisi says UTC needs the proper technology infrastructure as well as the “commercial architecture” to deliver real value rather than noise. “It’s really about pacing it on change management adoption, technology scalability, and do we have the operating mechanisms in place to really govern this,” he said.\nWrite to steven.norton@wsj.com\nShare this: ANALYTICS UNITED TECHNOLOGIES VINCE CAMPISI Previous The Morning Download: New Chip Flaw Related to Spectre and Meltdown Emerges",
