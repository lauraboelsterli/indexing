    "text": "(Reuters) - A Maryland man accused of a 2017 workplace shooting in his home state that left three co-workers dead was convicted on Tuesday of multiple charges in the shooting of a man in Delaware, prosecutors said.\nA New Castle County, Delaware, jury found Radee Prince, 38, guilty of attempted manslaughter, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, reckless endangering in the first degree, carrying a concealed deadly weapon, and resisting arrest, Carl Kanefsky, a Delaware Department of Justice spokesman, said in an email.\nPrince is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 31 and faces eight to 89 years in prison, Kanefsky said.\nIn January, a grand jury in Harford County, Maryland, indicted Prince on three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder, as well as firearms charges, for the October workplace attack at a kitchen countertop company near Baltimore, according to the county prosecutor’s office.\nPrince, of Elkton, Maryland, is accused of shooting to death three co-workers and wounding two others at the Edgewood, Maryland, company before fleeing in a vehicle.\nPrince was jailed in Wilmington, Delaware, for a separate shooting that occurred there hours after the deadly attack in Maryland. In Delaware, he had faced a charge of attempted first-degree murder stemming from the shooting of a man at an auto shop.\nMaryland prosecutors plan to pursue a warrant to pick up Prince and return him to Maryland so they can begin their case and send Prince back to Delaware for sentencing, Harford County State’s Attorney Joseph Cassilly said in a telephone interview.\n(Corrects title in second paragraph to ‘Delaware Department of Justice spokesman’ from ‘U.S. Department of Justice spokesman)\nReporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Editing by Matthew Lewis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
