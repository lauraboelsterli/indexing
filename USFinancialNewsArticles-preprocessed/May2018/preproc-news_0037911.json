    "text": "* US 10-yr yield holds above 3 pct after surge\n* Italian markets jolted by 5-Star, League coalition proposals\n* Wall St little changed as retail stocks gain\n* Dollar extends rally, euro weak (Updates with opening of U.S. markets; changes dateline, pvs LONDON)\nBy Lewis Krauskopf\nNEW YORK, May 16 (Reuters) - Italy’s borrowing costs jumped on Wednesday and the country’s stocks slid after reports that the two parties seeking to form Italy’s next government might seek debt forgiveness, while the U.S. dollar rallied further to a five-month high.\nInvestors were digesting Tuesday’s surge in U.S. bond yields on the heels of a retail sales report that fueled the dollar and hurt stocks.\nThe benchmark 10-year yield held well above 3 percent after bursting through key technical levels on Tuesday.\n“The combination of higher oil prices, higher dollar and stronger yields are starting to potentially weigh on investor sentiment,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management division of Northern Trust in Chicago.\n“As yields go up they start to be a little bit more competitive with risk assets and with stocks in particular.”\nWall Street’s main indexes were little changed after sliding on Tuesday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.28 points, or 0.01 percent, to 24,704.13, the S&P 500 gained 4.37 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,715.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.88 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,376.51.\nShares of U.S. retailers rose after results from department store chain Macy’s.\nIn Italy, investors seized on a report that the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League party plan to ask the European Central Bank to forgive 250 billion euros ($296 billion) of Italian debt, according to a draft the parties are working on.\nItalian stocks tumbled 2.3 percent while Italy’s 10-year bond yield jumped to 2.096 percent.\n“It’s right to resonate with markets because it tells you about the sense of the wisdom between these negotiating parties,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.\nOther major European stock markets were higher, and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.22 percent.\nMSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.03 percent.\nNorth Korea threw next month’s summit between Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump into doubt, by saying it may reconsider if Washington insists it unilaterally gives up its nuclear weapons.\n“Investors have gotten sort of used to this. Whether we are talking about North Korea or the trade discussions with China... I think investors are recognizing we are at the beginning of the beginning of this, so it’s not anything to make dramatic portfolio moves or any significant bets on,” Nixon said.\nU.S. Treasury yields were little changed with the 10-year yield hovering near a seven-year high.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 3.0871 percent, from 3.08 percent late on Tuesday.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.32 percent to 93.515 after rising to 93.632 during the session, its highest since mid December. The euro was down 0.48 percent to $1.178.\nU.S. crude fell 0.5 percent to $70.95 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.05, down 0.48 percent on the day.\nAdditional reporting by Tommy Wilkes and Dhara Ranasinghe in London, Danilo Masoni in Milan Editing by Louise Ireland and Susan Thomas\n ",
