( www.legendpower.com ) is changing the way buildings around the world use power. The company’s patented and proprietary technology reduces overvoltage, a natural condition present in power grids around the world. Overvoltage inflates energy costs, damages electrical equipment, and increases the negative impact a building has on the environment. Legend’s utility-proven Harmonizer improves the power efficiency of an entire building to reduce total energy consumption and power costs, while maximizing equipment life. The solution provides customers risk free energy savings, improves the value of their physical assets, and enhances their sustainability efforts. As an application with demand side benefits, Legend is also a key contributor toward utility conservation goals. In 2015 Legend was recognized as the top performing cleantech company on the TSX Venture Exchange.\nFor further information please contact:\nRandy Buchamer, CEO and President\n+ 1 778 945 1501\nrbuchamer@legendpower.com\nSean Peasgood, Investor Relations\n+ 1 647 503 1054\nsean@sophiccapital.com\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Press Release may contain statements which constitute “forward-looking information”, including statements regarding the plans, intentions, beliefs and current expectations of the Company, its directors, or its officers with respect to the future business activities and operating performance of the Company.
