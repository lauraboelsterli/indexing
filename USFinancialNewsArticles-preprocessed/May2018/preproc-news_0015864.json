    "text": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, L.P. (HFF) announces the sale of The Rivington, a 240-unit, luxury apartment community in Hoboken, New Jersey. This transaction represents the largest apartment sale in New Jersey in 2018.\nThe HFF team marketed the property exclusively on behalf of institutional investors advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Equity Residential purchased the property free and clear of existing debt.\nThe Rivington is situated at 1130 Grand Street in the heart of the dynamic northwest section of Hoboken, which offers commuters access into Manhattan via the Hoboken PATH Station, 14 th Street Ferry Terminal and the NJ Transit bus line. Additionally, the property has a WalkScore® of 94 and is within blocks of multiple retail amenities along Washington Street as well as the 5.4-acre Northwest Park. Completed in 1999, The Rivington features 240 two-bedroom, market-rate units housed within four six-story apartment buildings, each with one story of covered parking at ground level. A large portion of units have been renovated since 2014. Community amenities include an updated fitness center, newly renovated courtyard with lounge and grilling areas, clubhouse, private storage lockers and a Zipcar pickup/drop off station.\nThe HFF investment advisory team representing the seller included senior managing director Jose Cruz, managing director Kevin O’Hearn and senior directors Michael Oliver and Stephen Simonelli.\n“Capital continues to be attracted to multifamily assets in markets with high barriers to entry and significant future rental growth,” stated Cruz. “The Hudson Waterfront market remains a target for REITs, pension fund advisors and private buyers alike.”\nHFF and Holliday GP Corp. (\"HFF\") are licensed New Jersey real estate brokers.\nAbout J.P. Morgan Global Alternatives\nJ.P. Morgan Global Alternatives is the alternative investment arm of J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
