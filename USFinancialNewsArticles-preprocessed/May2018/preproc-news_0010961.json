    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Thursday it had carried out a series of raids in different countries concerned over anticompetitive behavior in the metal packaging sector.\nThe raids followed an investigation by the German regulator, which noted that some anticompetitive practices in the sector could have expanded to other countries in the bloc.\n“The European Commission can confirm that on 24 April 2018 its officials carried out unannounced inspections in several member states at the premises of companies active in the metal packaging sector,” the Commission, which acts as the competition watchdog in the European Union, said.\nThe Commission did not name any of the companies involved in the investigation, adding the raids did not mean the companies were guilty of anti-competitive behavior.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ",
