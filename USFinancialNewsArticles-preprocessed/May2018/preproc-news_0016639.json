    "text": "TUALATIN, Ore., May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CUI Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: CUI), (the \"Company\") today reported its unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNote: Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), utilizing the modified retrospective method. The Company also provides its results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 under old revenue rules, ASC Topic 605, following the 'Recent Business and Operational Highlights' section below as required under the modified retrospective transition method to allow easier comparison with prior results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Performance Summary: (comparisons to prior year period)\nTotal revenues were $22.0 million compared to $17.8 million; Gross profit was $6.6 million compared to $5.7 million; Gross margin was 29.9% compared to 31.9%; Consolidated net loss was $(3.3) million compared to $(3.9) million; Loss per basic share was $(0.11) compared to $(0.18) per basic share; Adjusted EBITDA was $(2.7) million compared to $(3.2) million; Cash and cash equivalents were $9.6 million and restricted cash was $0.5 million at March 31, 2018; Power and Electromechanical (P&EM) segment unaudited backlog was $26.1 million at March 31, 2018, up from $20.2 million at December 31, 2017; and, Energy segment unaudited backlog was $17.7 million at March 31, 2018, up from $12.6 million at December 31, 2017.\n\"Strong revenue and record backlog in the first quarter reflect continued execution on our strategy to leverage our industry-disrupting technologies to build demand with new customers and across new geographies,\" said William Clough, president and CEO of CUI Global. \"Our P&EM segment continues to benefit from new and expanded distributor relationships supplemented this quarter by initial ICE Technology sales. In our Energy segment, with a new, larger facility in Houston we are winning higher-dollar integration projects from leading energy providers in North America, and are advancing Energy products opportunities internationally that offer significant revenue optionality even as we await the restart of our largest Energy product contract in Italy.\n\"Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive volume and sales growth and improve the profitability of our sales mix,\" continued Mr. Clough. \"In our P&EM segment, UL certification for our ICE Switch and ICE Block products enables us to more vigorously promote this full solution to the data center market that has already demonstrated its interest with significant orders received in Q4 2017 for the ICE Switch and Q1 2018 for the ICE Block.\n\"In our Energy segment, we continue to cultivate demand for our Energy products across Europe and North America. In particular, the recent certification of our GasPT solution by Ofgem should serve to catalyze interest in the U.K. at a time when energy providers there are moving to utilize a government subsidy program to build biomethane terminals. We are progressing GasPT opportunities in North America for process control and fiscal monitoring applications, and concurrently building demand for our VE Technology as demonstrated by the receipt of recent orders with several Fortune 100 energy providers. We are also increasingly leveraging integration projects across both geographies to drive Energy product sales. These joint solutions create significant incremental value and generate higher gross margins for us. As business development activities in prior quarters convert to opportunities and orders, we are building a stronger business and ensuring our long-term success,\" concluded Mr. Clough.\nRecent Business and Operational Highlights:\nCUI Global announced that its Orbital Gas Systems North America (Orbital N.A.) subsidiary deployed its proprietary VE Technology across leading North American energy companies. Orders for VE probes and thermowells were received from several Fortune 100 energy companies. CUI Global's Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. (Orbital-UK) subsidiary received new, broader certification of its proprietary GasPT analyzer and software from the U.K. regulator, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets. Certification further opens the U.K. gas market to GasPT, and was necessary for continued implementation of the Future Billing Methodology, biomethane applications and other projects on which the solution is applicable. The Company's CUI Inc. subsidiary entered into a global distribution agreement with Master Electronics, one of the largest global distributors of electronic components to distribute and market CUI's extensive product portfolio of power, interconnect, motion, audio and thermal management technologies to the design, OEM and contract manufacturer communities. CUI Global announced that its Orbital-UK subsidiary secured contracts totaling $4.58 million to enhance fuel gas metering and compressor efficiency on the U.K.'s gas transmission network. The award is the Company's first non-biomethane project to include GasPT and VE products; The Company received UL 9540 certification for its ICE Block data center hardware. With the receipt of UL certification, ICE Block is now fully certified and saleable in the market; CUI Global announced that its Orbital N.A. subsidiary was awarded a $2.1 million integration project from a large U.S.-based energy, procurement, and construction firm for which Orbital N.A. is the sole-source integrator. The award follows the recent opening of Orbital N.A.'s new, larger production facility in Houston to service bigger opportunities with the region's largest gas operators; The Company's CUI Inc. subsidiary received an initial purchase order for 400 of its ICE Block devices and additional ICE Switches valued at approximately $2.9 million for expected delivery in the late 2018; CUI Global's Orbital N.A. subsidiary was awarded a fourth purchase order in as many months for its GasPTi device from a leading U.S.-based power and energy producer. The devices are being utilized in a process control application to optimize the efficiency and minimize maintenance on certain of the customer's gas-fired compressor turbines in the northeastern United States.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Performance Summary: (ASC Topic 605 basis)\nTotal revenues would have been $21.7 million compared to $17.8 million; Gross profit would have been $6.0 million compared to $5.7 million; Gross margin would have been 27.5% compared to 31.9%; Consolidated net loss would have been $(3.8) million compared to $(3.9) million; Loss per basic share would have been $(0.13) compared to $(0.18) per basic share.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call today, May 7, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss these results as well as recent corporate developments.

These non-GAAP financial measures do not represent funds available for management's discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net loss should not be construed as a substitute for net loss or as a better measure of liquidity than cash flow from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net loss exclude components that are significant in understanding and assessing the company's results of operations and cash flows. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net loss are not terms defined by GAAP and as a result our measure of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net loss might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net loss are used by management to evaluate, assess and benchmark the company's operational results and the company believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net loss are relevant and useful information which are often reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the Company's industry. Accordingly, the Company is disclosing this information to permit a more comprehensive analysis of its operating performance, to provide an additional measure of performance and liquidity and to provide additional information with respect to the Company's ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Adjusted Net loss eliminates the amortization expenses associated with intangible assets acquired with Orbital Gas Systems Limited and CUI-Canada, non-cash expenses associated with stock and stock options for compensation, royalties and services during the period, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.\n(in thousands)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nEBITDA:\nNet loss\n$\n(3,261)\n$\n(3,854)\nPlus: Interest expense\n114\n116\nPlus: Income tax benefit\n(302)\n(226)\nPlus: Depreciation and amortization\n730\n700\nEBITDA\n$\n(2,719)\n$\n(3,264)\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nPlus: Provision (credit) for bad debt\n$\n6\n$\n(27)\nPlus: Unrealized gain on derivative\n(84)\n(33)\nPlus: Stock issued and stock to be issued for\ncompensation, royalties and services\n66\n91\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(2,731)\n$\n(3,233)\nAdjusted net loss:\nNet loss\n$\n(3,261)\n$\n(3,854)\nPlus: Amortization expense of Orbital and CUI -\nCanada acquisition intangibles\n325\n298\nPlus: Stock issued and stock to be issued for\ncompensation, royalties and services\n66\n91\nAdjusted net loss\n$\n(2,870)\n$\n(3,465)\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cui-global-inc-reports-unaudited-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300643154.html\nSOURCE CUI Global, Inc.",
