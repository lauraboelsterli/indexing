    "text": "* Dow and S&P futures flat, Nasdaq up 0.15 pct\nBy Medha Singh\nMay 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stock market futures steadied on Friday, helped by a measured response by North Korea to President Donald Trump’s cancelling of a planned summit, while a slump in oil prices pressured energy stocks.\nNorth Korea said it was still open to talks with the United States, saying it hoped the “Trump formula” could resolve the standoff over its nuclear weapons program.\nThe three main U.S. indexes ended only slightly lower on Thursday, recovering from what market participants said was a knee-jerk reaction to the cancelling of the summit.\nEnergy stocks were weighed down by a more than 2 percent drop in oil prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were ready to ease supply curbs that have pushed prices to their highest since 2014.\nShares of Exxon Mobil dipped 1.0 percent in premarket trading, while Chevron was off 1.0 percent. The S&P energy index ended down 1.7 percent on Thursday.\nAt 7:30 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 6 points, or 0.02 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.5 points, or 0.02 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10.75 points, or 0.15 percent.\nAmong other stocks, Foot Locker jumped 14.3 percent after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Nike , for whom the footwear retailer is often seen as a leading indicator, gained 1.3 percent.\nPayPal rose 1.2 percent after the company gave an upbeat long-term forecast on its investor day.\nDesign software maker Autodesk fell 4.8 percent after the AutoCAD owner forecast second-quarter profit below expectations.\nData due at 8:30 a.m. ET is likely to show overall orders for durable goods fell 1.4 percent in April, after rising 2.6 percent in March.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on “Financial Stability and Central Bank Transparency” at a conference in Stockholm, Sweden at 09:20 a.m. ET.
