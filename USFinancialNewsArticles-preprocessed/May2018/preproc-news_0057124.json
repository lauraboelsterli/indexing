A view shows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland August 14, 2012. REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo\nThe drug, larotrectinib, is being developed for a wide variety of tumors that share a rare mutation, and analysts expect annual sales to reach $500 million to $1 billion.\nLarotrectinib will now get a speedy review for adult and pediatric patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a type of mutation called neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion.\nBayer plans to submit the European Union marketing application for the drug this year, Loxo said.
