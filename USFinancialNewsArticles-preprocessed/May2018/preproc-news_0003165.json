    "text": "CHICAGO, May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE | Nasdaq: CBOE) today reported record first quarter of 2018.\nConsolidated results for the first quarter of 2017 include Bats Global Markets (Bats) for the period March 1 through March 31, 2017. Cboe completed its acquisition of Bats on February 28, 2017.\n\"Our record results underscore the utility of our products and the strength of our diversified portfolio of exchanges, particularly in times of heightened market uncertainty, which we witnessed during the first quarter. We reported strong growth across each of our business segments and set new volume highs in our proprietary products as well as in multiple asset classes including options, futures and FX,\" said Edward T. Tilly, Cboe Global Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Additionally, we successfully completed the technology migration for CFE, our Futures exchange, we are on track to complete the C2 Options exchange technology migration in May and announced plans for an October 7, 2019 migration for Cboe Options. We plan to continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders as we focus on achieving our synergy targets and executing on our strategic initiatives.\"\n\"Our first-quarter financial results highlight the operating leverage inherent in our business model with strong top- and bottom-line growth driven by record net revenue, prudent expense management and the positive impact of tax reform,\" said Brian Schell, Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"Our business continued to generate considerable operating cash flow which enabled us to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and to reduce our leverage ratio. Taken together, our actions demonstrate our balanced approach to capital deployment and our continued focus on creating long-term value for our shareholders.\"\n(1) A full reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is included in the attached tables. See \"Non-GAAP Information\" in the accompanying financial tables.\n(2) Organic net revenue excludes the net revenue contribution resulting from the acquisition of Bats to arrive at net revenue for legacy Cboe. See \"Non-GAAP Information\" in the accompanying financial tables.\nConsolidated First Quarter Results -Table 1\nTable 1 below presents summary selected unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for the company as reported, on an adjusted basis for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and on an adjusted combined basis for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The adjusted combined results reflect the Bats acquisition and related financing transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2017.\nTable 1\n1Q17\nConsolidated First Quarter Results\n1Q18\nAdjusted\n($ in millions except per share)\n1Q18\n1Q17\nChange\nAdjusted 1\nCombined 1\nChange\nTotal Revenues Less Cost of Revenues\n$\n328.5\n$\n193.4\n70\n%\n$\n328.5\n$\n265.3\n24\n%\nTotal Operating Expenses\n$\n160.8\n$\n167.3\n(4)\n%\n$\n109.9\n$\n106.3\n3\n%\nOperating Income\n$\n167.7\n$\n26.1\n543\n%\n$\n218.6\n$\n159.0\n37\n%\nOperating Margin %\n51.1\n%\n13.5\n%\nnm\n66.5\n%\n59.9\n%\n660\nbps\nNet Income Allocated to Common Stockholders\n$\n117.3\n$\n15.1\n677\n%\n$\n155.2\n$\n105.8\n47\n%\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.04\n$\n0.16\n550\n%\n$\n1.38\n$\n0.94\n47\n%\nEBITDA\n$\n222.4\n$\n51.2\n334\n%\n$\n231.2\n$\n172.0\n34\n%\nEBITDA Margin %\n67.7\n%\n26.5\n%\nnm\n70.4\n%\n64.8\n%\n560\nbps\nTotal revenues less cost of revenues (referred to as \"net revenue\"), were $328.5 million, up 70 percent from $193.4 million in the prior-year period, driven primarily by a $131.2 million net revenue contribution from legacy Bats for the first quarter of 2018 versus a $39.2 million net revenue contribution from legacy Bats for the first quarter of 2017 and an increase in net transaction fees. Net revenue of $328.5 million was up $63.2 million, or 24 percent, compared with adjusted combined net revenue 1 of $265.3 million in the prior-year period. The increase primarily reflects higher revenue from net transaction fees 1 , primarily due to higher trading volume across each business segment. Excluding legacy Bats' net revenue contribution, the company's organic net revenue 2 was $197.3 million, up $43.1 million or 28 percent, compared to first quarter 2017. The increase was primarily a result of stronger trading volume from Cboe's VIX ® futures and proprietary index options. Operating expenses were $160.8 million versus $167.3 million in the prior-year first quarter. The decrease was driven by a $56.4 million decrease in acquisition-related expenses offset somewhat by increased amortization of acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating expenses 1 for the first quarter were $109.9 million compared with adjusted combined operating expenses of $106.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase primarily reflects higher compensation and benefits expense, primarily due to an increase in incentive-based compensation, which is aligned with the company's financial and operational performance. The operating margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 51.1 percent. The adjusted operating margin 1 was 66.5 percent, up 660 basis points compared with the adjusted combined margin 1 of 59.9 percent in the first quarter of 2017, mainly attributed to the higher revenue.\n(1) A full reconciliation of our non-GAAP and adjusted combined results to our GAAP results is included in the attached tables. See \"Non-GAAP Information\" in the accompanying financial tables.\n(2) Organic net revenue excludes the net revenue contribution resulting from the acquisition of Bats to arrive at net revenue for legacy Cboe. See \"Non-GAAP Information\" in the accompanying financial tables.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 25.9 percent. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the first quarter of 2018 was 25.8 percent¹. Diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.04. Adjusted diluted EPS 1 was $1.38, up 47 percent compared to adjusted combined diluted EPS 1 of $0.94 for 2017's first quarter.\nBusiness Segment Information:\nTable 2\nTotal Revenues Less Cost of Revenues by\nBusiness Segment\n1Q17\n(in millions)\n1Q18\n1Q17\nChange\nCombined 1\nChange\nOptions\n$\n167.1\n$\n128.9\n30\n%\n$\n135.1\n24\n%\nU.S. Equities\n79.7\n25.5\n213\n%\n72.7\n10\n%\nFutures\n42.3\n28.8\n47\n%\n28.8\n47\n%\nEuropean Equities\n24.6\n6.1\n303\n%\n17.9\n37\n%\nGlobal FX\n14.6\n4.0\n265\n%\n10.8\n35\n%\nCorporate\n0.2\n0.1\n100\n%\n—\n—\nTotal\n$\n328.5\n$\n193.4\n70\n%\n$\n265.3\n24\n%\nDiscussion of Results by Business Segment:\nOptions:\nOptions net revenue of $167.1 million was up 30% from first quarter 2017. On a combined¹ basis, options net revenue was up $32.0 million, or 24 percent, reflecting increases in net transaction fees, offset somewhat by higher royalty fees and lower regulatory fees. Net transaction fees 1 for options increased $43.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $38.6 million, or 36 percent, on a combined 1 basis, primarily driven by higher net transaction fees from index options. Total options average daily volume (ADV) increased 33 percent and the average revenue per contract (RPC) increased 7 percent for the first quarter, primarily due to a shift in the mix of trading volume towards higher RPC index options. Net transaction fees generated by Cboe's proprietary index options accounted for 84 percent of options net transaction fees and were up $36.4 million, or 49 percent, versus the first quarter of 2017. The growth resulted from a 45 percent increase in index options ADV, driven by record contracts traded in VIX and SPX options, with increases of 62 percent and 39 percent, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nU.S. Equities:\nU.S. Equities net revenue of $79.7 million was up $54.2 million due to the Bats acquisition. On a combined 1 basis, it increased $7.0 million, or 10 percent, reflecting higher market data fees and net transaction fees. Cboe's U.S. Equities business maintained its position as the second-largest market operator during the first quarter of 2018, growing its market share to 19.4 percent versus 19.2 percent in the comparable prior-year period.\n(1) A full reconciliation of our non-GAAP and combined results to our GAAP results is included in the attached tables. See \"Non-GAAP Information\" in the accompanying financial tables.\nFutures:\nFutures net revenue of $42.3 million increased $13.5 million or 47 percent, primarily due to higher transaction fees resulting from a 44 percent increase in futures ADV, primarily driven by VIX futures. Trading volume in VIX futures set a new quarterly high with ADV of 360,500 contracts, up 41 percent compared with 2017's first quarter.\nEuropean Equities:\nNet revenue for European Equities increased 303% due to the Bats acquisition. On a combined 1 basis, net revenue increased 37 percent, reflecting growth in both net transaction fees and non-transaction revenue, following the implementation of MiFID II in January. The increase also reflects a benefit from foreign currency translation. In local currency, net revenue grew 18 percent. Cboe Europe's Periodic Auctions volume set several new records during the first quarter of 2018, including a new one-day record for average daily notional value (ADNV) traded of €969.2 million on March 27, record monthly ADNV of €631.1 million in March and record quarterly ADNV of €425.9 million. For the first quarter of 2018, Cboe Europe Equities retained its position as the largest Pan-European stock exchange with 21.2 percent market share.\nGlobal FX:\nGlobal FX net revenue of $14.6 million rose 265% due to the Bats acquisition. On a combined 1 basis, net revenue increased 35 percent from $10.8 million, primarily due to higher net transaction fees compared with the first quarter of 2017. ADNV traded on the Cboe FX platform was $41.6 billion for the quarter, up 44 percent from last year's first quarter, driven by record quarterly volume. Cboe FX market share increased to 15.3 percent for the first quarter, setting a new all-time high.\n2018 Fiscal Year Financial Guidance\nThe company updated or reaffirmed its financial guidance for the 2018 fiscal year as follows:\nCapital expenditures are now expected to be in the range of $45 to $50 million, a decrease from previous guidance of $50 to $55 million. This includes the company's ongoing investments in technology, including Cboe's migration to Bats technology. Reaffirmed that the effective tax rate¹ on adjusted earnings for the full year is expected to be in the range of 26.5 to 28.5 percent. However, the company noted that it expects the tax rate to be slightly above the high end of the guidance range for the second quarter of 2018 and at the higher end, but within the guidance range, for the third and fourth quarters. Significant changes in trading volume, expenses, federal, state and local tax laws or rates and other items could materially impact this expectation. Reaffirmed that adjusted operating expenses are expected to be in a range of $420 to $428 million. The guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets of $157 million, which the company plans to include in its non-GAAP reconciliation.¹ Reaffirmed that depreciation and amortization expense, which is included in adjusted operating expenses above, is expected to be in the range of $53 to $58 million, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets of $157 million.\n(1) Specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the company's adjusted operating expenses guidance and adjusted effective tax rate guidance are not available. The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures, primarily related to acquisition-related expenses that would be required to reconcile to GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate, which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. The company believes that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the range of the company's adjusted operating expenses and adjusted effective tax rate would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified above.\nUpdated Run-Rate Expense Synergy Target\nThe company now expects to achieve $85 million of annualized run-rate expense synergies related to the Bats acquisition by the end of 2020, up $20 million from $65 million and a year ahead of initial projections.\nCapital Management\nThe company paid cash dividends of $30.6 million, or $0.27 per share, during the first quarter of 2018 and utilized $43.6 million to repurchase 387,142 shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program at an average price of $112.52 per share. As of March 31, 2018, the company had approximately $203 million of availability remaining under its existing share repurchase authorizations.\nAt March 31, 2018, the company had net cash and financial investments of $166.3 million, which excludes $64 million of cash collected for Section 31 fees. Long-term debt as of March 31, 2018 was $1.21 billion and reflects a payment of $25 million made during the first quarter towards the company's term loan.\nEarnings Conference Call\nExecutives of Cboe Global Markets will host a conference call to review its first-quarter financial results today, May 4, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. CT.

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction fees, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, organic net revenue, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted tax rate, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release also include combined company financial measures that are discussed in further detail below under the sub-section \"Combined Reconciliations.\"\nManagement believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release, including adjusted net revenue, organic net revenue and adjusted operating expenses, provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.\nOrganic net revenue: Is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisition of Bats. Management believes the organic net revenue growth measure provides users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing revenue performance and trends by presenting revenue growth excluding the impact of the Bats acquisition.\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses, the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore, we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.\nAcquisition-related expenses: From time to time, we have pursued small bolt-on acquisitions and in 2017 completed a larger transformative acquisition, which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly, we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.\nOther significant items: We have excluded certain other charges that are the result of other non-comparable events to measure operating performance. For 2017, other significant items primarily included interest and other borrowing costs incurred prior to the close of the Bats transaction and accelerated stock-based compensation that was incurred due to a change in the vesting schedule for equity award grants.\nThe tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.\nOrganic Net Revenue Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended\nTable 3\nMarch 31,\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\nReconciliation of Revenue Less Cost of Revenue to Organic Net Revenue\nRevenue less cost of revenue (net revenue)\n$\n328.5\n$\n193.4\nRecent acquisitions:\nBats revenue less cost of revenue\n(131.2)\n(39.2)\nOrganic net revenue\n$\n197.3\n$\n154.2\nReconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Information\nThree Months Ended\nTable 4\nMarch 31,\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n2018\n2017\nReconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP (As shown on Table 1)\nNet income allocated to common stockholders\n$\n117.3\n$\n15.1\nNon-GAAP adjustments\nCompensation and benefits (1)\n—\n9.1\nAcquisition-related expenses (2)\n8.8\n65.2\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets (3)\n42.1\n14.4\nChange in contingent consideration\n—\n0.2\nChange in redemption value of noncontrolling interests\n0.3\n0.3\nInterest and other borrowing costs (4)\n—\n4.3\nTotal Non-GAAP adjustments\n51.2\n93.5\nIncome tax expense related to the items above\n(13.0)\n(36.0)\nNet income allocated to participating securities - effect on reconciling items\n(0.3)\n(0.4)\nAdjusted net income allocated to common stockholders\n$\n155.2\n$\n72.2\nReconciliation of Diluted EPS to Non-GAAP\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n1.04\n$\n0.16\nPer share impact of non-GAAP adjustments noted above\n0.34\n0.62\nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share\n$\n1.38\n$\n0.78\nReconciliation of Operating Margin to Non-GAAP\nRevenue less cost of revenue\n$\n328.5\n$\n193.4\nNon-GAAP adjustments noted above\n—\n—\nAdjusted revenue less cost of revenue\n$\n328.5\n$\n193.4\nOperating expenses\n$\n160.8\n$\n167.3\nNon-GAAP adjustments noted above\n50.9\n88.9\nAdjusted operating expenses\n$\n109.9\n$\n78.4\nOperating income\n$\n167.7\n$\n26.1\nNon-GAAP adjustments noted above\n50.9\n88.9\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n218.6\n$\n115.0\nAdjusted operating margin (5)\n66.5\n%\n59.5\n%\nReconciliation of Income Tax Rate to Non-GAAP\nIncome before income taxes\n159.4\n18.3\nNon-GAAP adjustments noted above\n51.2\n93.5\nAdjusted income before income taxes\n$\n210.6\n$\n111.8\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n41.3\n3.1\nNon-GAAP adjustments noted above\n13.0\n36.0\nAdjusted income tax (benefit) expense\n$\n54.3\n$\n39.1\nAdjusted income tax rate\n25.8\n%\n35.0\n%\n(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2017, this amount includes $9.1 million for accelerated stock-based compensation expense.\n(2) This amount includes professional fees and outside services, severance, and other costs related to the company's acquisition of Bats.\n(3) This amount represents the amortization of acquired intangible assets for Bats.\n(4) This amount represents interest and other borrowing costs incurred prior to the close of the Bats acquisition.\n(5) Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue less cost of revenue.\nEBITDA Reconciliations\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a widely used non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income, as an indicator of the company's operating performance, or for cash flow, as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition, because EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by net revenue.\nTable 5\nThree Months Ended\n(in millions)\nMarch 31,\nReconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Per Table 1)\n2018\n2017\nNet income allocated to common stockholders\n$\n117.3\n$\n15.1\nInterest\n9.6\n7.9\nIncome tax provision\n41.3\n3.1\nDepreciation and amortization\n54.2\n25.1\nEBITDA\n$\n222.4\n$\n51.2\nEBITDA Margin ¹\n67.7\n%\n26.5\n%\nNon-GAAP adjustments not included in above line items\nCompensation and benefits (accelerated stock-based compensation)\n—\n9.1\nAcquisition-related expenses\n8.8\n65.2\nProvision for uncollectable convertible notes receivable\n—\n—\nLess: Legal settlement\n—\n—\nLess: Gain on settlement of contingent consideration\n—\n—\nOther\n—\n0.2\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n231.2\n$\n125.7\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin ¹\n70.4\n%\n65.0\n%\nThree Months Ended\n(in millions)\nMarch 31,\nReconciliation of Combined Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Per Table 1)\n2018 2\n2017\nCombined revenues less cost of revenues\n$\n265.3\nCombined net income allocated to common stockholders\n$\n73.0\nInterest\n12.0\nIncome tax provision\n22.0\nDepreciation and amortization\n55.3\nCombined EBITDA\n$\n162.3\nCombined EBITDA Margin ¹\n61.2\n%\nNon-GAAP adjustments not included in above line items\nCompensation and benefits (accelerated stock-based compensation)\n9.1\nAcquisition-related expenses\n—\nProvision for uncollectable convertible notes receivable\n—\nLess: Legal settlement\n—\nLess: Gain on settlement of contingent consideration\n—\nOther\n0.6\nAdjusted Combined EBITDA\n$\n172.0\nAdjusted Combined EBITDA Margin ¹\n64.8\n%\n¹EBITDA margin represents the respective EBITDA divided by the respective net revenue as shown in the non-GAAP reconciliations provided.\n2 Combined results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are the same as the financial results reported as the company was operating as a combined entity for the entire quarter.\nCombined Reconciliations\nThe non-GAAP unaudited combined financial measures have been prepared by recording combined adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of Cboe Global Markets. The combined financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2017 have been prepared as if the Bats acquisition closed on January 1, 2017.\nDue to the transformative nature of the Bats acquisition, the company believes that providing a discussion of its results and operations on a non-GAAP combined basis provides management and investors an additional perspective on the company's financial and operational performance and trends. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.\nThese combined financial measures are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have occurred had the transactions been effected on the assumed dates. Additionally, future results may vary significantly from the results reflected in the combined financial measures.\nThe tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP.
