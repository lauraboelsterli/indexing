    "text": "May 28, 2018 / 8:49 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Boston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving underwent surgery for deviated septum Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nBoston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving wasn’t inside TD Garden for the team’s Game 7 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday, but had a valid reason for his absence. Mar 8, 2018; Minneapolis, MN, USA; Minnesota Timberwolves guard Andrew Wiggins (22) dribbles in the third quarter against Boston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving (11) at Target Center. Mandatory Credit: Brad Rempel-USA TODAY Sports\nIrving underwent nasal surgery a few days earlier to repair a deviated septum.\nCeltics president Danny Ainge told reporters Irving didn’t want to be seen after the surgery.\nIrving has broken his nose multiple times, including earlier this season. He also suffered a deviated septum in one of the previous times he broke his nose.\nThe septum is the thin wall that separates the right and left nasal passages. A deviation is when one of the sides is displaced and decreases the size of one of the passages, reducing airflow and making it difficult to breathe.\nIrving missed the postseason after undergoing surgery on his left knee late in April. He had been ruled out of the postseason prior to the surgery.\nIrving underwent an earlier knee surgery in March to have a tension wire removed from the kneecap.\nIrving averaged 24.4 points, 5.1 assists and 3.8 rebounds in 60 games in his first season in Boston.\nBoston’s season ended with Sunday’s 87-79 loss to the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference finals.\n—Field Level Media",
