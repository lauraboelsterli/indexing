    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Tuesday said building a next generation 5G mobile network was a priority for the Trump administration, boosting the argument behind wireless carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc’s proposed deal.\n“I think the pitch that Sprint and T-Mobile are making is an interesting one, that their merger would propel Verizon and AT&T into more active pursuit of 5G,” Ross told CNBC.\n“Whoever pursues it, whoever does it, we’re very much in support of 5G. We need it. We need it for defense purposes, we need it for commercial purposes,” he added. (Reporting by Makini Brice and David Lawder Editing by Susan Heavey and Chizu Nomiyama)\n ",
