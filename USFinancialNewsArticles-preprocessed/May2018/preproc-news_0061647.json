    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey will tighten fiscal policy as it recently did with monetary policy, Finance Minister Naci Agbal said on Thursday, adding that it is important that the two policies are in harmony.\nFILE PHOTO: Turkish Finance Minister Naci Agbal is pictured in Ankara, Turkey, May 30, 2016. REUTERS/Umit Bektas/File Photo Turkey’s central bank hiked interest rates by 3 percentage points last week, following a deep sell-off in the lira.\nAgbal made the comments in an interview with private broadcaster Bloomberg HT. He also said debt restructuring and construction amnesty measures introduced earlier this year will generate a 40-45 billion lira ($9-$10 billion) income, preventing upward risks to Turkey’s budget deficit.\nReporting by Birsen Altayli; Writing by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
