    "text": "TOKYO, May 25 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices were steady to slightly firmer on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump called off a key summit with North Korea, though trading was limited with few investors eager to buy at current levels.\nTrump warned that the U.S. military was ready in the event of any reckless acts by North Korea, but Pyongyang’s measured response soothed nervers.\nTen-year JGB futures rose 0.08 point to 150.91, with a trading volume of 25,845 lots, while the 10-year JGB yield was flat at 0.040 percent.\nThe five-year JGB yield was flat at minus 0.115 percent.\nThe 30-year JGB yield fell 0.5 basis point to 0.740 percent, and the 40-year yield dropped 0.5 basis point to 0.880 percent.
