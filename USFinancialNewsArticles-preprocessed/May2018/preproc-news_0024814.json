This increase was mainly explained by an up selling of value added services combined with price modifications. Total Cable TV subscribers totaled almost 3.5 million, while the Cable TV ARPU amounted to P$636.5 during 1Q18, rising +37.4% vs. 1Q17. Moreover, average monthly churn during 1Q18 remained at 1.3%.\nDuring the first months of the year, Cablevisión continued to add exclusive content to its on-demand content grid. Among the most outstanding are: series and documentaries by BBC Worldwide; the 'Parecido' web series, through an agreement with UN3TV; and 'The Handmaid's Tale' entire series at the premiere of the first episode. On the other hand, the Cosquín Rock festival was broadcasted exclusively during the two days.\nIn addition, Cablevisión Flow, the innovative product that evolved the way of watching television and updated our offer in pay TV business, made the first platform upgrade in March, for both versions of the product (Box and App).

Cablevisión Flow subscribers in its Box version amounted to almost 0.8 million as of 1Q18, while Flow App subscribers totaled almost 0.3 million.\nFixed Telephony and Data Services\nDuring 1Q18, revenues generated by fixed telephony and data services amounted to P$3.625 million in 1Q18, +26.2% vs. 1Q17. The increase in fixed telephony services was mainly explained by monthly fee price increases that came into effect for both corporate and residential fixed line customers, and additionally due to the bundled offer of packs that include voice and internet services ('Arnet + Voz'), that aim to achieve higher levels of customer loyalty and churn reduction.\nAs a result, the average monthly revenue billed per user (\"ARBU\") amounted to P$198.4 in 1Q18, +47.9% vs. 1Q17.\nMeanwhile, Data revenues increase (services mainly offered to Corporate customers, SMEs, Government and to other operators) was mainly driven by FX rate variations that affected those contracts that were adjusted by the $/U$S exchange rate and due to the increase in the number of clients, generated in a context that evidence the growing position of Telecom as an integrated ICT provider.\nAdditionally, as part of the actions of the corporate business, the Company was present at the 12th edition of Expoagro, presenting innovative solutions for the agricultural sector and offering fixed and mobile connectivity for exhibitors and visitors.

Moreover, the average monthly churn rate for the period was around 1.5% for each product. On the other hand, clients with service of 20Mb or higher currently represent 25% of the total customer base as of 1Q18.\nFor fixed connectivity and content services, a suitable commercial offer was presented in March 2018, accompanied by a comprehensive campaign that included a 35% discount for 12 months in Cablevisión Flow + Fibertel with 100 megabytes of speed.\nConsolidated Operating Costs\nConsolidated Operating Costs totaled P$23,572 million in 1Q18, an increase of P$3,943 million, or +20.1% vs. 1Q17 (including D&A and impairment of PP&E). Continuing with the trend observed during the lasts quarters, this overall increase is below inflation levels and moreover Revenue growth, which allowed a significant increase in the Company's Operating Income before D&A and to improve its margin. This was a result of a higher level of efficiency in the cost structure. Higher costs are mainly associated to the effect of higher revenues, a highly competitive environment in the mobile and Internet businesses, the impact of higher direct and indirect labor costs generated by the operations in Argentina, the increase in costs of services contracted with our suppliers, higher programming and content costs due to cost from the incorporation of broadcasting signals of football matches.\nThe cost breakdown is as follows:\n- Employee benefit expenses and severance payments totaled P$5,217 million (+21.6% vs. 1Q17), mainly impacted by increases in salaries to unionized and non‐unionized employees together with the associated social security contributions. Finally, total employees at the end of 1Q18 amounted to 26,768 (vs. 27.155 in 1Q17).\n- Interconnection and transmission costs (including TLRD, Roaming, Interconnection, international settlement charges and lease of circuits) amounted to P$931 million, -0.2% vs. 1Q17. This decrease is mostly due to lower transmission costs in the international bandwidth, offset by higher TLRD costs.\n- Fees for services, maintenance, materials and supplies amounted to P$2,881 million (+18.2% vs. 1Q17), mainly due to greater fees for services, mostly related to call centers and to higher fees driven mostly by new Company projects and services linked to operational management in general. There were also higher technical maintenance costs and higher hardware and software maintenance costs due to the increase in prices and the higher level of activity.\n- Taxes and fees with regulatory authorities amounted to P$2,469 million (+27.1% vs. 1Q17), impact that was predominantly associated to the increase in revenues.\n- Commissions and advertising (Commissions paid to agents, prepaid card commissions and others) totaled P$1,709 million (+7.9% vs. 1Q17). The increase is mostly due to collections fees and higher advertising charges, offset by a decrease in CPP commissions and total commissions paid to commercial channels.\n- Cost of handsets sold totaled P$1,525 million (+23.3% vs. 1Q17), this increase was for the most part a consequence of higher costs per unit due to the rise in participation of high-end devices.\n- Programming and content costs totaled P$2,145 million (+44.0% vs. 1Q17), largely due to the incorporation of the cost of signals to broadcast live football matches of the first division of the Argentine Football Association.\n- Depreciation, amortization and impairment of PP&E amounted P$4,667 million (+17.1% vs. 1Q17). Depreciations of PP&E totaled P$3,676 million, amortizations of intangible assets amounted to P$935 million, while the losses of PP&E amounted to P$19 million and the impairment of PP&E P$37 million. The higher charge is mostly due to a greater amortization and depreciation of PP&E and intangibles, corresponding to higher values allocated to the aforementioned assets resulting from the acquisition method under IFRS 3.\n- Other Costs totaled P$2,028 million (+17.3% vs. 1Q17), of which bad debt expenses amounted to P$613 million (+28.8% vs. 1Q17), and whose increase is mainly due to the impact generated by the application as of the FY2018 of IFRS 9, partially offset by greater efficiency in the delinquency management, as well as other operating costs that totaled P$1,415 million, increasing by 12.9% vs. 1Q17.\nNet Financial Results\nThe Net Financial Results (including Financial Costs on Debt and Other Financial Results, net) showed a loss of P$2,306 million, compared with a loss of P$18 million in 1Q17. The result was mainly due to FX losses net of NDF of P$1,800 million (compared with a gain of P$555 million in 1Q17), mostly due to the depreciation of the peso during the 1Q18, followed by net interest losses of P$345 million (representing a greater loss of P$90 million vs. 1Q17), which are partially offset by gains on investments of P$192 million (that generated greater earnings of P$189 million vs. 1Q17).\nConsolidated Net Financial Debt\nAs of March 31, 2018, net financial debt position (cash, cash equivalents plus financial investments and financial NDF minus loans) totaled P$32,181 million, increasing when compared to the onsolidated net financial debt position as of December 31, 2017 (calculated as the sum of consolidated net financial debt positions of Telecom Argentina and Cablevisión, which was P$9,580 million).\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring 1Q18, the Company invested P$6,050 million, increasing approximately 18.5% from the sum of the parts of Telecom Argentina's and Cablevisión's CAPEX as of 1Q17, focusing on projects that maximize the network capacity and on the development of products and services that contribute to address the customers needs that today demand for connectivity and data availability. Likewise, significant investments have been made in the charging, billing and relationship systems with customers. In relative terms, Capex amounted to 19.7% of consolidated revenues.\nMoreover, the quantity of Homes Passed through the network amounted to 9.7 million as of 1Q18.\nIn terms of infrastructure, the deployment of the 4G/LTE network continued throughout the country, reaching more than 1,225 cities, including all the capital cities of the provinces, reaching 10.5 million customers with 4G devices. In addition, through sustained investments, the Company continues to expand its service offerings in the interior of the country, in order to integrate several places into the national digitalization plan.
