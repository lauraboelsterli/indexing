    "text": "IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quality Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: QSII), known to its clients as NextGen Healthcare, announced today its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and year end March 31, 2018 operating results.\n\"We closed fiscal 2018 with a strong quarter delivering at or above the commitments we made to our investors. We’re seeing great growth in our RCM pipeline, as well as continuing success with our NextGen Population Health Analytics Suite and NextGen Mobile Platform, formerly Eagle Dream and Entrada. We executed on our commitment to drive bookings growth in the back half of the fiscal year, with 9% actual and 5.5% pro forma year over year growth in the fourth quarter,\" commented Rusty Frantz, president and chief executive officer of NextGen Healthcare.\nMr. Frantz continued, “The successes we’ve seen over the course of fiscal 2018, particularly the sales performance during the fourth quarter, maintains our confidence in our long-term targets.”\nFiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Highlights\nNotable for the results in the fourth quarter, subsequent to the quarter-end, was an agreement-in-principle to settle the Federal Securities Class action litigation. As a result, we recorded a charge of $19 million, which is included in our quarterly GAAP results.\nRevenues for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter of $135.8 million compared to $132.4 million a year-ago.

Non-GAAP net income for the 2018 fourth quarter was $10.4 million compared with non-GAAP net income of $12.7 million in the 2017 fourth quarter.\nOn a GAAP basis, fully diluted loss per share was $0.17 in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter compared with earnings per share of $0.07 for the same period a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, fully diluted earnings per share for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter was $0.16 versus $0.21 reported in the fourth quarter a year ago.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, revenues reached $531.0 million, compared with $509.6 million for the 2017 fiscal year. GAAP net income for fiscal 2018 was $2.4 million, versus $18.2 million reported in fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2018 was $44.5 million compared to non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2017 of $50.8 million.\nOn a GAAP basis, fully diluted earnings per share for the 2018 fiscal year was $0.04, compared with $0.29 reported in the 2017 fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, fully diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2018 was $0.70 versus $0.82 reported in the prior year.\nFiscal 2019 Financial Outlook\nThe company is providing initial outlook for fiscal 2019 and expects:\nRevenue of between $532 million and $548 million Non-GAAP EPS of between $0.70 and $0.78\nConference Call Information\nNextGen Healthcare will host a conference call to discuss its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and year-end results on Thursday, May 24, 2018 at 5:00 PM ET (2:00 PM PT).

Risks and uncertainties exist that may cause the results to differ materially from those set forth in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause the anticipated results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements and additional risks and uncertainties are set forth in Part I, Item A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, including but not limited to: the volume and timing of systems sales and installations; length of sales cycles and the installation process; the possibility that products will not achieve or sustain market acceptance; seasonal patterns of sales and customer buying behavior; impact of incentive payments under The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on sales and the ability of the Company to meet continued certification requirements; uncertainties related to the future impact of U.S. tax reform; the impact of governmental and regulatory agency investigations; the development by competitors of new or superior technologies; the timing, cost and success or failure of new product and service introductions, development and product upgrade releases; undetected errors or bugs in software; product liability; changing economic, political or regulatory influences in the health-care industry; changes in product-pricing policies; availability of third-party products and components; competitive pressures including product offerings, pricing and promotional activities; the Company's ability or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; possible regulation of the Company's software by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; changes of accounting estimates and assumptions used to prepare the prior periods' financial statements; disruptions caused by acquisitions of companies, products, or technologies; and general economic conditions. A significant portion of the Company's quarterly sales of software product licenses and computer hardware is concluded in the last month of a fiscal quarter, generally with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business days of that month. Due to these and other factors, the Company's revenues and operating results are very difficult to forecast. A major portion of the Company's costs and expenses, such as personnel and facilities, are of a fixed nature and, accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual revenues typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a result, comparison of the Company's period-to-period financial performance is not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis news release contains certain non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures, which are provided only as supplemental information. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for U.S. GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure in the accompanying financial tables. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than Quality Systems, which limits comparability between companies. The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share provides useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding the Company's financial condition and results. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company calculates non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by excluding net acquisition costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, restructuring costs, net securities litigation defense costs and settlement, share-based compensation, and other non-run-rate expenses from GAAP income before provision for income taxes. The Company utilizes a normalized non-GAAP tax rate to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods within a given fiscal year by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items, which can vary in size and frequency, and which are not necessarily reflective of the Company’s longer-term operations.\nThe normalized non-GAAP tax rate applied to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 is 30.5%. The determination of this rate is based on the consideration of both historic and projected financial results. The Company has not adjusted its non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2018 following the enactment of the new tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The Company may adjust its non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2019 as additional information becomes available and further analysis is completed based on the expected long-term impact of the tax reform legislation in conjunction with any other significant events occur that may materially affect this rate, such as merger and acquisition activity, changes in business outlook, or other changes in expectations regarding tax regulations.\nThe Company’s future period guidance in this release includes adjustments for items not indicative of the Company’s core operations. Such adjustments are generally expected to be of a nature similar to those adjustments applied to the Company’s historic GAAP financial results in the determination of the Company’s non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Such adjustments, however, may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments as to the items that are excluded in the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, as described in this release. The exact amount and probable significance of these adjustments, including net acquisition costs, net securities litigation defense costs and settlement, and other non-run-rate expenses, are not currently determinable without unreasonable efforts, but may be significant. These items cannot be reliably quantified or forecasted due to the combination of their historic and expected variability. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile this non-GAAP guidance to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nQUALITY SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (In thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, Year Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Revenues: Software license and hardware $ 15,378 $ 16,581 $ 55,576 $ 65,547 Software related subscription services 25,963 23,139 99,547 87,050 Total software, hardware and related 41,341 39,720 155,123 152,597 Support and maintenance 40,634 41,898 163,805 158,803 Revenue cycle management and related services 19,669 20,515 83,996 82,552 Electronic data interchange and data services 23,327 23,424 92,773 88,951 Professional services 10,804 6,828 35,322 26,721 Total revenues 135,775 132,385 531,019 509,624 Cost of revenue: Software license and hardware 5,720 5,427 21,667 24,654 Software related subscription services 11,673 9,637 44,495 36,744 Total software, hardware and related 17,393 15,064 66,162 61,398 Support and maintenance 7,349 7,414 29,932 28,317 Revenue cycle management and related services 15,290 14,318 60,905 56,370 Electronic data interchange and data services 13,702 12,870 54,015 51,102 Professional services 8,243 6,304 30,521 25,947 Total cost of revenue 61,977 55,970 241,535 223,134 Gross profit 73,798 76,415 289,484 286,490 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 65,709 42,710 193,226 163,623 Research and development costs, net 21,098 22,111 81,259 78,341 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 1,795 2,546 7,810 10,435 Impairment of other assets 3,757 — 3,757 — Restructuring costs 481 2,393 611 7,078 Total operating expenses 92,840 69,760 286,663 259,477 Income (loss) from operations (19,042 ) 6,655 2,821 27,013 Interest income 19 5 55 14 Interest expense (1,073 ) (711 ) (3,323 ) (3,156 ) Other income (expense), net 85 (116 ) 37 (262 ) Income (loss) before provision for (benefit of) income taxes (20,011 ) 5,833 (410 ) 23,609 Provision for (benefit of) income taxes (8,964 ) 1,418 (2,830 ) 5,368 Net income (loss) $ (11,047 ) $ 4,415 $ 2,420 $ 18,241 Net income (loss) per share: Basic $ (0.17 ) $ 0.07 $ 0.04 $ 0.30 Diluted $ (0.17 ) $ 0.07 $ 0.04 $ 0.29 Weighted-average shares outstanding: Basic 63,888 62,345 63,435 61,818 Diluted 63,888 62,348 63,440 62,010 QUALITY SYSTEMS, INC.
