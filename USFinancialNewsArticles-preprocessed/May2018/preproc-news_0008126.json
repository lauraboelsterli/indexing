    "text": "QINGDAO, China, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ â€“ TDH Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PETZ) (\"TDH\" or the \"Company\"), a PRC-based company that specializes in the development, manufacturing and sales of various pet food products under multiple established brands in China, Asia and Europe, today announced its audited financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights:\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n($ millions, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nRevenues\n$28.98\n$24.44\n18.6%\nGross profit\n$8.30\n$7.08\n17.3%\nGross margin\n28.6%\n28.9%\n-0.3 pp*\nOperating income\n$0.27\n$1.15\n-76.8%\nOperating margin\n0.9%\n4.7%\n-3.8 pp*\nNet income\n$0.12\n$1.01\n-88.6%\nEPS - basic and diluted\n$0.01\n$0.13\n-89.1%\n* pp: percentage points\nRevenues increased by 18.6% to $28.98 million for 2017, with growth in sales across overseas, domestic and E-commerce. Gross profit increased by 17.3% to $8.30 million for 2017 from $7.08 million for 2016. Operating income was $0.27 million for 2017, compared to $1.15 million for 2016. The decrease in operating income was mainly due to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses that more than offset the increase in gross profit. Selling expense increased due to the increase in e-commerce promotion expenses, e-commerce platform commission, shipping and handling expenses and payroll expenses for marketing personnel, all part of the Company's strategy to expand E-commerce business in the past two years; and general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the increased professional fees related to the IPO and an increase in management compensation. Net income was $0.12 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, for 2017, compared to $1.01 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, for 2016. Rongfeng Cui, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TDH, commented, \"With revenues and gross profit increasing by 18.6% and 17.3%, respectively, our 2017 results highlighted steady growth momentum of our business. While the pet food industry in China remained highly fragmented and competitive in 2017, we benefited from a diversified portfolio of over 200 products and balanced sales and distribution channels that included both retail partners and wholesale distributor across overseas, domestic and E-commerce platforms. Innovation and new product launch also played a key role in our sales growth with new products introduced during the year accounted for 74% of sales in 2017.\"\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues\nThe Company generates its revenues from product sales, mainly including sales for pet chews, dried pet snacks and wet canned pet foods. Revenue consists of the invoiced value for the sales, net of value-added tax (\"VAT\"), business tax, and applicable local government levies. For 2017, revenues increased by $4.54 million, or 18.6%, to $28.98 million from $24.44 million for 2016. The increase in revenues was across overseas, domestic and E-commerce sales. Our sales growth was mainly driven by the growth in sales volume as blended average selling prices for our products had been relatively stable for 2017 and 2016.\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nY/Y Change\nRevenues ($'000)\n% of Total\nRevenues ($'000)\n% of Total\nAmount ($'000)\n%\nOverseas\n$\n21,190\n73.1%\n$\n18,883\n77.2%\n$\n2,307\n12.2%\nDomestic\n2,086\n7.2%\n1,129\n4.6%\n957\n84.8%\nE-commerce\n5,734\n19.8%\n4,462\n18.3%\n1,273\n28.5%\nless: sales tax and addition\n(31)\n-0.1%\n(29)\n-0.1%\n(2)\n5.6%\nTotal\n$\n28,980\n100.0%\n$\n24,444\n100.0%\n$\n4,536\n18.6%\nOverseas sales increased by $2.31 million, or 12.2%, to $21.19 million for 2017 from $18.88 million for 2016.

As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues was 71.4% for 2017, compared to 71.1% for 2016.\nGross profit and gross margin\nGross profit increased by $1.22 million, or 17.3%, to $8.30 million for 2017 from $7.08 million for 2016.

The increase in selling expense was mainly due to the increase in e-commerce promotion expenses, e-commerce platform commission, shipping and handling expenses and payroll expenses for marketing personnel, as it was the Company's strategy to expand E-commerce business in the past two years.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $0.69 million, or 48.9%, to $2.10 million for 2017 from $1.41 million for 2016. The increase in general and administrative expense was mainly attributable to the increased professional fees related to the IPO and the increase in management compensation.\nResearch and development expense was $1.05 million for 2017, compared to $1.08 million for 2016.\nAs a result, total operating expenses increased by $2.11 million, or 35.5%, to $8.03 million for 2017 from $5.92 million for 2016.\nOperating income and operating margin\nIncome from operations decreased by $0.88 million, or 76.8%, to $0.27 million for 2017 from $1.15 million for 2016.
