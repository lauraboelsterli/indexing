    "text": "(Recasts; adds details of intervention and disclosure)\nSEOUL, May 16 (Reuters) - South Korea on Thursday said it will disclose details of actions taken by currency authorities on a regular basis starting in the second half of this year, an action likely to ease concerns about the country being labelled a currency manipulator by the United States.\nStarting in the second half of 2018, the country’s finance ministry will disclose the net amount used on buying and selling of U.S. dollars to prevent sharp swings in the South Korean won , the ministry said in a statement.\nFrom the second half of 2019, the details will be disclosed on a quarterly basis.\nThe move would help boost the transparency of South Korea’s currency market, as the government and the Bank of Korea have not been sharing details of its “smoothing operations” until now.\nThe decision will “remove unnecessary misunderstandings about our currency market operations and help build trust about our policies”, a joint statement from the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Korea said.\nIn March, South Korean officials said plans to disclose details of currency market interventions were under review, as was long suggested by the International Monetary Fund.\nSouth Korea, along with China, avoided the label of currency-manipulator in the U.S. Treasury Department’s twice-yearly report in April, but was kept on a currency “monitoring list”.
