FILE PHOTO - Argentina's Finance Minister Luis Caputo speaks at the discussion panel \"Market Forces at Work\" on the side of the IMF/World Bank spring meeting in Washington, U.S., April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\nThe so-called ‘stand-by arrangement’ would allow Argentina to obtain financing at an interest rate of around 4 percent, and would allow the South American country to receive more money than other options available from the IMF, Caputo said in an interview on local television channel TN.
