    "text": "GARDNER, Mass., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Precision Optics Corporation, Inc. (OTCQB:PEYE) (the “Company”) today announced operating results on an unaudited basis for its fiscal year 2018 third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial highlights include:\n6% increase in nine month revenues : $2,577,000 nine month fiscal 2018 revenues compared to nine month 2017 revenues of $2,434,000; 25% decrease in three month revenues : $736,000 third quarter fiscal 2018 revenues compared to $983,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017; Two production orders : Prepared to start deliveries against two production orders totaling approximately $2 million with deliveries beginning in fiscal 2018 fourth quarter; Increased gross margins in Fiscal 2018 : 32% and 36% gross margins in fiscal 2018 third quarter and nine months, respectively, compared to 28% and 24% in the same periods of fiscal 2017.\nCommenting on the third quarter results, Joseph Forkey, Company CEO said, “The decrease in third quarter fiscal 2018 revenues resulted from a reduction in engineering services revenues, while production revenues in the third quarter were up by 9% over the prior year. Overall, engineering service activity was strong in the third quarter with a similar number and size of engineering projects in process as compared to recent quarters. The reduction in revenue was due in part to timing of revenue recognition tied to specific phases of long-term projects. Improved gross margins throughout fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 continued to demonstrate the efficiency of our operations and the optimized utilization of our production and engineering resources. Unfortunately, our operating expenses and net loss in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 included $88,750 of bad debt expense resulting from one slow-paying customer for engineering services. Collection issues with this customer also contributed to the reduction in engineering revenues recognized in the quarter.”\nDr. Forkey continued, “The long-range objective of our engineering projects is to assist our customers in their efforts to develop and market their medical devices and to ultimately provide us with long-term, ongoing production orders to manufacture those products. In the third quarter, we made good progress in our preparations to start shipping against manufacturing orders from two medical device customers totaling over $2 million and spanning the next twelve to eighteen months, depending on the rate of success of their product introductions to the market. We have now begun, in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter, regular, scheduled deliveries against both of these orders. Also, we recently began shipments to another customer, of a highly complex optical assembly, used in a defense application, against a new purchase order that represents the first production pilot build for this project, which has been in development for the last couple years. We believe that the success of these three projects in moving from development into production, combined with an ongoing robust engineering pipeline will result in increased revenues and improved financial performance in coming quarters.”\nQuarterly Conference Call Details\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss the fiscal third quarter 2018 financial results for Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time.
