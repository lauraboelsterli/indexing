(NYSE: OGE) Chairman, President and CEO Sean Trauschke today told the company's shareholders that the core of the company is \"rock solid.\" Speaking at the company's annual meeting, Trauschke said that both OG&E, Oklahoma's largest investor-owned utility, and Enable Midstream, in which the company owns interest, are performing well and creating long-term shareholder value.\n\"I'm pleased with the performance of both businesses. At OG&E our operational performance in 2016 was very good. In 2017, we ramped it up to an even higher level. And, the outlook for 2018 is even brighter,\" Trauschke said. \"At Enable, we're seeing all-time highs in natural gas gathered and processed volumes supported by strong rig activity. Things are shaping up there for a solid year.\"\nTrauschke also said that among the most significant periods of capital investment in the company's history, 2017 stands out as the single most active year. \"We executed on a number of simultaneous construction projects, from building 126 miles of new transmission line, to the scrubber project at Sooner Power Plant, to the new, state-of-the-art Mustang Energy Center,\" he said.\nTrauschke added, \"I'm proud to report that all the projects we've undertaken on behalf of our customers are on time and under budget, which is a testament to the focus and dedication of our employees.\"\nLooking ahead, he said, the company will focus its attention and resources on further modernizing the grid, including improving or replacing existing distribution infrastructure, as well as upgrading systems that allow the company to respond to outages more quickly.\n\"These steps are essential to our ongoing efforts to improve the reliability and resiliency of our grid, as well as reduce costs for customers from more efficient response and operation,\" he said.\nThe OGE Energy board of directors also declared a third quarter dividend of $0.3325 per common share of stock, to be paid July 30, 2018, to shareholders of record July 10, 2018.
