His top priority will be to accelerate implementation of ENSERVCO’s initiative to enhance the Company’s operating structure and business processes in order to drive full fleet utilization.\n“Kevin is a seasoned and trusted leader with a strong track record of building and integrating multi-location teams to optimize operations and accelerate growth,” said Dickinson. “His skill set – which includes fleet logistics, ERP systems, data analytics, sales and team building – is ideally suited to help take ENSERVCO to the next level. I have tremendous confidence in Kevin’s ability to lead our field teams and drive operational excellence.”\n“ENSERVCO is well positioned with industry tailwinds, an expanded fleet and an exceptional group of field personnel,” said Kersting. “Our business opportunity has never been stronger, and I am incredibly energized to help lead the Company to its next level of growth through the optimization of our equipment deployment, the integration of several key departments, and by leveraging our geographic footprint and world class customer base.”\nPrior to joining ENSERVCO, Kersting held several senior positions at CAP Logistics, a leader in time critical and custom transportation services for heavy industry.
