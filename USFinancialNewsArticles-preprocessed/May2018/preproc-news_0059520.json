FILE PHOTO: A logo of Exxon Mobil is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\nShareholders also rejected a proposal that would have forced the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer to provide greater disclosure on its lobbying expenditures. Shareholders did approve the full slate of 10 nominees to the company’s board of directors at their Dallas meeting. Reporting by Ernest Scheyder",
