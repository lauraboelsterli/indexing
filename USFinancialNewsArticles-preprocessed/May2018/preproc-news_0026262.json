(NASDAQ: INTX) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“First quarter 2018 revenue and earnings were both in line with management’s expectations as we continue to work towards our 2018 objectives,” said Michael R. Stanfield, Executive Chairman and President. “Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes of $1.3 million and adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million continued the trend of significant improvement over prior year results.” Mr. Stanfield continued, “We believe that having Identity Guard ® with Watson™ active in all of our U.S. channels together with the continued expansion of new partner opportunities provides a strong foundation to meet our 2018 plans and support our long-term growth objectives.”\nConsolidated First Quarter Results:\nConsolidated revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $39.1 million, compared to $40.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1.3 million, compared to $(4.3) million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $3.3 million, compared to $(1.0) million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Basic and diluted income (loss) from continuing operations per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $0.07, compared to $(0.18) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nConsolidated First Quarter Highlights:\nIdentity Guard ® subscriber revenue was $13.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $13.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $12.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Identity Guard ® subscriber base was 357 thousand subscribers as of March 31, 2018, compared to 333 thousand subscribers as of March 31, 2017. The increase in the subscriber base was primarily from growth in the direct to consumer and employee benefits channels. Revenue from U.S. financial institution clients was $19.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to revenue of $20.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Revenue decreased on average by approximately 1% per month during the first quarter, which the Company believes is representative of normal attrition given the discontinuation of marketing and retention efforts for this population. Consolidated general and administrative expenses were $13.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $16.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted G&A Expense decreased 14.4% to $13.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $15.3 million for the quarter ended March 31,2017. Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1.3 million, compared to $1.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $(4.3) million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $3.3 million, compared to $4.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $(1.0) million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The first quarter 2018 marked the third consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA.\nLiquidity:\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had a cash balance of $8.4 million, and an outstanding principal balance of $21.5 million under its existing credit agreement. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1.4 million.\nCash used in operating activities for the first quarter includes approximately $1.4 million for business development activities, the significant majority of which is personnel cost. The Company expects to continue its spending on business development activities for the remainder of 2018 at approximately the same level as 2017.\nThe Company continued to develop new product features primarily for the Identity Guard ® with Watson ™ platform during the first quarter 2018. As a result, the Company invested approximately $0.8 million in internally developed capitalized software for the first quarter. The Company expects to continue its investments in product development for the remainder of 2018 at approximately the same level as 2017.\nThe Company amended its existing credit agreement on April 3, 2018 and made a $1.0 million voluntary, partial prepayment of the outstanding principal balance.
