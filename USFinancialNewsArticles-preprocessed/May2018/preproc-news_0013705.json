    "text": "May 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures trimmed their losses on Friday after data showed U.S. job growth increased less than expected in April and the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent.\nThe Labor Departmentâ€™s closely watched employment report on Friday also showed wages barely rising last month, which could ease concerns that inflation pressures were rapidly building up, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening.\nAt 8:32 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 42 points, or 0.18 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 5.25 points, or 0.2 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 17 points, or 0.26 percent.\nAhead of the report, Dow e-minis were down 81 points, or 0.34 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 9.5 points, or 0.36 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 28.75 points, or 0.43 percent. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n ",
