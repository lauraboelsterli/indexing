    "text": "(Reuters) - Brazilian truckers association Abcam said in a written statement on Friday that it had rejected the government’s accord with other driver groups to end a nationwide blockade that has paralyzed key sectors of Latin America’s biggest economy.\nAbcam, the group that started the protests on Monday, said it would not back down until fuel tax cuts promised by the government became law, which would not happen until next week at the earliest. Abcam, which says it represents 600,000 drivers, told its members to remain “firm” in keeping its protest in place.\nReporting by Jose Roberto Gomes; Writing by Brad Brooks\n ",
