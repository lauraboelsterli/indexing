    "text": "Four ways retirees botch their Social Security benefits Up to 85 percent of your benefits could be subject to income taxes. Social Security replaces about 40 percent of preretirement income for average earners. If you file at 62, your income benefit decreases by 25 percent. 8 Hours Ago | 01:09\nYou have one source of guaranteed income in retirement. Try not to mess it up.\nThough Social Security replaces up to 40 percent of preretirement income for average earners, misconceptions about how the program works continue to persist.\nIndeed, nearly 3 in 10 retirees said their Social Security payments are less than expected, according to a survey conducted by Nationwide Retirement Institute.\nThe poll of 1,013 adults over age 50 also found that 57 percent of participants who are still working believed they were eligible for Social Security sooner than they actually are.\nThat's just one of the common errors soon-to-be retirees make when it comes to claiming Social Security, said Marguerita M. Cheng, CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\nShe highlighted four major mistakes workers make with this crucial retirement-income program. Not knowing your full retirement age Sam Edwards | Getty Images\n\"You need to know your full retirement age â€” the age at which you can take an unreduced benefit,\" said Cheng. Retirees may receive a reduced Social Security benefit as early as age 62, but in order to collect your benefit without any reductions, you'll need to wait until age 66 if you were born between 1943 and 1954.\nThat's known as full retirement age.Hold off on your benefits until age 70 and you'll get 132 percent of the monthly benefit you would have received at full retirement age. Failing to understand when to file for benefits Getty Images\nRetirees fail to realize that they can file for benefits up to three months in advance of receiving income, Cheng said. That means if you're turning 66 on October 1 and you'd like to receive your first check that month, you can file for benefits on July 1.\nBe sure to gather up your necessary documents, which will include your Social Security card, birth certificate and your Form W-2.\nMore from Straight Talk:",
