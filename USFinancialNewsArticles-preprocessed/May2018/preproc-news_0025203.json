    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Marin Software Incorporated (NYSE: MRIN), a leading provider of cross-channel, cross-device, enterprise marketing software for advertisers and agencies, today announced the first quarter .\n\"Our growth in cross-channel revenue during Q1 demonstrates the appeal for an open, independent approach to digital advertising,\" said Chris Lien, Chief Executive Officer of Marin Software. \"Our new platform, which launches this summer, will help advertisers drive performance in a world where Google, Facebook and increasingly Amazon, dominate.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business and Product Release Highlights:\nOnboarded first customers advertising on Amazon, including a multinational pharmaceutical corporation and a leading consumer electronics and technology company. Upgraded Marin Bidding to automatically calculate audience bid multipliers based on campaign performance, driving greater ad spend efficiency for advertisers. Developed a tool to automatically create a video slideshow ad from top-performing products, helping to drive increased engagement on social advertising. Expanded offerings for social travel advertisers by supporting trip consideration and broad audiences for Facebook's Dynamic Ads for Travel. Debuted customizable cross-channel dashboards, providing advertisers with access to all key search and social campaign metrics in a single view.

Added support for Twitter Website Video Cards, providing advertisers another outlet for delivering engaging video content. Added support for Facebook offer ads where advertisers can create and track promotions. Marin's proprietary Offer Library makes it easier to launch and reuse offers at scale.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Updates:\nNet revenues totaled $15.4 million, a year-over-year decrease of 24%, when compared to $20.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP loss from operations was ($9.1) million, resulting in a GAAP operating margin of (59%), compared to a GAAP loss from operations of ($6.0) million and a GAAP operating margin of (29%) for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP loss from operations was ($6.0) million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of (39%), as compared to a non-GAAP loss from operations of ($3.2) million and a non-GAAP operating margin of (16%) for the first quarter of 2017. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $23.3 million as of March 31, 2018, as compared to $28.8 million as of December 31, 2017. During January 2018, initiated an organizational restructuring plan designed to reduce operating expenses and better align the Company's efforts to return to growth. This restructuring plan is expected to result in annualized cost savings of $6.0 million to $7.0 million going forward. In connection, the Company incurred $0.9 million in restructuring related expenses during the first quarter of 2018, consisting primarily of employee severance costs.\nReconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below, under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nFinancial Outlook:\nMarin is providing guidance for its second quarter of 2018 as follows:\nForward-Looking Guidance\nIn millions\nRange of Estimate\nFrom\nTo\nThree Months Ending June 30, 2018\nRevenues, net\n$\n13.5\n$\n14.0\nNon-GAAP loss from operations\n(6.7)\n(6.2)\nNon-GAAP loss from operations excludes the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of internally developed software, intangible assets and deferred costs to obtain and fulfill contracts, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, non-recurring costs associated with restructurings, capitalization of internally developed software and deferral of costs to obtain and fulfill contracts.\nAdditionally, the Company does not reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP loss from operations, due to variability between revenues and non-cash items such as stock-based compensation. The GAAP loss from operations includes stock-based compensation expense, which is affected by hiring and retention needs, as well as the future price of Marin's stock. As a result, a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be made without unreasonable effort.\nQuarterly Results Conference Call\nMarin Software will host a conference call today at 2:00 PM Pacific Time (5:00 PM Eastern Time) to review the Company's the quarter , and its outlook for the future.

For more information about Marin Software, please visit: http://www.marinsoftware.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nMarin uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release. Marin uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its ongoing operational performance. Marin believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Non-GAAP financial measures that Marin uses may differ from measures that other companies may use.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP expenses, measures and net loss per share. Marin defines non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP general and administrative, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of internally developed software, intangible assets and deferred costs to obtain and fulfill contracts, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, non-cash expenses related to debt agreements, non-recurring costs associated with restructurings, capitalization of internally developed software and deferral of costs to obtain and fulfill contracts. Non-GAAP net loss per share is calculated as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted average shares outstanding.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Marin defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization of internally developed software, intangible assets and deferred costs to obtain and fulfill contracts, capitalization of internally developed software, deferral of costs to obtain and fulfill contracts, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, provision for income taxes, other income or expenses, net and non-recurring costs associated with restructurings. These amounts are often excluded by other companies to help investors understand the operational performance of their business. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measurement of its operating performance because it assists in comparing the operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain non-cash and non-operating items. Adjusted EBITDA reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the operations that Marin believes, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements including, among other things, statements regarding Marin's business, expectations about our ability to return to growth, impact of investments in product and technology on future operating results, progress on product development efforts, product capabilities and future financial results, including its outlook for the second quarter of 2018.
