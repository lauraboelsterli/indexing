FILE PHOTO: Steel Rectangular Tubular Profiles (PTR) are pictured at Kalisch Steel factory in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/File Photo\nTrump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum in March, but granted temporary exemptions to Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the European Union, Australia and Argentina. The temporary exemptions were due to expire at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT) on Tuesday. Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Sandra Maler",
