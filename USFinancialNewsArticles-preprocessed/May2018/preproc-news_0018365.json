    "text": "25 COMMENTS Cable giant Comcast Corp. is getting the pieces in place to make a hostile bid for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets should it choose to do so , according to people familiar with the situation.\nFox agreed in December to sell the assets in question to Walt Disney Co. for $52.4 billion in stock .\nComcast is considering making a play to break up that deal, and has lined up around $60 billion in financing to make an all-cash offer for the Fox assets, the people say.\nComcast hasn’t yet decided whether to proceed with a hostile bid. One pivotal factor is the outcome of the government’s lawsuit to stop the pending merger of AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. If the companies are successful and their deal survives, Comcast would be emboldened to pursue the Fox assets, the people said.\nArguments in the antitrust case against the deal concluded last week, with the judge saying he would announce his ruling on June 12.\nMore Coverage\nComcast Pursues Sky While Assessing Bigger Move for Fox Assets (April 25, 2018) Comcast Considers Reviving Pursuit of Fox After Higher Bid Was Rejected (Feb. 11, 2018) Comcast Moves to Hijack Murdoch’s Deal for Sky With $31 Billion Offer (Feb. 27, 2018) Disney Agrees to Buy Key Parts of 21st Century Fox in $52.4 Billion Deal (Dec. 14, 2017) Full Coverage: AT&T Time Warner Antitrust Trial The assets Comcast and Disney are seeking to purchase include the Twentieth Century Fox TV and film studio, cable networks and international properties including Fox’s 39% stake in European pay TV operator Sky PLC.\nSeparately, on another track, Comcast and Fox are each vying for full control of Sky and have lobbed in bids. Comcast is securing financing from banks that would allow it to pursue a bid for the Fox entertainment assets and consolidate 100% ownership of Sky, the people familiar with the situation said.\nReuters earlier reported that Comcast was asking banks to arrange financing that would give it the ability to pursue an all-cash bid for the Fox assets.\nZazie Beetz and Donald Glover star in ‘Atlanta,’ which airs on FX and is owned by 21st Century Fox. Photo: FX NETWORKS/EVERETT COLLECTION Comcast has circled the Fox assets for months. Fox, citing regulatory concerns, turned down a Comcast stock offer in the low $60 billion range before sealing the Disney deal, people familiar with the matter have said. Comcast’s offer was a 16% premium to Disney’s, according to a securities filing and people close to the deal talks.\nIt is possible Comcast could bid a bit lower than last time if it pursues a hostile effort, one of the people familiar with the situation said. The cable company believes an all-cash offer would be compelling to most Fox shareholders.\nOne concern raised from the Fox side during the last round of deliberations was the relative value of Comcast shares versus Disney shares, so an all-cash bid would take that off the table, the person said.\nComcast shares have been under pressure in recent months. The cable company’s chief financial officer, Michael Cavanagh, said on an earnings call late last month that Comcast was unlikely to use its stock to make deals. He said the company’s strong balance sheet will give it flexibility to consider opportunities “at times like this.”\n21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal-parent News Corp share common ownership.\nThe cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix.
