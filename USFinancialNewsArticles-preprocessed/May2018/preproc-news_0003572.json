(NYSE:HCC) (“Warrior” or the “Company”) today announced results for the first 2018. Warrior is the leading dedicated U.S.-based producer and exporter of high quality metallurgical (“met”) coal for the global steel industry.\nWarrior reported first quarter 2018 net income of $178.7 million, or $3.36 per diluted share, compared to net income of $108.3 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding one-time transaction and other expenses, adjusted earnings per share were $3.42 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, a 54% increase over the same period in 2017. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $216.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $135.5 million in the prior year period. The market for high quality premium met coal continued to be strong in the first quarter, reflecting resilience in global steel production, as well as the effects of met coal supply disruptions in Australia.\n“Warrior’s results in the first quarter continue to reflect the strong demand for our premium met coal, as well as our industry leading margins,” commented Walt Scheller, CEO of Warrior. “Our record-setting production and sales volumes, coupled with high price realization and our low-cost structure, enabled us to achieve strong free cash flow conversion. These robust results continue to validate our highly focused business strategy as a premium 'pure-play' met coal producer.”\nOperating Results\nThe Company produced 2.1 million short tons of met coal in the first quarter of 2018, 30% more than the amount produced in the first quarter of 2017. “By taking advantage of the strong pricing environment for our premium met coal, we are on track to meet our previously established guidance for the full year 2018,” Mr. Scheller added.\nAdditional Financial Results\nTotal revenues were $421.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, including $412.9 million in mining revenues, which consisted of met coal sales of 2.1 million short tons at an average net selling price of $195 per short ton, net of demurrage and other charges. Sales volume increased 88% over the first quarter of 2017, reflecting both increased production levels and high demand from customers. Warrior capitalized on the strong pricing environment in the quarter by achieving a gross price realization of 99%. The Company's gross price realization now represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our daily realized price per ton based on gross sales, which excludes demurrage and other charges, as a percentage of the Platts Premium Low Volatility (\"LV\") Free-On-Board (\"FOB\") Australia Index price (the \"Platts Index\").\nCost of sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $190.7 million, or 46.2% of mining revenues, and included mining costs, transportation and royalty costs. Cash cost of sales (free-on-board port) per short ton decreased to $89.82 in the first quarter of 2018 from the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher sales volumes.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $8.2 million, or 2.0% of total revenues. Transaction and other expenses were $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 and were related to the issuance of $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the \"New Notes\"). Depreciation and depletion costs for the first quarter of 2018 were $24.6 million, or 5.8% of total revenues. Warrior incurred interest expense of $8.6 million during the first quarter of 2018, which was higher than previous quarters due to the incurrence of interest on the Notes (as defined below). The Company did not incur any income tax expense for the first quarter of 2018 due to its planned utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”).\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nThe Company continued to generate strong cash flows from operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 of $193.7 million, compared to $65.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net working capital, excluding cash, increased by $9.0 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to the higher accounts receivable on higher sales volumes. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were $22.5 million, resulting in free cash flow of $171.2 million, which was $117.0 million higher than in the prior year period. Spending on sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures included a down payment on a new set of shields and the new portal at Mine 7. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $376.0 million for the quarter when compared to the prior year period.\nThe Company’s available liquidity as of March 31, 2018 was $422.0 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $322.0 million and $100.0 million available under its Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement.\nCompany Outlook\nThe Company’s outlook is subject to many risks that may impact performance, such as market conditions in the steel and met coal industries, overall global economic and competitive conditions, all as more fully described under \" .\" In light of the Company's successful first quarter performance, NOL carryforwards and expected market conditions in 2018, Warrior is updating its guidance for the full year 2018 as indicated below. Interest expense has been updated to reflect the New Notes and the number of and timing of longwall moves has been updated.\nCoal sales 6.8 - 7.3 million short tons Coal production 6.8 - 7.3 million short tons Cash cost of sales (free-on-board port) $89 - $95 per short ton Capital expenditures $100 - $120 million Selling, general and administrative expenses $30 - $33 million Interest expense $40 - $42 million Cash tax rate 0% The Company’s guidance for capital expenditures consists of sustaining capital spending of approximately $70 - $83 million, including regulatory and gas requirements, and discretionary capital spending of $30 - $37 million for various operational improvements.\nKey factors that may affect outlook include:\nHCC index pricing Planned longwall moves - 2 in Q3 and 1 in Q4 Exclusion of other non-recurring costs\nThe Company does not provide reconciliations of its outlook for cash cost of sales (free-on-board port) to cost of sales in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided for under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop the meaningful comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") cost of sales. These items typically include non-cash asset retirement obligation accretion expenses, mine idling expenses and other non-recurring indirect mining expenses that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include a GAAP estimate.\nStock Repurchase Program\nThe Company also announced today that its board of directors (the “Board”) has approved a stock repurchase program (the “stock repurchase program”) that authorizes repurchases of up to an aggregate of $40.0 million of its outstanding common stock. The stock repurchase program does not require the Company to repurchase a specific number of shares or have an expiration date. The Company is not obligated to purchase any specific number of shares under its stock repurchase program, and the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued by the Board at any time without prior notice.\nUnder the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time, in amounts, at prices and at such times as the Company deems appropriate, subject to market and industry conditions, share price, regulatory requirements as determined from time to time by the Company and other considerations. The Company’s repurchases may be executed using open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and repurchases may be executed pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Repurchases will be subject to limitations in the Company's asset-based revolving credit agreement (the “ABL Facility”) and the indenture dated as of November 2, 2017, as amended (the “Indenture”). The Company intends to fund repurchases under the stock repurchase program from cash on hand and/or other sources of liquidity.\nSenior Secured Notes Offering and Special Dividend\nOn March 1, 2018, the Company consummated its previously announced private offering (the “Offering”) of the New Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The New Notes were offered as additional notes under the Indenture, pursuant to which Warrior previously issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “Existing Notes” and together with the New Notes, the \"Notes\").\nOn April 3, 2018, the Company used the net proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on hand, to declare a special cash dividend of approximately $6.53 per share of Warrior’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, totaling an aggregate payment of $350 million, which was paid on April 20, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 13, 2018.\nRegular Quarterly Dividend\nOn April 24, 2018, the Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, totaling approximately $2.7 million, which will be paid on May 11, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2018.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release contains the use of certain U.S. non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The HCC that Warrior produces from the Blue Creek coal seam contains very low sulfur and has strong coking properties and is of a similar quality to coal referred to as the premium HCC produced in Australia. The premium nature of Warrior’s HCC makes it ideally suited as a base feed coal for steel makers and results in price realizations near the Platts Index price. Warrior sells all of its met coal production to steel producers in Europe, South America and Asia.

In connection with this corporate conversion, the Company filed a certificate of incorporation. Pursuant to the Company’s certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue up to 140,000,000 shares of common stock $0.01 par value per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock $0.01 par value per share. The number of shares and per share amounts of common stock have been retroactively recast to reflect the corporate conversion.\nWARRIOR MET COAL, INC. QUARTERLY SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA AND\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nUNAUDITED QUARTERLY SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA:\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31,\n(short tons in thousands) (1) 2018 2017 Tons sold 2,116 1,127 Tons produced 2,098 1,614 Gross price realization (2) 99 % 84 % Average net selling price $ 195.12 $ 213.89 Cash cost of sales (free on board port) per short ton (3) $ 89.82 $ 93.75 (1) 1 short ton is equivalent to 0.907185 metric tons.\n(2) For the three months ended March 31, 2018, our gross price realization represents a volume weighted-average calculation of our daily realized price per ton based on gross sales, which excludes demurrage and other charges, as a percentage of the Platts Index price. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, gross price realization represents gross sales dividend by tons sold as a percentage of the Australian HCC Benchmark.\nRECONCILIATION OF CASH COST OF SALES (FREE-ON-BOARD PORT) TO COST OF SALES REPORTED UNDER U.S. GAAP:\n(in thousands) For the three months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Cost of sales $ 190,676 $ 106,144 Asset retirement obligation accretion (560 ) (481 ) Stock compensation expense (67 ) — Cash cost of sales (free on board port) (3) $ 190,049 $ 105,663 (3) Cash cost of sales (free on board port) is based on reported cost of sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, labor, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items, and may be adjusted for other items that, pursuant to GAAP, are classified in the Condensed Statements of Operations as costs other than cost of sales, but relate directly to the costs incurred to produce met coal. Our cash cost of sales per short ton is calculated as cash cost of sales divided by the short tons sold. Cash cost of sales per short ton is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. GAAP and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe cash cost of sales per ton is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance. Cash cost of sales per ton may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWARRIOR MET COAL, INC.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing operations. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be aware that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nRECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME TO AMOUNTS REPORTED UNDER U.S. GAAP:\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) For the three months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Net income $ 178,694 $ 108,308 Transaction and other expenses, net of tax 3,288 8,882 Adjusted net income (5) $ 181,982 $ 117,190 Weighted average number of basic shares outstanding 53,149 52,681 Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding 53,152 52,681 Adjusted basic and diluted income per share: $ 3.42 $ 2.22 (5) Adjusted net income is defined as net income net of transaction and other expenses, net of tax (based on each respective period's effective tax rate). Adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from adjusted net income are significant to the reader in understanding and assessing our results of operations. Therefore, adjusted net income should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income under GAAP. We believe adjusted net income is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance.

Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from net cash provided by (used in) operating activities are significant to the reader in understanding and assessing our results of operations. Therefore, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities under GAAP.
