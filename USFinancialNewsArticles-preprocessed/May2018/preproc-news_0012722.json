    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Integrated Device Technology, Inc. (IDT ® ) (NASDAQ: IDTI) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended April 1, 2018.\nFourth quarter fiscal 2018 revenues totaled $224.6 million, up 3 percent sequentially, and up 28 percent from the year ago period. Strength in the quarter was driven primarily by increased demand for products in the automotive/industrial and consumer end markets.\n\"We exceeded our original $830 million FY2018 revenue target, delivering revenues of $842.8 million (up 15.7% over FY2017). We also delivered on our Non-GAAP operating margin model target of 30% for the quarter, up from 27.2% in the year ago period. For FY2019, we expect continued diversified revenue growth, coupled with further year over year margin expansion,\" said Greg Waters, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nRecent Business Highlights – Datacenter/HPC & Communications Infrastructure\nIDT announced the availability of its first DDR5 Registered Clock Driver (RCD), the IDT® 5RCD0144H RCD, which pairs seamlessly with the IDT® P8900 PMIC to form the first complete chipset for the early evaluation of DDR5 server memory modules. Providing the first chipset capable of comprehensively evaluating interconnect and power delivery at the system and module level allows IDT's ecosystem partners to get a jumpstart on validation of silicon, hardware and software development efforts. Our platform solution enables DDR5 memory to scale up to twice the maximum speed and effective bandwidth of DDR4 and promises to be the most significant evolution in the memory subsystem in nearly two decades. At the 2018 Optical Forum Conference (OFC), IDT displayed multiple new analog/mixed signal line-driver, transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and clock-data recovery (CDR) timing devices for next generation 200G/400G intra and inter datacenter applications and 400G/600G metro/long distance telecom applications. At OFC 2018, IDT introduced the IDT® GX72170 25G linear driver for 5G wireless network fiber backhaul applications. The demand for 25G and 50G fiber-based backhaul transceivers in the next 5 years is expected to have 45% CAGR or more, according to the latest LightCounting report.\nRecent Business Highlights – Consumer\nIDTI announced that its latest wireless charging transmitter and receiver chipset is used in the Xiaomi Mobile flagship MI MIX 2S smartphone and associated wireless charging pad. The Xiaomi smartphone implements the Qi standard Baseline Power Profile (BPP) with a proprietary operations mode for a faster wireless charging experience supported by IDT. IDTI announced that its latest wireless charging chipset is being used as the receiver system-on-chip (SoC) in Samsung's flagship Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ Android smartphones as well as the transmitter application in the bundled charging pad. IDT announced that its latest wireless charging chipset is used in HMD Global's new premium smartphone, the Nokia 8 Sirocco, which was launched at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Using the IDT wireless charging chipset, the Nokia 8 Sirocco supports the popular Qi wireless charging standard, which allows consumers to quickly and easily charge their smartphones wirelessly without the need for cumbersome cables.\nRecent Business Highlights – Auto and Industrial\nIDT's Auto and Industrial business segment continues to experience healthy growth and design win momentum. New product releases in sensor signal conditioners, position sensors, and fully integrated sensor platforms are delivering growth and new design wins. These fully integrated sensor platforms include the sensor, sensor signal processing IC, software/algorithm, calibration with high-volume assembly/test capabilities.\nThe following highlights the Company's financial performance on both a GAAP and supplemental non-GAAP basis. The Company provides supplemental information regarding its operating performance on a non-GAAP basis that excludes certain gains, losses and charges, or events which occur relatively infrequently and which management considers to be outside our core operating results. Non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Non-GAAP information should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is attached to this press release.\nRevenue for the full fiscal 2018 was $842.8 million versus $728.2 million for full fiscal 2017. GAAP net loss for fiscal 2018 was $12.1 million or $0.09 per diluted share (including a GAAP charge of $114.2 million for the estimated impacts of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (\"TCJA\")) compared with fiscal 2017 GAAP net income of $109.2 million or $0.79 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for full fiscal 2018 was $214.4 million or $1.55 per diluted share versus $195.7 million for full fiscal 2017 or $1.40 per diluted share. Revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 was $224.6 million. This compared with $217.1 million reported last quarter, and $175.7 million reported in the same period one year ago. GAAP net income for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 was $20.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share versus GAAP net loss for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 of $68.2 million, or a loss of $0.51 per diluted share (including a $101.9 million charge for the estimated impacts of TCJA) and GAAP net income of $30.2 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the same period one year ago. Fiscal fourth quarter GAAP results include $15.1 million in restructuring-related charges, $12.4 million in stock-based compensation; $10.1 million in acquisition-related charges and $3.8 million in non-cash interest expense. Non-GAAP net income for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 was $63.4 million or $0.46 per diluted share compared with non-GAAP net income of $57.6 million or $0.42 per diluted share last quarter, and non-GAAP net income of $48.2 million or $0.35 per diluted share reported in the same period one year ago.

Risks include, but are not limited to, global business and economic conditions, fluctuations in product demand, manufacturing capacity and costs, inventory management, competition, pricing, patent and other intellectual property rights of third parties, timely development and introduction of new products and manufacturing processes, dependence on one or more customers for a significant portion of sales, successful integration of acquired businesses and technology, availability of capital, cash flow and other risk factors detailed in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The Company urges investors to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2017. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release and the Company disclaims any duty to update such statements.\nNon-GAAP Reporting\nTo supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, IDT uses non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as described in detail below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with IDT's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting the Company's business and operations. It should also be noted that IDT's non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by IDT include:\nCost of revenues; Gross profit; Research and development expenses; Selling, general and administrative expenses; Interest and other income (expense); Benefit from (provision for) income taxes; Operating income; Net income (loss); Diluted net income (loss) per share; and Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted\nThe Company presents non-GAAP financial measures because the investor community uses non-GAAP results in its analysis and comparison of historical results and projections of the Company's future operating results. These non-GAAP results exclude acquisition-related expense, restructuring and divestiture related costs (gain), share-based compensation expense, results from discontinued operations, and certain other expenses and benefits. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of the business. These non-GAAP results are also consistent with the way management internally analyzes IDT's financial results.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the accompanying press release.\nAs presented in the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP\" tables in the accompanying press release, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:\nAcquisition-related. Acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or IDT's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to the Company's core operating performance. Adjustments of these items provide investors with a basis to compare IDT's performance to other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting. Acquisition-related expenses primarily include:\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology, patents, customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and non-compete agreements. Acquisition-related costs such as legal, accounting and other professional or consulting fees directly related to an acquisition. Fair market value adjustment to acquired inventory sold.\nRestructuring-related. Restructuring charges primarily relate to changes in IDT's infrastructure in efforts to reduce costs and expenses (gains) associated with strategic divestitures and restructuring in force actions. Restructuring charges (gains) are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although IDT has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges (gains) from IDT's non-GAAP financial measures as it enhances the ability of investors to compare the Company's period-over-period operating results. Restructuring-related charges (gains) primarily include:\nSeverance costs directly related to a restructuring action. Facility closure costs consist of ongoing costs associated with the exit of our leased and owned facilities. Gain on divestiture consists of gains recognized upon the strategic sale of business units. Assets impairments including accelerated depreciation and amortization of certain assets no longer in use or related to discontinued product lines.\nOther adjustments. These items are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not related to the core operating activities and on-going future operating performance of IDT. Excluding this data allows investors to better compare IDT's period-over-period performance without such expense, which IDT believes may be useful to the investor community.\nOther adjustments primarily include:\nStock based compensation expense. Compensation expense (benefit) – deferred compensation, consists of gains and losses on marketable equity securities related to our deferred compensation arrangements. Non-cash interest expense, consists of amortization of issuance cost and accretion of discount related to the convertible notes. Loss (gain) on deferred compensation plan securities represents the changes in the fair value of the assets in a separate trust that is invested in corporate owned life insurance under our deferred compensation plan. Unrealized foreign currency gains and losses resulting from remeasurement of certain non-functional currency account balances. Tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP tax calculation is based on estimated cash tax expense and reserves. The Company forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period. This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the impact of the Company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, which may not reflect actual cash tax expense. The tax impacts of the TCJA related to non-current liabilities and deferred tax assets are not reflected in the non-GAAP tax provision. Diluted weighted average shares non-GAAP adjustment, for purposes of calculating non-GAAP diluted net income per share, the GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding is adjusted to exclude the benefits of stock compensation expense attributable to future services not yet recognized in the financial statements that are treated as proceeds assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury method.\nIDT and the IDT logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Integrated Device Technology, Inc.
