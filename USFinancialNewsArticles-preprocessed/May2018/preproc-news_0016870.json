This translates into gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 of 63.9%, compared with 64.7% for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $16.8 million, resulting in net loss of $0.12 per share, compared with net income of $3.6 million and diluted net income of $0.02 per share, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.9 million, compared with $25.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 8.5% compared with 23.0% for the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.0 million, resulting in Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.04, compared with Non-GAAP net income of $9.7 million and Non-GAAP diluted net income of $0.07 per share, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the first three months of 2018 was $6.9 million, compared with $2.3 million for the first three months of 2017.\n“The Company's financial performance in the first quarter of 2018 was in line with our expectations,” said Jonathan Boldt, vice president of finance and interim chief financial officer of Inovalon. “While first quarter results reflect several factors including the previously discussed ACA-related impact and our continued conversion of legacy solutions to subscription-based platform offerings, the results do not yet reflect the positive contributions of ABILITY. The integration of ABILITY and the process of capturing both revenue and cost synergies is progressing well. We continue to be pleased with our internal execution and remain confident in the outlook for full-year 2018. As a result, we are reaffirming our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2018, and adjusting other guidance to reflect interest expenses associated with the debt financing and subsequent swap arrangements related to the ABILITY acquisition.”\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Non-GAAP net income are Non-GAAP measures. Net income is the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income. Reconciliations of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income, identifying the differences between net income and each of these Non-GAAP financial measures, are included in this press release after the consolidated financial statements.\nKey Highlights and Subsequent Events\n1. ABILITY Network Acquisition\na. During the first quarter of 2018, Inovalon entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ABILITY Network (“ABILITY”), a leading cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) technology company helping to simplify the administrative and clinical complexities of healthcare. The acquisition of ABILITY closed effective April 2, 2018. See the Company’s announcement and supplemental presentation materials available on the Company’s investor website dated March 7, 2018 regarding the acquisition.\nb. During the first quarter of 2018, Inovalon borrowed $980 million through a Senior Secured Term Loan B to facilitate the acquisition of ABILITY. Based on current leverage ratios, the interest rate on the Term Loan is at LIBOR + 350 basis points (declining to 325 basis points upon reaching a net debt ratio of 4.0x Adjusted EBITDA or less). To decrease the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk in a potentially rising interest rate environment, the Company has entered into multiple interest rate swap transactions that collectively fix the LIBOR rate component of interest on $600 million of the Term Loan at approximately 2.8%. Pretax interest expense is expected to be approximately $48 to $49 million in 2018, inclusive of $4 million in original issuance discount and debt issuance fees amortization. Following the closing of the transaction, Inovalon continues to have strong liquidity, with cash of approximately $90 million and an untapped $100 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\n2. Expansion of Inovalon ONE™ Platform Offerings\na. Commencing during the summer of 2017, Inovalon began the design and development of capabilities to bring an industry-leading cloud-based specialty pharmacy offering to the marketplace. Referred to as ScriptMed™ Cloud, the specialty pharmacy configuration of the Inovalon ONE™ Platform leverages a wide array of existing proprietary technology toolsets within the Platform (known as Components) as well as a Module of eight newly developed Components reengineered in cloud native microservice architecture from the Creehan ScriptMed™ Enterprise software portfolio. The specialized configuration of the Inovalon ONE™ Platform brings to the marketplace significant advancements in clinical analytics and healthcare ecosystem connectivity, together with synchronized, seamless processing of the many steps required for specialty medication initiation, authorization, dispensing, inventory management, and claims for both pharmacy and medical insurance coverages in massive scale. The Platform dramatically decreases processing time and expense, accelerating the start of the patient’s therapy, and optimizing the patient’s treatment experience enabling highly differentiated and integrated business processes, patient engagement, and clinical insights, empowering improved outcomes for the patients served. The high complexity and high-cost nature of specialty pharmacy, estimated to grow to approximately $282 billion by 2020, stands to benefit significantly from the data, connectivity, analytics, and cloud-based capabilities enabled through the Inovalon ONE™ Platform configuration.\nb. In April 2018, Inovalon launched two new cloud-based “as a service” offerings on the Inovalon ONE™ Platform: Clinical Data Extraction as a Service (CDEaaS™) and Natural Language Processing as a Service (NLPaaS™). The CDEaaS offering identifies and extracts patient data within the healthcare ecosystem and aggregates it autonomously in a digital medical record format that is both CMS and NCQA compliant. The new NLPaaS solution enables clients to analyze non-structured data within clinical medical record data for clinical quality, diagnosis, disease progression, outcomes, treatment, risk, compliance, waste, and a host of other complex healthcare initiatives. Inovalon began applying these technologies within its own operations during 2017, achieving an annual run-rate reduction in operating costs of more than $15 million by year end. The CDEaaS and NLPaaS offerings are among the previously-discussed technology-based efficiencies that Inovalon has invested in to speed both time-to-value for clients and margin improvement for the Company. Inovalon can now offer these solutions directly to clients to help them reduce their own labor expenses and the time required to obtain clinical data records, while also improving accuracy and consistency. The benefits to Inovalon include further monetizing the Company’s investments, further differentiating Inovalon in the marketplace, and providing the Company with significant incremental cross-sell opportunities.\n3. Financial Performance\na. During the first quarter of 2018, Inovalon’s subscription-based platform revenue grew $4.4 million, or approximately 6% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting an annualized growth in subscription-based platform revenue of approximately 27% prior to the previously discussed three (3) principal negative impacts to the Company’s revenue. Number one, was the ACA-related decisions by health plan clients expected to have a negative impact of approximately 8% on Inovalon’s growth rate in 2018 (predominantly in the first half of the year). The impact of this factor in Q1 was approximately $9.3 million. Number two, was the ongoing conversion of remaining legacy solutions to subscription-based platform offerings. The impact of this factor in Q1 was $5.6 million in executed contracts, and an additional $4.2 million in contracts expected to convert as of the end of the quarter (and which have converted since the completion of the quarter). This conversion process is now ahead of schedule for the year, resulting in the legacy solution revenue contribution to the quarter being only 11% (from 20% in Q4 of 2017). Number three, was the ordinary client churn of approximately $5.3 million, an amount which is within the expected range of client churn for the Company during the first quarter of a year.\nb. First quarter 2018 gross margin of 63.9% compares to 64.7% in the first quarter of 2017, a decline of 80 basis points despite the significant impacts on revenue discussed above, reveals the continued progression of significant benefits being achieved through connectivity and automation. Gross margin is expected to expand significantly to approximately 70% during 2018 from the Company’s expanding use of connectivity, automation, product price mix, and the combination with ABILITY.\nc. General and administrative (G&A) overhead expenses of the Company rose to $49.4 million during Q1 of 2018 in comparison to $35.8 million in Q1 of 2017. As detailed on slide #20 of our First Quarter 2018 Earnings Presentation Supplement, however, the increase was driven by $4.8 million in non-comparable items that do not otherwise relate to Inovalon’s ongoing performance, $4.4 million in acquired G&A associated with the CCS acquisition in October of 2017, and $4.3 million in combined employee-related and professional fees associated with the Inovalon ONE™ Platform development, launch, and associated data center expansions. Additionally, certain G&A expense synergies were implemented and achieved in Q1 2018 reducing expenses by approximately $2.5 million on average per quarter going forward. Normalized for the aforementioned non-comparable one-time expenses, Inovalon’s quarterly G&A expense is expected to decline to a range between $40 million and $44 million per quarter during the three remaining quarters of 2018 excluding G&A related to the acquisition of ABILITY, and between $49 million and $53 million including ABILITY.\nd. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company began the accelerated development and infrastructure expansion to enable the launch of the Inovalon ONE™ Platform. This initiative was further expanded with commitments to programs such as the aforementioned ScriptMed™ Cloud launch which was initiated during the summer of 2017. These investments by the Company have significantly expanded the Company’s capital expenditures from the annual average of 6% of revenue seen historically (e.g., 2013, 2014, and 2015) to the higher levels seen in 2016 and 2017 (i.e., 9% of revenue in 2016 and 15% in 2017). These investments enabled not only advanced proprietary software development, but also the build-out of high-capacity, sophisticated private cloud data centers. With significant functionality and capacity now in place, the Company sees the rate of capital expenditures now receding back towards historical levels, with capital expenditures in 2018 projected to be between 8% and 9% of revenue, inclusive of ABILITY.\nOther Financial Data and Key Metrics\nThe following constitute other financial and key metrics which are presented quarterly.\nGrowth of Datasets: At March 31, 2018, the MORE 2 Registry ® dataset contained more than 243 million unique patient counts and nearly 38.8 billion medical event counts, increases of 54% and 177%, respectively, compared with March 31, 2017.\nInvestment in Innovation: For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Inovalon’s ongoing investment supporting innovations in advanced, cloud-based platforms empowering a data-driven transformation from volume-based to value-based models was $25.5 million, or 27% of revenue, an increase of $7.8 million, or 44%, compared to the prior year period.\nAnalytical Process Count Growth: Inovalon’s trailing 12-month Patient Analytics Months (PAM) count, which the Company believes is indicative of the Company’s overall level of analytical activity, grew to 45.2 billion as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 60% as compared with March 31, 2017.\nPlease see the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for further detail regarding the preceding other financial data and key metrics.\nShares Outstanding\nAs of April 30, 2018, the Company had 71.7 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 80.6 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nInovalon is reaffirming full-year 2018 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance previously provided by the Company on March 7, 2018 while updating metrics impacted by acquisition-financing interest expenses. Following the completion of the debt financing associated with the acquisition of ABILITY, and the implementation of certain interest rate swap transactions to achieve a fixed interest rate on certain amounts of the Company’s outstanding debt ($600 million of the Company’s $980 million as of May 8, 2018), the Company is updating guidance regarding net (loss)/income, Non-GAAP net income, diluted net (loss)/income per share, and Non-GAAP diluted net income per share guidance to reflect updated expected interest expense. Guidance includes the benefit of the ABILITY acquisition that closed on April 2, 2018.\nFinancial Metric Updated Guidance Range\nProvided May 8, 2018 Previous Guidance Range\nProvided March 7, 2018 Revenue $568 million to $593 million $568 million to $593 million Net (loss) income (1) ($13 million) to ($5 million) ($5 million) to $3 million Non-GAAP net income $46 million to $55 million $52 million to $61 million Adjusted EBITDA $163 million to $174 million $163 million to $174 million Net cash provided by operating activities $90 million to $100 million Non-GAAP net cash provided by operating activities $104 million to $115 million Capital expenditure (2) $50 million to $55 million Diluted net (loss) income per share ($0.09) to ($0.03) ($0.03) to $0.02 Non-GAAP diluted net income per share $0.32 to $0.38 $0.36 to $0.42 (1) GAAP net (loss)/income includes estimated: one-time transaction costs of $4.0 million, non-recurring integration costs of $7.5 million, and deal-related intangible asset amortization of $21.0 million using an estimated intangible asset useful life of 15 years (totaling approximately $32.5 million).\n(2) Capital expenditure is defined as the sum of purchases of property and equipment and investment in capitalized software.\nAdditional assumptions made within the Company's 2018 guidance are as follows:\nWhile changes in the stock price could change the fully diluted share count, under the treasury stock method, 2018 guidance assumes 146 million weighted average diluted shares.\n2018 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for the full year.\nReconciliations of net income, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income, and of net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Non-GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, identifying the differences between each of these Non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, are included in this press release after the consolidated financial statements.\nConference Call\nInovalon will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today.
