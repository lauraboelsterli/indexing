    "text": "May 15, 2018 / 11:22 AM / Updated 11 minutes ago UK's Johnson: we should not pursue regime change in Iran Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said regime change in Iran was not a policy Britain should pursue and that any change would not necessarily be for the better. Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson arrives in Downing Street, in London, May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\nJohnson made the comments in parliament on Tuesday in response to a question about whether he thought John Bolton, the U.S. National Security Advisor, was seeking regime change in Tehran.\n“I have to tell you that I do not believe that regime change in Tehran is the objective that we should be seeking,” Johnson said.\n“We might conceivably achieve regime change at some stage in the near future but I cannot with any confidence say that would be a change for the better because it seems equally plausible to me to imagine that Qasem Soleimani of the IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps) could put himself in a very good position to take over from Ayatollah Khamenei for instance.” Reporting by Estelle Shirbon and Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison",
