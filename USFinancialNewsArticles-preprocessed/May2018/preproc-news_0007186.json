    "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - Norway will consider introducing a tax on fish farmers because of their use of the country’s national resources, the finance ministry said.\nFish farms, which mainly raise salmon and rainbow trout, tend to be located in deepwater fjords along the country’s coast.\nThe industry is Norway’s second-largest export industry after oil and gas production, with sales of 63.7 billion crowns ($8.0 billion) in 2016, according to Statistics Norway.\n“The government will ... study and possibly recommend a tax on the use of natural resources to be introduced in 2020,” the finance ministry said in a statement late on Friday. “Such a tax is under consideration without a detailed plan yet ready.”\nLeading Norwegian producers include Marine Harvest, Salmar, Leroy Seafood, Grieg Seafood and Norway Royal Salmon.\n($1 = 7.9565 Norwegian crowns)\nReporting by Camilla Knudsen and Gwladys Fouche; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ",
