    "text": "BEIJING, May 16 (Reuters) - China’s new home prices rose 0.5 percent in April from a month earlier, compared with an increase of 0.4 percent in March, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data published on Wednesday.\nCompared with a year earlier, average new home prices in China’s 70 major cities increased 4.7 percent, slowing from a 4.9 percent gain in March.\nChina has rolled out property cooling measures in more than 100 cities since 2016, as the country aims to contain property bubbles while ensuring a soft landing in the economy.
