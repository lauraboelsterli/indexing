    "text": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BookJane Inc. (\"BookJane\") today announces that Pacific Reach Properties Ltd. (“Pacific Reach”), a Vancouver-based private investment fund, has made an investment in BookJane. With the investment, Pacific Reach is appointing Zahra Salisbury to join BookJane’s Board of Directors.\nBookJane, since its founding in 2016, has been committed to providing the highest quality caregivers to its 500 business clients from its 3000 and forever expanding pool of certified professional caregivers. Through use of its technologies, BookJane is able to deliver services at a level of efficiency that is unprecedented in the caregiver industry.\n“Our technologies differentiate us from other caregiver companies, but with our recent SaaS-based contract wins with Comfort Keepers and Amica, we believe we have an opportunity to really change the caregiver industry,” stated Curtis Khan, CEO and Founder of BookJane. “With this new investment from Pacific Reach, we can accelerate the development of a comprehensive technology-based solution that will dramatically improve how our business customers and the caregiver industry as a whole, can attract, retain and efficiently utilize their internal staff.”\nZahra Salisbury remarked, “Pacific Reach is very excited to be part of this journey with BookJane. We believe there is a critical need in the industry for their services and their technologies. Pacific Reach is proud to provide BookJane with the capital needed to accelerate their growth, but more importantly, help change an industry that is in need of innovation. I look forward to personally joining the Board and contribute in any way I can.”\n“We are very fortunate to have Zahra join our Board. Her background and relationships in the senior housing industry has already provided us with a number of new opportunities and I believe this is only the start of what she will bring to our organization,” Khan added.\nSalisbury is part of the Jamal Family that founded Retirement Concepts Senior Services and sold it in 2017 after more than 30 years in the seniors housing industry. Pacific Reach is the Jamal Family’s new company with an emphasis on hospitality and multi-family housing; however, the company does make strategic investments in select early stage companies including BookJane and Maple. Salisbury holds a Master of Science degree in Health Policy and Management from Harvard University, and has previously worked for McKinsey & Company, the World Health Organization, GrowthWorks Capital and Ernst & Young Corporate Finance.\nAbout BookJane Inc.\nBookJane is a visionary startup that through the use of its technologies, is addressing the inefficiencies in finding certified caregiver professionals when needed. Initially developed for internal use, BookJane’s technologies is now being deployed as a SaaS platform for business customers’ internal use in the United States and Canada. With the investment commitment from Pacific Reach, BookJane just completed their Angel Financing round.\nAbout Pacific Reach Properties Ltd.\nBuilding on more than two decades of real estate experience, Pacific Reach Properties acquires, improves and professionally manages multi-family and commercial properties throughout North America while maximizing tenant experience and investment returns.\nFor more information on BookJane, please visit www.bookjane.com\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180524006170/en/\nBookJane Inc.\nCurtis Khan, 416-352-8636\nCurtis@bookjane.com\nSource: BookJane Inc.",
