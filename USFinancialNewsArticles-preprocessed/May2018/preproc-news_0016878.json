First quarter GAAP operating income of $0.09 million, or 0.3% of revenues; non-GAAP operating income of $1.7 million, or 5.5% of revenues. First quarter GAAP net income of $565 thousand, or $0.02 per diluted share; non-GAAP net income of $2.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Newly introduced Avalanche HD system and upgrade sales ahead of expectations; received significant orders from existing and new customers.\nROSH-HA`AYIN, Israel, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kornit Digital Ltd. (NASDAQ:KRNT), a leading provider of digital printing solutions for the global printed textile industry, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP figures in today’s press release are presented using a different methodology compared to previous periods as a result of comments from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. These changes also impact the Company's guidance methodology.\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $31.1 million, which represents a 14.8% increase compared to the prior year period of $27.1 million. The non-cash impact of the warrants deducted from the revenues was $42 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $938 thousand in the first quarter of 2017. Higher revenue in the quarter was attributable to growth in both Products and Services.\nGAAP net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $565 thousand, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss of $(1.7) million, or $(0.05) per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis net income was $2.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to prior-year non-GAAP net loss of $(547) thousand, or $(0.02) per diluted share.\nGabi Seligsohn, Kornit Digital’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “We are pleased to report an exceptionally strong start to the year, with sales and operating margins both ahead of our expected guidance range. Growth in the quarter was broad based and included a diversity of customers and product categories, led by faster-than-expected customer adoption of Avalanche HD systems and upgrades, which exceeded $5 million in orders in the first quarter. We are also very pleased to report that to date in the second quarter, we have received orders for an additional $10 million of Avalanche HD systems and upgrades. As we look to the balance of the year, we are poised for our momentum to continue, supported by the launch of the Storm HD6 and a large-scale customer program, which is resuming deliveries in the second quarter.”\nFirst Quarter Results of Operations\nKornit reported first quarter revenues, net of the non-cash impact of warrants, of $31.1 million, compared with the prior-year period level of $27.1 million. The total non-cash impact of the warrants deducted from revenues was $42 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 and $938 thousand in the first quarter of 2017. Higher revenue in the quarter was attributable to growth in both Products and Services, in particular, strong adoption of the Avalanche HD6 and upgrades.\nOn a GAAP basis, first quarter gross profit was $15.4 million, compared with $11.9 million, in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP gross profit in the first quarter was $15.6 million, or 50.0% of revenues compared with $12.1 million, or 44.5% gross margin in the first quarter of 2017. Higher gross margins primarily reflected a favorable product mix compares to first Quarter of 2017 and an increase in system's upgrade revenues.\nOn a GAAP basis, total operating expenses in the first quarter were $15.3 million, compared to $13.2 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter increased to $13.9 million, or 44.5% of revenues, compared to $12.0 million, or 44.2% of revenues in the prior year period. The increase in total operating expenses was consistent with the previously stated growth strategy, as the Company continues to execute to its global infrastructure build out and was specifically impacted by costs associated with increased headcount expenses.\nFirst quarter GAAP research and development expenses were $5.3 million, compared to the prior-year period of $4.8 million.

First quarter non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses were $5.4 million, or 17.3% of revenues, compared to $4.9 million, or 18.2% of revenues in the prior-year period.\nFirst quarter GAAP general and administrative expenses were $4.0 million, compared to the prior-year period of $2.8 million. First quarter non-GAAP general and administrative expenses were $3.4 million, or 10.8% of revenues, compared to $2.4 million, or 8.8% of revenues in the prior-year period.\nOn a GAAP basis, first quarter operating income was $92 thousand, compared to the prior year period operating loss of $(1.3) million. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter increased to $1.7 million, compared to $94 thousand in the prior year period.
