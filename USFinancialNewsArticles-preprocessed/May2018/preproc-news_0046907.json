Countries such as Germany, 840,319 people above the age of 65 consulted a general physician. Hypertension was the most common cause of these visits. Stroke was the least common cause. More than one out of two people who visited a general physician had three chronic diseases.\nAccording to a senior analyst at Technavio for cardiovascular diseases , “The sedentary lifestyle and changing eating habits of people make susceptible to chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, arthritis, and chronic pain such as low back pain and knee pain. According to research analysis, majority of the people with chronic pain have pain in different areas. In countries such as the US, the most common types of pain among adults is low back pain, knee pain, shoulder pain, finger pain, and hip pain. Radiofrequency ablation devices are used to treat these chronic diseases. Hence, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the growth of the geriatric population will drive the growth of the global radiofrequency ablation devices market.”\nLooking for more information on this market?
