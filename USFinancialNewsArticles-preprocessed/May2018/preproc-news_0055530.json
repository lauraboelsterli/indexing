    "text": "0 COMMENTS Asia-Pacific stock markets were largely lower Tuesday following declines in Europe the previous day. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index declined 1.1% by midday on the back of a strengthening yen, and benchmarks in Hong Kong and South Korea fell less than 1%. Most Southeast Asian markets were closed for a local holiday. The 10-year Treasury yield on Tuesday fell to session lows of 2.88%.\nTuesday’s Big Theme Energy stocks continued to fall, though declines were less than what was seen Monday following an end-of-week fall in oil prices. The potential for higher output after major producers agreed to production caps abruptly cooled what’s been one of the hottest markets this year. Oil stocks, which had seen similar rallies, also reversed over the past week.\nWhat’s Happening Investors had wondered how high oil prices could climb, after they hit a three-and-a-half-year high of $80 a barrel on Wednesday. But the Brent international benchmark made a sharp U-turn last week, pulling back a cumulative 5.6% through Monday. July futures were recently up 0.5% at $75.71 a barrel.\nOn Friday, Saudi Arabia and Russia hinted that it could be time to loosen the taps again. The U.S., which rounds out the world’s top oil producers, has repeatedly posted daily output records in recent months.\nAs the chart shows, oil’s weakness is hurting Asian energy stocks. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Benchmark Index on Monday closed at its lowest level this month. The country’s energy sub-index, which hit a three-year high early last week, then pulled back 7.3% before rebounding 0.1% on Tuesday.\nChina’s major offshore oil producer, CNOOC Ltd., on Tuesday fell a further 1.5% to put its five-day decline at 12%. Fellow state-controlled Sinopec has slid 11%.\nMarket Reaction A “combination of building U.S. oil inventories and perceptions of OPEC readying to turn on the taps” has sent oil prices lower, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. “While lower oil prices may eventually fuel corporate profits the initial hit to the industrial outlook is dragging on stock markets.”\nInvestors in Asia “will be looking at the recent decline in oil prices and U.S. bond yields for signs whether the recent market pressure on emerging markets [will] ease,” said Tai Hui, J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Asia-Pacific chief strategist.\nElsewhere The dollar rose in Asian trade as cautious investors sold emerging market currencies, which are often viewed as riskier. The Aussie and New Zealand dollars were each hit, while Japan’s yen rallied 0.3% against other major currencies. Their moves came as the euro slipped against the dollar, as elections loom in Italy.\nWrite to Joanne Chiu at joanne.chiu@wsj.com",
