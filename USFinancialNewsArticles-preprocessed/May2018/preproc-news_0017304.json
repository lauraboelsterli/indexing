(NYSE:KAMN) today reported financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2018.\nTable 1. Summary of Financial Results (unaudited) In thousands except per share amounts For the Three Months Ended March 30,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange Net sales: Distribution $ 283,932 $ 271,618 $ 12,314 Aerospace 179,395 164,323 15,072 Net sales $ 463,327 $ 435,941 $ 27,386 Operating income: Distribution $ 11,834 $ 11,416 $ 418 % of sales 4.2 % 4.2 % — % Aerospace 22,662 16,030 6,632 % of sales 12.6 % 9.8 % 2.8 % Net gain on sale of assets 63 20 43 Corporate expense (13,835 ) (13,977 ) 142 Operating income $ 20,724 $ 13,489 $ 7,235 Adjusted EBITDA*: Net earnings $ 14,066 $ 6,291 $ 7,775 Adjustments 22,041 18,673 3,368 Adjusted EBITDA* $ 36,107 $ 24,964 $ 11,143 % of sales 7.8 % 5.7 % 2.1 % Earnings per share: Diluted earnings per share $ 0.50 $ 0.22 $ 0.28 Adjustments 0.05 — 0.05 Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share* $ 0.55 $ 0.22 $ 0.33 Neal J. Keating, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our results for the first quarter demonstrate continued momentum. At Distribution, our efforts to improve sales trends showed progress as Organic Sales per Sales Day* increased 4.5% over the prior year. As we normally experience, certain employee related costs disproportionately impacted Distribution's first quarter results. In addition, we incurred costs associated with the onboarding of several new national accounts and we expect the benefit from these new customers to ramp up over the next three quarters. We will continue to focus on balancing sales growth and operating margin expansion to drive improvement throughout the year.\n“Aerospace delivered strong performance in the quarter, and as of the end of the quarter backlog is in excess of $800 million. Demand for the Joint Programmable Fuze from both the US and foreign governments remains strong and we are working on a number of significant new opportunities. In addition, we anticipate continued sales growth in our specialty bearings and engineered products area as the year progresses, continuing a trend that has developed over the past several years. And in 2018 we will open a new state of the art test facility that will enable us to reduce our time to market for new products, while allowing our engineers to design and test new products for next generation applications and platforms.\n“Finally, we are redeploying a portion of the benefit from tax reform to make additional investments in our business and our people. First, our outlook for capital expenditures of $35.0 million will allow us to improve our operations and expand production capacity. Second, we are investing in our people, by contributing an additional $10.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan and offering $2.6 million in one-time employee incentives.\"\nChief Financial Officer Robert D. Starr commented, \"In the first quarter of 2018, we delivered operating cash flows of $56.9 million, leading to Free Cash Flow* of $50.5 million. This level of cash flow generation provides us confidence in our forecast for the year and allowed us to reduce our debt to capitalization ratio to 35.2%. We are well positioned to execute on our strategic initiatives, with a focus on investing in engineered product offerings.\n“First quarter performance was slightly ahead of expectations as we delivered diluted earnings per share of $0.50, or $0.55 adjusted*, on sales of $463.3 million, as measured under the new revenue standard. Our top line performance benefited from our second straight quarter of organic growth at Distribution, higher JPF DCS deliveries and revenue recognized on Option 13 of our JPF USG contract as we made progress toward meeting our scheduled delivery requirements later this year. The adoption of the new standard increased operating income in the first quarter by $9.7 million, while the reduction in our corporate tax rate and the benefit from our pension plan also contributed to the significant year over year net earnings growth.\n“Looking more closely at the impact from the adoption of the new standard, Distribution was not significantly impacted; however, we experienced a more meaningful impact at Aerospace. The new standard changed the accounting for a number of our Aerospace contracts, with the largest impact to our results from our JPF and K-MAX® contracts. As a reminder, we prepared our 2018 outlook under the new standard which shifts the timing of revenue recognized on our contracts, but does not change the total amount of revenue we anticipate or the timing of cash receipts or payments associated with our contracts.\n“Finally, based on first quarter performance, we are increasing our expectations for 2018. We now expect sales at Distribution to be $10.0 million higher than our prior outlook, in the range of $1.11 billion to $1.16 billion. Additionally, we have finalized the assumptions associated with our pension and now expect the income associated with the plan for 2018 to increase by $1.0 million to $12.5 million. All other components of our prior outlook remain unchanged, with approximately 70% of our earnings expected in the second half of the year. I want to highlight that our expectations for core operational cash flow and profit performance have increased, allowing us to more than offset the impacts from the one-time employee incentive and the additional $10.0 million discretionary pension contribution.\"\n2018 Outlook\nOur revised 2018 outlook is as follows:\nDistribution: Sales of $1,110.0 million to $1,160.0 million Operating margins of 5.1% to 5.4% Depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $15.0 million Aerospace: Sales of $750.0 million to $780.0 million Operating margins of 15.5% to 16.0%, or 16.2% to 16.7% when adjusted* for approximately $5.5 million in anticipated restructuring and transition costs Depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $24.0 million Interest expense of approximately $20.0 million Corporate expenses of approximately $59.0 million Net periodic pension benefit of approximately $12.5 million Estimated annualized tax rate in the range of approximately 25.5% to 26.5% Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $43.0 million Capital expenditures of approximately $35.0 million Cash flows from operations in the range of $185.0 million to $210.0 million; Free Cash Flow* in the range of $150.0 million to $175.0 million Weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 28.0 million\nPlease see the MD&A section of the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission concurrently with the issuance of this release for greater detail on our results and various company programs.\nA conference call has been scheduled for tomorrow, May 8, 2018, at 8:30 AM ET.

The Company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Other companies may define the measures differently. We define the Non-GAAP measures used in this release and other disclosures as follows:\nOrganic Sales - Organic Sales is defined as \"Net Sales\" less sales derived from acquisitions completed during the preceding twelve months. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, which can obscure underlying trends. We also believe that presenting Organic Sales separately for our segments provides management and investors with useful information about the trends impacting our segments and enables a more direct comparison to other businesses and companies in similar industries. Management recognizes that the term \"Organic Sales\" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. No other adjustments were made during the three-month fiscal periods ended March 30, 2018 and March 31, 2017. The following table illustrates the calculation of Organic Sales using the GAAP measure, \"Net Sales.\"\nTable 4. Organic Sales (in thousands) (unaudited) For the Three Months Ended March 30,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nDistribution Net sales $ 283,932 $ 271,618 Acquisition Sales — — Organic Sales $ 283,932 $ 271,618 Aerospace Net sales 179,395 164,323 Acquisition Sales — — Organic Sales $ 179,395 $ 164,323 Consolidated Net sales $ 463,327 $ 435,941 Acquisition Sales — — Organic Sales $ 463,327 $ 435,941 Organic Sales per Sales Day - Organic Sales per Sales Day is defined as GAAP \"Net sales of the Distribution segment\" less sales derived from acquisitions completed during the preceding twelve months divided by the number of Sales Days in a given period. Sales days (\"Sales Days\") are the days that the Distribution segment's branch locations were open for business and exclude weekends and holidays. Management believes Organic Sales per Sales Day provides an important perspective on how net sales may be impacted by the number of days the segment is open for business and provides a basis for comparing periods in which the number of Sales Days differs.\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of Organic Sales per Sales Day using “Net sales: Distribution” from the “Segment and Geographic Information” footnote in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7, 2018.\nTable 5. Distribution - Organic Sales Per Sales Day (in thousands, except days) (unaudited) For the Three Months Ended March 30,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nCurrent period Net sales $ 283,932 $ 271,618 Sales days 64 64 Organic Sales per Sales Day for the current period a $ 4,436 $ 4,244 Prior period Net sales from the prior year $ 271,618 $ 288,664 Sales days from the prior year 64 65 Organic Sales per sales day from the prior year b $ 4,244 $ 4,441 % change (a-b)÷b 4.5 % (4.4 )% Table 6.

Adjusted EBITDA differs from net earnings, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, in that it excludes interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, other expense (income), net and certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company's segments or corporate function for the period presented. We have made numerous investments in our business, such as acquisitions and capital expenditures, including facility improvements, new machinery and equipment, improvements to our information technology infrastructure and new ERP systems, which we have adjusted for in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA also does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect funds available for distributions, reinvestments or other discretionary uses. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional perspective on the operating results of the organization and its earnings capacity and helps improve the comparability of our results between periods because it provides a view of our operations that excludes items that management believes are not reflective of operating performance, such as items traditionally removed from net earnings in the calculation of EBITDA as well as Other expense (income), net and certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company's segments or corporate function for the period presented. Adjusted EBITDA is not presented as an alternative measure of operating performance, as determined in accordance with GAAP. No other adjustments were made during the three-month fiscal periods ended March 30, 2018 and March 31, 2017. The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA using GAAP measures:\nTable 7. Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) (unaudited) For the Three Months Ended March 30,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nAdjusted EBITDA Consolidated Results Sales $ 463,327 $ 435,941 Net earnings $ 14,066 $ 6,291 Interest expense, net 5,352 4,160 Income tax expense 4,677 3,916 Other expense (income), net (342 ) (159 ) Depreciation and amortization 10,661 10,756 Other Adjustments: Restructuring and severance costs 1,693 — Adjustments $ 22,041 $ 18,673 Adjusted EBITDA $ 36,107 $ 24,964 Adjusted EBITDA margin 7.8 % 5.7 % Free Cash Flow - Free Cash Flow is defined as GAAP “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” in a period less “Expenditures for property, plant & equipment” in the same period. Management believes Free Cash Flow provides an important perspective on our ability to generate cash from our business operations and, as such, that it is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free Cash Flow should not be viewed as representing the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures such as dividends to shareholders or acquisitions, as it may exclude certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt and other contractual obligations. Management uses Free Cash Flow internally to assess overall liquidity. The following table illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow using “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” and “Expenditures for property, plant & equipment”, GAAP measures from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this release.\nTable 8. Free Cash Flow (in thousands) (unaudited) For the Three\nMonths Ended\nMarch 30,\n2018\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $\n56,913\nExpenditures for property, plant & equipment\n(6,422\n) Free Cash Flow $\n50,491 Table 9.

Debt is defined as GAAP “Current portion of long-term debt” plus “Long-term debt, excluding current portion”. Capitalization is defined as Debt plus GAAP “Total shareholders' equity”. Management believes that Debt to Capitalization Ratio is a measurement of financial leverage and provides an insight into the financial structure of the Company and its financial strength. The following table illustrates the calculation of Debt to Capitalization Ratio using GAAP measures from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this release.\nTable 10. Debt to Capitalization Ratio (in thousands) (unaudited) March 30,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ 7,500 $ 7,500 Long-term debt, excluding current portion, net of debt issuance costs 341,591 391,651 Debt $ 349,091 $ 399,151 Total shareholders' equity 642,329 635,656 Capitalization $ 991,420 $ 1,034,807 Debt to Capitalization Ratio 35.2 % 38.6 % Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share - Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share are defined as GAAP \"Net earnings\" and \"Diluted earnings per share\", less items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the business for the periods presented. These items are included in the reconciliation below. Management uses Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess its performance relative to its competitors. We believe that this information is useful for investors and financial institutions seeking to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance.\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share using “Net earnings” and “Diluted earnings per share” from the “Consolidated Statements of Operations” included in the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7, 2018.\nTable 11.

Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income, less items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company's segments or corporate function for the period presented. These items are included in the reconciliation below. Management uses Adjusted Net Sales and Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze underlying trends in our segments and corporate function and to assess their performance relative to their competitors. We believe that this information is useful for investors and financial institutions seeking to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance. The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted Operating Income using information found in Note 16, Segment and Geographic Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7, 2018.\nTable 12.
