    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Technical Institute, Inc. (NYSE: UTI), the leading provider of transportation technician training, reported financial results for the fiscal 2018 second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKim McWaters, UTI's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"In the second quarter of 2018, we demonstrated good traction on leading indicators for our business, as we generated a greater number of higher converting inquiries and increased enrollment applications by seven percent as compared to 2017. We are now in the initial implementation phases of the Transformation Plan announced in March and expect to see a positive impact on our operational results starting in the fourth quarter. We remain on track to open our third metro campus in Bloomfield, NJ, and community, employer and prospective student response has been overwhelmingly positive. Both the Transformation Plan and our new campus represent significant investment in the long-term profitable growth of UTI, with positive financial benefits beginning in fiscal 2019.\"\nFinancial Results for the Three-Month Period Ended March 31: 2018 Compared to 2017\nRevenues for the quarter were $80.7 million, compared to $82.5 million for the prior year period. The year-over-year revenue variance was primarily attributable to a 4.4% decrease in UTI's average student population. Operating expenses for the quarter were $89.5 million, compared to $81.8 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to planned increases in compensation costs, which were largely a result of our graduate-based compensation program for our admissions representatives, contract services, and advertising expense; these increases were all aligned with our previously announced strategic growth transformation. Operating loss for the quarter was $8.8 million compared to operating income of $0.7 million for the prior year period. Net loss for the quarter was $8.8 million, compared to $1.7 million for the prior year period. Loss available for distribution to common shareholders was $10.1 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $3.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share for the prior year period. Earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $(4.0) million, compared to $5.6 million for the prior year period. (See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" below.)\nFinancial Results for the Six-Month Period Ended March 31: 2018 Compared to 2017\nRevenues were $161.8 million, compared to $166.7 million for the prior year period. The year-over-year revenue variance was attributable to a 5.2% decrease in UTI's average student population. Operating expenses were $174.2 million, compared to $164.6 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to planned increases in contract services, advertising, graduate based admissions compensation, and professional accounting service expenses. Operating loss was $12.4 million compared to operating income of $2.1 million for the prior year period. Income tax benefit was $2.9 million, compared to an income tax expense of $4.8 million for the prior year period. The current period benefit was primarily a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, as well as the loss before taxes during the quarter. Net loss was $10.0 million, compared to $3.5 million for the prior year period. Loss available for distribution to common shareholders was $12.6 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $6.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share for the prior year period. Earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was $(3.2) million, compared to $11.9 million for the prior year period. (See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" below.) Our early adoption of the new accounting standard on revenue recognition resulted in a non-cash increase to equity of approximately $37.2 million as of October 1, 2017.\nStudent Metrics\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nSix Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nTotal starts\n1,819\n1,869\n3,135\n3,249\nAverage undergraduate full-time student enrollment\n10,394\n10,876\n10,823\n11,420\nEnd of period undergraduate full-time student enrollment\n10,005\n10,261\n10,005\n10,261\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nStudent starts are still expected to grow in the low-single digits.

Management chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because they provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the results from operations and helps to identify underlying trends. Additionally, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods. Management also utilizes EBITDA as a performance measure internally. To obtain a complete understanding of the Company's performance these measures should be examined in connection with net income (loss), determined in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the financial statements and notes thereto included in the annual and quarterly filings with the . Since the items excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under GAAP, these measures should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of the Company's operating performance or profitability. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than UTI does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included below.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nAll statements contained herein, other than statements of historical fact, are \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
