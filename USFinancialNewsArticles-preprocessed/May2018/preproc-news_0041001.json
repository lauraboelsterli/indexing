    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 11:46 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago U.S. meets China's Liu He - CCTV Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who is leading a trade delegation in Washington, has met U.S. , state broadcaster China Central Television said on Friday. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He attends the news conference following the closing session of the National People's Congress (NPC), at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee\nA second round of talks between senior Trump administration officials and their Chinese counterparts started at the U.S. Treasury on Thursday morning, focussed on cutting China’s U.S. trade surplus and improving intellectual property protections.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders had earlier said Trump would meet Liu later on Thursday.\nTrump has threatened to impose tariffs on goods worth up to $150 billion to combat what he says is Beijing’s misappropriation of U.S. technology through joint venture requirements and other policies.\nBeijing has threatened equal retaliation, including tariffs on some of its largest U.S. imports, including aircraft, soybeans and autos.
