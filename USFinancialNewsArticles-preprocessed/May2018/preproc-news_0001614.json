On a trailing twelve-month basis, non-GAAP operating 1 return on average equity excluding average AOCI 1 was 14.6% based upon reported results and 13.5% excluding both the impact of assumption revisions and losses on extinguishment of debt.\nPOLICYHOLDER FUNDS UNDER MANAGEMENT UP 1.5% ON $1.0 BILLION OF SALES\nPolicyholder funds under management at March 31, 2018 were $49.1 billion, a $747 million or 1.5% increase from December 31, 2017. First quarter sales were $1.0 billion before coinsurance ceded and $941 million after coinsurance ceded. Gross sales and net sales for the quarter were down 4.5% and 6.6%, respectively, from first quarter 2017 sales. However, on a sequential basis, gross and net sales increased 2.2% and 6.6%, respectively.\nTotal sales by independent agents for American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company increased 9.5% sequentially while total sales by broker-dealers and banks for Eagle Life Insurance Company fell by $52 million or 23.7% sequentially, in part due to a $25 million decline in sales of non-core multi-year fixed rate annuities. Sales of fixed index annuities (FIAs) were up 5.2% sequentially to $994 million driven by the gain in sales for American Equity Life.\nCommenting on sales, John Matovina, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: \"We are pleased with another sequential increase in FIA sales and the momentum we have in sales by American Equity Life's independent agents. Sales in that channel appear to have bottomed in the third quarter of last year. FIA sales for Eagle Life of $161 million were down $27 million or 14.5% sequentially but still got our year off to a good start and were 83% higher than Eagle Life's 2017 first quarter FIA sales.\"\nCommenting on the market environment and the outlook for FIA sales, Matovina added: \"The market in each of our distribution channels remains competitive. Despite the increase in equity market volatility since early February, a number of competitors raised rates and guaranteed income. However, the changes we made to our products in September and October of last year kept us in good stead, and we continue to be in a strong competitive position for guaranteed income, caps and participation rates.\"\nMatovina continued: \"In March, we introduced our new IncomeShield series of fixed index annuity products. IncomeShield was designed to allow policyholders to tailor their lifetime income benefit rider to their specific time horizons for guaranteed income. IncomeShield 10 is now our highest guaranteed income product. In addition, one version of the IncomeShield lifetime income benefit rider allows policyholders to begin receiving lifetime income payments 30 days after the policy is issued which is a new feature for us which enhances our competitive positioning in the guaranteed income segment of the market. Initial agent response to IncomeShield has been very positive. Just one month after its introduction, IncomeShield is accounting for more than 18% of American Equity Life's new applications. While some of this may be agents pivoting from one of our products to the new IncomeShield, there are also indications that we're picking up incremental sales from agents who have returned to selling American Equity products.\"\nINVESTMENT SPREAD DECLINES LARGELY ON NON-TRENDABLE ITEMS; OUTLOOK FOR INVESTMENT YIELD MORE FAVORABLE; RENEWAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS TO MITIGATE IMPACT OF RISING OPTION COSTS\nAmerican Equity’s investment spread was 2.54% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2.75% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2.71% for the first quarter of 2017. On a sequential basis, the average yield on invested assets decreased by eleven basis points while the cost of money rose ten basis points.\nAverage yield on invested assets fell to 4.36% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.47% for the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily reflecting a decrease in the benefit from fee income from bond transactions and prepayment income to three basis points in the first quarter of 2018 from eleven basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017. The average yield on fixed income securities purchased and commercial mortgage loans funded in the first quarter of 2018 was 4.43% compared to 4.27% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe aggregate cost of money for annuity liabilities of 1.82% in the first quarter of 2018 was up ten basis points from 1.72% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The benefit from over hedging index linked interest obligations was two basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to eight basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCommenting on investment spread, Matovina said: “Two thirds of the first quarter's sequential decline in investment spread was attributable to a fourteen basis point decrease in the benefit from non-trendable items including fee income from bond transactions, prepayment income and over-hedging. Our investment spread was also under pressure in the first quarter of 2018 in part due to the escalation of option costs for certain index strategies in the latter half of 2017 that is recognized in the cost of money ratably over the twelve month option period. To counteract this impact, we began reducing caps on the monthly point to point index strategy in March and will be expanding the universe of policies subject to monthly point to point cap reductions later this quarter. We have flexibility to reduce our crediting rates and could decrease our cost of money by approximately 0.54% through further reductions in renewal rates to guaranteed minimums should the cost of money not return to acceptable levels.\"\nMatovina went on to say: \"Our investment spread should also benefit from the recent increases in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury rate and rates available to us on asset classes we have targeted for purchase. In addition to the uplift in investment yield on new purchases we've received from higher rates, we're also benefiting from the continued deployment of money into asset classes that were not traditionally in our portfolio including allocations to asset-backed securities. We're also positioned to benefit from further increases in short-term interest rates with 5% of our portfolio at March 31st in floating rate instruments. The prospect for higher investment yields is quite good and the trend of declining investment yields that has persisted for more than eight years is likely to end this year.\"\nCAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Non-GAAP operating income equals net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of items that fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a manner unrelated to core operations, and the Company believes measures excluding their impact are useful in analyzing operating trends. The most significant adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP operating income eliminate the impact of fair value accounting for the Company's fixed index annuity business. These adjustments are not economic in nature but rather impact the timing of reported results. The Company believes the combined presentation and evaluation of non-GAAP operating income together with net income provides information that may enhance an investor’s understanding of its underlying results and profitability.\nReconciliation from Net Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 140,962 $ 53,939 Adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP operating income: (a) Net realized investment (gains) losses, including OTTI 23 (1,942 ) Change in fair value of derivatives and embedded derivatives - fixed index annuities (78,818 ) 10,977 Change in fair value of derivatives - debt (1,832 ) (247 ) Income taxes 17,359 (3,105 ) Non-GAAP operating income $ 77,694 $ 59,622 Per common share - assuming dilution: Net income $ 1.55 $ 0.60 Adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP operating income: Net realized investment (gains) losses, including OTTI — (0.02 ) Change in fair value of derivatives and embedded derivatives - fixed index annuities (0.87 ) 0.12 Change in fair value of derivatives - debt (0.02 ) — Income taxes 0.19 (0.04 ) Non-GAAP operating income $ 0.85 $ 0.66 (a) Adjustments to net income to arrive at non-GAAP operating income are presented net of related adjustments to amortization of deferred sales inducements (DSI) and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) where applicable.\nAmerican Equity Investment Life Holding Company\nUnaudited (Dollars in thousands)\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAverage Stockholders' Equity and Return on Average Equity\nReturn on average equity measures how efficiently the Company generates profits from the resources provided by its net assets. Return on average equity is calculated by dividing net income and non-GAAP operating income for the trailing twelve months by average equity excluding average accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"). The Company excludes AOCI because AOCI fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to unrealized changes in the fair value of available for sale investments.\nTwelve Months Ended March 31, 2018 Average Stockholders' Equity Average equity including average AOCI $ 2,491,611 Average AOCI (412,263 ) Average equity excluding average AOCI $ 2,079,348 Net income $ 261,668 Non-GAAP operating income 303,122 Return on Average Equity Excluding Average AOCI Net income 12.58 % Non-GAAP operating income 14.58 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006491/en/\nAmerican Equity Investment Life Holding Company\nSteven D.
