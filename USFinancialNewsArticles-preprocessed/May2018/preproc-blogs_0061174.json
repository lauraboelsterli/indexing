    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s new government has promised to release a long-awaited report into the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 as a privately funded underwater search ended on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO: A woman leaves a message of support and hope for the passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 in central Kuala Lumpur March 16, 2014. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj/File Photo Flight MH370, carrying 239 people, vanished enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, becoming one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries.\nThe government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said last week that U.S. seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity, which had scoured the southern Indian Ocean for the aircraft since January, would end its hunt on Tuesday.\nThe previous administration of Najib Razak, who was defeated in a stunning election upset on May 9, had promised up to $70 million to the Texas-based firm if it found the plane within 90 days.\nMalaysia’s transport minister, Anthony Loke, said a full report into MH370’s disappearance would be published in the near future, but he did not give a date.\n“I can assure you the final report will be published with full disclosure. There will not be any edits, or anything hidden,” he told reporters late on Monday.\nAsked whether the report would refer to controversial elements of the MH370 case, he said: “To me, whatever elements, we will just publish it”.\nLast year, Australian authorities said the MH370 captain had flown a route on his home simulator six weeks before the disappearance that was “initially similar” to the course actually taken by the aircraft.\nFILE PHOTO: Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200ER with the registration number 9M-MRO flies over Poland February 5, 2014. The aircraft flying as MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, less than an hour into a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. REUTERS/Tomasz Bartkowiak/File Photo Peter Foley, who led the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s search efforts, told an Australian Senate hearing “control inputs” had been made to fly the airliner off course, but he could not say if one of the pilots had done so.\nMalaysian investigators said in 2015 they had found nothing suspicious in the financial, medical or personal histories of the pilots or crew. (GRAPHIC: The search for MH370: tmsnrt.rs/2L3ZZHo )\nFAMILIES CALL FOR REVIEW The decision to engage Ocean Infinity came after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($159 million) search across a 120,000 square-kilometer (46,332 square mile) expanse of the Indian Ocean last year.\nThis was despite investigators calling for the target area to be extended north by 25,000 square kilometers (9653 square miles).\nOcean Infinity CEO Oliver Plunkett said on Tuesday their team had searched more than 112,000 square kilometers (43,243 square miles) of ocean floor in a little over three months.\nSlideshow (4 Images) While the outcome was “extremely disappointing”, Plunkett hoped the company would be able to offer its services again in a future search for the airliner.\nAsked if China would consider further funding for the search, or whether search organizations had asked China for more resources, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had always maintained close communication with the relevant parties.\n“We will continue to maintain communication with relevant parties,” Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing in Beijing.\nVoice 370, a group representing the relatives of those aboard the flight, has pressed the new Malaysian government to review all matters related to MH370, including “any possible falsification or elimination of records related to MH370 and its maintenance”.\nCalvin Shim, whose wife was a crew member on the plane, said he was concerned that the accident report would not include key information such as the plane’s full cargo manifest and the results of a separate investigation by Malaysian police.\n“We know that this issue is already four years old and a lot of people involved want closure,” he said.\n“These four years have not been fun to us, the families.”\nAustralia’s Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said the search had tested the limits of technology and capacity of experts and people at sea.\nIt would only resume if there was “credible evidence which identifies a specific location of the missing aircraft”.\n“We will always remain hopeful that one day the aircraft will be located,” McCormack’s office said in a statement.\nThe only confirmed traces of the plane have been three wing fragments found washed up on Indian Ocean coasts.\nReporting by Rozanna Latiff; Additional reporting by Jamie Freed in SINGAPORE, Michael Martina in BEIJING and Colin Packham in SYDNEY; Editing by Darren Schuettler\n ",
