    "text": "CLEVELAND, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DATATRAK International, Inc. (OTC Markets: DTRK), a software-as-a-service provider and innovation leader of cloud-based technologies for the life sciences industry, today announced its operating results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFinancial Highlights:\nDATATRAK's revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1,754,000 compared to $1,952,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease of $198,000 was due to lower backlog levels caused by less sales volume in the previous year, which was partially offset by higher revenue from new contract sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Direct costs decreased by 10% during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to lower employee and clinical data management costs. The Company's gross margin was 80% for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. SG&A expenses decreased by $308,000, or 18%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The majority of the decrease was in legal expenses as the first quarter of 2017 included the settlement of litigation. The Company also saw a decrease in stock compensation due to recognition of stock grants in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with employment agreements. However, travel costs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to international sales travel. As a result of the items discussed, DATATRAK had a loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of ($112,000) compared to ($274,000) for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company's net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was ($110,000) compared ($315,000) for the first quarter of 2017.\nDATATRAK's backlog at March 31, 2018 was $18.4 million compared to a backlog of $18.9 million at December 31, 2017, which is a 3% decrease. Backlog consists of future value from authorization letters to commence services, statements of work, technology and services agreements, change orders and other customer contracts, billed and unbilled.\nAll contracts are subject to possible delays or cancellation or can change in scope in a positive or negative direction. Therefore, current backlog is not necessarily indicative of the Company's future quarterly or annual revenue. Historically, backlog has not always been an accurate predictor of the Company's short-term revenue.\nExecutive Highlights:\n2018 has been a year of exciting growth, not only in its product offering, but also in the global presence of DATATRAK ONE ® . \"For over two years, DATATRAK has been quietly expanding its footprint in the Chinese Life Sciences market. Through its partnership with NTT DATA, the DATATRAK ONE ® platform is now being used in over 21 studies across 19 Contract Research Organizations (CRO) and Sponsor companies,\" said Scott DeMell, VP Sales and Marketing, DATATRAK.\nThe China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has recently implemented new guidelines that encourage better developed and more efficient approaches to clinical trial design, conduct, oversight, recording and reporting while continuing to ensure human subject protection and the reliability of trial results. Standards regarding electronic records and essential documents intended to increase clinical trial quality and effectiveness have also been updated.\n\"The tighter guidelines by the CFDA have led to an increased demand by Chinese Pharma, Device, and CROs for global partners with full featured, regulatory compliant systems that can meet these requirements at a reasonable cost. We are very pleased with their response to our platform's capacity, scalability and affordability, which has the added bonus of being interfaced in simplified Chinese for ease of use. We are equally excited with our sales force expansion and client responses to the Sisense Business Intelligence and Analytics integration into our CTMS and EDC,\" said Jim Bob Ward, CEO, DATATRAK.\nAt the recent ChinaBio Partnering Forum in Suzhou, China, DATATRAK met with a number of Biotech, CRO, and Pharmaceutical companies. \"There was a growing consensus among the attendees for the need of better regulatory compliant systems to ensure patient safety, and to ensure regulatory standards are being met,\" said Scott DeMell, VP Sales and Marketing, DATATRAK. \"Opportunities are rapidly developing for a system like DATATRAK ONE ® that can help local companies better promote their products on a global level.\"\nDATATRAK's next major event in China will be exhibiting at the upcoming China Drug Information Association Annual Meeting in Beijing this May.\nJoin DATATRAK Thought Leaders:\nTwitter LinkedIn DATATRAK Resources\nTweet: DATATRAK Reports Results for First Quarter of 2018 https://bit.ly/2rr4WBZ\nAbout DATATRAK International, Inc.\nDATATRAK International is a software-as-a-service provider of enterprise cloud-based technologies for the life sciences industry.
