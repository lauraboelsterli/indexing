    "text": "-IMVEXXY’s applicator-free self-administration was developed with the woman in mind-\n-TherapeuticsMD will host a conference call at 8:00 AM EDT today-\nBOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TherapeuticsMD, Inc. (NASDAQ: TXMD), an innovative women’s healthcare company, today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved IMVEXXY (estradiol vaginal inserts) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia (vaginal pain associated with sexual activity), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause. IMVEXXY is the only product in its therapeutic class to offer a 4 mcg and 10 mcg dose, the 4 mcg representing the lowest approved dose of vaginal estradiol available.\n“IMVEXXY is a bio-identical vaginal estrogen product that offers a fraction of the estrogen contained in the average doses of many existing products currently on the market,” said Brian Bernick, MD, Chief Clinical Officer of TherapeuticsMD. “IMVEXXY is the only product specifically designed to be applicator-free. It dissolves completely without mess or additional clean-up, and can be used anytime of day. It allows women the freedom to immediately return to their normal daily activities. Studies showed that, in patients who used IMVEXXY, systemic absorption of estradiol remained within postmenopausal range.”\n“We are excited to bring IMVEXXY to market as TherapeuticsMD’s first FDA-approved drug as we strive to be the premier Women’s Health Company,” said Robert Finizio, Chief Executive Officer of TherapeuticsMD. “IMVEXXY reflects our long-standing corporate mission and commitment to health solutions that women want, based on the concepts of medical need, efficacy, safety, simplicity, and affordability. IMVEXXY will be offered at a price in parity with other products that have been on the market for 10 to 30 years. By ensuring patients can access IMVEXXY at an affordable price, TherapeuticsMD is doing the right thing for women.”\nAbout Dyspareunia and Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy (VVA)\nVVA is a component of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which may include, but is not limited to, genital symptoms of dryness, burning and irritation, sexual symptoms such as decreased lubrication, discomfort, and pain, and urinary symptoms such as urgency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections. 1 VVA is a chronic, progressive condition that leads to distressing symptoms and can progressively worsen if not treated. 2\nVVA is a condition that develops when the body makes less estrogen due to menopause. Without sufficient estrogen, the vaginal tissue becomes thin, dry, and less elastic. The vaginal canal can also narrow and shorten. Insufficient estrogen can also decrease vaginal fluids, change the acid balance of the vagina, and weaken pelvic floor muscles. All these factors can lead to dyspareunia. 2\nVVA affects an estimated 32 million postmenopausal women in the US. Only about seven percent (2.3 million) of these women receive prescription treatment. 3 Nearly 1 out of 2 women will experience pain during intercourse due to VVA at some point during their lives. 3\n“Studies have shown that many women are not seeking treatment for VVA and 81% are unaware that VVA is a treatable medical condition and part of a constellation of symptoms associated with loss of estrogens,\" said Dr. Sheryl Kingsberg, President, North American Menopause Society. \"I am delighted that our patients will now have a convenient treatment option with IMVEXXY and hope that the excitement generated by this new option will encourage women to talk to their healthcare provider and get relief from their pain and discomfort due to VVA.”\nIMVEXXY For the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Dyspareunia Due to Menopause\nImvexxy’s mechanism of action is the re-estrogenization of the tissue in and around the vagina. IMVEXXY’s distinctive formulation ensures that it dissolves completely without mess, so patients can use it any time of day by placing the softgel capsule in the lower part of the vagina to treat the vulva and vagina. IMVEXXY is administered daily for two weeks followed by only twice a week dosing. Nine out of 10 patients who participated in a clinical trial reported that IMVEXXY was “easy to use.” 4\nThe FDA approval of IMVEXXY is based on the results of a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of IMVEXXY (4 mcg and 10 mcg) compared to placebo from baseline to week 12. The study showed that IMVEXXY provided relief of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause as early as week 2 for both doses. 5 Statistically significant changes in vaginal cytology and pH were also observed. 5 A substudy of the REJOICE trial evaluated the pharmacokinetics of IMVEXXY 4 mcg, 10 mcg, and placebo. With both the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses, the mean concentration of estradiol and estrone remained within average postmenopausal range. 6 The results were published in the journal Menopause: The Journal of The North American Menopause Society. 5,6\nThe most common adverse reaction with IMVEXXY (incidence ≥3 percent) and greater than placebo was headache. There were no clinically significant differences in AEs observed between treatment and placebo groups. 5 Important safety information for IMVEXXY, including the boxed warning for endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disorders, breast cancer, and probable dementia, is provided below. The full prescribing information may be viewed by visiting www.imvexxy.com .\nTherapeuticsMD anticipates that IMVEXXY will be available for commercial distribution in July.\nAs part of the FDA’s approval, TherapeuticsMD has committed to conduct a post-approval observational study.\nConference Call Information\nTherapeuticsMD will host a conference call today to discuss the IMVEXXY approval. Details for the call are:\nDate: Wednesday, May 30, 2018 Time: 8:00 AM EDT Telephone Access (US): (866) 665-9531 Telephone Access (International): (724) 987-6977 Access Code for All Callers: 4757309 Additionally, a live webcast can be accessed on the company’s website, www.therapeuticsmd.com , on the Home Page or under the “Investors & Media” section. A digital recording of the conference call will be available for replay beginning two hours after the call's completion and for at least 30 days with the dial-in (855) 859-2056 or international (404) 537-3406 and Conference ID: 4757309.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nWARNING: ENDOMETRIAL CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, BREAST CANCER and PROBABLE DEMENTIA\nSee full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.\nEstrogen-Alone Therapy\n• There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens\n• Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia\n• The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n• The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older\nEstrogen Plus Progestin Therapy\n• Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia\n• The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of stroke, DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE) and myocardial infarction (MI)\n• The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of invasive breast cancer\n• The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nIMVEXXY™ is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions: undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; known, suspected, or history of breast cancer; known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia; active DVT, PE, or history of these conditions; active arterial thromboembolic disease or a history of these conditions; known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema to IMVEXXY; known liver impairment or disease; known protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency, or other known thrombophilic disorders.\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nIMVEXXY is intended only for vaginal administration. Systemic absorption may occur with the use of IMVEXXY. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin therapy has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown. Other warnings include: gallbladder disease; severe hypercalcemia, loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice. Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. Women on thyroid replacement therapy should have their thyroid function monitored.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe most common adverse reaction with IMVEXXY (incidence ≥ 3 percent) and greater than placebo was headache.\nPlease note that this information is not comprehensive.
