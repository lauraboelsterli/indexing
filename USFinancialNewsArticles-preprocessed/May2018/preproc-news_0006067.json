    "text": "MONTREAL, April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Maya Gold & Silver Inc. (“Maya” or the “Corporation”) (TSX-V:MYA) has released its audited condensed consolidated financial statements accompanied by the management's discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) for the year ending on December 31, 2017.\nThe documents have been filed electronically with SEDAR and will be available on the Corporation's website at www.mayagoldsilver.com .\nNoureddine Mokaddem, President & CEO of Maya stated, “The Corporation is pleased with the advances we have made in 2017. The drilling campaign produced exceptional drill results and the $10 million we invested in the research and development of our properties has already began to bear fruit with an extremely positive PEA on our Zgounder property previously announced in March. We were also able to increase our silver production in 2017 by 0.87% despite the fact that the Zgounder Mine’s water supply pipelines were washed out following unusually heavy rainfall for approximately two months. The exercise of 28,016,217 warrants in 2017 infused over $6.2 million of positive capital into the Corporation. Looking ahead, 2018 is an exciting year for Maya with the upcoming PEA on our Boumaâdine property and the increase in production at our Zgounder Mine to 500 t/day in Q3 2018, a slight delay due to unusual weather including snow and extreme cold. The current market cap of $211 million reflects positively on future prospects for Maya.”\nH ighlights of 2017\nTotal assets of $36,413,525 as of December 31, 2017; Working capital of $3,135,362 as of December 31, 2017 versus a negative working capital of $1,833,069 in 2016; Cash position $7,063,991 as of December 31, 2017 ; Closing of a $1.5 million non-brokered private placement of units in March 2017; Repayment at maturity of $3.05 million 8% unsecured convertible debentures from the Zgounder mine cashflows in April 2017.\nZgounder Silver Mine 2017 Highlights\nZgounder Silver mine production highlights during the year ended December 31, 2017 include:\nSilver production of 16,085 kg (2016 – 15,946 kg) of silver (517,135 ounces) (2016 – 512,691 ounces) up 0.87% over 2016; Revenue from silver in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 totalled $11,119,263 (2016 - $10,750,614) and the development cost incurred during the period, excluding capitalised interest, amounted to $10,780,627 (2016 – $9,581,288). The net cash flow from the activities at Zgounder, before capitalised interest, totalled $338,636 (2016 - $1,169,326); The Corporation reported exceptional drill intercepts from its exploration program at the Zgounder Silver Mine; Drilling program included 29 new diamond drill holes (DDH) for a total of 7,243 m, up to depths of 684m; Encouraging results from drill hole analyses, confirmed the presence of large mineralized zones, with some high-grade zones, extending the known areas of the deposit, which are currently being exploited; Ruby Silver Ore (Proustite) Identified at Zgounder; Civil Engineering for the Floatation Cell 500 tpd plant upgrade at the Zgounder Millenium Silver Mining (²ZMSM\") site is completed and commissioning is in progress; On February 22, 2018 the Corporation filed a technical report on its positive PEA of the Zgounder Sliver Mine.\nHighlights of the Boumaâdine Polymetallic Property\nIn October 2017, GoldMinds Geoservices Inc. (“GMG”) completed the digitization of available historical technical data on the Boumaâdine property and will start on-site validation, including verification drilling of ancient tailings and fresh rock polymetallic mineralization in the upcoming months; The Qualified Person in charge of the PEA preparation on Boumaâdine has planned and initiated a 3,000m drilling program of new holes; A sampling program on two tailings containing 240,000 tonnes of ore material will be initiated in order to quantify the gold and silver content recovery potential; Management has opted for the optimal process to extract the polymetallic ore from the deposit, including the recovery of precious metals. An analytical comparison was performed between fluidized bed roasting and pressurized autoclave and the preferred process will be roasting for its economic and technical advantages; Lodging installations for the employees and technical team are in preparation.\nOperating and Financial Highlights\nQuarter ended Year-ended March 31,\n2017\n(unaudited) June 30,\n2017\n(unaudited) Sept. 30,\n2017\n(unaudited) Dec. 31,\n2017\n(unaudited) Dec. 31,\n2017\n(unaudited) Dec. 31,\n2016\n(unaudited) Material Processed (tons) 14,358 13,472 11,693 14,024 53,547 57,831 Average Grade (g/t Ag) 381 338 351 345 355 345 Mill Recovery (%) 86 83 82 85 85 80 Silver Ingots (kg) 4,703 3,992 3,253 4,137 16,085 15,947 Silver ounces produces (oz) 151,214 128,334 111,222 126,365 517,135 520,605 Sales of silver (oz) 161,088 115,571 92,106 127,528 496,293 491,283 Sales of silver ($) 3,599,146 2,871,507 1,709,941 2,938,669 11,119,263 10,750,614 Development expenses (excluding interest) ($) 3,019,635 2,045,196 2,631,542 3,084,254 10,780,627 9,581,288 Cash flow generated from the activities at the mine (excluding interest ($) (1) 579,511 826,311 (921,601 ) (145,585 ) 338,636 1,169,326 (1) Cash flow generated from the activities at the mine is non-International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) performance measures, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
