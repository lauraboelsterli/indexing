Some important global trade indicators are suddenly pointing downward, writes Nathaniel Taplin.\nJan Smets Says ECB Could Take Steps to Phase Out QE This Summer : The European Central Bank is likely to move over the summer to gradually phase out its bond-buying program, perhaps announcing a decision after its July 26 policy meeting, a top ECB official said.\nEuropean Union Threatens Subsidy Cuts to Rein In Rebel Nations : The European Union’s executive branch israising the ante in its clash with Poland and Hungary over democratic values: Play ball or risk being cut out of EU funding.\nItalian President Raises Specter of New Elections : Italy edged closer to fresh national elections, as the Italian president launched a last-ditch call for parties to support a short-term government in an attempt to break a two-month political deadlock.\n‘Terrorists’ or ‘Mistaken Idealists’? Spain Confronts ETA’s Bloody Legacy : Basques remain at odds over the militant separatist group in the wake of its dissolution.\nGermany Logs Strong Industrial Output, Exports in March : German industrial production bounced back in March and exports rose strongly, bolstering expectations that a recent string of weak economic indicators marked a dip in activity, rather than the end of solid growth.\nGreek Banks Get the All Clear From European Regulators : Greece’s biggest banks received a clean bill of health from Europe’s regulators on Saturday, an important step toward the completion of an eight-year bailout program that has strained the country’s economy.\nBritish Lord Who Helped Stem the Financial Crisis Now Fishing in Scotland : Former U.K. Treasury chief Alistair Darling, lost his appetite for politics and thinks about painting the garden shed.\nThe Riddle of the Eurozone’s Missing Inflation : Unlike the U.S. and the U.K., where inflation has started to pick up, consumer-price growth in the 19-nation eurozone remains stubbornly low despite years of strong economic expansion.\nEU Set to Settle Antitrust Case Against Gazprom Soon : The European Union is poised to settle its long-running antitrust case against Gazprom as soon as this month, according to people familiar with the discussions, a move that could be perceived as bending to the Russian state-owned energy giant and at a time of rising tensions between Moscow and the West.\nAs Putin Starts Fourth Term, Higher Oil Prices Give Him a New Edge : Russian President Vladimir Putin began his fourth term on Monday with an unexpected weapon in his arsenal against Western sanctions: higher oil prices.\nIN THE PAPERS\nJob Cuts at Trade Department Test Claim of ‘Global Britain’ After Brexit – Financial Times\nAir France Dispute Threatens to Escalate Macron’s Battle With Labor – New York Times\nLeftist Army Prepares for Life Beyond Corbyn – Politico\nEven After Brexit, English Will Remain the Language That Holds the EU Together – Quartz\nAll Creatures Great and Small Will Get Stuck at Brexit’s Border – Bloomberg\nBe the first with intelligence for an ambitious day.
