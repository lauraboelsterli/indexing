He walked two and struck out six. He was pulled after throwing 113 pitches.\nCahill likewise was not rewarded for his second straight outstanding home start of the season. He shut out the Orioles for six innings, striking out a career-high 12. He allowed just four hits and a walk.\nCahill’s previous high for strikeouts was 10, done twice, once for the A’s in 2010 and later for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2013.\nCahill, who returned to the A’s this season after he was dealt away in 2012, has struck out 20 in two home starts this year. He has yet to allow a run in the Coliseum.\nYusmeiro Petit and Santiago Casilla followed Cahill and threw two shutout innings apiece before Daniel Coulombe struck out four of the five batters he faced bridging the 11th and 12th innings.\nA’s pitchers combined to strike out 20 batters while allowing seven hits.\nMark Trumbo and Anthony Santander had two hits apiece for the Orioles, who lost their fifth straight on a six-game trip that ends Sunday.\nBaltimore has lost 11 straight on the road.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
