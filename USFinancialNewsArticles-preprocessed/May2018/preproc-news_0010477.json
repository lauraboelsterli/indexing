    "text": "1 COMMENTS When it comes to managing money, feminist activist Gloria Steinem wants women to follow her advice and not her actions.\n“I was always telling women to save, but I was just not doing it,” she says in this week’s Secrets of Wealthy Women podcast with Veronica Dagher .\nIn this episode taped at Evercore Wealth Management in New York, Ms. Steinem speaks about starting to save later in life, how having a father without a steady job shaped how she thinks about money and how she dealt with her own unpredictable income.\nMs. Steinem—who appeared on the podcast along with Evercore partner Jewelle Bickford—also explains how women can move past their fears of becoming a bag lady.\nIn this podcast series, successful women from all walks of life share their financial and career tips to help empower women and improve their financial savvy.
