FILEPHOTO: The new John Lewis store at the Westfield shopping centre in White City is seen in London, Britain. March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\nThe couple, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, tied the knot on Saturday at Windsor Castle, in a splendid display of pomp and ceremony watched by almost 18 million viewers, making it the most watched programme of the year so far.\nJohn Lewis, Britain’s largest department store group, reported a 6.3 percent drop in sales in the week to May 19 compared to the same week last year, which it put down to warm weather and “customers turning their attention to the weekend’s celebrations.”\nJohn Lewis’s supermarket arm Waitrose fared better, posting a 3.2 percent rise in weekly sales, as people celebrated the wedding with rose wine, champagne and seasonal bouquets of peonies.
