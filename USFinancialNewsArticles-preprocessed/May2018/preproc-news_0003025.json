    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gran Tierra Exchangeco Inc. (“GTE Exchangeco”) (TSX:GTX), a subsidiary of Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra”) (NYSE American:GTE) (NYSE MKT:GTE) (TSX:GTE), announces that it has established a redemption date of July 5, 2018 (the “ Redemption Date ”) in respect of all of its outstanding exchangeable shares (the “ Exchangeable Shares ”) and that Gran Tierra Callco ULC (“ GTE Callco ”) has elected to exercise its overriding redemption call right to acquire all of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares (other than Exchangeable Shares held by GTE Callco) on the business day immediately prior to the Redemption Date, being July 4, 2018.\nOn July 4, 2018, GTE Callco will acquire each of the Exchangeable Shares not yet redeemed for shares of Gran Tierra for purchase consideration of one share of Gran Tierra common stock (“ Gran Tierra Common Stock ”).\nRegistered holders of Exchangeable Shares must deliver their share certificates and accompanying documentation to Computershare Investor Services Inc. in order to receive Gran Tierra Common Stock.\nNotice of the redemption of Exchangeable Shares and the exercise by GTE Callco of its redemption call right and a Letter of Transmittal, will be mailed to holders of Exchangeable Shares. Copies of these documents will be filed on the Canadian System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) at www.sedar.com under the profile of GTE Exchangeco. Holders of Exchangeable Shares should follow the instructions in these materials to ensure they receive the Gran Tierra Common Stock they are entitled to receive.\nAfter July 4, 2018, former holders of Exchangeable Shares will not have any rights as holders thereof other than the right to receive Gran Tierra Common Stock.\nHolders of Exchangeable Shares may continue to exercise their retraction rights and exchange their Exchangeable Shares for Gran Tierra Common Stock at any time before July 4, 2018.\nFor additional information about how to exchange their Exchangeable Shares before May 21, 2018, holders of Exchangeable Shares should contact Computershare Investor Services Inc. at 1-800-564-6253 or by e-mail to corporateactions@computershare.com .\nGTE Exchangeco intends to apply to the Toronto Stock Exchange to have the Exchangeable Shares delisted after July 4, 2018. GTE Exchangeco also intends to apply to the applicable securities regulatory authorities to cease to be a reporting issuer after the Redemption Date.\nThe Exchangeable Shares were originally issued to Canadian shareholders of Solana Resources Limited to defer capital gains tax consequences of a plan of arrangement that occurred in 2008. The redemption of the Exchangeable Shares will generally be taxable in Canada to the extent the value of the Gran Tierra Common Stock received on the Redemption Date exceeds the shareholder's historic tax basis in the shares of Solana Resources Limited. Redeeming shareholders should contact their tax advisors regarding their particular tax consequences.\nThe NYSE American, NYSE MKT and TSX have not reviewed and do not accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of the contents of this news release, which has been prepared by management of Gran Tierra Exchangeco Inc.\nAbout Gran Tierra Energy Inc.\nGran Tierra Energy Inc. is an independent international energy company focused on oil and natural gas exploration and production in Colombia.
