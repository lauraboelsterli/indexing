    "text": "BEIRUT, May 9 (Reuters) - Iran cannot be militarily threatened by any foreign power, its defence minister said on Wednesday, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency, a day after the United States pulled out of Iran’s 2015 international nuclear deal.\n“Today, with attention to the defensive power of our country, we’re in a situation that Islamic Iran cannot be militarily threatened by any foreign power,” Amir Hatami said.\nHatami pointed to Iran’s military role combating “takfiri” fighters in Iraq and Syria as a recent achievement of the Islamic Republic’s armed forces. Officials in predominantly Shi’ite Muslim Iran often refer to Sunni Muslim radicals as “takfiris”.\nReporting By Babak Dehghanpisheh Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
