Aquino, President and CEO. “As we layer on value-added products, such as advanced managed services through our SingleHop acquisition, we expect our customers to benefit by the integrated solution sets we offer them in Tier 1 markets, where addressable market demand for our services allows us to capture additional share. Our new sales team now has momentum that we can build on and expand our product set across our entire platform, providing a path toward a combination of organic and acquisition growth.”\nRevenue\nFirst quarter 2018 results include SingleHop operations as of March 1, 2018, and are therefore not comparable to prior periods.\nRevenue totaled $74.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $4.2 million or 5.9% sequentially and 2.9% year over year. The sequential increase was primarily due to the SingleHop acquisition. Base line revenues remain generally flat sequentially, including the impact of announced planned closures.\nIn 2018, with the inclusion of SingleHop, INAP moved to a geographic organizational structure to better align global data center assets with management and increase sales efficiency. Beginning with first quarter 2018 reporting, INAP redefined its segment reporting into: INAP US, and INAP INTL.\nINAP US revenue totaled $57.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 7.2% sequentially and 2.9% year over year. The sequential increase was driven by SingleHop, a full quarter of INAP's new Atlanta Data Center, and the stabilization of US revenue. INAP INTL revenue totaled $17.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 1.9% sequentially and 2.7% year over year. The sequential increase was contributed by SingleHop operations in Europe, while the year over year increase is due to both consolidation of INAP Japan, and SingleHop. Post consolidation at the end of 2017, INAP Japan contributes $2 million per quarter in revenue.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary\n($ in thousands) QoQ YoY 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2017 Growth Growth Total Revenue $ 74,201 $ 70,035 $ 72,133 5.9 % 2.9 % Operating Costs and Expenses $ 73,322 $ 64,432 $ 71,641 13.8 % 2.3 % Depreciation and Amortization $ 21,077 $ 17,397 $ 17,745 21.2 % 18.8 % Acquisition Costs $ 2,558 $ 176 $ — — — All Other Operating Costs and Expenses $ 49,687 $ 46,859 $ 53,896 6.0 % (7.8 )% GAAP Net Loss Attributable to INAP Shareholders $ (14,060 ) $ (6,934 ) $ (8,230 ) (102.8 )% (70.8 )% GAAP Net Loss Margin (18.9 )% (9.9 )% (11.4 )% Minus Goodwill Impairment and Other Items $ 3,701 $ 1,393 $ 3,414 165.7 % 8.4 % Normalized Net Loss 2 $ (10,359 ) $ (5,541 ) $ (4,816 ) (87.0 )% (115.1 )% Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 25,665 $ 24,363 $ 21,554 5.3 % 19.1 % Adjusted EBITDA Margin 1 34.6 % 34.8 % 29.9 % Capital Expenditures (CapEx) $ 6,359 $ 12,616 $ 5,989 (49.6 )% 6.2 % Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx 1 $ 19,306 $ 11,747 $ 15,565 64.3 % 24.0 % Net Loss, Normalized Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA and Business Unit Contribution\nGAAP net loss attributable to INAP shareholders was $(14.1) million, or $(0.70) per share in the first quarter of 2018, including $2.6 million of costs associated with acquisition costs, compared with $(6.9) million, or $(0.35) per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, including $0.2 million of costs associated with acquisition costs. GAAP net loss in first quarter 2017 was $(8.2) million.\nNormalized net loss was $(10.4) million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $(5.5) million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $(4.8) million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $25.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 5.3% compared with $24.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of 19.1% compared with $21.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.6% in the first quarter of 2018, down 20 basis points compared to 34.8% in the fourth quarter, and up 470 basis points compared to 29.9% in first quarter 2017. The increases in Adjusted EBITDA were primarily driven by continued focus on cost savings in real estate and network facilities, INAP’s initiative to exit less profitable data center sites, and one month of SingleHop's financial statements.\nBusiness Unit Contribution 3 - INAP US and INAP INTL business unit contribution for the first quarter 2018 is as follows:\nINAP US, includes colocation, cloud, and network services. Cloud contains AgileCloud, Managed Hosting and Services.\n-- INAP US business unit contribution totaled $26.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 15.4% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and a 32.7% increase from the first quarter of 2017. As a percent of revenue, INAP US business unit contribution margin was 46.5% in the first quarter of 2018 up 330 basis points sequentially and 1,040 basis points year-over-year. The year over year business unit contribution increase reflects continued focus on cost savings in real estate and network facilities, INAP's initiative to exit less profitable data center sites, and one month of SingleHop's financials.\nINAP INTL, includes colocation, cloud, and network services. Cloud contains AgileCloud, Managed Hosting and Services, iWeb and Ubersmith.\n-- INAP INTL business unit contribution totaled $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 5.2% decline compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and a 21.9% decrease from the first quarter of 2017. The primary driver for the decline is due to the inclusion of INAP Japan in the fourth quarter 2017 which has a low contribution margin.\n“We are off to a great start to the year, having worked through further operations improvement, the closing of SingleHop acquisition and repricing of our total debt,” says Robert M. Dennerlein, Chief Financial Officer. “The repricing of our debt at favorable rates creates over $5 million in annual interest savings. We also realigned our divisions along geographic reporting segments to correspond with our management reorganization to include SingleHop.”\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $16.2 million at March 31, 2018. Total debt was $667.2 million, net of discount and prepaid costs, at the end of the quarter, including $233.6 million in capital lease obligations. As previously reported, on April 9, 2018, INAP entered into a Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, which amended INAP’s Credit Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2017 to lower the interest rate margin applicable to outstanding term loans by 125 basis points.\nCash generated from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $3.5 million compared to $7.3 million in first quarter 2017, and $13.8 million in fourth quarter of 2017. Capital expenditures over the same periods were $6.4 million, compared to $6.0 million and $12.6 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx 1 was $19.3 million, compared to $15.6 million in first quarter 2017 and $11.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Free cash flow 4 over the same periods was $(2.8) million, compared to $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Unlevered free cash flow 4 was $10.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $8.6 million in first quarter 2017 and $13.0 million in fourth quarter 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nINAP reiterated its outlook for 2018 which, as noted above, includes projected results of acquired SingleHop operations as of February 28, 2018. Additionally, INAP’s sales momentum is expected to contribute to organic growth, offset by select planned closures of certain data center facilities.\nFull-Year 2018 Expected Range Revenue $320 million-$330 million Adjusted EBITDA $105 million-$115 million Capital Expenditures $40 million-$45 million\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx are non-GAAP financial measures which we define in an attachment to this press release entitled “Non-GAAP (Adjusted) Financial Measures.” Reconciliations between GAAP information and non-GAAP information related to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are contained in the table entitled “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA.” Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found below.\nWe define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is GAAP net loss attributable to INAP shareholders plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, other expense (income), (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment, exit activities, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment costs, pre-acquisition costs and claim settlement.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA less CapEx is Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures with Adjusted EBITDA for this non-GAAP measure defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities plus cash paid for interest, cash paid for taxes, cash paid for exit activities and restructuring, cash paid for strategic alternatives and related costs, cash paid for organizational realignment costs, payment of debt lender fees and other working capital changes less capital expenditures.\nNormalized net loss is net loss attributable to INAP shareholders plus exit activities, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment costs, pre-acquisition costs, claim settlement and debt extinguishment and modification expenses.\nBusiness unit contribution is business unit revenues less direct costs of sales and services, customer support, and sales and marketing, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nBusiness unit contribution margin is business unit contribution as a percentage of business unit revenue.\nFree cash flow is net cash flows provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.\nUnlevered free cash flow is free cash flow plus cash interest expense.\nWe believe that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations.\nWe believe that excluding depreciation and amortization and loss (gain) on disposals of property and equipment, as well as impairments and restructuring, to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides supplemental information and an alternative presentation that is useful to investors’ understanding of our current ongoing operating results and trends. Not only are depreciation and amortization expenses based on historical costs of assets that may have little bearing on present or future replacement costs, but also they are based on management estimates of remaining useful lives. Loss on disposals of property and equipment is also based on historical costs of assets that may have little bearing on replacement costs. Impairments and restructuring expenses primarily reflect goodwill impairments and subsequent plan adjustments in sublease income assumptions for certain properties included in our previously disclosed restructuring plans.\nWe believe that excluding interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and other expense (income) from non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental information and an alternative presentation useful to investors’ understanding of our core operating results and trends. Investors have indicated that they consider financial measures of our results of operations excluding interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and other expense (income) as important supplemental information useful to their understanding of our historical results and estimating our future results.\nWe also believe that, in excluding the effects of interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and other expense (income), our non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with transparency into what management uses to measure and forecast our results of operations, to compare on a consistent basis our results of operations for the current period to that of prior periods and to compare our results of operations on a more consistent basis against that of other companies, in making financial and operating decisions and to establish certain management compensation.\nWe believe that exit activities, restructuring and impairment charges, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment costs, pre-acquisition costs, claim settlement costs and debt extinguishment and modification expense are unique costs, and consequently, we do not consider these charges as a normal component of expenses related to current and ongoing operations.\nSimilarly, we believe that excluding the effects of stock-based compensation from non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental information and an alternative presentation useful to investors’ understanding of our current ongoing operating results and trends. Management believes that investors consider financial measures of our results of operations excluding stock-based compensation as important supplemental information useful to their understanding of our historical results and estimating our future results.\nWe also believe that, in excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with transparency into what management uses to measure and forecast our results of operations, to compare on a consistent basis our results of operations for the current period to that of prior periods and to compare our results of operations on a more consistent basis against that of other companies, in making financial and operating decisions and to establish certain management compensation.\nStock-based compensation is an important part of total compensation, especially from the perspective of employees. We believe, however, that supplementing GAAP net loss by providing normalized net loss, excluding the effect of exit activities, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment cost, pre-acquisition costs, claim settlement costs, and debt extinguishment and modification expenses in all periods, is useful to investors because it enables additional and more meaningful period-to-period comparisons.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed as a supplement to — not a substitute for — our results of operations presented on the basis of GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by operating activities as defined by GAAP. Our statements of cash flows present our cash flow activity in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is used by and is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. We believe that:\nEBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company-to-company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and\ninvestors commonly adjust EBITDA information to eliminate the effect of disposals of property and equipment, impairments, restructuring and stock-based compensation which vary widely from company-to-company and impair comparability.\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\nas a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period-to-period on a consistent basis;\nas a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; and\nin communications with the board of directors, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance.\nOur presentation of business unit contribution and business unit contribution margin excludes depreciation and amortization in order to allow investors to see the business through the eyes of management.\nWe also have excluded depreciation and amortization from business unit contribution and business unit contribution margin because, as noted above, they are based on estimated useful lives of tangible and intangible assets. Further, depreciation and amortization are based on historical costs incurred to build out our deployed network and the historical costs of these assets may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures.\nFree cash flow and unlevered free cash flow are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.\nWe use free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed capital expenditures, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.\nFree cash flow and unlevered free cash flow have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made to service our debt or capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAdjusted EBITDA less CapEx is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA less CapEx has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx does not incorporate payments made to service our debt or capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAdjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as we understand certain investors use it as one measure of our historical ability to service debt. Also adjusted EBITDA is used in our debt covenants.\nAlthough we believe, for the foregoing reasons, that our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our results of operations, our non-GAAP financial measures should only be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, any measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET LOSS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FORWARD LOOKING ADJUSTED EBITDA\nA reconciliation of GAAP net loss attributable to INAP
