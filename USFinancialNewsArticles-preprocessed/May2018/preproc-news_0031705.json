We made further progress with our strategic collaboration with Tencent and JD.com, opening up the entry on JD's app homepage in mid-March and the WeChat wallet entry in early April. Looking ahead, we will continue to work closely with Tencent and JD.com in order to improve the traffic flow and conversion rates, which will contribute meaningfully to our long-term customer and revenue growth.\"\nMr. Donghao Yang, Chief Financial Officer of Vipshop, further commented, \"We finished the first quarter of 2018 with a solid 25% year-over-year increase in topline, which was at the high-end of our guidance range. Our average revenue per customer increased by 25% year over year, driven by improved customer shopping frequency. Leveraging the support from Tencent and JD.com, we will continue to grow our topline and expand our market share.\"\nRecent Business Highlights\nVipshop launched its JD flagship store on March 3, 2018 and opened up its entry on the homepage of JD's app to all customers on March 14, 2018. Vipshop's JD flagship store attracted approximately half a million followers within the first two months of launching. The majority of customers from the JD channel are new customers, and male apparel is the strongest category. The Company opened access of its WeChat wallet entry to all traffic on April 8, 2018 and conducted a round of promotions with red dots prompting users to click into Vipshop's WeChat mini-program in mid-April, 2018. Comparing to the Company's app users, customers from its mini-program are younger and more male-concentrated. In the first quarter of 2018, Vipshop's average revenue per customer increased by approximately 25% year over year, driven by the robust 25% year-over-year increase in average number of orders per customer. During this quarter, 86% of customers were repeat customers, up from 77% in the prior year period, and approximately 96% of orders were placed by repeat customers, up from 92% in the prior year period. Vipshop's Board of Directors appointed Mr. Martin Lau, President and Executive Director of Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK: 0700), as a Director of the Company's Board, effective December 29, 2017. In addition, Mr. Bin Wu resigned from the Company's Board of Directors, effective January 30, 2018. On May 8, 2018, L'Oréal Paris launched its official WeChat mini-program, which was developed and operated by Vipshop. Vipshop is actively exploring more opportunities within the WeChat ecosystem with its brand partners, empowering brands to grow their business leveraging the robust traffic within WeChat. In the first quarter of 2018, Vipshop added an overseas warehouse in Frankfurt, Germany, bringing the Company's total international warehousing capacity to approximately 59,000 square meters.

More than 81% of customer returns were handled directly by Vipshop's in-house last mile delivery network, up from 67% in the prior year period. As of March 31, 2018, close to 1.5 million customers enrolled in Vipshop's Super VIP Paid Membership Program, representing a 54% increase sequentially. Vipshop's cross-border business was particularly strong during this year's 4.19 promotional event, with sales increasing by 43% year over year.

The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and increased retained earnings by approximately RMB176.4 million (US$28.1 million). In addition, the impact of applying this ASU for the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily resulted in an increase in product sales and a change in deferred revenue driven by the Weipin Coins that are now accounted as a single performance obligation and identified as variable consideration.\nThe Company offers customers with an unconditional right of return for a period of 7 days upon receipt of products on sales from its platforms. Under the previous revenue standard, revenue was deferred until the 7 days return period expired. However, under the new revenue standard, revenue is recognized at the point of time when the control of goods has been passed to the customers upon the receipt of goods by the customers. The Company makes accrual on the expected sales returns in relation to the 7 day unconditional return policy.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects its total net revenue to be between RMB20.5 billion and RMB21.3 billion, representing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 17% to 22%. These forecasts reflect the Company's current and preliminary view on the market and operational conditions, which is subject to change.\nExchange Rate\nThe Company's business is primarily conducted in China and the significant majority of revenues generated are denominated in Renminbi (\"RMB\"). This announcement contains currency conversions of RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to US$ are made at a rate of RMB6.2726 to US$1.00, the effective noon buying rate for March 30, 2018 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at that rate on March 30, 2018, or at any other rate.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 8:00 am Eastern Time or 8:00 pm Beijing Time to discuss its financial results and operating performance for the first quarter of 2018.\nUnited States:\n+1-845-675-0438\nInternational Toll Free:\n+1-855-500-8701\nChina Domestic:\n400-1200-654\nHong Kong:\n+852-3018-6776\nConference ID:\n#1856707\nThe replay will be accessible through May 23, 2018 by dialing the following numbers:\nUnited States Toll Free:\n+1-855-452-5696\nInternational:\n+61-2-9003-4211\nConference ID:\n#1856707\nA live and archived webcast of the conference call will also be available at the Company's investor relations website at http://ir.vip.com .\nAbout Vipshop Holdings Limited\nVipshop Holdings Limited is a leading online discount retailer for brands in China.

Vipshop may also make written or oral in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Vipshop's beliefs and expectations, are . Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: Vipshop's goals and strategies; Vipshop's future business development, results of operations and financial condition; the expected growth of the online discount retail market in China; Vipshop's ability to attract customers and brand partners and further enhance its brand recognition; Vipshop's expectations regarding demand for and market acceptance of flash sales products and services; competition in the discount retail industry; fluctuations in general economic and business conditions in China and assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in Vipshop's filings with the SEC. All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of this press release, and Vipshop does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe condensed consolidated financial information is derived from the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), except that the consolidated statements of cash flows, and the detailed footnote disclosure required by Accounting Standards Codification 270, Interim Reporting (\"ASC270\"), have not been omitted. Vipshop uses non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders, non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders per diluted ADS, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating income margin, non-GAAP net margin attributable to Vipshop's shareholders, and free cash flow, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders is net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment loss of investments, and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions and equity method investments. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders per diluted ADS is computed using non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders divided by weighted average number of diluted ADS outstanding for computing diluted earnings per ADS. Non-GAAP income from operations is income from operations excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income margin is non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of total net revenue. Non-GAAP net margin attributable to Vipshop's shareholders is non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders as a percentage of total net revenue. Free cash flow is the operating cash flow adding back the impact from Internet financing activities and less capital expenditures, which include purchase of property and equipment, purchase and deposits of land use rights, and purchase of other assets. Impact from Internet financing activities added back or deducted from free cash flow contains changes in the balances of financial products, which are primarily consumer financing, supplier financing and cooperative lending that the Company provides to customers, suppliers and individuals respectively. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the non-cash impact of share-based compensation, impairment loss of investments and amortization of intangible assets adds clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the effect of non-cash share-based compensation expenses, impairment loss of investments, and amortization of intangible assets. Free cash flow enables the Company to assess liquidity and cash flow, taking into account the impact from Internet financing activities and the financial resources needed for the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform. Share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company's net income for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. One of the key limitations of free cash flow is that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Vipshop Holdings Limited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this release.\nInvestor Relations Contact\nJessie Fan\nTel: +86 (20) 2233-0732\nEmail: IR@vipshop.com\n[1] \"Active customers\" are defined as registered members who have purchased from the Company or the
