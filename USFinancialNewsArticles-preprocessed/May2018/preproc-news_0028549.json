The attacker had been overpowered by police, he said.\nThe Paris prefecture had earlier said a person had carried out a knife attack in the second arrondissement - or district - of the French capital. Paris’ opera and landmark retail stores are located in that area.\nThe police source said some seven people had been injured. BFM TV said two were in a critical condition.\nA judicial source said authorities were looking into whether the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office should be handling the case.\nFrance has been on high alert as a series of attacks commissioned or inspired by Islamic State have hit the country over the past three years in which dozens of people have been killed.
