    "text": "TOKYO, May 24 (Reuters) - Most Japanese government bonds were little changed on Thursday but some super-long bonds firmed slightly as Japanese share prices tumbled for the third consecutive day, boosting the allure of government bonds.\nWhile the market is supported by the Bank of Japanâ€™s massive bond buying programme, few investors are eager to buy JGBs at current levels after bond yields saw a substantial rise globally in the past few weeks.\nTen-year JGB futures fell 0.02 point to 150.83, with a trading volume of 25,407 lots while the 10-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.045 percent.\nThe two-year JGB yield was flat at minus 0.145 percent while the five-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to minus 0.110 percent.\nBut the 30-year JGB yield fell 0.5 basis point to 0.745 percent and the 40-year yield dropped 0.5 basis point to 0.885 percent, helped by a fall in Japanese shares.\nThe Nikkei share average extended losses into a third day, falling 2.5 percent during this period.
