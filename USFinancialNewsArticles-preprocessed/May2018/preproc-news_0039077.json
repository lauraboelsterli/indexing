    "text": "TOKYO, May 16 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s economy shrank at an annualised rate of 0.6 percent in January-March, contracting for the first time in nine quarters, as private consumption and capital expenditure slowed, government data showed on Wednesday.\nThat marked the end of the longest sequence of growth since a 12-quarter run between April-June 1986 and January-March 1989 during the asset-inflated bubble economy.\nThe preliminary reading for first-quarter gross domestic product compared with a median estimate of a 0.2 percent annualised contraction in a Reuters poll of economists.\nIt followed a downwardly revised 0.6 percent annualised rate of expansion in the fourth quarter, the Cabinet Office data showed.\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP shrank 0.2 percent, versus the median estimate for a GDP to remain unchanged.\nFor more background, see this story\nTo view the full tables, go to the Cabinet Office's website: here (Reporting by Stanley White and Leika Kihara; Editing by Chris Gallagher)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
