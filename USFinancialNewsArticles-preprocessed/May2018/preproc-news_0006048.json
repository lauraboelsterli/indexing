    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire – Sunniva Inc. (\"Sunniva\" or \"the Company\") (CSE:SNN) (OTCQX:SNNVF), a North American provider of cannabis products and services, today released its financial results and management’s discussion and analysis for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. All figures are reported in Canadian dollars ($). Sunniva's financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.\nMessage from the CEO\n“2017 was a transformative year for Sunniva establishing the necessary infrastructure to become one of the largest vertically integrated cannabis companies operating in the world’s two largest cannabis markets – Canada and California. It has taken us many years to navigate strict federal and state legislative frameworks in California and the recent US presidential support of the legislative rights of individual states affirms our vision of becoming the leading provider of clean, medical grade cannabis within the Golden State,” said Tony Holler, CEO of Sunniva.\n“Our vision is to become one of the lowest cost, highest quality cannabis producers in these markets by building large scale purpose-built current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) designed greenhouses and establishing sophisticated distribution channels, including our ownership of Natural Health Services (“NHS”) cannabis clinics in Canada which has surpassed 95,000 active patients as of today, to purchase the significant quantities of high quality Sunniva branded and Sunniva private label cannabis products. Our focus moving forward is to execute and de-risk our business model by forward selling a large portion of our production in both markets, supplementing the previously announced 90,000 KG take or pay contract with Canopy Growth in Canada, with an emphasis on creating long term shareholder value.”\n“ 2017 was a year of building and 2018 will be the year of execution for our team to drive significant revenue in the near future. The major focus and milestones for the Company over the next year will be:\nCompleting construction and commencing operations in our large-scale cGMP greenhouse facilities in both Canada and California. Finalizing debt financing for the estimated $120 million construction costs of the Sunniva Canada Campus. Securing additional long-term supply contracts in both markets. Leveraging the NHS doctor and software platform to capture a significant percentage of the Canadian medical cannabis market. Establishing a global Sunniva brand - a trusted source of high quality cannabis flower and extracted products and services.”\nFinancial Highlights – Year ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated Financial Highlights Expressed in 000’s of CDN$, except per share amounts\nT hree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2 017 2 016 C hange 2 017 2 016 C hange Revenue 5,857 - 5,857 16,072 38 16,034 Cost of Goods Sold 3,353 12 3,341 9,389 12 9,377 Expenses 5,280 864 4,416 20,897 6,059 14,838 Loss from Operations (2,776) (876) (1,900) (14,214) (6,033) (8,181) Net Income (Loss) 159 (1,561) 1,402 (18,472) (6,887) (11,585) Basic Earnings (Loss)\nPer Share $0.01 $(0.11) $0.12 $(0.74) $(0.41) $(0.33) Weighted Average\nNumber of Shares 26,630,146 14,499,043 12,131,103 25,128,623 16,782,306 8,346,317 Operating Highlights - Year ended December 31, 2017\nKey operating highlights for the Company for the year included:\nIn Cathedral City, California the Company acquired 20 acres of land and 18 licenses to produce and distribute cannabis in California.

The expenses were applied to the Consolidated Statements of Loss and Comprehensive Loss for the period.\nThe Company earned net income of $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017 compared to a net loss of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016.
