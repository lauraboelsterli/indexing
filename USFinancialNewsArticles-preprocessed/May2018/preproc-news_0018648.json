    "text": "ROCKFORD, Mich., May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (NYSE: WWW) today reported financial results and record earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, and provided an update on its 2018 GLOBAL GROWTH AGENDA, which is in the next phase of the Company's transformation initiative. The Company also raised full-year earnings guidance and updated its full-year outlook.\n\"Our first quarter was very strong and an excellent start to the year,\" said Blake W. Krueger, Wolverine Worldwide's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. \"The Company had record earnings per share performance, much better than expected entering the year. This reflects our ability to harvest the benefits of our recent transformation initiatives.\"\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 REVIEW\nReported revenue of $534.1 million decreased 9.7% during the first quarter. Underlying revenue increased 1.8% and further adjusting for currency, increased 0.3%. Reported gross margin was 42.7%, compared to 39.7% in the prior year. Adjusted gross margin in the prior year was 41.2%. Reported operating margin was 11.5%, compared to 5.8% in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 12.0%, up 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Reported diluted earnings per share was $0.48, compared to $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.50 compared to $0.37 in the prior year, an increase of 35%. Inventory declined $66.0 million or 18.5% compared to the prior year. The Company made a voluntary debt principal payment of $100 million during the quarter. The Company executed nearly $45 million in share repurchases during the quarter, comprised of 1,509,664 shares at an average price of $29.56 per share.\n2018 GLOBAL GROWTH AGENDA\n\"The Company is currently implementing key investments and activating critical initiatives as part of our new GLOBAL GROWTH AGENDA, the next phase of our holistic transformation,\" stated Mr. Krueger. \"The recent restructuring and related operational activities are substantially complete and we are now utilizing the new tools and capabilities that were developed as part of this work to focus on growth. During the first quarter, Merrell, Sperry and our international business exceeded our revenue expectations and our owned eCommerce business delivered mid-twenties underlying growth. These results were driven in large part by executing against our new and more profitable operating model focused on speed, innovation and growth.\"\nThe Company's GLOBAL GROWTH AGENDA is comprised of three key elements:\nPowerful Product Creation Engine - Relentless and frequent introduction of craveable product that resonates around the world - taking full advantage of new creative design capabilities, stronger consumer insights and a faster supply chain. Digital-Direct Offense - Seamless interaction with our consumers through more effective digital engagement to drive our owned eCommerce growth beyond 20%, improve the on-line businesses of our retail customers and enhance our brand positioning in the digital marketplace. International Expansion - Greater investment in regional resources and systems to accelerate international growth, with a specific focus on China and the Asia Pacific region.\n\"We are proceeding with our enhanced investment strategy related to the GLOBAL GROWTH AGENDA and still anticipate achieving our stated 12% adjusted operating margin goal well ahead of our original schedule,\" said Mike Stornant, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"Gross margin performance in the first quarter was especially noteworthy, driven mostly by lower product costs and less markdown exposure due to much cleaner inventory levels.\"\nUPDATED 2018 OUTLOOK\nThe strong first quarter earnings results were better than expected. The Company is now raising its earnings projection for the year. The full year outlook is summarized below.\nRevenue in the range of $2.24 billion to $2.32 billion. Gross margin expansion in the range of 50 to 90 basis points, despite a negative mix impact of 20 basis points from 2017 store closures. Reported operating margin of 11.6% to 11.9% and adjusted operating margin of 12.0% to 12.3%, inclusive of $40 to $45 million of incremental investments to support the Company's GLOBAL GROWTH AGENDA. An effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 21%. Reported diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.92 to $2.02 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.00 to $2.10.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. References to \"underlying\" revenue indicate reported revenue adjusted for the impact of retail store closures, the transition of Stride Rite ® to a license business model, the sale of the Sebago ® brand and the sale of the Department of Defense business. Measures referred to as \"adjusted\" financial results exclude environmental and other related costs, organizational transformation costs which include gains or losses from divestitures, restructuring and other related costs and incremental store inventory mark-downs.\nBeginning in Q1 2018, the Company has separately provided the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue, rather than including it as a part of underlying revenue, to better isolate this variable. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding results of operations, consistent with how the Company evaluates performance. The Company calculates constant currency by converting the current-period local currency financial results using the prior period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results.\nThe Company has provided a reconciliation of the above non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors to increase comparability to the prior period by adjusting for certain items that may not be indicative of core operating measures and to better identify trends in our business. The adjusted financial results are used by management to, and allow investors to, evaluate the operating performance of the Company on a comparable basis.\nEARNINGS CALL INFORMATION\nThe Company will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results and current business trends. The conference call will be broadcast live and accessible under the \"Investor Relations\" tab at www.wolverineworldwide.com . A replay of the conference call will be available at the Company's website for a period of approximately 30 days.\nABOUT WOLVERINE WORLDWIDE\nWith a commitment to service and product excellence, Wolverine World Wide, Inc. is one of the world's leading marketers and licensors of branded casual, active lifestyle, work, outdoor sport, athletic, children's and uniform footwear and apparel.

The Company also describes underlying revenue, which excludes the impact of retail store closures, the transition of Stride Rite ® to a license business model, the sale of the Sebago ® brand and the sale of the Department of Defense business. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors to increase comparability to the prior period by adjusting for certain items that may not be indicative of core operating measures and to better identify trends in our business. The adjusted financial results are used by management to, and allow investors to, evaluate the operating performance of the Company on a comparable basis.\nBeginning in Q1 2018, the Company has separately provided the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue, rather than including it as a part of underlying revenue, to better isolate this variable. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding results of operations, consistent with how the Company evaluates performance. The Company calculates constant currency by converting the current-period local currency financial results using the prior period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results.\nManagement does not, nor should investors, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitution for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are found in the financial tables above.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wolverine-worldwide-reports-record-first-quarter-earnings-and-raises-full-year-earnings-outlook-300645009.html\nSOURCE Wolverine Worldwide",
