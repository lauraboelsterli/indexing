    "text": "Award winning marketer brings more than 20 years of senior Fortune 500 brand leadership to OpenX Board\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OpenX, the world’s leading independent advertising technology provider, today announced that Accenture Executive Roxanne Taylor is joining the company’s board of directors. Taylor spent over 20 years at Accenture, including a decade as the company’s chief marketing and communications officer leading all marketing and communications activities for the Fortune Global 500 company.\nUnder Taylor’s leadership, the marketing and communications functions have helped drive significant growth and expansion for Accenture, a leading professional services company that provides a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations. With global revenues of $34 billion in 2017 and approximately 442,000 employees worldwide, Accenture’s market presence reaches across more than 120 countries and 40 industries.\nFor more than a decade Taylor served as one of the most respected and awarded c-suite marketing and communications executives leading a global team of more than 1,000 professionals responsible for Accenture’s image and market development, corporate and financial communications, brand management, advertising and research. She has won numerous awards throughout her prestigious career, including recognition as one of Forbes’ “Most Influential CMOs,” and Advertising Women of New York’s “Change the Game” award.\n“Brands today are beginning to understand that not every company in the supply chain has made the right investments in quality, security and fraud prevention necessary to earn their business,” said Taylor. “This is one of the largest challenges facing the $60 billion and growing digital advertising sector, and I am thrilled to be joining the board of a company like OpenX that has built a reputation in the market for quality, tech innovation and brand safety. These are core differentiators that have set the company up to deliver exactly what brands want.”\n“Advertisers have rightly begun to demand more of their supply chain, and a clear message has been sent to technology partners: If you want to win and keep the business of a brand marketer, it’s critical that you meet their quality and safety needs,” said Tim Cadogan, CEO of OpenX. “Roxanne is one of the most respected marketing leaders in business today and she is bringing to our board an unrivaled understanding of what brands expect from their advertising partners.”\nAbout OpenX\nOpenX powers highly relevant advertising at global scale, delivering quality and value to brands, publishers and consumers across every type of connected screen and ad format.
