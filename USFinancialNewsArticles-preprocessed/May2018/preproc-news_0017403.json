    "text": "YOQNEAM, Israel, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MIND C.T.I. LTD. – (Nasdaq:MNDO), a leading provider of convergent end-to-end prepaid/postpaid billing and customer care product based solutions for service providers as well as unified communications analytics and call accounting solutions for enterprises, today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThe following will summarize our major achievements in the first quarter of 2018 as well as our business. The financial results can be found in the Company News section of our website at http://www.mindcti.com/company/news/ and in our Form 6-K.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenues were $4.5 million, same as in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income was $1.3 million, or 28% of total revenues, compared with $0.9 million, or 21% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2017. The unusually high operating margins are the result of higher than usual revenue from licenses. Net income was $1.2 million, or $0.06 per share, compared with $0.9 million, or $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2017. One SaaS new customer and multiple follow-on orders. Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $1.3 million, compared with $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had 228 employees in our offices, compared with 250 as of March 31, 2017.\nMonica Iancu, MIND CTI CEO, commented: “As previously announced, we continue to generate significant revenues from our existing customer base and we are active in presale processes, but sales cycles are long and competition is even more intense. There is severe pricing pressure, especially when we compete against vendors that focus on specific markets. As planned, we continue to improve our operating efficiency and productivity and at the same time the professional services component of our business revenues increases. We continue to invest in technology and in enhancing our offering to include omni-channel engagement and business analytics.”\nNew Win and Multiple Follow-on Orders\nThe new win is a 6-year SaaS contract, based on a revenue sharing model, with a US customer offering Avaya Hosted IP Office for mid-market partners. MIND will deploy the MINDBill Essentials product based solution.\nThis quarter we received multiple orders from different customers including one large license increase, an additional upgrade to MINDBill Version 8, specific customizations to be delivered with Agile methodology and additional professional services.\nCash Position and Annual Dividend Distribution\nOur cash position, including long-term available-for-sale securities, was $14.4 million as of March 31, 2018.\nAs previously announced, the Board declared on February 22, 2018 a cash dividend of $0.30 per share before withholding tax at a rate of 20%.\nThe dividend declared and distributed was approximately $5.8 million, out of which approximately $4.6 million was paid to the shareholders in March 2018 and approximately $1.2 million was paid for the withholding tax to the Israel Tax Authority after the quarter end, in April 2018.\nRevenue Distribution\nRevenues in the Americas represented 64%, revenues in Europe represented 27% and revenues in the rest of the world represented 9% of our total revenues.\nRevenues from customer care and billing software totaled $3.6 million, or 79% of total revenues, while revenues from enterprise call accounting software totaled $0.9 million, or 21% of total revenues.\nRevenues from licenses were $0.8 million, or 18% of total revenues, while revenues from maintenance and additional services were $3.7 million, or 82% of total revenues.\nChanges in Management Team\nMIND also announced today the appointment of new CFO and CTO.\nRan Mendelaw, (41), joined us in order to replace Mr. Aviram Cohen as the new CFO, starting June 2018. Mr. Cohen joined MIND in 2006 and served as CFO since 2010 and now intends to pursue other business opportunities. We thank Mr. Cohen for his contribution to the company's success.

Prior to that, he served 10 years at PwC Israel, including as a senior manager. Ran is a Certified Public Accountant and holds a B.A. degree in Accounting and Economics from the Haifa University.\nReuben Halevi rejoined MIND in April 2018 as CTO, bringing over 25 years of a proven track record as an executive, business and technical leader and consultant in the US and Israeli software industry. For the last three years Mr. Halevi worked as a consultant, assisting hi-tech startup companies in all strategy and business aspects. Prior to that, he served in several executive roles, including as VP Engineering at MIND in 2014-2015, VP R&D and US COO at Retalix (acquired by NCR).
