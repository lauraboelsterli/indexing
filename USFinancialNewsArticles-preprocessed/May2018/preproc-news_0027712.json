    "text": "TORONTO, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Partners Real Estate Investment Trust (the “REIT,” or “Partners”) (TSX: PAR.UN) today announced its results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 (the “first quarter”).\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nNet loss of $2.3 million, a reduction to earnings of $4.4 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter net loss is the result of unrealized fair value losses on the REIT’s property portfolio. Revenues from income producing properties of $13.0 million, a reduction of $0.9 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017. This reduction in revenue is the result of a property sold during June 2017. Same property NOI for the quarter of $7.7 million, an improvement of $0.3 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017, due to new leasing, renewals and the impact from development activity. All property NOI of $7.7 million, a reduction of $0.4 million when compared with the first quarter of 2017 due to the sale of a property during June 2017, partially offset by increases to same property NOI as discussed above. FFO and AFFO per unit of $0.07 and $0.05, compared to $0.08 and $0.06, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. ACFO payout ratio of 118.5%, compared to 95.6% for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of $0.5 million in restructuring costs, the REIT’s first quarter proforma ACFO payout ratio would have been 98.5%. Occupancy of 90.8% as at March 31, 2018, compared to a level of 95.3% as at December 31, 2017. The reduction to the REIT’s occupancy is due to the departure of a Sears’ tenancy at a property in Ontario. As at March 31, 2018, the REIT had renewed a total of 115,387 square feet, or 65%, of leases that were originally set to expire during 2018. Debt to gross book value was 59.8% as at March 31, 2018, a slight increase from 59.4% at the end of 2017. During the first quarter, the REIT announced that it is offering for sale up to 11 of its 34 properties, all located in western Canada. The Board of Trustees have determined that successful execution of this strategy would enable the REIT to raise capital on an efficient basis, and at the same time afford the opportunity to simplify the operations of the enterprise. If completed as planned, this strategy will have sourced capital at approximately those properties’ Net Asset Value, rather than at the discounted levels at which the REIT's equity units presently trade. It will also permit management to align its operations to serve a more geographically concentrated portfolio.\nAs at and for the three months ended Mar 31, 2018 Mar 31, 2017 Revenues from income producing properties $ 12,975,362 $ 13,871,283 Net income (loss) (2,283,886 ) 2,147,990 Net income (loss) per unit - basic (0.05 ) 0.06 NOI - same properties (1) 7,724,602 7,464,712 NOI - all properties (1) 7,724,602 8,153,916 FFO (1)(9) 3,236,302 2,810,703 FFO per unit (1) 0.07 0.08 AFFO (1) (9) 2,317,612 2,001,444 AFFO per unit (1) 0.05 0.06 ACFO (1) 2,431,240 2,246,099 Distributions (2) 2,887,053 2,147,370 Distributions per unit (2) 0.06 0.06 ACFO distribution payout ratio (3) 118.7 % 95.6 % Cash distributions (4) 2,640,883 1,578,328 Cash distributions per unit (4) 0.06 0.05 As at Mar 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Dec 31, 2016 Total assets $ 465,653,438 $ 475,045,178 $ 514,700,205 Total debt (5) 280,031,069 283,331,535 354,556,805 Total equity 178,405,701 183,347,418 151,508,380 Weighted average units outstanding - basic 45,871,307 39,435,646 33,690,649 Weighted average units outstanding - diluted 46,078,000 39,559,729 33,690,649 Debt-to-gross book value including debentures (5) 59.8 % 59.4 % 68.6 % Debt-to-gross book value excluding debentures (5) 59.8 % 57.8 % 57.5 % Interest coverage ratio (6) 2.15 2.02 1.75 Debt service coverage ratio (6) 1.30 1.25 1.14 Mortgages weighted average effective interest rate (7) 4.08 % 4.10 % 4.41 % Portfolio occupancy (8) 90.8 % 95.3 % 95.1 % (1) NOI – same properties and all properties, FFO, AFFO and ACFO are non-IFRS financial measures widely used in the real estate industry. See “Part II – Performance Measurement” for further details and advisories.\n(2) Represents distributions to unitholders on an accrual basis. Distributions are payable as at the end of the period in which they are declared by the Board of Trustees and are paid on or around the 15 th day of the following month. Distributions per unit exclude the 5% bonus units, or 3% bonus units for distributions with a record date after March 1, 2016, given to participants in the Distribution Reinvestment and Optional Unit Purchase Plan.\n(3) ACFO distribution payout ratio is a non-IFRS financial measure that has a standardized meaning under RealPac. It is calculated as total distributions as a percentage of ACFO (a new measure standardized by RealPac – see Part II Performance Measurement). There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n(4) Represents distributions on a cash basis, and as such, excludes the non-cash distributions of units issued under the Distribution Reinvestment and Optional Unit Purchase Plan.\n(5) Debt-to-gross book value is a non-IFRS financial measure widely used in the real estate industry. See calculation under “Debt-to-Gross Book Value” in “Part IV – Results of Operations”. Management considers debt-to-gross book value to be a valuable metric in assessing the REIT’s overall leverage. Non-IFRS measures do not have standardized meanings and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n(6) Interest coverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio are non-IFRS financial measures widely used in the real estate industry, calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. See definition under “Mortgages and Other Financing” in “Part IV – Results of Operations”. Management considers the interest coverage and debt service coverage ratios to be valuable metrics in assessing the REIT’s ability to make contractual payments on debt. Non-IFRS measures do not have standardized meanings and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. There are no directly comparable IFRS measures.\n(7) Represents the weighted average effective interest rate for secured debt excluding debentures and credit facilities.\n(8) Portfolio occupancy is calculated as economic occupancy, not physical occupancy. A unit is considered occupied once it is committed to a lease with a minimum one-year term.\n“The same property NOI shows improvement of $0.3 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017 and is due to the positive leasing in Quebec and Western Canada through continued active asset management.” stated Jane Domenico, the REIT’s CEO. “The most significant real estate change this quarter is the termination of Sears’ tenancy at our Cornwall Square property in Ontario. This tenancy represented 4.4% of our total portfolio GLA. Excluding Cornwall Square, Partners’ occupancy results remain strong at 96.6%. Finally, the entire team is focused on the marketing and sale of the western Canada assets.”\nFurther Information\nA more detailed analysis of the REIT's financial results for the first quarter are included in the REIT's Management Discussion and Analysis and Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been filed on SEDAR and can be viewed at www.sedar.com or on the REITs' website at www.partnersreit.com .\nConference Call\nPartners will host a conference call at 8:30 AM Eastern on Thursday, May 10, 2018, at which time Partners’ management will both review the financial results and discuss the REIT’s strategic outlook.\nConference Dial-In Details\nToll Free (North America): (800) 377-0758\nLocal: (416) 340-2216\nInstant Replay Details (Available until May 17, 2018)\nToll Free (North America): 800-408-3053\nPasscode: 5135685#\nA recording of the conference call will also be available via Partners’ website.\nAbout Partners REIT\nPartners REIT is a real estate investment trust focused on the management of a portfolio of 34 retail and mixed-use community and neighbourhood shopping centres.
