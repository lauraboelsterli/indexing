    "text": "May 31 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc has interviewed outgoing Royal Bank of Scotland Chief Finance Officer Ewen Stevenson to replace HSBC Finance Director Iain Mackay, The Times newspaper reported on Thursday.\nHSBC Chairman Mark Tucker has spoken to several candidates in recent weeks with Stevenson among the favourites to succeed Mackay, the report added. bit.ly/2sfWoPt\nRBS and HSBC did not respond to requests for comment outside regular business hours.\nStevenson, a former investment banker, quit unexpectedly in a surprise exit from RBS on Wednesday, casting doubt on the timing of a possible sale of some of the British government’s controlling stake in the bank.\nHaving joined RBS in May 2014 after 25 years at Credit Suisse Group AG, Stevenson has led turnaround efforts with the bank’s Chief Executive Ross McEwan, who arrived six months earlier.\nIn February, Stuart Gulliver stepped down as HSBC CEO after the bank reported a smaller-than-expected rise in annual profits and unveiled plans to raise up to $7 billion to bolster its capital.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; editing by Diane Craft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
