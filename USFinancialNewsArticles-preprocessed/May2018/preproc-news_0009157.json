    "text": "Strong New Customer Acquisition and Add-on Success Demonstrate Momentum in Email Security Market\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zix Corporation (Zix) (NASDAQ: ZIXI), a leader in email security, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights (results compared to the same year-ago quarter)\nRevenue increased 5% to $16.7 million Annual contract value increased 7% to a record $68.4 million New first year orders increased 9% to $2.3 million Total orders increased 3% to $14.8 million GAAP net income increased 7% to $1.9 million GAAP fully diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.04 Cash flow from operations decreased to $1.0 million Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $0.08 Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $4.8 million The company ended the quarter with $29.3 million in cash and no debt\nManagement Commentary\n“There’s a real sense of growth, momentum and success in our customer acquisition and retention efforts since entering the new year,” said David Wagner , Zix’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are increasingly winning larger deals and displacing competitors. We recognized more than a year ago that building a full suite of services was what we needed to win; now, a year after the introduction and early success of our bundles, we are winning new customers and becoming a more formidable force in the email security space. ZixProtect and ZixArchive had another strong quarter in Q1, continuing their impressive momentum from 2017 to generate competitive displacement after displacement. And now, with the addition of Erado, we have advanced our bundles to meet the absolute gold standard in compliance when it comes to protecting and archiving business communications. We have also made positive strides on the distribution front, strengthening our managed service provider (MSP) program and focusing more on the distributor relationships that can drive the most value for us and our customers. Overall, we are becoming increasingly convinced that our focus on building our suite of offerings through strategic acquisitions is putting us on an enhanced growth trajectory.\"\nZix’s Chief Financial Officer David Rockvam added, “As our results for the quarter demonstrate, we are making steady progress in our efforts to capture a larger share of the broader email security market. Once again, we achieved our guidance for both the top and bottom line, and generated another quarter of solid New First Year Orders, over 20% of which were driven by ZixProtect and ZixArchive. We also returned to year-over-year growth in our total orders, saw improvement in customer retention and maintained our 29% adjusted EBITDA margin. And, as part of our balanced capital allocation approach, we also repurchased 706,994 shares during the quarter, while investing in our core encryption, advanced threat protection and archiving capabilities. This mindset of deploying capital in the areas where we see the highest returns will be what guides us as we strive to increase shareholder value.”\nRecent Operational Highlights\nAcquired Seattle-based Erado to expand unified archiving, eDiscovery, and compliance solution Expanded MSP program , integrating additional offerings to provide superior security for partners Partnered with Progress Distribution and Proact IT Group AB to help UK and European enterprises comply with new GDPR rules Selected as SC Media 2018 Trust Award finalist for best email security solution\nFirst Quarter 2018 Corporate Financial Summary and Other Operational Metrics\n$ in Millions, except per share data Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Change (1)\nRevenue $ 16.7 $ 15.9 4.8 % GAAP Gross Profit $ 13.1 $ 13.1 0.5 % GAAP Net Income $ 1.9 $ 1.8 6.6 % GAAP Net Income Per Share – Diluted $ 0.04 $ 0.03 7.0 % EBITDA (2) $ 3.5 $ 3.3 4.5 % EBITDA Margin 20.9 % 20.9 % (0.1 pts) Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Profit (3) $ 13.3 $ 13.1 1.1 % Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (3) $ 4.3 $ 3.7 15.9 % Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income Per Share – Diluted (3) $ 0.08 $ 0.07 16.3 % Adjusted EBITDA (3) (4) $ 4.8 $ 4.5 8.4 % Adjusted EBITDA Margin (3) 29.0 % 28.1 % 1.0 pts New First Year Orders $ 2.3 $ 2.1 8.6 % Total Orders $ 14.8 $ 14.3 3.5 % Backlog (5) $ 70.8 $ 78.9 (10.3 %) (1) Changes are based on actual numbers versus numbers shown in the columns, which may reflect rounding\n(2) Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(3) A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP adjusted results is included in this press release and available on our investor relations Web page at http://investor.zixcorp.com\n(4) Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(5) Service contract commitments that represent future revenue to be recognized as the services are provided\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the second quarter 2018, the company forecasts revenue to range between $17.3 million and $17.5 million, representing an increase of 6% to 7% year-over-year.

For a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to comparable GAAP measures, the reasons why management uses these measures, the usefulness of these measures and the material limitations of these measures, see Notes to Reconciliation of GAAP to on the next page.\nZIX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe Company occasionally utilizes financial measures and terms not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) in order to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing our operating results in a manner that enables investors to more thoroughly evaluate our current performance as compared to past performance. We also believe these Non-GAAP measures provide investors with a more informed baseline for modeling the Company’s future financial performance. Management uses these Non- to make operational and investment decisions, to evaluate the Company's performance, to forecast and to determine compensation. Further, management utilizes these performance measures for purposes of comparison with its business plan and individual operating budgets and allocation of resources. We believe that our investors should have access to, and that we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. These Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We have provided definitions below for certain Non- , together with an explanation of why management uses these measures and why management believes that these Non- are useful to investors. In addition, in our earnings release we have provided tables to reconcile the Non- utilized to .\nADJUSTED NON-GAAP MEASURES\nOur Non-GAAP measures adjust GAAP Cost of revenue, Gross profit, Research and development expense, Selling and marketing expense, General and administrative expense, Operating income, Net income, Net income per share - diluted, and EBITDA for non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and strategic consulting and litigation costs to derive Non-GAAP adjusted Cost of revenue, adjusted Gross profit, adjusted Research and development expense, adjusted Selling and marketing expense, adjusted General and administrative expense, adjusted Operating income, adjusted Net income, adjusted Net income per share - diluted and adjusted EBITDA. We provide a reconciliation of these adjusted Non-GAAP measures to GAAP Gross profit, Operating income, Net income, Net income per share - diluted and EBITDA.\nOur forward-looking adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per share information consistently excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, the adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per share will consistently exclude litigation expenses and non-recurring items that impact our ongoing business. See items (A) through (E) below for further information on the current quarter's reconciling items.\nItems (A) through (F) on the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to \" table are listed to the right of certain categories under \"Gross profit,\" \"Operating income,\" \"Net income,\" \"Net income per share - diluted\" and \"EBITDA\" and correspond to the categories explained in further detail below under (A) through (F).\n(A) Non-cash stock-based compensation charges relating to stock option grants, restricted stock, and restricted stock units awarded to and accounted for in accordance with Share-Based Payment accounting guidance. See (1) on previous page for breakdown of stock-based compensation. Because of varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and varying award types, the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation charges provides for more accurate comparisons to our peer companies and for a more accurate comparison of our financial results to previous periods. Additionally, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of non-cash stock-based compensation charges on our operating results.\n(B) Strategic consulting, acquisition and litigation costs. See item (2) on previous page. The Company’s management excludes certain board-directed consulting costs and litigation expenses when evaluating its ongoing performance and/or predicting its earnings trends and therefore excludes these charges on our adjusted operating results.\n(C) Intangible amortization costs. See item (3) on previous page. The Company’s management excludes amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of intangible assets when evaluating its ongoing performance and/or predicting its earnings trends and therefore excludes these charges on our adjusted operating results.\n(D) Corporate separation payment relating to employment termination benefits agreement. See item (4) on previous page. The Company’s management excludes these costs when evaluating its ongoing performance and/or predicting its earnings trends and therefore excludes these charges on our adjusted operating results .\n(E) The Non-GAAP adjustment to the tax provision represents the non-cash tax expense included in the GAAP tax provision, including the current period utilization of deferred tax assets created in previous periods. The remaining provision for income taxes represents expected cash taxes to be paid.\n(F) EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA adds back stock-based compensation charges and litigation expenses.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006464/en/\nZix Company Contact\nGeoff Bibby, 214-370-2241\ngbibby@zixcorp.com\nor\nZix Investor Contact\nLiolios Group, Inc.\nMatt Glover and Najim Mostamand, CFA, 949-574-3860\nZIXI@liolios.com\nSource: Zix Corporation",
