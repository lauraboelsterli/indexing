Its partners are France’s Total SA , Malaysia’s Petronas and Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS).\nSantos shares rose about 1.9 percent by 0025 GMT, ahead of a 0.5 percent rise in the broader market.\n$1 = 1.3208 Australian dollars Reporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Richard Pullin\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
