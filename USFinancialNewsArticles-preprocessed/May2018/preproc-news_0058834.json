Choubey said on Wednesday. The deadline for receiving bids has already been extended once to May 31 from May 14.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s government, keen to sell the loss-making, debt-ridden airline, finalised plans in late March to divest a 76 percent stake and offload about $5.1 billion of its debt.
