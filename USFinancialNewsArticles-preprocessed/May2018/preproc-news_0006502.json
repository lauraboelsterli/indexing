(Nasdaq:MDRX) (Allscripts) announced its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\nFirst quarter 2018 GAAP revenue was $514 million, an increase of 24 percent year-over-year. Non-GAAP revenue totaled $519 million, improving 25 percent year-over-year.\nBookings (1) were $304 million in the first quarter of 2018. This result compares with $286 million in the first quarter of 2017. Contract revenue backlog as of March 31, 2018, totaled $4.7 billion, up 19 percent compared to a year ago.\nReflecting increased transaction costs, gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 43.0 percent on a GAAP basis and 47.3 percent on a non-GAAP basis, compared with 43.2 and 47.5 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis in the first quarter of 2018, total operating expenses, consisting of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses, were $213 million, or a 33 percent increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $182 million, a 29 percent increase year-over-year. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to the acquisition of the Enterprise Information Solutions (EIS) business from McKesson Corporation. Additionally, the company recorded $24 million of legal, transaction-related and other costs in the first quarter of 2018. This compares with $13 million of such costs in the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net loss in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $40 million compared with net loss of $20 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $30 million, up 29 percent when compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP loss per share in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.22, compared with loss per share of $0.11 in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 were $0.16, compared with $0.13 in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $96 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 20 percent increase compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nCash flow from operations for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $58 million, compared to $76 million the same period of 2017. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $17 million, compared to $27 million in the same period of 2017.\nStock repurchases totaled $58 million in the first quarter of 2018.\n“The growth we have generated in the first part of 2018 demonstrates the impact of last year’s transformative actions. Our comprehensive portfolio of healthcare IT solutions continues to drive revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth and positions us to achieve more than $2.1 billion in non-GAAP revenue this year,” commented Paul M. Black, Chief Executive Officer of Allscripts. “We believe we are well positioned and are particularly excited as we integrate EIS and Practice Fusion into Allscripts. We are similarly looking forward to adding, via Netsmart, Change Healthcare Homecare’s solutions to Allscripts’ portfolio of offerings”.\nOther Announcements\nAllscripts announced today that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire HealthGrid Holding Company (HealthGrid), a mobile enterprise patient engagement platform business. Allscripts expects to close the acquisition in the second quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nAllscripts affirms the following financial outlook for 2018, published originally on February 15, 2018:\nNon-GAAP revenue of between $2.15 billion and $2.25 billion, up 17% to 22% versus 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of between $420 million and $460 million, up 12% to 23% year over year, consisting of: Allscripts, excluding Netsmart, Adjusted EBITDA between $310-340 million, and; Netsmart Adjusted EBITDA between $110-120 million Non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.72 to $0.82, an increase of 16% to 32%\nAs of January 1, 2018, Allscripts adopted the new revenue recognition guidance in ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method. Within the body of this earnings release, all amounts for the first quarter of 2018 are reflected under the new revenue recognition standard, and the 2018 financial outlook incorporates the expected impact of the new revenue recognition standard. The overall impact to first quarter results, is immaterial from a comparability perspective against historical results. Please refer to Allscripts’ Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 2018, which will be filed with the SEC, for additional information regarding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard on our financial results.\nIn providing financial guidance, the company does not reconcile non-GAAP revenue, Adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Allscripts does not provide guidance for the various reconciling items since certain items that impact GAAP revenue and net income are either outside of its control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted.\nPlease see the “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release for detailed information on calculating non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of other non-GAAP items, see the non-GAAP financial reconciliation tables in this release (Tables 4, 5 and 6).\nConference Call\nAllscripts will conduct a conference call today, Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 4:30 PM Eastern Time to discuss its earnings release and other information.

To supplement this information, Allscripts presents in this release non-GAAP revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expense, Adjusted EBITDA, effective income tax rate, net income and earnings per share, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The definitions of non-GAAP financial measures used throughout this document are presented below:\nNon-GAAP revenue consists of GAAP revenue, as reported, and adds back recognized deferred revenue from the EIS business, Practice Fusion, Netsmart, NantHealth’s provider/patient engagement business and non-material consolidated affiliates that are eliminated for GAAP purposes due to purchase accounting adjustments.\nNon-GAAP gross profit consists of GAAP gross profit, as reported, and excludes acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, acquisition-related amortization, stock-based compensation expense and transaction-related and other costs. Non-GAAP gross margin consists of non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue in the applicable period. For the first quarter of 2018, non-GAAP gross margin totaled 47.3 percent, consisting of non-GAAP gross profit of $245.5 million divided by non-GAAP revenue of $518.6 million. For the first quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin totaled 47.5 percent, consisting of non-GAAP gross profit of $197.1 million divided by non-GAAP revenue of $415.1 million. Reconciliations to GAAP gross profit are found in Table 4 within this press release.\nNon-GAAP operating expense consists of GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) and research and development expense (R&D), as reported, and excludes transaction-related and other costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded to SG&A and R&D. For the first quarter of 2018, non-GAAP operating expense totaled $182.1 million, consisting of $143.1 million of GAAP SG&A and $70.0 million of GAAP R&D expense and excluding $20.9 million of total transaction-related and other costs and $10.1 million of stock-based compensation expense recorded to SG&A and R&D. For the first quarter of 2017, non-GAAP operating expense totaled $141.3 million consisting of $110.9 million of GAAP SG&A and $49.2 million of GAAP R&D expense and excluding $12.7 million of transaction-related and other costs and $6.1 million of stock-based compensation expense recorded to SG&A and R&D. Please note operating expense totals may not sum due to rounding.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and consists of GAAP net income/(loss), as reported, and adjusts for: acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; transaction-related and other costs; non-cash asset and long-term investment impairment charges; interest expense and other, net; equity in net earnings of unconsolidated investments; and tax provision (benefit).\nNon-GAAP effective income tax rate is based on non-GAAP pre-tax earnings and consists of the statutory federal income tax rate, Allscripts effective state income tax rate and adjustments for permanent differences.\nNon-GAAP net income consists of GAAP net income/(loss), as reported, and adds back acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, acquisition-related amortization, stock-based compensation expense, transaction-related and other costs, non-cash asset and long-term investment impairment charges, non-cash charges to interest expense and other, and equity in net earnings of unconsolidated investments and the related tax effect of the aforementioned adjustments. Non-GAAP net income also includes a tax rate alignment adjustment.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. is a non-GAAP measure and consists of non-GAAP net income, as described above, with an adjustment to reduce non-GAAP net income for the percentage of non-controlling interest outside Allscripts ownership position. For this presentation, Netsmart preferred stock is treated as if it was converted to common stock. There can be no assurance that the holders of Netsmart preferred stock will elect to convert their holdings to common stock.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share consist of non-GAAP net income, as defined above, divided by weighted shares outstanding – diluted in the applicable period.\nFree cash flow consists of GAAP cash flows provided by operating activities in the applicable period, net of capital expenditures and capitalized software costs.\nAcquisition-Related Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Deferred revenue adjustments include acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, which reflect the fair value adjustments to deferred revenue acquired in a business acquisition. The fair value of acquired deferred revenue represents an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin, to perform services related to the acquiree's software and product support, which assumes a legal obligation to do so, based on the deferred revenue balances as of the acquisition date. Allscripts adds back acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments for its non-GAAP financial measures because it believes the inclusion of this amount directly correlates to the underlying performance of Allscripts operations.\nAcquisition-Related Amortization. Acquisition-related amortization expense is a non-cash expense arising primarily from the acquisition of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions or investments. Allscripts excludes acquisition-related amortization expense from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income because it believes (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Allscripts business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods because of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets. Investors should note that the use of these intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation, and the related amortization expense will recur in future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards. Allscripts excludes stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Allscripts business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing and valuation of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods, and such expense will recur in future periods.\nTransaction-Related and Other Costs. Transaction-related and other costs relate to certain legal proceedings, consulting, severance and other charges incurred in connection with activities that are considered one-time. For the first quarter of 2018, Allscripts incurred $24 million of transaction-related and other expenses.\nAllscripts excludes transaction-related and other costs, in whole or in part, from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Allscripts business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods.\nNon-Cash Charges to Interest Expense and Other . Non-cash charges to interest expense include the amortization of the fair value of the cash conversion option embedded in the 1.25 percent Cash Convertible Notes issued by Allscripts during the second quarter of 2013.\nImpairment of and Losses on Long-Term Investments. Impairment of and losses on long-term investments relates to other-than-temporary non-cash impairment charges associated with such investments based on management’s assessment of the likelihood of near-term recovery of the investments’ value. The amount recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 relates to a non-cash impairment charge related to one of our cost-method equity investments and a related note receivable.\nEquity in Net Income (loss) of Unconsolidated Investments. Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated investments represents Allscripts share of the equity earnings (losses) of our investments in third parties accounted for under the equity method, including the amortization of cost basis adjustments.\nTax Rate Alignment. Tax rate alignment aligns the applicable period’s effective tax rate to the expected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate.\nManagement also believes that non-GAAP revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expense, effective income tax rate, net income, earnings per share, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the underlying performance of Allscripts business operations. Acquisition accounting adjustments made in accordance with GAAP can make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons of the underlying operations of the business without considering the non-GAAP adjustments provided and discussed herein.\nManagement also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting, as it believes that these measures are indicative of core operating results. In addition, management may use non-GAAP gross profit, operating expense, operating income, net income, earnings per share and/or Adjusted EBITDA to measure achievement under Allscripts stock and cash incentive compensation plans. Note, however, that non-GAAP gross profit, operating income, net income earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA are performance measures only, and they do not provide any measure of cash flow or liquidity. Allscripts considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after capital expenditures and capitalized software costs. Free cash flow provides management and investors a valuable measure to determine the quantity of capital generated that can be deployed to create additional shareholder value by a variety of means. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Allscripts results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors are encouraged to review the definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial measures contained within the attached condensed consolidated financial statements.\nSource: Allscripts",
