    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lab7 Systems, a leader in informatics solutions and services for data intensive scientific applications and personalized medicine, announced today its name change L7 Informatics, Inc. to reflect the expansion of its product offering. In conjunction with the name change, L7 is proud to announce the appointment of Vasudev Rangadass, Ph.D., as its CEO. As L7 Informatics, the company is well positioned to address its mission of providing synchronized solutions for science + health and to pioneer scientific process and data management (SPDM) in order to accelerate discoveries and drive higher quality of healthcare. Together with the new name L7 announces its new website at www.l7informatics.com .\nDr. Rangadass joined the company in early December, bringing his experience in transforming healthcare operations into well-organized enterprises through the successful growth of Net.Orange, which he guided to an acquisition by NantHealth. With his proven leadership building enterprise software companies, Dr. Rangadass has enabled Christopher Mueller, Ph.D., the founder and Chief Technology Officer of L7 Informatics, to focus his energies on the expansion of the capabilities of L7’s flagship software, the Enterprise Science Platform (ESP).\n“Launching our new name and Vasu coming aboard are welcomed changes as we transition to the growth phase of L7 Informatics,” commented Dr. Mueller. “Vasu’s experience in building Net.Orange will help guide L7 to becoming a dominant player in the healthcare and life science enterprise software industry. I’m especially excited that I can now devote myself to carrying out my vision for ESP.”\n“I’m very happy to be leading L7 through this next chapter in our growth,” added Dr. Rangadass. “What the company built with ESP serves as a strong foundation for building automated precision health solutions in the Academic and Industry Research Centers, life science, pharmaceutical, NGS-based diagnostics lab, and healthcare markets. If I’ve learned anything in my experience, it’s that a company cannot succeed without a very strong platform. I’m very much looking forward to building upon the successes of Chris and his team.”\nPrior to Lab7 Systems, Dr. Rangadass was the Chief Strategy Officer at NantHealth following its acquisition of Net.Orange, the company he founded to provide enterprise solutions to the healthcare industry. Prior to Net.Orange, he was the first employee of i2 Technologies, which he was instrumental in growing into a global company that revolutionized the supply chain market.\nL7 Informatics is presenting its solutions at the 2018 Bio-IT World Conference and Expo in Boston, May 15-17. In addition to exhibiting in booth 343, Dr. Mueller will present a talk titled “Operational Informatics: A Whole Lab Approach to Actionable Data Insights” and Varshal Davé, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, will be chairing a session on Data and Standards Approaches for Statistical Analysis, both on Wednesday, May 16.\nAbout L7 Informatics:\nL7 Informatics, formerly Lab7 Systems, provides software and services that enable synchronized solutions for science + health. L7’s novel Enterprise Science Platform (ESP) is a scientific process and data management (SPDM) solution that enables life science and healthcare companies to connect people, processes, and systems to accelerate discoveries and drive precision healthcare.
