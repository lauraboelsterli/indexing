Photo: Sergey Nivens/Shutterstock.com\nGood morning. Specialists in emerging technology, cybersecurity and risk-and-scenario modeling are going to be among the most sought-after employees in the next three years, according to a survey of 400 U.S.-based chief executives by KPMG LLP . Three-quarters said they are prioritizing hiring in these areas to support growth, while 52% said they think more jobs will be created by artificial intelligence than will be lost.\nIt’s no surprise these specialists are in high demand, given companies’ need to protect themselves against increasing regulatory, strategic, operational and emerging risks, said Kelly Watson, national service group leader for risk consulting at the professional-services firm. Most companies have a wealth of data but often struggle to tap it for insights that will help them avoid trouble. Modeling specialists help organizations to be more agile in their risk management and compliance efforts, he said.\n“By leveraging forward-looking insights from the data they can better plan for and respond to emerging risks, including regulatory shifts, changes in the geopolitical landscape and risks created by disruptive technologies,” said Ms. Watson. “CEOs have come to appreciate the importance of scenario planning, and understand that to effectively manage the organization it’s key to anticipate change.”\nWhile 89% of CEOs said protecting customer data is one of their most important personal responsibilities, just 15% said having a strong cybersecurity strategy was important for building trust with stakeholders, the survey found.\nWhy the disparity? It may be that while CEOs view customer data protection as one of their most important personal responsibilities, they are less sure about the role of a strong cyber strategy in building trust, said Tony Buffomante, U.S. leader of cybersecurity services at KPMG.\n“They understand that more than just a sound cyber strategy is needed to engender customer and stakeholder trust,” he said. Also key is being able to properly respond to breaches, including timely and accurate communication to consumers and other stakeholders, said Mr. Buffomante.\n“While an overarching and high-level strategy is important to set the stage for cyber risk management, those more mature organizations in the U.S. have moved beyond just strategy to focus on deploying detailed tactics to fortify trust with their customers and other stakeholders,” he said.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nBumble Bee Foods Chief Executive Christopher Lischewski is taking a leave of absence to fight charges he colluded to fix tuna prices, the company said Friday. Mr. Lischewski was indicted on May 16 in connection with allegedly agreeing to fix prices on packaged seafood. He didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCOMPLIANCE\nMonths before new U.S. sanctions against Iran take hold , the world’s two biggest shipping lines, Denmark’s Maersk Line and Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Co. , said they were winding down general cargo shipment. Tanker owners plan to move their vessels to other oil-producing countries, the WSJ reports.\nThe oil terminal on Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf handles most of Iran’s crude exports. ABEDIN TAHERKENAREH/EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY The U.S. decided to defer a sanctions push against North Korea as both sides sought to revive a summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. The White House was to announce the sanctions Tuesday but decided Monday to indefinitely delay the measures, the WSJ reports.\nJapan said it detected what seemed to be a Chinese ship making an illegal cargo transfer to a North Korean vessel some 200 miles offshore from Shanghai, Reuters reports. China has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing U.N. sanctions against North Korea, Reuters reports.\nMurray Huberfeld, a co-founder of the defunct hedge fund Platinum Partners , pleaded guilty Friday to a single count of wire-fraud conspiracy in connection with what federal prosecutors had called a bribery-and-kickback scheme, the WSJ reports.\nChinese authorities are set to approve Qualcomm ’s planned $44 billion acquisition of Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors , in what would be another significant step toward easing frayed U.S.-China trade relations, the WSJ reports.\nIrish voters overwhelmingly repealed a constitutional ban on abortion, a sweeping change that caps an emotion-filled debate and marks another significant step away from the country’s historic Catholic influence, the WSJ reports.\nDATA SECURITY\nTwo Canadian banks said Monday they were contacted by “fraudsters” who said Sunday they had information about customer accounts. Bank of Montreal said data for fewer than 50,000 customers may have been stolen. Simplii Financial , an online unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , said roughly 40,000 customers may have been affected, the WSJ reports.\nGOVERNANCE\nFounders of top startups are increasingly wresting control of their companies from venture-capital backers and extracting huge pay packages tied to going public, the WSJ reports. Venture capitalists remain the main backers of private companies, but new sources of capital have reduced their leverage, giving power to star entrepreneurs.\nREPUTATION\nC.L. Max Nikias, the embattled president of the University of Southern California , agreed to step down Friday, just over a week after allegations were made public that a longtime gynecologist at the school’s student-health center had sexually abused patients for years, the WSJ reports.\nRISK\nThe European Union’s top trade official, Cecilia Malmstrom, will meet U.S. counterparts in Paris on Wednesday, according to EU officials, in a last-ditch effort to secure waivers from steel and aluminum tariffs and to engage Washington on efforts to tackle China’s market-distorting policies, the WSJ reports.\nOPERATIONS\nTwo railway unions, representing close to 3,500 conductors, engineers and signal operators, filed a strike notice Saturday with Canadian Pacific Railways Ltd. , telling management that workers will walk off the job Tuesday night if an agreement can’t be reached. Time off and wages are at issue, the WSJ reports.\nBrazil’s government said concessions to end a truckers strike will have a high cost for taxpayers even as businesses and consumers struggle with shortages of vital goods. Truckers began blockading highways May 21. As of Monday afternoon, there were still 557 blockades around the country, the WSJ reports.\nA second major flash flood to hit Ellicott City, Md., in two years on Sunday left businesses once again devastated. The flood sent cars floating down Main Street in the community of about 68,000 and swept others away. A similar flash flood hit the region in July 2016, the WSJ reports.\nSTRATEGY\nPepsiCo said Friday it is buying Bare Foods Co. , a maker of fruit and vegetable snacks, as the global food and beverage company looks to expand its offerings of healthier fare . Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, the WSJ reports.\nPepsiCo said it is buying Bare Foods Co., a maker of fruit and vegetable snacks, for an undisclosed sum. SETH PERLMAN/ASSOCIATED PRESS A fizzy lemon-flavored alcoholic drink that went on sale in Japan on Monday marked Coca-Cola ’s first fling at selling alcohol in its 132-year history. Although it owned a winery from 1977 to 1983, Coca-Cola had never directly sold an alcoholic drink during a history that dates to 1886, the WSJ reports.\nThe Morning Risk Report from WSJ’s Risk & Compliance Journal cues up the most important news in risk and compliance every weekday morning.

That makes a significant difference in the way senior executives and boards should think about extended enterprise risk management (EERM), with one approach being to think of third parties as teaming with the business to help create value. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to EERM, managing third-party risk from both a revenue and cost perspective can provide significant opportunity to drive additional business value, create efficiencies, and build resilience.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
