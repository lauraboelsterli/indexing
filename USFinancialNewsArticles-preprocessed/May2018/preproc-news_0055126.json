    "text": "0 COMMENTS About a third of New York City fifth-graders who appeal their middle-school admission decisions are successful and win seats at the public schools they prefer, Education Department data show.\nThe department lets students unhappy with their April acceptance letters file appeals, and expects to announce those results in early June.\nSuspense runs high .\nLast spring, about 8,600 fifth-graders appealed their offers for the fall of 2017—almost 12% of applicants, according to department data. About 2,800 of them, or 33%, won their appeals and nabbed a spot at one of their choices.\nAbout 500 students who appealed never enrolled: Many switched to private schools, charters or options outside the city.\nUnder New York’s complex system, fifth-graders rank schools they want to attend, and schools rank students they want to enroll, often based on their academic records and other criteria, such as interviews or auditions. The department makes matches. In appeals, students can ask again for their initial choices or new ones.\nNicola DiMaria, an 11-year-old in Brooklyn’s Carroll Gardens, broke into tears when she was matched last year to a school she had never toured.\n“All my friends were getting their first or second choice and saying, ‘I got into the school of my dreams!’” she said.\nHer mother, Ana Larios, said she was upset to discover that Nicola’s assigned school in District 15 had a metal detector at the door and staff she found unimpressive when they visited. They appealed, and were thrilled Nicola was accepted at her original first pick, Boerum Hill School for International Studies.\n“I love my school so much,” Nicola said, citing its French-immersion program, floor hockey and off-campus lunch privileges. “I was lucky,” she said. But for some students she knew, appeals failed.\nDepartment officials said students are matched to schools during appeals through the same criteria as initial applications, and get spots that open up when accepted students change plans.\nThis high-anxiety process is tied to a choice system that is under increasing scrutiny . Critics of sorting children by academic records say it often ends up segregating them by family income, race and prior access to strong elementary schools. Meanwhile, parents who support the choice system say high-performing, selective options keep them in public education.\nThe city’s new chancellor, Richard Carranza, surprised many parents last week by questioning the whole rationale for screening students this way , though he didn’t announce any changes.\n“Why are we screening kids in a public school system?” he asked. “That’s, to me, antithetical to what I think we all want for our kids.”\nFifth-graders who appealed roughly reflected the demographics of the system overall. About 15% of those appealing last year were white, 19% were Asian, 21% were black and 37% were Hispanic, according to city data. About 72% qualified for subsidized lunch.\nHigh achievers on state tests were least likely to appeal: Only 13% of those who appealed earned the top test scores, or Level 4 on state exams. That is probably because they are more successful at getting into the selective schools they want, educators said.\n“Everyone wants to go to the same middle schools,” said Robin Aronow, an admissions consultant with School Search NYC. “Inevitably there are kids who don’t get in, some of whom are just as qualified as anyone else.”\nAs parents and educators debate changing admissions systems to integrate public schools in parts of the city, some say the number of appeals will rise, especially if strong students lose access to sought-after spots.\nIn District 3, for example, covering the Upper West Side and parts of Harlem, 88% of students with Level 4 scores got into their favorite middle-school choices for last fall, compared with 55% of low scorers, or Level 1. When students appealed and didn’t end up enrolling in schools run by the department, they were most frequently hoping for high-achieving options in great demand—Mott Hall II, the Computer School, Booker T. Washington and West End Secondary School.\nStudents who failed state tests were especially likely to appeal their placements. Only 6% of those who appealed in District 3 had top test scores of Level 4.\nTo diversify schools in District 3, and make access to popular schools more equitable, the department has proposed setting aside 25% of seats in each middle school for struggling students. To decide who would get priority, it has suggested using various combinations of low test scores, course grades and poverty measures.\nMany District 3 parents have balked at these scenarios , saying talented students would unfairly lose access to desirable schools and might be sent to classrooms with few children who passed state tests. Many parents say they want more integration, but that this plan lacks money for remedial help for children below grade level who would be assigned to high-performing schools, among other concerns. And many say the real problem is there are simply too few options with sufficient resources.\n“The problem is the Department of Education hasn’t provided enough quality schools,” said Debra Plafker, a District 3 parent and education consultant. “Parents are jostling for too few good seats.”\nA department spokesman countered that. “We have high-quality middle-school programs all across the city, and are investing in every school as we build a pathway to success for all students,” said Doug Cohen in an email. “We’ll continue working closely with students and families throughout the appeals process to help them find a program that best fits their needs. ”\nWrite to Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com",
