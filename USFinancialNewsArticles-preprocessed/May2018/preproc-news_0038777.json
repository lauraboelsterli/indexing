    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CohBar, Inc. (NASDAQ:CWBR) (“CohBar” or the “Company”), an innovative biotechnology company developing mitochondria based therapeutics (MBTs) to treat age-related diseases, today reported its financial results for the first quarter\n“We raised $4.6 million in additional funding since the beginning of the year to further support our pre-clinical and clinical activities,” said Simon Allen, CohBar CEO, “and our latest findings regarding CB4211’s novel mechanism of action were accepted for presentation at a major scientific conference next month. Our planned clinical entry will mark significant milestones both for CohBar’s transition to a clinical-stage company, and for the transformation of naturally occurring mitochondrial peptides into a novel class of therapeutics for the potential treatment of a range of age-related diseases.”\nRecent and First Quarter 2018 Business and Preclinical Development Highlights:\nCB4211 Mechanism of Action Findings Accepted for Presentation at Major Scientific Conference in June. The Company will be presenting its findings to date about the molecular mechanisms underlying CB4211’s efficacy in animal models of NASH at a major scientific conference in June 2018. The Company’s ongoing investigation identified CB4211’s interaction with a cell-surface receptor that plays a key role in metabolic regulation.\nCompleted Private Placement. With the final closing in April 2018, the Company issued and sold a total of $3.9 million of non-convertible unsecured promissory notes, together with warrants to purchase 780,500 shares of the Company's common stock. Insider participation accounted for more than $500,000 of the financing. An additional $0.7 million was raised from warrant and option exercises during the first quarter.\nInvestment and Scientific Community Outreach. During the first quarter, CohBar’s CEO Simon Allen presented an overview of the Company and its clinical development program at the H.C. Wainwright & Co. 2 nd Annual NASH Investor Conference, and met with institutional investors and NASH scientific and medical experts at the BIO CEO and Investor Conference, and at the 30 th Annual ROTH Conference.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nCash and Investments. CohBar had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $8,456,656 on March 31, 2018, compared to $8,452,459 on December 31, 2017.\nR&D Expenses. Research and development expenses were $2,680,983 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1,292,780 in the prior year first quarter. The increase was due primarily to costs related to our clinical and IND-enabling activities, and an increase in stock-based compensation for option grants made during the current year quarter, and for prior grants to consultants that are revalued at each balance sheet date.\nG&A Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $913,088 in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $940,089 in the prior year quarter. The decrease in general and administrative expenses were related to lower stock-based compensation costs compared to the prior year first quarter, offset by increases in insurance premiums and directors fees related to the addition of a new Board member announced at the end of 2017.\nNet Loss. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net loss was $3,586,585, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2,232,110, or $0.06 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nCohBar will not be hosting a first quarter 2018 investor conference call. The Company will be conducting an investor teleconference in conjunction with its Annual Shareholder Meeting scheduled for June 19, 2018. Details of the Annual Shareholder Meeting will be announced in early June.\nAbout CohBar’s Lead Program\nCohBar’s lead preclinical development program is based on MOTS-c, a mitochondrial-derived peptide (MDP) that was discovered in 2012 by CohBar founder Professor Dr. Pinchas Cohen and his academic collaborators, whose research has shown that MOTS-c plays a significant role in the regulation of metabolism. The Company has developed CB4211, a novel and improved analog of MOTS-c, which has demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in preclinical models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity.\nAbout CohBar\nCohBar is an innovative biotechnology company focused on the research and development of mitochondria based therapeutics (MBTs), an emerging class of drugs for the treatment of age-related diseases. MBTs originate from the discovery by CohBar’s founders of a novel group of peptides encoded within the mitochondrial genome called mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs), some of which have been shown to regulate metabolism and cell death, and whose levels declined with age. CohBar’s efforts focus on the discovery of new MDPs, and their development into novel MBTs that offer the potential to address a broad range of age-related diseases with underlying metabolic dysfunction, including obesity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), Type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, the Company and its founders have discovered more than 100 MDPs.\nFor additional company information, please visit www.cohbar.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements (statements which are not historical facts) within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
