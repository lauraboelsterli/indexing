FILE PHOTO: Cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason is seen in an undated handout picture released by Kensington Palace April 24, 2018. Lars Borges/Pool via Reuters\nAsked by Meghan herself to perform, the 19-year-old from Nottingham is already well-known in Britain, where he was voted BBC Young Musician in 2016 and his debut album “Inspiration” topped the classical music charts.\nAs the couple signed the register, Kanneh-Mason played three pieces accompanied by an orchestra: “Apres un Reve” by French composer Gabriel Faure, “Sicilienne” by Maria Theresia von Paradis and Schubert’s “Ave Maria”.\nIn the hours after his performance media around the world scrambled to find out what they could about the musician. “Who was the man with the cello?” read one headline in German magazine Der Spiegel’s online edition, while celebrity news website Hollywood Life told readers “5 things to know about the hunky 19-year-old wedding cellist”. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle walk down the aisle of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle after their wedding in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Danny Lawson/Pool via REUTERS\nKanneh-Mason said on Twitter in April that he received a personal call from Markle asking him to perform at the ceremony.\n“Of course I immediately said yes! What a privilege,” he wrote.\nHe was the first black musician to win the prestigious BBC competition since it was launched in 1978.
