AbbVie has been informed by the depositary that the preliminary proration factor for the tender offer is approximately 94.3 percent.\nIn accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer, and based on the preliminary count by the depositary, AbbVie expects to acquire approximately 71.4 million shares of its common stock at a price of $105 per share, for an aggregate cost of approximately $7.5 billion, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. These shares represent approximately 4.5 percent of the shares outstanding. The number of shares to be purchased and the purchase price are preliminary and subject to change.
