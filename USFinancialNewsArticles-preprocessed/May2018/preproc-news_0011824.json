    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 12:21 AM / Updated 16 minutes ago Australia corporate watchdog expands legal action against Rio Tinto, former executives Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s corporate watchdog said on Tuesday it has expanded legal action against miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) and two former top executives, alleging a failure to recognise an impairment in its Mozambique coal assets in 2012 financial statements. FILE PHOTO: The Rio Tinto mining company's logo is photographed at their annual general meeting in Sydney, Australia, May 4, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo\nThe new allegations against former Chief Executive Tom Albanese and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott come on top of claims the executives misled investors about the coal reserves in the 2011 annual report.\nRio Tinto had no immediate comment on Tuesday, has denied any wrongdoing in a similar case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRio Tinto bought Riversdale Mining, later renamed Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique, for $4 billion (£2.91 billion) in 2011, but later wrote off about $3.5 billion of its value.
