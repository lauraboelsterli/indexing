    "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s fuel distribution market should be regulated to reduce concentration in a few hands, the country’s Public Security Minister Raul Jungmann said on Wednesday, in the wake of a crippling truckers’ strike.\nJungmann said the owners of distribution companies took part in the stoppage that almost brought the country to a halt and left gas stations and airports across Brazil with no fuel, disrupting road and air travel.\nBrazil’s supply lines were now returning to normal, he added.\nReporting by Anthony Boadle, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
