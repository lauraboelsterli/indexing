    "text": "FRIEDBERG, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- voxeljet AG (NYSE:VJET) (the “Company”, or “voxeljet”), a leading provider of high-speed, large-format 3D printers and on-demand parts services to industrial and commercial customers, today announced consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights - First Quarter 2018\nTotal revenues for the first quarter increased 11.5% to kEUR 5,052 from kEUR 4,530 Gross profit margin improved to 44.9% from 34.9% Systems revenues decreased 18.8% to kEUR 1,375 from kEUR 1,693 Services revenues increased 29.6% to kEUR 3,677 from kEUR 2,837 Reaffirm full year 2018 guidance\nDr. Ingo Ederer, Chief Executive Officer of voxeljet, commented, “2018 is off to an excellent start with the best quarter in both Services revenue and gross profit in our company’s history. We see these metrics as leading indicators of the ongoing strength of our industrial 3D printing technology. Our goal of becoming a critical supply chain partner and solutions provider is gaining traction. As downstream processes become more automated, we are very confident this will in medium term translate into significantly improved Systems revenue.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 11.5% to kEUR 5,052 compared to kEUR 4,530 in the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenues from our Systems segment, which focuses on the development, production and sale of 3D printers, decreased 18.8% to kEUR 1,375 in the first quarter of 2018 from kEUR 1,693 in last year’s first quarter. This was mainly due to lower revenues based on the mix of printer sales during the quarter. The Company delivered two used and refurbished 3D printers in the first quarter of 2018, compared to two new printers delivered in last year’s first quarter. Systems revenues also include all revenues from consumables, spare parts and maintenance, which almost remained on the same level compared to the last year’s same period. Systems revenues represented 27.2% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 37.4% in last year’s first quarter.\nRevenues from our Services segment, which focuses on the printing of on-demand parts for our customers, increased 29.6% to kEUR 3,677 in the first quarter of 2018 from kEUR 2,837 in the comparative period of 2017. This was due to higher revenue contributions mainly from our subsidiary voxeljet America Inc. (“voxeljet America”). The increase in revenue at our American service center resulted from a growing market penetration in the North American sales region which is accompanied by a larger customer base.\nCost of sales was kEUR 2,785 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to kEUR 2,949 for the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit and gross profit margin were kEUR 2,267 and 44.9%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to kEUR 1,581 and 34.9% in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit for our Systems segment increased to kEUR 429 in the first quarter of 2018 from kEUR 353 in the first quarter of 2017. The improvement was mainly related to the reduction in the reserve for slow-moving inventory with a positive impact of kEUR 226 compared to a release amounting to kEUR 60 in the comparative period. The release was mainly due to the increase in order backlog and higher sales forecast. Gross profit margin for this segment increased to 31.2% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 20.9% in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit for our Services segment significantly increased to kEUR 1,838 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to kEUR 1,228 in the first quarter of 2017. This is mainly due to the increase in revenues. The gross profit margin for this segment increased to 50.0% in the first quarter of 2018 from 43.3% in the first quarter of 2017. This was mainly related to stronger gross profit margin contributions from our subsidiary voxeljet America. voxeljet UK still provided negative gross profit contributions, but improved significantly. This was partially offset by weaker gross profit margin from voxeljet China. The improvement regarding voxeljet America and voxeljet UK resulted from a higher utilization of these service centers. Gross profit margin from the German operation remained almost unchanged.\nSelling expenses were kEUR 1,736 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to kEUR 1,385 in the first quarter of 2017. The increase is mainly due to higher personnel expenses resulting from higher headcount especially regarding the German operation as well as our subsidiary voxeljet America compared to the last year’s first quarter.\nAdministrative expenses were kEUR 1,232 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to kEUR 1,194 in the first quarter of 2017 and therefore almost unchanged.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses increased to kEUR 1,597 in the first quarter of 2018 from kEUR 1,497 in the first quarter of 2017. The increase of kEUR 100 was mainly due to higher personnel expenses related to a slight increase in headcount.\nOther operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were kEUR 358 compared to kEUR 190 in the prior year period. This was mainly due to higher losses from foreign currency transaction for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nThe losses from foreign currency transactions were primarily driven by the valuation of the intercompany loans granted by the parent company to our US and UK subsidiaries.\nOther operating income was kEUR 402 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to kEUR 297 in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly due to higher gains from foreign currency transactions.\nOperating loss was kEUR 2,254 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to an operating loss of kEUR 2,388 in the comparative period in 2017. The slight improvement was primarily related to a significant increase in gross profit partially offset by higher operating expenses within the functions Sales and research and development, compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancial result was positive kEUR 678 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a financial result of negative kEUR 43 in the comparative period in 2017. The significant increase was mainly related to the revaluation of derivative financial instruments resulting in a finance income of kEUR 941 partially offset by interest expense for long term debt of kEUR 232.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was kEUR 1,582 or EUR 0.42 per share, as compared to net loss of kEUR 2,431, or EUR 0.65 per share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nBased on a conversion rate of five American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) per ordinary share, net loss was at EUR 0.08 per ADS for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of EUR 0.13 per ADS for the first quarter of 2017. Earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to stockholders of the parent by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. Earnings per ADS is calculated by dividing the above earnings per share by five as each ordinary share represents five ADSs.\nBusiness Outlook\nOur revenue guidance for the second quarter of 2018 is in the range of kEUR 5,250 to kEUR 7,250.\nWe reaffirm our guidance for the full year ended December 31, 2018\nFull year revenue is expected to be in the range of kEUR 28,000 and kEUR 30,000 Gross margin is expected to be above 40% Operating expenses for the full year are expected as follows: SG&A expenses expected to be in the range of kEUR 11,000 and kEUR 12,000 and R&D expenses projected to be approximately kEUR 5,000 to kEUR 6,000. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between kEUR 3,750 and kEUR 4,000. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be neutral-to-positive in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), as calculated under IFRS accounting principles before interest (income) expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding other (income) expense resulting from foreign exchange gains or losses on the intercompany loans granted to the subsidiaries. Capital expenditures are projected to be in the range of kEUR 5,500 to kEUR 6,500, which primarily includes ongoing investments in our global subsidiaries.\nOur total backlog of 3D printer orders at March 31, 2018 was kEUR 4,899, which represents eight 3D printers. This compares to a backlog of kEUR 2,770 representing four 3D printers, at December 31, 2017. As production and delivery of our printers is generally characterized by lead times ranging between three to nine months, the conversion rate of order backlog into revenue is dependent on the equipping process for the respective 3D printer as well as the timing of customers’ requested deliveries.\nAt March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of kEUR 3,140 and held kEUR 17,688 of investments in bond funds, which are included in current financial assets on our consolidated statements of financial position.\nWebcast and Conference Call Details\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast to review the results for the first quarter on Friday, May 18, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Participants from voxeljet will include its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ingo Ederer, and its Chief Financial Officer, Rudolf Franz, who will provide a general business update and respond to investor questions.\nInterested parties may access the live audio broadcast by dialing 1-877-705-6003 in the United States/Canada, or 1-201-493-6725 for international, Conference Title “voxeljet AG First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call”. Investors are requested to access the call at least five minutes before the scheduled start time in order to complete a brief registration. An audio replay will be available approximately two hours after the completion of the call at 1-844-512-2921 or 1-412-317-6671, Replay Conference ID number 13679191. The recording will be available for replay through May 25, 2018.\nA live webcast of the call will also be available on the investor relations section of the Company’s website.

A replay will also be available as a webcast on the investor relations section of the Company’s website.\nNon-IFRS Measure\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure of its financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), as calculated under IFRS accounting principles, interest (income) expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding other (income) expense resulting from foreign exchange gains or losses on the intercompany loans granted to the subsidiaries. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA to be an important financial measure because it excludes the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange gains or losses on the intercompany loans granted to its subsidiaries which are difficult to forecast for future periods. Management regularly uses both IFRS and non-IFRS results and expectations internally to assess its overall performance of the business, making operating decisions, and forecasting and planning for future periods. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial measure to the Company’s investors as it helps investors better understand and evaluate the projections our management board provides. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled financial measures reported by other peer companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute to financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nExchange rate\nThis press release contains translations of certain U.S. dollar amounts into euros at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.

Preparation of financial statements\nOur consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of voxeljet AG, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries voxeljet America Inc., voxeljet UK Ltd. and voxeljet India Pvt. Ltd., as well as voxeljet China Co. Ltd., which are collectively referred to herein as the ‘Group’ or the ‘Company.’\nOur consolidated interim financial statements were prepared in compliance with all applicable measurement and presentation rules contained in International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as set forth by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and Interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’). The designation IFRS also includes all valid International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’); and the designation IFRIC also includes all valid interpretations of the Standing Interpretations Committee (‘SIC’). Specifically, these financial statements were prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements and the measurement principles for interim financial reporting purposes specified by IAS 34.\nThe IASB issued a number of new IFRS standards which are required to be adopted in annual periods beginning after January 1, 2018.\nStandard Effective date Descriptions IFRS 9 01/2019 Amendments Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation IFRS 16 01/2019 Leases IAS 19 01/2019 Amendments Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement IAS 28 01/2019 Amendments Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures IFRIC 23 01/2019 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments Improvements to IFRS (2015-2017) 01/2019 IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12, IAS 23 Others 01/2020 Amendments References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards IFRS 17 01/2021 Insurance Contracts IFRS 10, IAS 28 indefinite Amendment Sale or Contribution of Assets between Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture The Company has not yet determined what impact the new standards, amendments or interpretations will have on its financial statements.\nThe interim financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were authorized for issue by the Management Board on May 17, 2018.\n2. Summary of significant accounting policies\nExcept as described below, the accounting policies applied in these consolidated interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, which can be found in its Annual Report on Form 20-F that was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The changes in accounting policies are also expected to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ending December 31, 2018.\nThe Group has initially adopted IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, on January 1, 2018. A number of other new standards are effective from January 1, 2018 but these do not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe adoption of IFRS 15 resulted in minor impacts related to the revenue recognition regarding the revenue streams from maintenance as well as extended warranty contracts. Those impacts include immaterial timing differences for revenue recognition related to these types of contracts with customers. The new guidance is not expected to have a material impact to net income (loss) on an ongoing basis. The adoption of IFRS 9 resulted in a minor increase in impairment losses recognized on trade receivables.\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nIFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaced IAS 18, Revenue, IAS 11, Construction Contracts, and related interpretations. The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method, with the effect of initially applying this standard recognized at the date of initial application (i.e. January 1, 2018). Accordingly, the information presented for 2017 has not been restated – i.e. it is presented, as previously reported, under IAS 18, IAS 11 and related interpretations.\nThe following table summarizes the impact, net of tax, of transition to IFRS 15 on retained earnings as of January 1, 2018.\nImpact at January 1, 2018 Impact on adopting\nIFRS 15 at January 1,\n2018\n(€ in thousands) Retained earnings (100) Recognition of revenues from maintenance and extended warranty contracts (100) The following table summarizes the impacts of adopting IFRS 15 on the Company’s consolidated interim consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2018 and its consolidated interim statement of comprehensive loss for the three months then ended for each of the line items affected.\nAmounts without\n03/31/2018 As reported Adjustments adoption of IFRS 15 (€ in thousands) Total assets 67,707 15 67,722 Current assets\n38,347 15 38,362 Trade receivables 4,802 15 4,817 Total equity and liabilities 67,707 59 67,766 Current liabilities\n8,957 59 9,016 Deferred income 69 752 821 Contract liabilities 2,969 (2,969 ) -- Other liabilities and provisions 2,024 2,276 4,300 Amounts without\n03/31/2018 As reported Adjustments adoption of IFRS 15 (€ in thousands) Revenue 5,052 (44 ) 5,008 Impairment loss on trade receivables (53 ) 53 -- Operating loss (2,254 ) 9 (2,245 ) Loss before income taxes (1,576 ) 9 (1,567 ) Net loss (1,582 ) 9 (1,573 ) Total comprehensive loss (1,661 ) 9 (1,652 ) The details of the new accounting policies and the nature of the changes to previous accounting policies in relation to the Group’s revenue streams in relation to the Maintenance and extended warranty contracts are set out below.\nAfter the initial one year of statutory warranty period, the Company offers its customers extended warranty and optional maintenance contracts. Extended warranty and maintenance contracts are generally provided for a period of twelve months and automatically extended for another twelve months if not cancelled on a timely basis. Before the adoption of IFRS 15 extended warranty and maintenance service revenue has been recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term.\nUnder IFRS 15, the Company recognizes revenue based on input factors like the number of service visits or the provision of certain goods, in particular printheads under the maintenance and warranty contracts. Therefore the expected number of service visits and goods to be provided under a contract have been estimated by the Company’s service department based on historical experience. This leads to minor timing differences for revenue recognition related to these types of contracts with customers throughout the contract term.\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments\nIFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognizing and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39, Financial Instruments.\nThe Company has taken an exemption not to restate comparative information for prior periods with respect to classification and measurement (including impairment) requirements. Differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognized in retained earnings and reserves as of January 1, 2018. Accordingly, the information presented for 2017 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 but rather those of IAS 39.\nThe details of new significant accounting policies and the nature and effect of the changes to previous accounting policies are set out below.\nClassification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities\nIFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities. However, it eliminates the previous IAS 39 categories for financial assets of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale.\nUnder IFRS 9, on initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics.\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\nit is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to record subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component that is initially measured at the transaction price) is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition.\nUnder IFRS 9, our investments in bond funds will be classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). As permitted by IFRS 9, the Company has designated these investments at the date of initial application as measured at FVOCI. Unlike IAS 39, the accumulated fair value reserve related to these investments will never be reclassified to profit or loss.\nUnder IAS 39 as well as upon adoption of IFRS 9, our derivative financial instruments have been designated as at FVTPL.\nImpairment of financial assets\nIFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with an ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, FVOCI and contract assets. Under IFRS 9, credit losses are recognized earlier than under IAS 39.\nThe Company’s financial assets at amortized cost consist of trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. For cash and cash equivalents the adoption of IFRS 9 did not have any impact regarding impairment.\nUnder IFRS 9, loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases:\n12-months ECLs: these are ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; or lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.\nThe Company considers a financial asset to be in default when:\nthe borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full, without recourse by the Company to actions such as realizing security (if any is held); or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.\nThe Company considers an investment to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of ‘investment grade’. The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in bond funds which are fully guaranteed by the financial institutions and therefore represents short term credit rating of A-3 based on Standard & Poor’s or P-2 based on Moody’s.\nTrade receivables\nThe Company measures loss allowances for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. The Company calculates the ECL based on the risk scoring its customers’ according to an external rating agency. Following the risk score of each customer, the trade receivables are clustered into different grades. For each grade, the ECL is calculated after deducting from trade receivables a loss allowance based on actual credit loss experience. In addition the Company uses qualitative assessment of the trade receivables, where default has incurred.\nThe Group considers an equity security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of ‘investment grade’. The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in bond funds which are fully guaranteed by the financial institutions and therefore represents.\nPresentation of impairment\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets and presented within other operating expenses.\nImpairment losses on financial assets classified as FVTPL and FCOCI are presented within the finance expense and other comprehensive income, respectively.\nThe following table presents the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new measurement categories under IFRS 9 for each class of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities as of January 1, 2018.\nOriginal New Original classification New classification carrying amount carrying amount 01/01/2018 under IAS 39 under IFRS 9 under IAS 39 under IFRS 9 (€ in thousands) Financial assets 27,063 27,000 Non-current assets\nEquity securities Available-for-sale financial assets FVOCI 5 5 Derivative financial instruments A financial asset or financial liability at fair value through profit or loss Mandatorily at FVTPL 352 352 Current assets\nBond funds Available-for-sale financial assets FVOCI 14,044 14,044 Cash and cash equivalents Loans and receivables Amortized cost 7,569 7,569 Trade receivables Loans and receivables Amortized cost 5,093 5,030 Financial liabilities 20,416 20,416 Non-current liabilities\nLong-term debt Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost Amortized cost 16,242 16,242 Finance lease obligation Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost Amortized cost 171 171 Current liabilities\nBank overdraft Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost Amortized cost 58 58 Long-term debt Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost Amortized cost 796 796 Finance lease obligation Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost Amortized cost 308 308 Trade payables Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost Amortized cost 2,841 2,841 Impact of the new impairment model\nFor assets in the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model, impairment losses are generally expected to increase and become more volatile. The Company has determined that the application of IFRS 9’s impairment requirements at January 1, 2018 results in an additional impairment allowance as follows.\n(€ in thousands) Loss allowance at December 31, 2017 under IAS 39 482 Additional impairment recognized at January 1, 2018 on: Trade and other receivables as at December 31, 2017 62 Additional trade receivables recognized on adoption of IFRS 15 1 Loss allowance at January 1, 2018 under IFRS 9 545 The following tables provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables as of January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018.
