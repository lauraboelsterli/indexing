    "text": "PARIS, May 8 (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said France would work on a broader agreement covering Iran’s nuclear activity, ballistics programme and regional activities after President Donald Trump said he was withdrawing the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal.\n“We will work collectively on a broader framework, covering nuclear activity, the post-2025 period, ballistic activity, and stability in the Middle-East, notably Syria, Yemen, and Iraq,” Macron said on Twitter moments after Trump spoke.\nMacron also said the nuclear non-proliferation regime was at stake.
