    "text": "Reblog Intel Corp. plans to release patches for a new vulnerability affecting its chips, the second time this year it has addressed flaws known as Spectre and Meltdown. Inspired by the January disclosure of the bugs, security researchers are digging into chip attacks and uncovering even more flaws, said Paul Kocher, an independent cryptography expert who with others discovered Spectre. Spectre and Meltdown sent the world’s chip makers scrambling to fix design flaws long present in most of the world’s processors.",
