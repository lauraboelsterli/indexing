    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s far-right League party will not block rapid political solutions that would allow the country to handle possible emergencies, but it wants an election as soon as possible, a source from the party said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: League party leader Matteo Salvini speaks at the media after a round of consultations with Italy's newly appointed Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at the Lower House in Rome, Italy, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile “At this point, we will not block rapid solutions capable of managing emergencies, but we must let Italians express themselves again as soon as possible,” the source said.\nThe source did not explain what was meant by “emergencies”, though financial markets have been in turmoil over the continuing political uncertainty.\nReporting by Sara Rossi, writing by Steve Scherer; Editing by Mark Bendeich\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
