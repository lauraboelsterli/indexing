    "text": "Dallas Cowboys wideout Terrance Williams mistakenly told police that former Baylor teammate and current Minnesota Vikings wideout Kendall Wright was driving his Lamborghini when it crashed over the weekend, according to Williams’ attorney.\nDec 17, 2017; Oakland, CA, USA; Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Terrance Williams (83) runs with the ball after making a catch next to Oakland Raiders cornerback Dexter McDonald (23) in the first quarter at Oakland Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports Chip Lewis, Williams’ attorney, told the Dallas Morning News on Thursday that Williams — not Wright — was driving the car when it crashed early Saturday morning. He added that Williams and Wright had been together earlier in the evening, but that Williams was alone when his vehicle hopped a curb and wrecked.\nWilliams was arrested near his home before dawn in Frisco, Texas, and charged with public intoxication — a Class C misdemeanor in Texas — after police found his car wrecked from striking a light pole at an intersection near the Cowboys’ training complex.\nAccording to the police report, there was no driver present when the car was found at 4:41 a.m., but police determined the vehicle was registered to Williams and went to his home in a nearby gated community. The attendant at the gate said Williams had come through as a passenger in a car about 10 to 15 minutes earlier.\nAs the officers were leaving the gate to return to the site of the wreck, one officer saw Williams riding an electric scooter out of the exit gate. As two police vehicles approached the swerving scooter from behind, Williams looked back, swerved more severely and crashed, sending him over the handlebars.\nWhile checking to make sure Williams was all right, an officer noted several signs of intoxication, including watery eyes, slurred speech and the smell of alcohol on Williams’ breath.\nAccording to the report, Williams went on to tell police that he had been at his home the “whole time” and that Wright had called him around 1:45 a.m. to tell him he had crashed the Lamborghini. Williams said he was driving the scooter to check on the car, adding that Wright had left the crash scene in a yellow Camaro to go to a club.\nPolice also wrote in the report that Williams said he would “never put himself in a (messed) up situation where we would be there” and “stated multiple times throughout (the) conversation that he would never put himself in a bad situation and he would not lie to us.”\nLewis told the Morning News that Williams and not Wright was not driving the car, but added he hasn’t seen the police report yet, saying, “All I have is what Terrance remembers.”\nAug 19, 2017; Glendale, AZ, USA; Arizona Cardinals free safety Tyrann Mathieu (32) intercepts a pass intended for Chicago Bears wide receiver Kendall Wright (13) during the first half at University of Phoenix Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports “All of that is news to me,” the lawyer continued. “Anytime you hit a curve going about 60 mph and he struck his head, I don’t know, but we’re going to find out. I have to do the work necessary when you have an injury like this when you hit your head if there is any head trauma as far as a gap in memory.”\nIn a statement released by Lewis on Saturday evening, Williams said that he was driving the Lamborghini when the accident happened, after a car in front of him stopped quickly.\n“The driver in front of me slammed on his brakes and I turned to the left and hopped the curb to avoid hitting him,” the statement read, in part. “I got his insurance information and my neighbor picked me up when my car wouldn’t drive. I live right near where the accident occurred, so my neighbor dropped me off and I called a tow truck and took the scooter from my house to go meet the tow truck driver.\n“The police officer, who I have met in the past in the neighborhood, saw me on the scooter and arrested me without performing any sobriety tests. I have always been an upstanding citizen and handled the situation the best way I know how. I apologize if I should have handled it a little bit differently.”\nIn releasing the statement, Lewis also said, “Contrary to media reports, Terrance did not hit a light pole and there was no light pole even near the vehicle.”\nWilliams, 28, was released from the Frisco Detention Center on a $369 bond. He was also given a misdemeanor at-large charge for leaving the scene of a crash.\nWright, who signed with the Minnesota Vikings as a free agent this spring, played with Williams at Baylor from 2009-11.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
