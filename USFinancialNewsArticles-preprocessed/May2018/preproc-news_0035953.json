    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 10:34 PM / Updated 4 hours ago Matt Hancock cuts top stake on FOBT to £2 - The Sun Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Media secretary Matt Hancock has said that the highest stake on fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) will be cut to 2 pounds, The Sun reported on Wednesday. Britain's Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Matt Hancock arrives in Downing Street in London, January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay\nPrime Minister Theresa May had been \"on the fence for a while\" with Chancellor Philip Hammond being opposed to the 2 pounds limit, but May eventually sided with Hancock and Sports Minister Tracey Crouch on the issue, the report said, citing a source. bit.ly/2rMiMig\nBritish gambling firms GVC Holdings Plc ( GVC.L ) and Betfred, along with other bookmakers, had been weighed down for the past few months by uncertainty over the review to decide the new top stake for slot machines.\nFOBT is a touch-screen machine that allows players to bet on the outcome of various games such as roulette. Dubbed the “crack cocaine” of gambling, campaigners argue that the machines enable players to lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and wider social problems.
