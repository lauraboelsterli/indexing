    "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia and NEW YORK, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mesoblast Limited (ASX:MSB) (Nasdaq:MESO) today announced strong financial results for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and provided operational highlights for the third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKey financial results for the nine months ended March 31, 2018\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash reserves of US$59.5 million.\nRevenues increased to US$15.6 million, compared with US$1.8 million in the corresponding period of FY2017, an increase of US$13.8 million.\nThis increase reflects revenues received from our two licensees, JCR Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd marketing TEMCELL® Hs. Inj. for treatment of acute Graft Versus Host Disease (aGVHD) in Japan, and TiGenix NV/Takeda (Alofisel®), which has central marketing authorization (MA) approval in Europe for the treatment of perianal fistulae.\nNet cash outflows from operating activities in the nine months of FY2018 were reduced by US$17.2 million (24%) compared with the nine months of FY2017.\nThe loss after tax in the nine months of FY2018 was significantly reduced by US$35.2 million (71%), from US$49.6 million in the nine months of FY2017 to US$14.5 million.\nDuring the quarter, Mesoblast established a non-dilutive, four year credit facility with Hercules Capital for up to US$75 million, with US$35.0 million drawn at closing.\nRecent operational highlights and anticipated upcoming milestones\nMSC-100-IV for acute Graft Versus Host Disease (aGVHD):\nThe Phase 3 trial successfully met its Day 28 primary endpoint of overall response in the reporting quarter.\nUpcoming Day 100 survival/safety data (Q2 CY18).\nUpcoming Day 180 survival/safety data (Q3 CY18).\nBased on discussions with the FDA, Mesoblast believes that successful results from the completed Phase 3 trial through Day 100, together with Day 180 safety and quality of life parameters in these patients, may provide sufficient clinical evidence for filing for this product candidate in the United States under an accelerated review pathway.\nMPC-150-IM for Advanced and End-Stage Heart Failure:\nUpcoming 12 month data read-out for 159 patient trial in End-Stage Heart Failure and LVAD implantation (Q3 CY18).\nBased on prior Phase 2 results, the FDA granted RMAT designation for MPC therapy in this indication in December 2017.\nPhase 3 events-driven trial for Advanced Heart Failure (Class II/III) enrollment completion (H2 CY18).\nTrial received a positive recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee to continue without modification after an evaluation of clinical data in the first 465 randomized patients.\nMPC-06-ID for Chronic Low Back Pain:\nOur Phase 3 trial in patients with chronic low back pain who have failed all conservative measures has completed enrollment in the reporting quarter.\nContinue to access non-dilutive capital for commercialization of MSC-100-IV (remestemcel-L).\nEstablish U.S., global and regional commercial partnerships for high volume products.\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 (third quarter) (in U.S. Dollars)\nRevenues were US$1.1 million in the third quarter of FY2018 compared with US$0.9 million in the third quarter of FY2017, an increase of US$0.2 million (19%).\nThere was an increase of US$11.4 million (116%) in the loss after income tax for the third quarter of FY2018, compared with the third quarter of FY2017.\nThe main items which impacted the loss after income tax movement were:\nRevenues were US$1.1 million for the third quarter of FY2018, compared with US$0.9 million for the third quarter of FY2017, an increase of US$0.2 million. This increase of US$0.2 million in the third quarter of FY2018 was due to an increase of US$0.7 million from royalties on sales of TEMCELL by our licensee in Japan, JCR, offset by a decrease of US$0.5 million in milestone revenue for TEMCELL, licensed with JCR.\nResearch and Development expenses were US$16.8 million for the third quarter of FY2018, compared with US$13.9 million for the third quarter of FY2017, an increase of US$2.9 million (21%) as the Company invested in Tier 1 clinical programs.\nManufacturing expenses were US$1.7 million for the third quarter of FY2018, compared with US$3.8 million for the third quarter of FY2017, a decrease of US$2.1 million (55%) following completion, in the prior year, of clinical product necessary for Phase 3 trials.\nManagement and Administration expenses were US$6.0 million for the third quarter of FY2018, compared with US$5.5 million for the third quarter of FY2017, an increase of US$0.5 million (9%) primarily due to increased corporate activities.\nFinance Costs of US$0.4 million in interest expenses were recognized in the third quarter of FY2018 in relation to the Company’s loan and security agreement entered into with Hercules in March 2018. No interest expense was recognized in the third quarter of FY2017.\nThe overall increase in loss after income tax also includes movements in other items which did not impact current cash reserves, such as: fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration, and foreign exchange movements within other operating income and expenses.\nA non-cash income tax benefit of US$3.4 million was recognized in the third quarter of FY2018 in relation to the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet during the period, compared to\nUS$3.1 million in the third quarter of FY2017.\nThe net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was US$21.1 million, or 4.47 cents loss per share, for the third quarter of FY2018, compared with US$9.8 million, or 2.43 cents loss per share, for the third quarter of FY2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash reserves of US$59.5 million.\nIn March 2018, Mesoblast established a non-dilutive, four-year credit facility with Hercules Capital for up to US$75 million with US$35.0 million drawn at closing. An additional US$15.0 million may be drawn on or before Q4 CY2018, and a further US$25.0 million may be drawn on or before Q3 CY2019, in each case as certain milestones are met.\nMesoblast retains an equity facility for up to A$120 million/US$90 million, to be used at its discretion over the next 15 months to provide additional funds as required.\nFinancial Results for the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 (the nine months) (in U.S. Dollars)\nRevenues were US$15.6 million in the nine months of FY2018 compared with US$1.8 million in the nine months of FY2017, an increase of US$13.8 million.\nThere was a decrease of US$35.2 million (71%) in the loss after income tax for the nine months of FY2018, compared with the nine months of FY2017.\nThe main items which impacted the loss after income tax movement were:\nRevenues were US$15.6 million for the nine months of FY2018, compared with US$1.8 million for the nine months of FY2017, an increase of US$13.8 million. This increase of US$13.8 million in the nine months of FY2018 was due to a 162% increase in commercialization revenue (US$1.6 million) from royalty income on sales of TEMCELL ® Hs. Inj., an upfront payment of US$5.9 million (€5.0 million) received upon execution of our patent license agreement with TiGenix in December 2017, a future payment from TiGenix of US$5.9 million (€5.0 million), due by December 2018, was recognized, and an increase of US$0.5 million in sales milestones recognized on sales of TEMCELL ® Hs. Inj. Research and Development expenses were US$48.4 million for the nine months of FY2018, compared with US$43.0 million for the nine months of FY2017, an increase of US$5.4 million (13%) as the Company invested in Tier 1 clinical programs.\nManufacturing expenses were US$3.4 million for the nine months of FY2018, compared with US$10.9 million for the nine months of FY2017, a decrease of US$7.5 million (69%) due to a reduction in manufacturing activity because sufficient quantities of clinical grade product were previously manufactured for all ongoing clinical trials.\nManagement and Administration expenses were US$16.7 million for the nine months of FY2018, compared with US$15.9 million for the nine months of FY2017, an increase of US$0.8 million (5%) primarily due to increased legal activities and labor costs for non-cash share based payments partially offset by a decrease in corporate overhead expenses such as rent, IT costs and depreciation.\nFinance Costs of US$0.4 million in interest expenses were recognized in the nine months of FY2018 in relation to the Company’s loan and security agreement entered into with Hercules in March 2018. No interest expense was recognized in the nine months of FY2017.\nThe overall decrease in loss after income tax also includes movements in other items which did not impact current cash reserves, such as: fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration, and foreign exchange movements within other operating income and expenses.\nA non-cash income tax benefit of US$29.7 million was recognized in the nine months of FY2018 in relation to the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet during the period, primarily due to a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized as a result of changes in tax rates. On December 22, 2017, the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which changed many aspects of United States corporate income taxation, including a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nA non-cash income tax benefit of US$9.3 million was recognized in the nine months of FY2017 in relation to the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet during the period.\nThe net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was US$14.5 million, or 3.12 cents loss per share, for the nine months of FY2018, compared with US$49.6 million, or 12.75 cents loss per share, for the nine months of FY2017.\nConference Call Details\nThere will be a webcast today on the financial results beginning at 6:30 pm ET on Wednesday, May 30, 2018; 8:30 am Thursday, May 31, 2018 AEST.\nThe live webcast can be accessed via http://webcasting.brrmedia.com/broadcast/5b0b3e055f522f0d08dbbb1c\nTo access the call only, dial 1 855 881 1339 (U.S.), 1 800 558 698 (toll-free Australia) or +61 2 9007 3187 (outside of the U.S. and Australia).
