    "text": "LONDON and NEW YORK,\nNeudata is very pleased to announce that Jan Scibor-Kaminski has joined the company as Managing Director. Jan was previously Managing Director of Structured Retail Products (SRP) - the foremost data business for the structured products industry and part of the Euromoney Institutional Investor group.\n\"I am excited to be joining such a talented, young, vibrant company in what is the most fast-paced and dynamic sector of the financial services industry: alternative data has disruptive capability for managers and investors alike and it is fascinating to be able to play a small part in shaping this nascent, game-changing industry\" said Jan Scibor-Kaminski. \"I look forward to working closely with quantitative and fundamental fund managers and with the Neudata team to develop some groundbreaking alt data products and services.\"\n\"Jan brings with him a track record of double-digit growth when it comes to data businesses achieved through innovative product development. Jan has spent the last 10 years working consultatively with the major derivatives desks of investment banks, asset managers, hedge funds, insurance companies and index providers to pioneer new products such as APIs and research products. We look forward to seeing Jan make a similar contribution to the alternative data space\" said Rado Lipuš, CEO of Neudata.\nJan has also worked for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, is a former member of Her Majesty's Armed Forces and holds a degree in Modern Languages from Trinity College, Oxford.\nAbout Neudata\nNeudata, headquartered in London with offices in New York City and Geneva, vets alternative data and conducts agnostic and independent research for investment managers.
