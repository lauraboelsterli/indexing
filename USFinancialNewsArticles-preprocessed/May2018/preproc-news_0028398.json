    "text": "ISTANBUL, May 10 (Reuters) - Turkish state lender Halkbank lowered its interest rate for housing loans with a maximum maturity of 10 years and an amount of up to 500,000 lira to a monthly 0.98 percent, the bank said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe move comes after President Tayyip Erdogan and his economic team advised banks to ease real estate borrowing in a meeting on Wednesday. According to Halkbankâ€™s website, the monthly rate stood at 1.16 percent.\nZiraat Bankasi also lowered the interest rate on similar housing loans to a monthly 0.98 percent.
