    "text": "BOULDER, Colo., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaia, Inc. (NASDAQ:GAIA), a conscious media and community company, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter\n70% subscriber growth generated 75% increase in streaming revenues Total revenues up 66% Gross margin up 100 basis points to 86.8%\n“We began 2018 on a strong note, achieving our subscriber growth target, which is ahead of the pace required to achieve our 2019 goal,” said Jirka Rysavy, Gaia’s CEO, “delivering another quarter of continued predictability.”\nGaia’s paying subscriber count increased to 421,000 on March 31, 2018, from 364,500 on December 31, 2017, and up 70% from 247,300 on March 31, 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues in the first quarter increased 66% to $9.6 million from $5.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was due to 75% growth in streaming revenues, which was driven by the 70% increase in paying subscribers versus March 31, 2017.\nGross profit in the first quarter increased 68% to $8.3 million compared to $5.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 86.8% from 85.8% in the first quarter of 2017 due to increased revenues and continued cost efficiency in Gaia’s original content investments. Gaia expects to maintain gross margins at this level through 2018.\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter were $16.2 million compared to $11.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to the planned marketing expense increases associated with accelerated subscriber growth. Customer acquisition costs as a percentage of streaming revenue declined to 109% in the first quarter of 2018 from 121% in the year-ago quarter, despite increasing the subscriber growth rate to 70% in the current quarter from 58% in the year-ago quarter.\nNet loss in the first quarter was $6.0 million, or $(0.39) per share, compared to a net loss of $6.2 million, or $(0.41) per share, in the year-ago quarter.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Gaia had $50.7 million in cash compared to $32.8 million at the end of 2017. On March 26, 2018, Gaia closed an oversubscribed public offering of Class A common stock, issuing 2.68 million shares, which included the full over-allotment. Gaia intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $37 million for working capital purposes. A majority of Gaia’s board of directors and executive management team participated in the offering. Gaia also paid off the $12.5 million outstanding on its line of credit as of December 31, 2017 during the quarter.\nGaia management will be presenting at the 19 th Annual B Riley FBR Institutional Investor Conference on May 23 and 24, 2018 in Santa Monica, CA.\nConference Call\nGaia is hosting a conference call today, May 7, 2018, beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET (2:30 p.m. MT).
