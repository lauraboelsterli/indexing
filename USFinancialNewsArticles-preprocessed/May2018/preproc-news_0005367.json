    "text": "SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Odonate Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ODT), a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of best-in-class therapeutics that improve and extend the lives of patients with cancer, today announced financial results for the three months .\nAs of March 31, 2018, Odonate had $195.2 million in cash, compared to $198.1 million as of December 31, 2017. This decrease in cash resulted primarily from net cash used in operating activities of $12.5 million, less net proceeds of $9.8 million from the sale of common stock to the underwriters in our initial public offering in connection with the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. Odonate’s net loss for the three months was $16.9 million, or $0.69 per share, compared to $2.7 million, or $0.26 per share, for the same period in 2017.\n“We are excited to have recently initiated CONTESSA, our Phase 3 study investigating tesetaxel in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer,” said Kevin Tang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Odonate. “Despite recent advances in the treatment of advanced breast cancer, there remains a significant need for new therapies that allow patients to maintain a better quality of life. We are hopeful that tesetaxel’s oral bioavailability, low pill burden, lack of history of hypersensitivity reactions and robust activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumors seen in prior studies may translate into significant benefits for patients.”\nAbout Tesetaxel\nTesetaxel is an investigational, orally administered chemotherapy agent that belongs to a class of drugs known as taxanes, which are widely used in the treatment of cancer. Tesetaxel has several potential therapeutic advantages over currently available taxanes, including: oral administration with a low pill burden and a patient-friendly dosing regimen; no history of hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions; and robust activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumors. More than 500 patients have been treated with tesetaxel across 22 clinical studies. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC), tesetaxel was shown to have robust single-agent antitumor activity in two, multicenter, Phase 2 studies.\nAbout CONTESSA\nCONTESSA is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study of tesetaxel, an investigational, orally administered taxane, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). CONTESSA will compare tesetaxel dosed orally at 27 mg/m 2 on the first day of a 21-day cycle plus a reduced dose of capecitabine (1,650 mg/m 2 /day dosed orally on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle) to the approved dose of capecitabine alone (2,500 mg/m 2 /day dosed orally on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle) in approximately 600 patients randomized 1:1 with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, hormone receptor (HR) positive MBC previously treated with a taxane in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy agent that is considered a standard-of-care treatment in MBC. Where indicated, patients must have received endocrine therapy with or without a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRC). CONTESSA’s secondary efficacy endpoints are overall survival, objective response rate (ORR) assessed by IRC, disease control rate assessed by IRC and patient-reported outcomes.
