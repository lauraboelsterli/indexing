Tennis - ATP 1000 - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 13, 2018 Germany's Alexander Zverev celebrates winning the final against Austria's Dominic Thiem REUTERS/Sergio Perez\nThe second seed broke a nervy-looking Thiem in the opening game thanks to a double-fault and was never really challenged as he claimed his third Masters 1000 title. Related Coverage\nZverev, 21, broke again right at the start of the second but squandered the chance of a double-break two games later as Thiem, conqueror of Rafael Nadal in the last eight, hung on. Slideshow (5 Images)\nThere was no chance of a let-up from Zverev though and he remained focussed throughout, winning on his first match point when his Austrian opponent returned long.\nZverev did not face a single break point as he became only the fifth active player to win at least three Masters 1000 titles — joining the ‘big four’ of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray.
