REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo\nThe council now needs to approve 100,000 euros (87,722 pounds) of funding for a feasibility study with organisers of the all-electric city-based series.\nThere was no immediate comment from Formula E.\nFormula E has already announced that the opening round of the 2018-19 season will be held in the Saudi Arabian city of Riyadh, and is in discussions with a number of undisclosed locations.\nA full calendar is due to be published in June.\nMayor Abdulah Skaka said bringing a race to Sarajevo, whose plight became synonymous with a 44-month siege by Bosnian Serb forces during the Bosnian war in the 1990s, would boost tourism and the economy.\nNearly 500,000 international and local visitors came to the Sarajevo region last year, up 22 percent from 2016, according to city authorities.\nDespite boasting some of the largest green areas in the region, Sarajevo lies in a valley surrounded by high mountains and is notoriously prone to fog.\nHeavy traffic, poor spatial planning and solid-fuel based heating are mostly to blame for the poor air quality.
