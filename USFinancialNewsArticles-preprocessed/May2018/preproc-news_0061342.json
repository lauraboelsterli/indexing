    "text": "PARIS, May 29 (Reuters) - Vivendi’s Canal Plus said on Tuesday it would consider the possibility of sub-licensing to broadcast French “Ligue 1” soccer games after the summer of 2020, after the French media group ended up empty-handed in a broadcasting rights auction.\nThe pay-TV channel, which has historically shown major French soccer games, will also consider taking legal action to challenge the auction’s result, Canal Plus general manager Maxime Saada said in a call with reporters.
