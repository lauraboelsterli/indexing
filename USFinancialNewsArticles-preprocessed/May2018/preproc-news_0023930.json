    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 6:25 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago U.S., UAE sign pact to resolve airline competition claims -sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nWASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - The United States and United Arab Emirates signed a deal on Friday to resolve U.S. claims that Gulf carriers have received unfair government subsidies, sources briefed on the matter said.\nThe voluntary agreement, which applies to Etihad and Emirates airline and is expected to be announced next week, is similar to a deal announced in January between the United States and Qatar in which Qatar agreed to release detailed financial information about state-owned Qatar Airways. Since 2015 the largest U.S. carriers have urged the U.S. government to challenge the conduct of the three major Middle Eastern carriers under “Open Skies” agreements. The U.S. airlines contend the Gulf carriers are being unfairly subsidized by their governmentsm with more than $50 billion in subsidies over the last decade.
