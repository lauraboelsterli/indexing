    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer, said on Tuesday it had decided not to go ahead with plans to develop projects in Iran at the moment due to the threat of U.S. sanctions, a company official said.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Russian oil company Lukoil is seen on a board at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2017 (SPIEF 2017) in St. Petersburg, Russia, June 1, 2017. Picture taken June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin The United States plans to impose new sanctions on Iran after pulling out of a 2015 agreement between Iran and major world powers to limit Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.\n“Considering the latest developments, I guess, it’s too early to say what our plans (about Iran) will be. For the moment, basically, we have everything on hold,” the official told a conference call which followed publication of Lukoil’s first-quarter results on Monday.\nA general view shows a gas facility of Lukoil company in Jarkuduk, Uzbekistan September 23, 2017.

REUTERS/Olesya Astakhova Lukoil said on Monday its first-quarter net profit rose to 109.1 billion rubles ($1.8 billion), up 75 percent on the previous year with the help of rising oil prices.\nThe official said that company’s focus remained on its domestic business. “We don’t plant to do anything material on the international M&A side,” he said.\nLukoil has been in talks with Iran over development of Abe Timur and Mansuri oilfields.\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin.
