At least 200 people have died from listeria in South Africa since January 2017.\nThe company’s headline earnings per share rose 14 percent to 541.2 cents. Headline earnings per share is the main profit measure in South Africa and strips out certain one-off items.\nSPAR shares, which had fallen by 2.4 percent over the past year, were up 2.68 percent at 1004 GMT.
