    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â€” The granddaughter of Bob Marley and her two friends say they want police and a neighbor held accountable regarding a burglary that was reported when they were leaving a California rental home.\nDonisha Prendergast, Kelly Fyffe Marshall and Komi-Oluwa Olafimihan (Oh-la-FEE'-Me-Hahn) say they were leaving the Airbnb rental in Rialto, California as planned April 30 when multiple police cars arrived. The three were accused of lying when they explained their presence. Rialto police say the department's response was polite and brief.\nAn attorney for the three called for an investigation into how police handled the situation and suggested the neighbor who called 911 should be investigated for filing a false report. The woman claimed there was a burglary in progress. Prendergast, Marshall and Olafimihan are black; the neighbor is white and hasn't been identified.",
