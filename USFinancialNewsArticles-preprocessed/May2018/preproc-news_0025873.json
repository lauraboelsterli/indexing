That requirement stood at 67.4 percent for Otkritie Holding alone at the start of the year.\nOtkritie’s management, led by former VTB executive Mikhail Zadornov, plans to cut non-performing loans to 256.3 billion roubles and the ones it could sell to 99.3 billion roubles in 2018, the document showed. It did not explain how the bank was going to do this.\n$1 = 61.7105 roubles Reporting by Tatiana Voronova Writing by Katya Golubkova Editing by Louise Heavens\n ",
