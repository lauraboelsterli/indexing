In this role, she identifies and develops new markets and service offerings for the company, which provides Medicare Secondary Payer compliance services and Medicare Set-Asides.\n“Kathleen is a great addition to Tower,” said CEO Rita Wilson. “Her extensive background in MSP compliance and her ability to guide clients toward claims resolution align well with Tower’s consultative approach to optimize settlement outcomes.”\nLosada has been involved in the development and implementation of MSP compliance services for the past decade. Most recently she served as vice president of business development for NuQuest/Bridge Pointe.\nHer 25-year career includes a leadership role with MTI America, which offers transportation, translation, home health, and diagnostic imaging services to workers’ compensation payers.
