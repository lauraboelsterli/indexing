    "text": "SHENZHEN, China, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Xunlei Limited (“Xunlei” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:XNET), a leading cloud-based acceleration technology company in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nTotal revenues were US$78.8 million, representing an increase of 117.9% from the corresponding period of last year and a decrease of 4.4% from the previous quarter. Cloud computing and other internet value-added services (“Cloud computing and IVAS”) revenues were US$48.1 million, representing an increase of 316.4% from the corresponding period of last year and a decrease of 7.3% from the previous quarter. Cloud computing revenues grew by 395.3% and 9.4% on a year-over-year basis and sequential basis, respectively. Cloud computing and IVAS mainly consist of cloud computing business and live streaming business. Subscription revenues were US$23.4 million, representing an increase of 12.3% from the corresponding period of last year and an increase of 3.0% from the previous quarter. Online advertising revenues (consisting primarily of revenues from mobile advertising) were US$7.3 million, representing an increase of 92.2% from the corresponding period of last year and a decrease of 6.8% from the previous quarter.\nRecent Developments:\nExtended cloud services from CDN domain to IaaS domain through our new cloud platform StellarCloud and the services can be exchanged for with the LinkToken; Launched a high-performance blockchain infrastructure ThunderChain capable of conducting millions of transactions per second (TPS); Started co-operation with third-party partners to develop ThunderChain applications; and Received a new national CDN license that allows us to offer CDN solutions from selected cities to mainland China.\nMr. Lei Chen, Chief Executive Officer of Xunlei, stated: “We are very pleased to report that we recorded a net income of US$8.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 following a profitable previous quarter. We achieved solid performance in the first quarter despite the seasonality impact as a result of the Chinese New Year holidays. Going forward, we will continue to invest in shared computing technology and expand our service portfolio. We are also very excited about the prospects of building a Xunlei blockchain ecosystem. And finally, we will expand into overseas markets to seek new growth opportunities. I look forward to reporting to you our progress in the coming days.”\nFirst Quarter 201 8 Financial Results\nTotal Revenues 1\nTotal revenues were US$78.8 million, representing an increase of 117.9% on a year-over-year basis, and a decrease of 4.4% on a sequential basis. The increase in total revenues on a year-over-year basis was mainly attributable to the growth of our cloud computing, live streaming and mobile advertising businesses. The slight decrease in total revenues on a sequential basis was mainly due to a technology solution service income generated from a previous service cooperation between Xiaomi and us in an amount of US$5.8 million. If such US$5.8 million service income had not been recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, the total revenues in the first quarter of 2018 would have increased 2.8% sequentially.\nCloud computing and IVAS: Revenues from cloud computing and IVAS were US$48.1 million, representing an increase of 316.4% on a year-over-year basis and a decrease of 7.3% on a sequential basis. Cloud computing revenues grew by 395.3% and 9.4% on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, respectively.\nSubscription: Revenues from subscriptions were US$23.4 million, representing an increase of 12.3% on a year-over-year basis and an increase of 3.0% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year increase in subscription revenue was primarily attributable to increase in average revenue per subscriber. The average revenue per subscriber for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB 38.8, representing an increase from RMB 34.4 as of December 31, 2017 and RMB 35.1 as of March 31, 2017, respectively. The number of subscribers was 3.81 million as of March 31, 2018, representing a decrease from 4.25 million as of December 31, 2017 and 4.08 million as of March 31, 2017, respectively.\nOnline advertising (primarily mobile advertising): Revenues from online advertising were US$7.3 million, representing an increase of 92.2% on a year-over-year basis and a decrease of 6.8% on a sequential basis. Mobile advertising revenue increased by 95.4% on a year-over-year basis.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues were US$40.5 million, representing 51.5% of our total revenues.\nBandwidth costs: Bandwidth costs were US$16.5 million, representing 20.9% of our total revenues, compared with US$14.7 million or 17.9% of the total revenues in the previous quarter. The remaining costs of the revenues mainly consisted of the manufacturing costs for our OneThing Cloud smart device and the revenue-sharing costs for our live streaming product.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit for the first quarter was US$37.7 million, a decrease of 5.2% compared with the previous quarter. Gross margin was 47.8% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 48.2% in the previous quarter.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were US$16.5 million, representing 20.9% of our total revenues, compared with US$20.6 million or 24.9% of our total revenues in the previous quarter. The decrease on a sequential basis was mainly due to the staff performance incentive for the year 2017 accrued in the previous quarter.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were US$6.8 million, representing 8.6% of our total revenues, compared with US$7.5 million or 9.1% of our total revenues in the previous quarter.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter were US$7.0 million, representing 8.9% of our total revenues, compared with US$7.7 million or 9.4% of our total revenues in the previous quarter.\nOperating Income/( Loss )\nOperating income was US$7.4 million, compared with operating income of US$3.9 million in the previous quarter.\nNet Income/( Loss ) and Earning/( Loss ) Per Share\nNet income from continuing operations was US$6.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with US$3.0 million in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was US$7.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with US$4.8 million in the previous quarter.\nDiluted earnings per ADS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2018 was US$0.10 as compared with a loss of US$0.14 in the same period last year and an income of US$0.05 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCash Balance and Short-Term Investments\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$355.6 million, compared with US$372.4 million as of December 31, 2017.\nGuidance for Second Quarter 201 8\nFor the second quarter of 2018, Xunlei estimates total revenues to be between US$56 million and US$62 million, and the midpoint of the range represents a year-over-year increase of approximately 53.2%.
