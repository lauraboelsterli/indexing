A boy touches a LEGO brick mosaic of Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in Windsor, Britain, May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Marko Djurica\nTraditionally the monarch bestows titles on princes and their spouses in the day of their wedding.\nHarry was also named Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel, in keeping with the tradition of awarding titles from different constituent parts of the United Kingdom.\nThe royal duchy of Sussex was created by George III for his fifth son Augustus Frederick in 1801. Augustus died without having any children in 1843 when the dukedom became extinct. Reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Estelle Shirbon",
