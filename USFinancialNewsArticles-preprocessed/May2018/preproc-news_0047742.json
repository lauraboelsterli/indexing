    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 3:19 PM / in 11 minutes Austria's OMV stands by Iran project but no investment yet Kirsti Knolle 3 Min Read\nVIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian energy group OMV is continuing with planned Iranian energy projects despite the United States’ withdrawal from a nuclear pact with Tehran, but said on Tuesday it had made no investments there yet.

REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader/File Photo\nEuropean firms doing business in Iran face U.S. sanctions after President Donald Trump withdrew from a deal between the U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Russia, China and Iran, which lifted sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program.\nThe other signatories have indicated that they hope to salvage the deal. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire brought up the idea that the European Union could compensate European companies that might face U.S. sanctions.\nLast week, French energy giant Total joined other European companies in signaling a possible exit from Iran in light of Trump’s decision.\nOMV was monitoring political developments in the U.S. and the European Union very closely, OMV’s upstream chief Johann Pleininger told its annual shareholder meeting in Vienna.\n“The project has not come to a standstill, it is continuing,” Pleininger said with regard to Iran, adding that “no investments have been made yet”.\nThe Austrian group, which generates the bulk of its profit in Europe, started operations in Iran in 2001 as the operator of the Mehr exploration block in the west of the country.\nOMV halted operations in 2006 due to sanctions, but following sanctions relief it signed in May 2016 a memorandum with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for projects located in the Zagros area in the west and the Fars field in the south, where foreign firms often need a local partner.\nIn June 2017, OMV and Russia’s Gazprom Neft announced a memorandum of understanding to work in Iran’s oil sector.\nAt last year’s shareholders meeting, Pleininger said the NIOC still owed OMV $48 million. OMV bought Iranian crude oil in April, a spokesman said this month but did give any more detail.\nOMV is Austria’s former state petroleum company and the government still holds a 31.5 percent stake. Its second-biggest investor is Abu Dhabi industrial group Mubadala Investment with 24.9 percent. Reporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Adrian Croft and Alexander Smith",
