This $11.4 million decrease or approximately 84% is primarily associated with the decline in revenues earned by the Infrastructure Segment as a result of supplier credit issues and a $2.0 million decrease in revenue resulting from the adoption of the new ASC 606 revenue recognition policy beginning in January 2018.

While management has based any forward-looking statements included in this release on its current expectations, the information on which such expectations were based may change. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of the control of Inpixon and its subsidiaries, which could cause actual results to materially differ from such statements. Such risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, but are not limited to, the fluctuation of global economic conditions, the performance of management and employees, the Company’s ability to obtain financing, competition, general economic conditions and other factors that are detailed in the Company’s periodic and current reports available for review at www.sec.gov . Furthermore, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment where new and unanticipated risks may arise. Accordingly, investors should not place any reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We disclaim any intention to, and undertake no obligation to, update or revise forward-looking statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement believes that certain financial measures not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP””) are useful measures of operations. EBIDTA, Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma net loss per share are non-GAAP measures. Inpixon defines “EBITDA” as net income (loss) before interest, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as the matrix in which it manages the business and Inpixon defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA plus adjustments for other income or expense items, non-recurring items and non-cash stock-based compensation. Inpixon defines “pro forma net loss per share” as GAAP net loss per share adjusted for adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and one time charges including gain/loss on the settlement of obligations, extinguishment loss for debt modification, goodwill impairment, severance costs, change in the fair value of shares to be issued, acquisition costs and the costs associated with the public offering.\nManagement provides Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma net loss per share measures so that investors will have the same financial information that management uses, which may assist investors in assessing Inpixon’s performance on a period-over-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA or pro forma net loss per share is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measure of performance under GAAP, or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma net loss per share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Inpixon’s results as reported under GAAP.\nContact\nInpixon Investor Relations:\nCORE IR\nScott Arnold, Managing Director\n+1 516-222-2560\ncoreir.com\nINPIXON AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands, except number of shares and par value data) March 31, 2018 2017 ASSETS Current Assets 6,694 $ 141 Accounts receivable, net 1,202 2,310 Notes and other receivables 218 183 Inventory 863 790 Prepaid licenses and maintenance contracts -- 4,638 Assets held for sale -- 23 Prepaid assets and other current assets 1,643 1,123 Total Current Assets 10,620 9,208 Prepaid licenses and maintenance contracts, non-current -- 2,264 Property and equipment, net 419 520 Software development costs, net 1,772 2,017 Intangible assets, net 11,355 12,678 Goodwill 636 636 Other assets 350 368 Total Assets $ 25,152 $ 27,691 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT Current Liabilities Accounts payable $ 22,020 $ 25,834 Accrued liabilities 1,724 5,421 Deferred revenue 27 5,611 Short-term debt 1,828 3,058 Derivative liabilities -- 48 Liabilities held for sale -- 2,059 Total Current Liabilities 25,599 42,031 Long Term Liabilities Deferred revenue, non-current -- 2,636 Long-term debt 142 767 Other liabilities 108 113 Acquisition liability - Integrio 420 997 Total Liabilities 26,269 46,544 Commitments and Contingencies Stockholders’ Deficit: Preferred Stock - $0.001 par value; 5,000,000 shares authorized, 0 issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 -- -- Series 3 Convertible Preferred Stock - $1,000 stated value; 10,185 shares authorized; 411.25 and 0 issued and 411.25 and 0 outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
