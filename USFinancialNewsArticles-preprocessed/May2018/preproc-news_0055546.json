    "text": "LINDON, Utah, May 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KAILO Energy, a Global Unicorn Holdings company (OTC PINK:GUHI), announced today that it has shipped its first customer orders for the new PowerBox home battery backup system. In addition, Ryan D. Shepherd has been promoted from President to Chief Executive Officer of KAILO. Shepherd will replace Dr. Vaughn R Cook and will immediately resume the day to day operations and executive duties. Dr. Cook will retain his role as Chairman of the Board for KAILO Energy, and will refocus his efforts as CEO and Chairman of Global Unicorn Holdings, Inc., the parent company for KAILO.\n\"Ryan is incredibly competent and has been the driving force in developing KAILO clean energy products,” said Cook. He has proven his leadership ability and I am confident that KAILO will experience amazing growth in sales, while continuing to develop new and exciting opportunities in the clean energy space.”\nThe PowerBox is a portable home battery backup system that allows home users to power essential electric systems when the power is out. Fulfilling the first orders for the new PowerBox is a significant milestone that represents many months of product development, supply channel development and manufacturing preparation to make sure that the product meets KAILO’s high standard of quality.\nPowerBox production and shipments will ramp up quickly as KAILO meets the challenges associated with production startup and inventory demands. Pre-order sales are expected to be completed by mid-June. In addition, new sales positions are being filled to continue to promote and sell the PowerBox.\n“Dr. Cook’s leadership has propelled KAILO through the development process and we will continue to build on the foundation he has established,” explained Shepherd. “We have a great product that I believe will significantly improve the lives of our customers.”\nAbout:\nKAILO Energy, a Global Unicorn Holdings company, manufactures high-tech residential batteries and energy management solutions for home owners around the world. The KAILO backup system enables essential items in your home to remain running even when the power is out.
