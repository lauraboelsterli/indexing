    "text": "First Quarter 2018 Performance Sales of $1.12 billion, consistent with guidance GAAP operating income of $104 million and non-GAAP adjusted operating income (excluding special items) of $189 million GAAP net income of $0.17 per diluted share Non-GAAP adjusted net income (excluding special items) of $0.49 per diluted share, consistent with guidance\nHICKORY, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: COMM), a global leader in infrastructure solutions for communications networks, reported sales of $1.12 billion and net income of $34 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $95 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. A reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP results is attached.\nIn comparison, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, CommScope reported sales of $1.14 billion and net income of $34 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $103 million, or $0.52 per diluted share.\n“CommScope delivered first quarter results consistent with our expectations, and we are encouraged by the growing market demand for our Mobility Solutions products,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Eddie Edwards. “We remain confident in our ability to deliver sales and earnings growth this year, despite higher input costs and expectations for price changes at certain large North American operators. As we move through 2018 and 2019, we are collaborating with these large customers to lower their total cost of ownership with an aim to driving incremental sales opportunities, ensuring we retain our industry-leading position. As we look to mitigate these changes in pricing, we are focused on realizing further, significant cost reductions over the short- and long-term.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Overview\nSales were consistent with expectations and declined 1 percent year over year as growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific regions was more than offset by lower sales in the U.S. Net sales in most major international regions increased, primarily driven by the 2.4 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange rates as compared to the prior year period.\nGAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2018 declined 14 percent year over year to $104 million. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization of purchased intangibles, integration and transaction costs, restructuring costs and other special items, declined 13 percent year over year to $189 million. The decreases in operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income were primarily driven by lower sales volumes, reductions in certain selling prices and higher material costs. These were partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Segment Overview\nFirst quarter Connectivity Solutions segment sales decreased 1 percent year over year to $674 million with broad-based international growth more than offset by declines in the U.S. The international growth was primarily driven by the 2.4 percent favorable impact from foreign exchange rate changes from the prior year period.\nConnectivity Solutions GAAP operating income increased 13 percent year over year to $53 million, while non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased 5 percent year over year to $109 million. GAAP operating income improved largely due to lower integration costs. The decrease in non-GAAP adjusted operating income was primarily driven by reductions in certain selling prices and higher material costs, partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives.\nFirst quarter Mobility Solutions segment sales declined 2 percent year over year to $447 million. Year-over-year growth in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions was more than offset by lower sales in the U.S. The international growth was primarily driven by the 2.5 percent favorable impact from foreign exchange rate changes compared to the year-ago period. Sequentially, Mobility Solutions sales increased 5 percent with a growing North American backlog.\nMobility Solutions GAAP operating income declined 31 percent year over year to $51 million, and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased 21 percent year over year to $80 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted operating income were impacted by lower sales volumes and unfavorable geographic and product mix.\nOutlook\nCommScope management revised its outlook primarily to reflect the price reductions at certain large North American operators expected in 2018 and 2019, as well as higher input costs. The company is taking action to mitigate these customer price changes through additional cost reduction initiatives, including manufacturing optimization, value engineering projects and additional product in-sourcing. The company provided the following second quarter and full year 2018 guidance.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance:\nRevenue of $1.21 billion – $1.26 billion Operating income of $151 million – $166 million Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $230 million – $250 million Non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate of 29 percent – 30 percent Earnings per diluted share of $0.31 – $0.34, based on 196 million weighted average diluted shares Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.63 – $0.68\nFull Year 2018 Guidance:\nRevenue of $4.675 billion – $4.825 billion Operating income of $545 million – $590 million Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $870 million – $920 million Non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate of 29 percent – 30 percent Earnings per diluted share of $1.20 – $1.32, based on 196 million weighted average diluted shares Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.33 – $2.48 Cash flow from operations > $550 million\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP outlook is attached.\nCommScope Investor Day\nCommScope is hosting an investor day for the financial community at its facility in Shakopee, MN, on Wednesday, June 13, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. CT.

CommScope management further believes that these financial measures are useful in assessing CommScope’s operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. CommScope management also uses certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring CommScope’s performance relative to that of its competitors. CommScope management believes these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate CommScope’s performance and that of its competitors. However, CommScope’s use of the terms non-GAAP adjusted operating income, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share may vary from that of others in its industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release or any other oral or written statements made by us or on our behalf may include forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
