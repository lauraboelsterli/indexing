    "text": "2018 First Quarter Highlights\nNet sales of $536.3 million, an increase of 11.9% compared to the prior year period Base business net sales of $485.2 million, an increase of 4.9% compared to the prior year period Net loss of $1.1 million compared to net income of $3.9 million in the prior year period Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $35.0 million Completed two acquisitions in the quarter\nTUSTIN, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Foundation Building Materials, Inc. (NYSE:FBM), one of the largest specialty building product distributors of wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and mechanical insulation in North America, today reported first quarter 2018 financial results.\n“We recorded a solid quarter of operational and financial performance, highlighted by year-over-year net sales growth of 12%, and base business growth of 5%, with good performance from both our Specialty Building Products and Mechanical Insulation business segments,” said Ruben Mendoza, President and CEO. “Despite adverse weather early in the year, we finished the quarter strong, and we look forward to building on this positive momentum in the business as we continue to deliver long-term value to our customers and stockholders.”\n2018 First Quarter Results\nConsolidated net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $536.3 million compared to $479.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $56.8 million, or 11.9%. Base business net sales increased $22.5 million, or 4.9%, to $485.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nConsolidated gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $154.4 million compared to $139.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $14.5 million, or 10.4%. Consolidated gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 28.8% compared to 29.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a change in product mix with a higher contribution from suspended ceilings systems and mechanical insulation on a percentage of net sales basis.\nSelling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $121.4 million compared to $113.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $8.4 million, or 7.4.%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 22.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 23.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Excluding non-recurring expenses, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were 22.3% compared to 22.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to our continued focus on operating efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives.\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.1 million, or $0.02 loss per share, a decrease of $5.0 million compared to net income of $3.9 million, or $0.11 earnings per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in gains from derivatives of $13.1 million, partially offset by higher income from operations of $4.7 million and lower income taxes of $3.4 million. Adjusted net income (1) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.4 million, or $0.01 adjusted earnings per share (1) , an increase of $1.2 million compared to an adjusted net loss (1) of $0.8 million, or $0.02 adjusted loss per share (1) , for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) was $35.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) was 6.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n2018 First Quarter Segment Results\nSpecialty Building Products (“SBP”). SBP net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $463.7 million compared to $418.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $45.2 million, or 10.8%. Net sales from acquired branches and existing branches that were strategically combined with acquired branches contributed $32.0 million of the increase.\nSBP gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $134.4 million compared to $122.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $12.0 million, or 9.8%. SBP gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 29.0% compared to 29.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a change in product mix with a higher contribution from lower gross margin products such as suspended ceilings systems, on a percentage of net sales basis.\nMechanical Insulation (“MI”). MI net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $72.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $11.6 million, or 19.1%. Base business net sales contributed $9.3 million of the increase, primarily due to higher net sales to industrial end markets.\nMI gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $20.0 million compared to $17.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $2.5 million, or 14.4%. MI gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 27.5% compared to 28.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a higher contribution from large industrial projects for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which generally have lower margins relative to the overall MI segment.\nAcquisitions\nDuring the first quarter the Company completed two acquisitions totaling seven branches. For 2018, these two acquisitions are expected to contribute $27.0 million to $29.0 million to net sales. Foundation Building Materials will continue to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions.\nExpected Debt Refinancing\nThe Company is actively exploring the refinancing of its $575.0 million 8.25% senior secured notes due 2021, or Notes. In the third quarter of 2018, the prepayment premium of the Notes will decrease, and the Company believes it will have opportunities to refinance the Notes, which could provide estimated annual cash interest savings of $12.0 million to $15.0 million. As Foundation Building Materials continues to optimize its capital structure and operating efficiencies, the Company expects its generation of cash flow to improve, which will allow the Company to further reduce its leverage over the next couple of years.\nFirst Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call\nIn conjunction with this release, Foundation Building Materials, Inc. will host a conference call today, Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 9:00 AM Eastern Time.

Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) Financial Measures\nIn addition to results under GAAP, this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), which are provided as supplemental measures of financial performance. These measures are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We calculate EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest expense net, income tax (benefit) expense, and depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before unrealized gains on derivative financial instruments, IPO and public company readiness expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-recurring adjustments such as non-cash purchase accounting effects, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, transaction costs and management fees. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We calculate Adjusted net income (loss) as net (loss) income before unrealized gains on derivative financial instruments, IPO and public company readiness expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-recurring adjustments such as non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, transaction costs, and management fees. We calculate Adjusted EPS as Adjusted net income (loss) on a per weighted average share outstanding basis.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EPS are presented because they are important metrics used by management as a means by which it assesses financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EPS are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. These measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, provides investors with an additional financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing our company and its results of operations.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income and earnings per share, or as any other measure of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EPS also should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EPS are not intended to be liquidity measures. Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use these measures or may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nThe following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure, net (loss) income (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands) Net (loss) income $ (1,053 ) $ 3,929 Interest expense, net 15,111 15,214 Income tax (benefit) expense (885 ) 2,564 Depreciation and amortization 19,886 18,396 EBITDA 33,059 40,103 Unrealized gain on derivative financial instruments (74 ) (13,219 ) IPO and public company readiness expenses 89 2,975 Stock-based compensation 271 1,553 Non-cash purchase accounting effects (a) 407 71 Loss on disposal of property and equipment 13 152 Transaction costs (b) 1,218 592 Management fees (c) — 353 Adjusted EBITDA $ 34,983 $ 32,580 Adjusted EBITDA margin (d) 6.5 % 6.8 % (a) Adjusts for the effect of the purchase accounting step-up in the value of inventory to fair value recognized in cost of goods sold as a result of acquisitions.
