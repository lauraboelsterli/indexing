    "text": "Las Vegas, Nevada, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- StereoVision Entertainment Inc. (OTC:SVSN) announced today that their majority-owned medical cannabis and industrial hemp company CannaVision has appointed Mr. Hemp, Michael Bowman, Chairman of their Board of Directors with immediate effect. CannaVision’s previous Chairman Dr. Jay Ellenby will continue devoting his time and energy to treating medical marijuana patients.\n“Our industrial hemp division is getting good traction so going forward industrial hemp will be our primary focus,” stated CannaVision Chief Operating Officer Steven Previch. “Until Florida gets their medical marijuana legislation corrected to where clinics become commercially viable, while we will continue to advocate for veteran’s right to choose medical marijuana over pharmaceuticals, we will be scaling back on our medical marijuana clinic plan in Florida.”\n“To lead us in our determination to compete in the global hemp industry there could not be a more perfect selection then Mr. Hemp himself, Michael Bowman,” said Previch. “We’re currently cultivating 400 acres of hemp on the Bowman Family Farm in Wray, Colorado with very favorable terms for the Company.”\n“Michael has been a driving force behind the hemp legalization effort in Washington D.C. with access at the highest levels as is exampled by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack dubbing Michael, ‘Mr. Hemp,’” continued Previch. “With Mitch McConnell advocating for the de-scheduling of hemp, our current 1,125 acres in Puerto Rico standing by awaiting our hemp farming permits, our 400 hemp farming permitted acres in Colorado, our REIT plan for purchasing irrigated farmland for favored nation leases to CannaVision moving forward, and other opportunities now becoming available, we believe this is an extremely opportune time to ramp up our efforts in the industrial hemp industry.”\nStereoVision. http://stereovision.com Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, StereoVision is a publicly traded Nevada corporation (OTC:SVSN) focused on creating, acquiring, and producing multimedia content with its media subsidiaries, the wholly owned 9 time Emmy Award-winning production/graphics company REZN8, http://rezn8.com , the majority-owned family entertainment company, Inspirational Vision Media Inc., http://ivmi.biz , and the majority-owned Florida medical marijuana clinic and hemp corp MediCannaVision, dba CannaVision. http://cannavisionclinics.com\nSafe Harbor Statement : Except for historical information certain statements in this news release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of Rule 175 under the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 3b-6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and those statements are subject to the safe harbor created by those rules.
