The company has commenced reporting US Dollar Annual Recurring Revenue base (“ARR”) at the end of each period as a key performance indicator. The increase in Q1 ARR was 5.9% continuing the growth trend going into Q2,” said Alvaro Pombo, CEO of ProntoForms. “We have proven that our platform is built for the enterprise, with the scalability, security, and cloud integrations that major global enterprises require. Our recurring revenue base now includes 11 customers that contribute more than $100,000 of ARR, which is up from 4 such customers at the end of Q1 last year. These same customers represent 19% of our recurring revenue base, up from 9% in Q1 of last year. This growth comes from both new enterprise customers and significant expansion from existing customers. Our growing roster of channel partners is also bringing us to opportunities where enterprise grade cloud-based mobile workflows are needed.”\nFinancial Highlights – 2018 First Quarter – Presented in US dollars\nRecurring revenue in Q1 2018 increased by 15% to $2,495,068, compared to $2,164,211 in Q1 2017, and increased by 5% compared to $2,376,458 in Q4 2017 Recurring revenue consisted of non-operator channel recurring revenue of $1,768,080 (32% growth vs. Q1 2017 and 7% growth vs. Q4 2017) and operator channel recurring revenue of $726,987 (12% decrease vs. Q1 2017 and effectively flat vs Q4 2017) Total revenue for Q1 2018 increased by 18% to $2,748,548, compared to $2,338,746 in Q1 2017, and increased by 4% compared to $2,648,687, in Q4 2017 Gross margin for Q1 2018 was 82% of total revenue compared to 83% in Q1 2017 and 80% in Q4 2017.
