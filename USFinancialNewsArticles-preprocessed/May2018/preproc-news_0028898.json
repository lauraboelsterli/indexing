    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Giulio Sapelli will not be the joint candidate of the 5-Star Movement and the League as Italy’s prime minister, a 5-Star source said, after the economics professor had announced he had been contacted for the job by both parties.\n“It will not be Sapelli,” said the 5-Star source, who asked not to be named.\nSapelli, a 71-year old professor in Milan, told Reuters earlier on Monday that had informed the two parties he was available.\nThe 5-Star Movement and League were near to a deal on Monday to form a coalition, though they had not announced their choice for prime minister. They are due to hold pivotal talks with the country’s president in the afternoon.\nReporting By Gavin Jones, editing by Steve Scherer\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
