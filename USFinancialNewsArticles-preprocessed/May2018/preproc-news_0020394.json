    "text": "BEIJING, May 8 (Reuters) - China’s April exports denominated in yuan rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier, the General Administration of Customs said on Tuesday, compared with a decline of 9.8 percent in March.\nYuan-denominated imports rose 11.6 percent last month, versus a 5.9 percent gain in March, resulting in a trade surplus of 182.8 billion yuan ($28.72 billion) for the period.\nChina’s trade performance has got off to a strong start this year, following through on a solid rebound in 2017, supported by sustained demand at home and abroad.\nBut the export outlook is being clouded by an escalating trade dispute with the United States, which could disrupt its shipments and supply chains, while a cooling property market may curb China’s demand for imported raw materials such as iron ore.\nCustoms is expected to release dollar-denominated trade data later on Tuesday.
