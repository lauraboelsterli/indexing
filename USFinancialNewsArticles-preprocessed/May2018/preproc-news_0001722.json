Segment profit for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by a provision for $74.5 million in legal settlements which was treated as an adjustment for non-GAAP measures.

Segment profit was $26.1 million and $21.2 million for second quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $32.5 million and $27.5 million for second quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018, net sales were $391.2 million, an increase of 18.1%, or $60.0 million, over the prior year period.

For the six months ended March 31, 2018, interest expense, net was $189.3 million, compared to $153.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase for both periods primarily related to an increase in the outstanding amount of debt principal, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate.

The net loss in the second quarter of 2018 was recorded in connection with (i) an opportunistic repricing of Post’s approximately $2.2 billion term loan, which reduced the interest rate applicable to the term loan by 25 basis points (0.25%), and (ii) Post’s early repayment through open market purchases of $112.0 million in total principal value of its 5.75% senior notes due 2027 and 8.00% senior notes due 2025. Additionally, the six months ended March 31, 2018 included a loss recorded in the first quarter of 2018 in connection with Post’s redemption of its 6.00% senior notes due 2022. The loss in the second quarter of 2017 and the six months ended March 31, 2017 was recorded in connection with Post’s redemption of its 6.75% senior notes due 2021 and 7.375% senior notes due 2022.\nOther income, net relates to non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate swaps.

For the six months ended March 31, 2018, income tax benefit was $231.9 million, compared to an expense of $43.9 million and an effective income tax rate of 30.6% for the six months ended March 31, 2017.

During the six months ended March 31, 2018, Post repurchased 1.8 million shares for $138.8 million at an average price of $75.57 per share.\nRecent Announcements\nOn January 12, 2018, Post completed the acquisition of Bob Evans, a leading producer and distributor of refrigerated potato, pasta and vegetable-based side dishes, pork sausage and a variety of refrigerated and frozen convenience food items.\nOn March 28, 2018, Post announced that one of its subsidiaries had confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) related to its proposed initial public offering for its private brands business. Post continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for its private brands business, as announced on January 11, 2018, and there can be no assurance that Post’s evaluation of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction or other action by Post.\nOn May 2, 2018, Post announced that its Board of Directors had approved a new $350 million share repurchase authorization, with repurchases occurring over a two year period beginning on May 7, 2018. As of May 2, 2018, Post had repurchased $488 million under its previous stock repurchase authorizations.\nOutlook\nPost management has affirmed its fiscal year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA range of $1.22-$1.25 billion, with modest favorability to the fourth quarter.\nIn fiscal year 2018, Post management expects to incur the following costs, which are treated as adjustments to non-GAAP measures:\n$25-$30 million of integration costs, comprised of severance, retention and third party consulting expenses; and $5-$7 million of restructuring and plant closure costs associated with the closure of the Clinton cereal facility, comprised of severance, retention and related expenses and accelerated depreciation.\nPost management has updated its fiscal year 2018 capital expenditures range to be between $245-$255 million. This includes requirements to complete the start-up and transfer of production to other facilities related to the Clinton cereal facility closure and $45-$50 million related to the previously announced cage-free housing conversion at the Bloomfield, Nebraska facility.\nThe Company provides Adjusted EBITDA guidance only on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide a reconciliation of its forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP guidance measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate swaps, provision for legal settlement, transaction and integration costs, restructuring and plant closure costs, assets held for sale, mark-to-market adjustments on commodity and foreign exchange hedges and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historical numbers, the amounts of which, based on historical experience, could be significant. For additional information regarding Post’s non-GAAP measures, see the related explanations presented under “Use of Non-GAAP Measures.”\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP measures in this release to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include total segment profit, Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA. The reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided later in this release under “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.”\nManagement uses certain of these non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA, as key metrics in the evaluation of underlying Company and segment performance, in making financial, operating and planning decisions and, in part, in the determination of cash bonuses for its executive officers and employees. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides increased transparency and assists investors in understanding the underlying operating performance of the Company and its segments and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. Non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude certain items as described later in this release. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. For additional information regarding the Company’s non-GAAP measures, see the related explanations provided under “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” later in this release.\nConference Call to Discuss Earnings Results and Outlook\nThe Company will host a conference call on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. EDT to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2018 outlook and to respond to questions.

These non-GAAP measures include total segment profit, Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA. The reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables following this section.\nNon-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude certain items as described below. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nTotal segment profit\nTotal segment profit represents the aggregation of the segment profit for each of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company believes total segment profit is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because it facilitates period-to-period comparison of results of segment operations.\nAdjusted net earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per common share\nThe Company believes Adjusted net earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per common share are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because they exclude items that affect the comparability of the Company’s financial results and could potentially distort an understanding of the trends in business performance.\nAdjusted net earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per common share are adjusted for the following items:\na. Non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate and cross-currency swaps : The Company has excluded the impact of non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate and cross-currency swaps due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to estimates of fair value and economic conditions and as the amount and frequency of such adjustments and settlements are not consistent. b. Payments of debt extinguishment costs, net : The Company has excluded payments and other expenses for premiums on debt extinguishment, net of gains realized on debt redeemed at a discount, as such payments are inconsistent in amount and frequency. Additionally, the Company believes that these costs do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods. c. Provision for legal settlement : The Company has excluded gains and losses recorded to recognize the anticipated or actual resolution of certain litigation as the Company believes such gains and losses do not reflect expected ongoing future operating income and expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods. d. Transaction costs and integration costs : The Company has excluded transaction costs related to professional service fees and other related costs associated with signed and closed business combinations and divestitures and integration costs incurred to integrate acquired or to-be-acquired businesses as the Company believes that these exclusions allow for more meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods. The Company believes such costs are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of acquired assets as part of the Company or the performance of the divested assets, and such costs are not factored into management’s evaluation of potential acquisitions or its performance after completion of an acquisition or the evaluation to divest an asset. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges varies significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures and the maturity of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions and divestitures, which often drive the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of future acquisitions or divestitures. By excluding these expenses, management is better able to evaluate the Company’s ability to utilize its existing assets and estimate the long-term value that acquired assets will generate for the Company. Furthermore, the Company believes that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. e. Restructuring and plant closure costs, including accelerated depreciation : The Company has excluded certain costs associated with facility closures as the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent. Additionally, the Company believes that these costs do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods. f. Assets held for sale : The Company has excluded adjustments recorded to adjust the carrying value of facilities and other assets classified as held for sale as such adjustments represent non-cash items and the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent. Additionally, the Company believes that these adjustments do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods. g. Inventory valuation adjustments on acquired businesses : The Company has excluded the impact of fair value step-up adjustments to inventory in connection with business combinations as such adjustments represent non-cash items, are not consistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of the Company’s acquisitions. h. Mark-to-market adjustments on commodity and foreign exchange hedges : The Company has excluded the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on commodity and foreign exchange hedges due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to fair value estimates. Additionally, these adjustments are primarily non-cash items and the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent. i. Foreign currency gains and losses on intercompany loans : The Company has excluded the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective legal entity in evaluating Company performance to allow for more meaningful comparisons of performance to other periods. j. Income tax : The Company has included the income tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments using its estimated blended annual income tax rate or its then statutory rate, as noted in the footnote of the reconciliation tables, as the Company believes that the Company’s GAAP effective income tax rate as reported is not representative of the income tax expense impact of the adjustments. k. U.S. tax reform net benefit : The Company has excluded the impact of the one-time income tax net benefit recorded in fiscal year 2018 which reflected (i) the benefit related to an estimate of the remeasurement of the Company’s existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering both the Company’s expected fiscal year 2018 blended U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and a 21% rate for subsequent fiscal years and (ii) the expense related to an estimate of a transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. The Company believes that the net benefit as reported is not representative of the Company’s current income tax position and exclusion of the benefit allows for more meaningful comparisons of performance to other periods. l. Preferred stock : The Company has included dividend and weighted-average diluted share adjustments related to its convertible preferred stock using the “if-converted” method when the convertible preferred stock is dilutive on an adjusted basis. Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA\nThe Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and liquidity because (i) we believe it is widely used to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, (ii) it presents a measure of corporate performance exclusive of the Company’s capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired and (iii) it is a financial indicator of a company’s ability to service its debt, as the Company is required to comply with certain covenants and limitations that are based on variations of EBITDA in the Company’s financing documents. The Company believes that segment Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because it allows for assessment of the operating performance of each reportable segment. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to provide forward-looking guidance and uses Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA to forecast future results.\nAdjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA reflect adjustments for interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, including accelerated depreciation, and the following adjustments discussed above: non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate swaps, provision for legal settlement, transaction costs and integration costs, restructuring and plant closure costs, assets held for sale, inventory valuation adjustments on acquired businesses, mark-to-market adjustments on commodity and foreign exchange hedges and foreign currency gains and losses on intercompany loans. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA reflect adjustments for the following items:\nm. Loss on extinguishment of debt, net : The Company has excluded net losses recorded on extinguishment of debt, inclusive of payments for premiums, the write-off of debt issuance costs and the write-off of net unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of gains realized on debt redeemed at a discount, as such losses are inconsistent in amount and frequency. Additionally, the Company believes that these costs do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods. n. Non-cash stock-based compensation : The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain executives and employees by aligning their long-term compensation interests with shareholders’ investment interests. The Company has excluded non-cash stock-based compensation as non-cash stock-based compensation can vary significantly based on reasons such as the timing, size and nature of the awards granted and subjective assumptions which are unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period and do not contribute to meaningful comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods. o. Noncontrolling interest adjustment : The Company has included adjustments for interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization for consolidated joint ventures which are attributable to the noncontrolling owners of the consolidated joint ventures. p. Equity method investment adjustment: The Company has included adjustments for its portion of interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization for unconsolidated joint ventures. The historical Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDA presented later in this release reflect further additional adjustments for the following items:\nq. Net foreign currency gains and losses for purchase price of acquisition: The Company has excluded net foreign currency gains and losses for the purchase price of acquisitions as the Company believes such gains and losses do not reflect expected ongoing future operating income and expense and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods. r. ﻿ Impairment of goodwill: The Company has excluded expenses for impairments of goodwill as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and the Company believes that these costs do not reflect expected ongoing future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance or comparisons of the Company’s operating performance to other periods.\nRECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS (LOSS) AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\nTO ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (Unaudited)\n(in millions) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, Six Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net Earnings (Loss) Available to Common Shareholders $ 88.9 $ (5.5 ) $ 380.4 $ 92.9 Dilutive preferred stock dividends 2.6 — 6.0 6.8 Net Earnings (Loss) for Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share 91.5 (5.5 ) 386.4 99.7 Adjustments: Non-cash mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on interest rate swaps (50.5 ) (1.0 ) (53.2 ) (145.5 ) Payments of debt extinguishment costs, net 1.4 67.9 32.2 67.9 Provision for legal settlement 2.0 (0.9 ) 11.0 73.6 Transaction costs 20.8 2.6 23.8 2.7 Integration costs 13.2 4.3 23.8 4.8 Restructuring and plant closure costs, including accelerated depreciation 1.9 — 1.9 0.2 Assets held for sale — — — (0.2 ) Inventory valuation adjustments on acquired businesses 4.2 — 4.2 — Mark-to-market adjustments on commodity and foreign exchange hedges (6.1 ) 0.7 (8.3 ) (2.7 ) Foreign currency loss (gain) on intercompany loans 0.9 (0.2 ) 0.9 — Total Net Adjustments (12.2 ) 73.4 36.3 0.8 Income tax effect on adjustments (1) 3.0 (25.7 ) (8.9 ) (0.3 ) U.S. tax reform net benefit (1.7 ) — (265.3 ) — Non-GAAP dilutive preferred stock dividends adjustment (2) — 3.4 — — Adjusted Net Earnings $ 80.6 $ 45.6 $ 148.5 $ 100.2 (1) Income tax effect on adjustments is calculated using Post’s expected fiscal year 2018 blended U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of approximately 24.5% for the three months and six months ended March 31, 2018 and Post’s then statutory rate of 35.0% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017. (2) Potentially dilutive convertible preferred stock is calculated using the “if-converted” method.
