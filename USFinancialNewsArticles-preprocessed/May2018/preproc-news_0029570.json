    "text": "HOUMA, La.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SEACOR Marine Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SMHI) (the “Company”), a leading provider of global marine and support transportation services to offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production facilities worldwide, today announced results for its quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet loss attributable to SEACOR Marine Holdings Inc. was $28.8 million ($1.64 per diluted share) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Operating Loss for the quarter was $24.4 million.\nHighlights from the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 included the following:\n• Stronger operating results in almost all of the Company’s major geographic markets drove an improvement of 14.5% over prior quarter, and 197.8% over prior year quarter, in direct vessel profit for the worldwide fleet to $13.4 million as compared to $11.7 million in the prior quarter and $4.5 million in the prior year quarter; • One-time charges and non-cash adjustments for the quarter included: $19.5 million of depreciation, $2.9 million of impairments and $12.2 million mark-to-market adjustment on the convertible senior notes, as well as a $3.9 million positive tax adjustment; • Total operating revenues increased 5% over prior quarter and 51% over prior year quarter in what is historically a seasonally low quarter. Approximately 30% of revenue increase driven by improved performance out of the Company's legacy fleet and remaining due to contributions from acquisitions when comparing to prior year quarter; • Successful closings of previously reported Falcon Global Holdings transaction resulting in an $140.5 million increase in property, plant and equipment, and $20 million cash investment in SEACOSCO joint venture; • The Company's liftboat fleet utilization increased 29% over prior year quarter following consummation of the Falcon Global Holdings transaction in early February; and • The Company delivered an approximately 29% reduction of its unfunded capital commitments by indefinite deferral of over $20 million of vessel orders. John Gellert, the Company’s , commented:\n“We had a very busy and productive first quarter. In what is historically a seasonally slow period for the maintenance of offshore oil and gas platforms and offshore wind farms supported by our fleet, we experienced sequential improvements in our operating results, reflecting contributions from recent acquisitions and improving market conditions.\nWe successfully closed on the Falcon Global Holdings and SEACOSCO transactions, substantially expanding our offerings in the liftboat and premium PSV markets. We renegotiated capital commitments for the construction of US flag FSV’s and PSV’s, re-profiling the capital required to fund the commitments over the next three years and indefinitely deferring over $20 million of commitments.\nThe increased activity experienced across the business this quarter has provided us with cautious optimism that the improved trends will continue throughout the year.\nAdditionally, in April we completed a private placement of $56.855 million of equity and the conversion of $50 million of our convertible senior notes into equity. These transactions not only strengthen our balance sheet, but also allow us to continue to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to drive growth and create long term shareholder value.”\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, net loss attributable to SEACOR Marine Holdings Inc. was $7.4 million ($0.42 per diluted share). Net income attributable to SEACOR Marine Holdings Inc. for the preceding quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $29.0 million ($1.20 per diluted share).\nA comparison of results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 with the preceding quarter ended December 31, 2017 is included below.\nOperating Revenues. Time charter revenues were $1.4 million higher compared with the preceding quarter. On a total fleet basis, time charter revenues increased by $4.1 million from net fleet additions, $0.8 million due to favorable changes in currency exchange rates and $0.3 million due to an increase in average rates per day worked, which increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.1 million due to reduced utilization of the active fleet, $2.0 million as a consequence of cold-stacking vessels and $0.7 million due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions. Other marine services revenues were $1.0 million higher compared with the preceding quarter primarily due to the collection in the first quarter of previously deferred revenues.\nExcluding wind farm utility vessels, but including cold-stacked vessels (those that are not currently available for active service), utilization of the fleet decreased from 51% to 50%, and average rates per day worked increased from $8,583 to $9,071. Days available for charter were 1% higher in the first quarter primarily due to net fleet additions. This release includes a table presenting time charter operating data by vessel class.\nDirect Vessel Profit (“DVP”) (1) by Region. DVP was $13.4 million compared with $11.7 million in the preceding quarter, an increase of $1.7 million. Improved operating revenues of $2.4 million were offset by increased operating expenses (excluding leased-in equipment) of $0.7 million. Results by region are as follows:\nUnited States, primarily Gulf of Mexico. DVP was $1.5 million compared with $1.3 million in the preceding quarter, a $0.2 million improvement. Time charter revenues were $0.4 million higher compared with the preceding quarter resulting from increased revenues of $2.0 million from fleet additions, which increase was partially offset by $1.5 million due to the cold-stacking of vessels, and $0.1 million lower due to reduced utilization. On a regional fleet basis, including cold-stacked vessels, utilization of the fleet decreased from 18% to 17%, and average rates per day worked improved by 9% from $8,027 to $8,775. Days available for charter were 5% higher in the first quarter primarily due to fleet additions. Other marine services revenues were $0.6 million higher primarily due to fleet additions. Operating expenses (excluding leased-in equipment) were $0.8 million higher primarily due to fleet additions. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 33 of 43 owned and leased-in vessels cold-stacked in the U.S. (six anchor handling towing supply vessels, 13 fast support vessels, 12 liftboats, one supply vessel and one specialty vessel) compared with 34 of 42 vessels as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had four anchor handling towing supply vessels and one supply vessel retired and removed from service in this region.\nAfrica, primarily West Africa. DVP was $4.7 million compared with $3.8 million in the preceding quarter, a $0.9 million improvement. Time charter revenues were $1.3 million higher compared with the preceding quarter reflecting an increase of $2.2 million due to fleet additions, which increase was partially offset by $0.2 million due to reduced utilization of the core fleet, $0.3 million due to a reduction in average day rates and $0.5 million due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions. On a regional fleet basis, including cold-stacked vessels, overall utilization of the fleet increased from 75% to 91%, primarily due to the impact of fleet additions, and average rates per day worked decreased by 10% from $10,517 to $9,455. Days available for charter increased by 4% in the first quarter primarily due to fleet additions. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had one specialty vessel retired and removed from service in this region.\nMiddle East and Asia. DVP was $2.3 million compared with direct vessel loss of $0.2 million in the preceding quarter, a $2.5 million improvement. Time charter revenues were $0.7 million higher compared with the preceding quarter. Time charter revenues were $0.3 million higher due to increased utilization of the core fleet and $1.1 million higher due to an increase in average day rates, which increases were partially offset by $0.5 million due to the effects of cold-stacking vessels and $0.2 million due to the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions. On a regional fleet basis, including cold-stacked vessels, utilization of the fleet decreased from 68% to 66%, and average rates per day worked improved by 16% from $6,784 to $8,072. Days available for charter decreased by 9% primarily due to the retirement and removal from service of two vessels during the first quarter. Operating expenses (excluding leased-in equipment) were $1.8 million lower compared with the preceding quarter, primarily due to a decrease in drydocking activity and reduced expenditure associated with the repositioning of vessels between geographic regions. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had one of 23 owned and leased-in vessels cold-stacked in the Middle East and Asia (one anchor handling supply vessel) compared with two of 25 vessels as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had two supply vessels and one specialty vessel retired and removed from service in this region.\n(1) Direct vessel profit (defined as operating revenues less operating expenses excluding leased-in equipment, “DVP”) is the Company’s measure of segment profitability when applied to reportable segments and a non-GAAP measure when applied to individual vessels, fleet categories or the combined fleet. DVP is a critical financial measure used by the Company to analyze and compare the operating performance of its individual vessels, fleet categories, regions and combined fleet, without regard to financing decisions (depreciation for owned vessels vs. leased-in expense for leased-in vessels). DVP is also useful when comparing the Company’s fleet performance against those of our competitors who may have differing fleet financing structures. DVP has material limitations as an analytical tool in that it does not reflect all of the costs associated with the ownership and operation of our fleet, and it should not be considered in isolation or used as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP. Brazil, Mexico, Central and South America. DVP was $1.8 million compared with $2.1 million in the preceding quarter, a decrease of $0.3 million. Time charter revenues were $0.2 million lower compared with the preceding quarter. On a regional fleet basis, including cold-stacked vessels, utilization of the fleet decreased from 50% to 41%, average rates per day worked decreased by 9% from $16,718 to $15,272 and days available for charter increased by 16% primarily due to repositioning of a vessel between geographic regions. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had one of three owned and leased-in vessels cold-stacked in Brazil, Mexico, Central and South America (one fast support vessel) compared with one of four vessels as of December 31, 2017.\nEurope, primarily North Sea. DVP was $3.1 million compared with $4.7 million in the preceding quarter, a decrease of $1.6 million. Time charter revenues were $0.8 million lower, primarily due to a seasonal reduction in utilization of the wind farm utility vessels. For the standby safety fleet, utilization decreased from 82% to 78%, and average rates per day worked improved by 5% from $8,660 to $9,058. For the windfarm utility vessels, utilization decreased from 73% to 64%, and average rates per day worked decreased from $2,330 to $2,317. Operating expenses (excluding leased-in equipment) were $1.0 million higher compared with the preceding quarter primarily due to increased drydocking activity for the standby safety fleet.\nAdministrative and general. Administrative and general expenses were $0.4 million higher compared with the preceding quarter primarily due to a recovery of doubtful accounts reserved in the preceding quarter.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $0.5 million lower compared with the preceding quarter.\nAsset Dispositions and Impairments. During the first quarter, the Company recognized impairment charges of $2.9 million associated with the Company’s anchor handling towing supply fleet. In addition, the Company sold one offshore support vessel and other equipment for net proceeds of $0.4 million and a gain of $0.3 million. During the preceding quarter, the Company recognized impairment charges of $11.8 million associated with the Company’s anchor handling towing supply fleet. In addition, the Company sold three offshore support vessels previously retired and removed from service and one other offshore support vessel for net proceeds of $0.7 million and losses of $0.5 million.\nDerivative gains (losses). Net derivative losses during the first quarter of $11.5 million, and net derivative gains during the preceding quarter of $7.5 million, are principally due to changes in the fair value of the Company’s conversion option liability on its convertible senior notes as a consequence of changes in the Company’s share price and estimated credit spread.\nIncome tax benefit. The Company's effective income tax rate of 23.8% for the quarter was more than the Company’s statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to taxes not provided on income attributable to non-controlling interests, foreign source income not subject to U.S. income taxes, and a reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit. During the preceding quarter, the Company recognized tax benefits of $43.7 million as a result of new U.S. tax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017. The majority of the income tax benefits recognized were due to a reduction in U.S. tax rates from 35% to 21% applied to the Company’s domestic basis differences and the elimination of previously accrued deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.\nEquity in earnings (losses) of 50% or less owned companies. Equity earnings in the first quarter were $0.2 million compared with equity earnings of $9.4 million in the preceding quarter. Equity earnings in the preceding quarter included the recognition of income tax benefits of $7.1 million as a result of new U.S. tax legislation. In addition, during the first quarter the Company recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million related to its investment in SEACOR Grant DIS.\nCapital Commitments. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had unfunded capital commitments of $48.8 million that included two fast support vessels, three supply vessels and four wind farm utility vessels. The Company’s capital commitments by year of expected payment are as follows (in thousands):\n2018 18,852 2019 21,069 2020 8,951 $ 48,872 In addition, the Company has indefinitely deferred an additional $20.8 million of orders with respect to two fast support vessels for which the Company had previously reported as unfunded capital commitments.\nLiquidity and Debt. As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s balances of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and construction reserve funds totaled $110.4 million and its total outstanding debt was $428.1 million (net of $41.4 million in discount and issue costs). These amounts do not reflect the $56,855,000 in gross proceeds received by the Company in April 2018 from the private placement of shares of the Company's common stock. As of March 31, 2018, construction reserve funds of $45.4 million were classified as non-current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as the Company has the intent and ability to use the funds to acquire equipment. Additionally, the Company had $7.5 million available under subsidiary credit facilities for future capital commitments.\nSEACOR Marine provides global marine and support transportation services to offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production facilities worldwide.
