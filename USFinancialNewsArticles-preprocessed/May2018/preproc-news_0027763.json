    "text": "BERLIN, May 9 (Reuters) - Adidas expects sales growth to “normalise” this year after two years of strong expansion, the chief executive of German sportswear firm told shareholders on Wednesday.\n“We do expect a certain normalisation this year, following the second consecutive year of strong double-digit growth rates,” Kasper Rorsted said according to a speech text he was giving at the annual general meeting.\nHe reiterated a target for sales to grow around 10 percent in 2018 on a currency neutral basis, down from 16 percent in 2017.\nShares in Adidas were hit last week after it predicted that sales in western Europe will stall in the second quarter.
