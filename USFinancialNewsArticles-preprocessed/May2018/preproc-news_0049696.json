Adjusted net loss was $17.0 million ($0.48 per diluted share) for the March 2018 quarter compared to an adjusted net loss of $40.3 million ($1.15 per diluted share) for the March 2017 quarter; the March 2018 quarter is adjusted for $83.9 million in net unfavorable special items, including impairment of our investment in Líder in Brazil, and the March 2017 quarter is adjusted for $37.7 million in net unfavorable special items. Fiscal year 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $105.4 million was up 48% over fiscal year 2017 adjusted EBITDA and in-line with increased adjusted EBITDA guidance provided in February 2018. Cash increase of $262 million in the March 2018 quarter to $380 million reflects the net benefit of the funding of our $350 million 8.75% five-year Senior Secured Notes, the termination of our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan repayments of $52.6 million. We expect fiscal year 2019 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $90 million to $140 million.\n\"I am honored to work with a team that delivered notable successes for our clients and investors in fiscal 2018, especially in the areas of safety on the field and liquidity on the balance sheet,\" said Jonathan Baliff. \"Looking ahead, our fiscal 2019 priorities will focus on continued safety improvement, delivering world-class performance to our clients and proactively managing our cost structure across a more responsive, regionally-focused New Bristow, while we win more business in this short-cycle challenging market.\"\nOperating revenue from external clients by line of service was as follows:\nFourth Quarter\nFull Year\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nOil and gas services\n$\n232,278\n$\n233,753\n(0.6)\n%\n$\n947,462\n$\n956,649\n(1.0)\n%\nU.K. SAR services\n58,659\n43,963\n33.4\n%\n222,965\n189,555\n17.6\n%\nFixed wing services\n49,845\n43,498\n14.6\n%\n209,719\n191,609\n9.5\n%\nCorporate and other\n393\n2,437\n(83.9)\n%\n4,278\n10,037\n(57.4)\n%\nTotal operating revenue\n$\n341,175\n$\n323,651\n5.4\n%\n$\n1,384,424\n$\n1,347,850\n2.7\n%\nFOURTH QUARTER FY2018 RESULTS\nThe year-over-year increase in revenue was primarily driven by the increase in U.K. SAR services due to additional bases coming online and an increase from our fixed wing services in our Europe Caspian, Asia Pacific and Africa regions. These revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in our oil and gas services driven by declines in our Asia Pacific and Africa regions, while revenue from oil and gas services in our Americas and Europe Caspian regions improved.\nWe reported a net loss of $100.9 million and diluted loss per share of $2.84 for the March 2018 quarter compared to a net loss of $78.0 million and diluted loss per share of $2.22 for the March 2017 quarter. The year-over-year change in net loss and diluted loss per share was primarily due to a loss on impairment in the March 2018 quarter and higher interest expense resulting from additional borrowings, partially offset by the increase in revenue discussed above and an income tax benefit.\nThe net loss for the March 2018 quarter was significantly impacted by the following special items:\nLoss on impairment totaling $90.2 million ($62.4 million net of tax including an additional $31.2 million in tax resulting from the repositioning of certain aircraft from one tax jurisdiction to another related to recent financing transactions), or $1.76 per share, including: Impairment of investment in unconsolidated affiliates of $85.7 million related to impairment of our investment in Líder in Brazil, and Impairment on inventories of $4.5 million; Organizational restructuring costs of $8.5 million ($6.0 million net of tax), or $0.17 per share, all of which is severance expense; $6.4 million of the restructuring costs are included in direct costs and $2.1 million are included in general and administrative expense; Early extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million ($1.3 million net of tax), or $0.04 per share, included in interest expense, which includes $1.8 million related to write-off of deferred financing fees and $0.1 million related to write-off of discount on debt; and Loss on disposal of assets of $5.2 million ($40.1 million net of tax), or $1.13 per share; partially offset by A non-cash benefit from tax items of $25.8 million, or $0.73 per share, that includes a one-time non-cash tax effect from the true-up of the one-time transition tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") of $31.2 million and net reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of $17.3 million, partially offset by a $22.7 million expense related to the true-up of the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities to a lower tax rate resulting from the Act.\nExcluding these items, adjusted net loss and adjusted diluted loss per share improved to $17.0 million and $0.48, respectively, for the March 2018 quarter compared to $40.3 million and $1.15, respectively, for the March 2017 quarter. Adjusted EBITDA also improved year-over-year to $22.9 million in the March 2018 quarter from $3.7 million in the March 2017 quarter primarily due an increase in operating revenue in our Europe Caspian region, primarily due to additional bases coming online for U.K. SAR, and increased activity and in our Americas region, primarily due to increased activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY\nOur cash balance of $380 million as of March 31, 2018 reflects the net benefit from closing and funding the $350 million 8.75% five-year Senior Secured Notes and the repayment of our April 2019 bank maturities.\nDon Miller, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"Fiscal year 2018 was a very successful year for Bristow as we materially improved our liquidity runway by repaying our 2019 bank maturities with the closing and funding of over $700 million in new low cost capital eliminating near term refinancing risk. The success of these financings will allow us to continue to focus on increasing revenue, reducing costs, and improving returns on our assets.\"\nREGIONAL PERFORMANCE\nEurope Caspian\nFourth Quarter\nFull Year\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nOperating revenue\n$\n194,429\n$\n162,511\n19.6\n%\n$\n765,412\n$\n710,581\n7.7\n%\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n3,164\n(4,628)\n*\n$\n22,774\n13,840\n64.6\n%\nOperating margin\n1.6\n%\n(2.8)\n%\n*\n3.0\n%\n1.9\n%\n57.9\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n22,787\n$\n1,890\n*\n$\n81,503\n$\n45,163\n80.5\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n11.7\n%\n1.2\n%\n*\n10.6\n%\n6.4\n%\n65.6\n%\nRent expense\n$\n31,355\n$\n34,065\n(8.0)\n%\n$\n134,158\n$\n134,072\n0.1\n%\nLoss on impairment\n$\n4,525\n$\n—\n*\n$\n4,525\n$\n8,706\n(48.0)\n%\n*\npercentage change too large to be meaningful or not applicable\nThe increase in operating revenue for the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 primarily resulted from an increase in activity and short-term contracts in Norway, the start-up of U.K. SAR bases and an increase in fixed wing revenue. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in U.K. oil and gas revenue resulting from the continued impact of the industry downturn on exploration activity. Eastern Airways contributed $30.7 million and $24.5 million in operating revenue for the March 2018 and 2017 quarters, respectively, and $118.5 million and $110.4 million in operating revenue for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDuring the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018, our results for the Europe Caspian region were impacted by a reduction in rent expense of $2.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, related to OEM cost recoveries that increased operating income and adjusted EBITDA.\nDuring the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018, we recorded an inventory impairment charge of $4.5 million for our fixed wing operations at Eastern Airways as a result of changes in expected future utilization of aircraft within those operations. During fiscal year 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $8.7 million of goodwill related to Eastern Airways. Both the inventory and goodwill impairment charges were included in operating income, but were adjusted for in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA.\nA substantial portion of our revenue in the Europe Caspian region is contracted in British pound sterling, which depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2017 due to Brexit with a modest recovery in fiscal year 2018. As a result of the changes in the British pound sterling, adjusted EBITDA was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate changes of $4.3 million and $9.2 million, respectively, during the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 compared to an unfavorable impact of $6.3 million and $35.6 million, respectively, during the March 2017 quarter and fiscal year 2017.\nOperating income, operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin increased in the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 primarily due to the increase in operating revenue, the reduction in rent expense related to the OEM cost recoveries and favorable impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These benefits were partially offset by increased salaries and benefits and maintenance expense year-over-year due to the increase in activity. Eastern Airways generated a negative $3.3 million and negative $4.3 million in adjusted EBITDA for the March 2018 and 2017 quarters, respectively, and a negative $6.9 million and negative $4.5 million in adjusted EBITDA for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAfrica\nFourth Quarter\nFull Year\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nOperating revenue\n$\n45,307\n$\n47,049\n(3.7)\n%\n$\n191,830\n$\n200,104\n(4.1)\n%\nEarnings from unconsolidated affiliates\n$\n2,518\n$\n2,025\n24.3\n%\n$\n2,518\n$\n2,068\n21.8\n%\nOperating income\n$\n3,973\n$\n10,225\n(61.1)\n%\n$\n32,326\n$\n30,179\n7.1\n%\nOperating margin\n8.8\n%\n21.7\n%\n(59.4)\n%\n16.9\n%\n15.1\n%\n11.9\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n12,213\n$\n12,203\n0.1\n%\n$\n52,419\n$\n51,553\n1.7\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n27.0\n%\n25.9\n%\n4.2\n%\n27.3\n%\n25.8\n%\n5.8\n%\nRent expense\n$\n2,133\n$\n2,000\n6.7\n%\n$\n8,557\n$\n8,101\n5.6\n%\nThe decrease in operating revenue for the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 primarily resulted from an overall decrease in activity compared to the prior year periods. Activity declined with certain clients and certain contracts ended, partially offset by an increase in activity from other clients. Additionally, fixed wing services in Africa generated operating revenue of $1.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for the March 2018 and 2017 quarters and $7.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2018 and 2017.\nOperating income and operating margin decreased in the March 2018 quarter primarily due to employee severance costs resulting from the expiration of a significant contract in this region which was not renewed. Operating income and operating margin increased in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and lower operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA increased in the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 compared to prior comparative periods primarily due to a favorable exchange rate impact compared to fiscal year 2017.\nOn March 31, 2018, a significant contract in this region expired and was not renewed. Additionally, changing regulations and political environment have made, and are expected to continue to make, our operating results for Nigeria unpredictable. Market uncertainty related to the oil and gas downturn has continued in this region, putting smaller clients under increasing pressure as their activity declined, which has reduced our activity levels and overall pricing.\nAmericas\nFourth Quarter\nFull Year\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nOperating revenue\n$\n57,480\n$\n51,966\n10.6\n%\n$\n236,364\n$\n220,544\n7.2\n%\nEarnings from unconsolidated affiliates\n$\n590\n$\n253\n133.2\n%\n$\n4,302\n$\n5,207\n(17.4)\n%\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n(84,592)\n$\n(1,566)\n*\n$\n(73,057)\n$\n4,224\n*\nOperating margin\n(147.2)\n%\n(3.0)\n%\n*\n(30.9)\n%\n1.9\n%\n*\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n7,580\n$\n5,635\n34.5\n%\n$\n41,010\n$\n39,952\n2.6\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n13.2\n%\n10.8\n%\n22.2\n%\n17.4\n%\n18.1\n%\n(3.9)\n%\nRent expense\n$\n6,440\n$\n6,757\n(4.7)\n%\n$\n24,920\n$\n23,015\n8.3\n%\nLoss on impairment\n$\n85,683\n$\n—\n*\n$\n85,683\n$\n—\n*\n*\npercentage change too large to be meaningful or not applicable\nOperating revenue increased for the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 compared to the prior year periods primarily due an increase in activity from our U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations and additional revenue from the search and rescue consortium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nEarnings from unconsolidated affiliates, net of losses, decreased for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a decrease in earnings from our investment in Líder in Brazil due to reduction in activity, partially offset by less of an unfavorable change in exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our earnings from our investment in Líder by $0.3 million, $0.6 million, $2.0 million and $3.2 million in the March 2018 quarter, March 2017 quarter, fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, respectively.\nLíder's management has significantly decreased their future financial projections as a result of recent tender awards announced by Petrobras. Petrobras represented 64% and 66% of Líder's operating revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2016, respectively. This significant decline in future forecasted results, coupled with previous declining financial results, triggered our review of the investment for potential impairment as of March 31, 2018. Based on the estimated fair value, we recorded an $85.7 million impairment in the March 2018 quarter. Our remaining investment in Líder as of March 31, 2018 is $62.3 million.\nThe decreases in operating income (loss) and operating margin for the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the impairment of our investment in Líder discussed above. The increases in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 were primarily driven by the increase in revenue discussed above.\nAsia Pacific\nFourth Quarter\nFull Year\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nOperating revenue\n$\n47,825\n$\n62,628\n(23.6)\n%\n$\n201,190\n$\n217,772\n(7.6)\n%\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n(4,916)\n$\n3,610\n*\n$\n(24,290)\n$\n(20,870)\n(16.4)\n%\nOperating margin\n(10.3)\n%\n5.8\n%\n*\n(12.1)\n%\n(9.6)\n%\n(26.0)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(1,926)\n$\n5,487\n*\n$\n(1,424)\n$\n(5,026)\n71.7\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n(4.0)\n%\n8.8\n%\n*\n(0.7)\n%\n(2.3)\n%\n69.6\n%\nRent expense\n$\n8,552\n$\n10,956\n(21.9)\n%\n$\n32,908\n$\n39,759\n(17.2)\n%\nOperating revenue decreased in the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 compared to the prior year periods primarily due to the early cancellation of a contract that generated an additional $17.2 million of operating revenue in the March 2017 quarter.\nAirnorth contributed $17.2 million in operating revenue for both the March 2018 and 2017 quarters, and a negative $1.4 million and a negative $0.7 million in adjusted EBITDA for the March 2018 and 2017 quarters, respectively, and $83.8 million and $77.1 million in operating revenue and $7.2 million and $7.1 million in adjusted EBITDA for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOperating income (loss), operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin declined for the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 compared to the prior year periods primarily due to the contract cancellation discussed above, which contributed $11.1 million of operating income and adjusted EBITDA in the March 2017 quarter, and a decline in oil and gas revenue, which was only partially offset by cost reduction efforts.\nCorporate and other\nFourth Quarter\nFull Year\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\nFY2018\nFY2017\n% Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nOperating revenue\n$\n393\n$\n2,452\n(84.0)\n%\n$\n4,305\n$\n10,369\n(58.5)\n%\nOperating loss\n$\n(20,287)\n$\n(25,747)\n21.2\n%\n$\n(88,996)\n$\n(104,616)\n14.9\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(17,772)\n$\n(21,528)\n17.4\n%\n$\n(68,081)\n$\n(60,558)\n(12.4)\n%\nRent expense\n$\n1,692\n$\n1,940\n(12.8)\n%\n$\n8,148\n$\n7,661\n6.4\n%\nLoss on impairment\n$\n—\n$\n—\n*\n$\n1,192\n$\n7,572\n(84.3)\n%\n*\npercentage change too large to be meaningful or not applicable\nOperating revenue decreased in the March 2018 quarter and fiscal year 2018 compared to prior periods primarily due to the sale of Bristow Academy on November 1, 2017.\nOperating loss and adjusted EBITDA improved for the March 2018 quarter compared to the March 2017 quarter primarily due to a reduction in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the decline in revenue discussed above. Operating loss for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was most significantly impacted by $1.2 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of inventory impairment charges and a reduction in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the decline in revenue. Adjusted EBITDA decreased year-over-year primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses of $4.4 million for fiscal year 2018 versus foreign currency transaction gains of $14.5 million for fiscal year 2017. This change in foreign currency impacts was partially offset by overall cost reduction activities that decreased general and administrative expenses as discussed above.\nDuring fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we recorded $9.5 million and $10.9 million, respectively, related to organizational restructuring costs, which along with the inventory impairment charges discussed above, are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.\nFY 2019 GUIDANCE\nGuidance for selected financial measures is included in the tables that follow.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nManagement will conduct a conference call starting at 10:00 a.m. ET (9:00 a.m. CT) on Thursday, May 24, 2018 to review financial results for the fiscal year 2018 fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2018.
