FILE PHOTO: El Salvador's coach Ramon Maradiaga reacts during their 2018 World Cup qualifying soccer match againast Canada in San Salvador, El Salvador, November 17, 2015. REUTERS/Jose Cabezas\nFIFA said Maradiaga, a Honduran who played for his own country in the 1982 World Cup, had “allowed and failed to report” a meeting in which a third party offered the players “financial compensation” in exchange for fixing the result.\nIt said the offer was rejected and reported by the players in a news conference on Sept. 5, 2016. The incident was widely reported at the time.\nMaradiaga could not immediately be reached for comment.\nEl Salvador were bottom of their four-team group with two points from five games and had already been eliminated from the competition for places at this year’s finals in Russia.\nHowever, a heavy defeat for El Salvador could have potentially allowed Canada to finish above Honduras and progress to the next stage of the competition on goal difference.\nIn the event, Canada won 3-1 but were eliminated after Honduras drew 0-0 away to Mexico.\nMaradiaga, 63, was found guilty of violating FIFA ethics rules on bribery and corruption and duty of disclosure, FIFA said in a statement. He was also fined 20,000 Swiss francs (14,738 pounds).\nHe is widely known in Central America, having also coached the national teams of Honduras and Guatemala as well a number of clubs including Marathon, Motagua, Real Espana and Aguila.\nCentral America is seen as especially vulnerable to match-fixing as many clubs struggle financially, playing conditions are poor and players often do not get paid on time.\nIn 2013, El Salvador banned 14 international players for life for match-fixing, including some of their best-known and most experienced names.
