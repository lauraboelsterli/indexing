    "text": "WARSAW, Ind., May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Consistent with its strategy to transform orthopaedic surgery by building a differentiated and comprehensive digital surgery platform, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc., part of the Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices Companies*, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of Medical Enterprises Distribution, LLC, a privately held developer of surgical impactor technology, including the automated ME1000™ Surgical Impactor for use in hip replacement. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. The closing is subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions. Financial terms of the acquisition are not being disclosed.\nThe ME1000 is a battery-powered device that automates bone preparation, implant assembly and positioning in Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). It is designed to replace the handheld mallet used in the procedure, leading to more consistent clinical outcomes while also helping to reduce surgeon fatigue as well as the potential for work-related injuries that can arise from mallet use.\nDePuy Synthes' focus is to provide a total solution for surgeons and patients throughout the episode of care. The ME1000 can be used with a variety of surgical approaches, including the anterior approach, for which DePuy Synthes has developed implants -- such as the ACTIS Total Hip System -- to accommodate surgeon preference and expertise. In addition, and as part of its leadership in the anterior approach, DePuy Synthes has an exclusive marketing agreement with JointPoint, Inc. to co-market a hip navigation system that allows for digital templating and precise analysis of implant selection and positioning during THA. JointPoint is compatible with the ME1000.\nThe company plans to develop and broaden the surgical impactor technology for a range of orthopaedic surgery procedures.\n\"The role that automation and digital technology are playing in orthopaedics, including joint replacement surgery, is tremendous, and our goal is to be at the forefront of providing surgeons with innovative and differentiated solutions that help increase efficiency as well as generate more predictable and reproducible patient outcomes,\" said Ciro Rӧmer, Company Group Chairman of DePuy Synthes. \"The acquisition of assets of Medical Enterprises Distribution is a key example of going beyond the implant to provide complete solutions to achieve better outcomes.\"\nAbout the Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices Companies\nThe Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices Companies have been working to make surgery better for more than a century.
