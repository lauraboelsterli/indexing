    "text": "CLARKSVILLE, Ind., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Savings Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSFG) (the \"Company\"), the holding company for First Savings Bank (the \"Bank\"), today reported net income of $1.6 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $2.2 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recognized merger-related expenses of $921,000, net of taxes, associated with its acquisition of the Odon, Indiana-based First National Bank of Odon (“FNBO”). Excluding the merger-related expenses, net of taxes, the Company would have reported net income of $2.6 million (non-GAAP measure) (1) and net income per diluted share of $1.08 (non-GAAP measure) (1) for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nOn February 9, 2018, the Bank completed its acquisition of FNBO. As part of the transaction, the Bank acquired net loans of $34.5 million and assumed net deposits of $91.8 million. In accounting for the acquisition, $2.1 million was assigned to a core deposit intangible and $1.6 million in goodwill was recorded.\nNet interest income increased $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. Interest income increased $1.9 million when comparing the two periods due primarily to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $133.7 million, from $777.1 million for 2017 to $910.8 million for 2018, and an increase in the average tax-equivalent yield, from 4.43% for 2017 to 4.59% for 2018. Interest expense increased $391,000 due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $90.7 million, from $642.2 million for 2017 to $732.9 million for 2018, and an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, from 0.64% for 2017 to 0.78% for 2018.\nThe Company recognized $371,000 in provision for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, due primarily to an increase of $31.3 million in the loan portfolio (excluding loans acquired in the FNBO transaction) during the three-month period, as compared to $375,000 of provision for loan losses recognized for the same period in 2017. Nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans over 90 days past due and still accruing interest, decreased $1.0 million, from $3.9 million at September 30, 2017 to $2.9 million at March 31, 2018. The Company recognized net charge-offs of $18,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to net charge-offs of $76,000 for the same period in 2017.\nNoninterest income increased $706,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was due primarily to increases in the net gain on sale of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) of $539,000 and other income of $198,000, and the recognition of a $226,000 impairment loss on a tax credit investment during the 2017 (there was no comparable loss in 2018). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the net gain on trading account securities of $270,000. The net gain on sales of loans guaranteed by the SBA was $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $949,000 for the same period in 2017. The net loss on trading account securities was $59,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a net gain of $211,000 for the same period in 2017. The decrease in net gain (loss) on trading account securities is due to market volatility in the municipal bond sector during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in other income is primarily attributable to increased servicing income on SBA-guaranteed loans.\nNoninterest expense increased $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was due primarily to increases in data processing, compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional fees, and other operating expenses of $896,000, $751,000, $232,000, $198,000 and $162,000, respectively, which included merger related expenses as provided in the table below.\nData Compensation Occupancy Professional Other (In thousands) Processing & Benefits & Equipment Fees Operating Increase $ 896 $ 751 $ 232 $ 198 $ 162 Less: Merger-Related 839 83 69 207 29 $ 57 $ 668 $ 163 $ (9 ) $ 133 The increase in compensation and benefits expense (excluding nonrecurring merger-related expense) is attributable to the addition of new employees to support the growth of the Company, including its SBA lending activities, post-merger compensation for the retained FNBO employees, and normal salary and benefits adjustments. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense (excluding nonrecurring merger-related expense) is primarily attributable to increases in repairs, maintenance and software licensing expenses.\nThe Company recognized income tax expense of $338,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, for an effective tax rate of 13.2%, as compared to income tax expense of $413,000, for an effective tax rate of 15.8%, for the same period in 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to a reduction in the Company’s statutory federal income tax rate from 34.0% to 24.5% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $576,000, which is pass-through income not subject to income tax at the entity level. The Company files federal income tax returns on a fiscal year basis and as result of Internal Revenue Code regulations, the Company’s federal income tax rate for the tax year ending September 30, 2018 is based on a blended rate of 24.5%.\n(1) Non-GAAP net income and net income per diluted share excludes certain nonrecurring items. A reconciliation to GAAP and discussion of the use of non-GAAP measures is included in the table at the end of this release.\nResults of Operations for the Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe Company reported net income of $5.1 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $4.5 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, for the six months ended March 31, 2017. During the six months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recognized merger related expenses of $945,000, net of taxes. Excluding the merger related expenses, net of taxes, the Company would have reported net income of $5.9 million (non-GAAP measure) (1) and net income per diluted share of $2.49 (non-GAAP measure) (1) for the six months ended March 31, 2018.\nNet interest income increased $2.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. Interest income increased $3.3 million when comparing the two periods due primarily to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $126.7 million, from $758.1 million for 2017 to $884.8 million for 2018, and an increase in the average tax-equivalent yield from 4.47% for 2017 to 4.59% for 2018. Interest expense increased $742,000 due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $87.7 million, from $633.3 million for 2017 to $721.0 million for 2018, and an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, from 0.65% for 2017 to 0.78% for 2018.\nThe Company recognized $833,000 in provision for loan losses for the six months ended March 31, 2018, due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio, as compared to $681,000 of provision for loan losses recognized for the same period in 2017. The loan portfolio increased $62.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 (excluding loans acquired in the FNBO transaction) as compared to an increase of $31.1 million for the same period in 2017. The Company recognized net charge-offs of $61,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to net charge-offs of $85,000 for the same period in 2017.\nNoninterest income increased $1.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was due primarily to increases in the net gain on sale of loans guaranteed by the SBA of $1.2 million, other income of $236,000 and the net gain on trading account securities of $162,000. The net gain on sales of loans guaranteed by the SBA was $3.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2017. The net gain on trading account securities was $91,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a net loss of $71,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase in other income is primarily attributable to increased servicing income on SBA-guaranteed loans.\nNoninterest expense increased $3.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was due primarily to increases in data processing, compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional fees, and other operating expenses of $869,000, $1.2 million, $374,000, $366,000 and $298,000, respectively, which included merger related expenses as provided in the table below.\nData Compensation Occupancy Professional Other (In thousands) Processing & Benefits & Equipment Fees Operating Increase $ 869 $ 1,221 $ 374 $ 366 $ 298 Less: Merger-Related 839 83 72 217 43 $ 30 $ 1,138 $ 302 $ 149 $ 255 The increase in compensation and benefits expense (excluding nonrecurring merger-related expense) is attributable to the addition of new employees to support the growth of the Company, including its SBA lending activities, post-merger compensation for the retained FNBO employees, and normal salary and benefits adjustments. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense (excluding nonrecurring merger-related expense) is primarily attributable to increases in repairs, maintenance and software licensing expenses. The increase in professional fees expense (excluding nonrecurring merger-related expense) is primarily attributable to third-party loan review engagements and increased performance-based investment advisor fees on the trading account portfolio.\nThe Company recognized income tax expense of $960,000 for the six-months ended March 31, 2018, for an effective tax rate of 14.4% as compared to income tax expense of $1.1 million, for an effective tax rate of 19.4%, for the same period in 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to a reduction in the Company’s statutory federal income tax rate from 34.0% to 24.5% as a result of the enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $663,000, which is pass-through income not subject to income tax at the entity level.\n(1) Non-GAAP net income and net income per diluted share excludes certain nonrecurring items. A reconciliation to GAAP and discussion of the use of non-GAAP measures is included in the table at the end of this release.\nComparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017\nTotal assets increased $117.4 million, from $891.1 million at September 30, 2017 to $1.0 billion at March 31, 2018. Loans increased $96.0 million due primarily to continued growth in the commercial real estate and SBA loan portfolios, as well as loans acquired in the FNBO transaction. Total deposits increased $89.4 million due primarily to deposit accounts assumed in the FNBO transaction and included increases in noninterest-bearing deposit accounts and interest-bearing deposit accounts of $66.4 million and $23.0 million, respectively, despite a $23.6 million decrease in brokered certificates of deposit. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $26.1 million in order to fund loan growth.\nCommon stockholders’ equity increased $2.1 million, from $93.1 million at September 30, 2017 to $95.2 million at March 31, 2018, due to retained net income of $4.4 million, partially offset by net unrealized losses of $2.6 million on the available for sale securities portfolio. At March 31, 2018, the Company and Bank were considered “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory capital guidelines.\nFirst Savings Bank has sixteen offices in the Indiana communities of Clarksville, Jeffersonville, Charlestown, Sellersburg, New Albany, Georgetown, Corydon, Lanesville, Elizabeth, English, Leavenworth, Marengo, Salem, Odon and Montgomery.
