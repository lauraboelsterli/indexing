Picture taken March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder Highlights\nEnthusiasm for the Democratic Party is waning among young voters, so-called millennials, as its candidates head into the crucial midterm congressional elections, according to the Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll . The online survey of more than 16,000 registered voters ages 18 to 34 shows their support for Democrats over Republicans for Congress slipped by about 9 percentage points over the past two years, to 46 percent overall. And they increasingly say the Republican Party is a better steward of the economy.\nAbout 50 people from a Central American migrant caravan including women, children and transgender individuals tried to seek U.S. asylum but were not allowed to cross the Mexico border because officials said the facility was full.\nIran’s supreme leader hit out at the United States a day after new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Riyadh, accusing Washington of trying to stoke a “regional crisis” by provoking its ally Saudi Arabia to confront Tehran.\nWorld\nAfghan security forces stand guard near the site of a blast in Kabul, Afghanistan April 30, 2018.

A survey taken the day North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met South Korean President Moon Jae-in, showed 64.7 percent believe the North will denuclearize and keep peace. Before the summit, only 14.7 percent of those polled said they did, research agency Realmeter said.\nCommentary\nEmmanuel Macron's state visit to Washington may have achieved a surprising result, writes John Lloyd .
