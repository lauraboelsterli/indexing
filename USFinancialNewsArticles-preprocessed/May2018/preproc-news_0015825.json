(Nasdaq:FLXN) today reported financial results and recent business highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“The first quarter of 2018 was marked by encouraging sales of ZILRETTA (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension), strong commercial execution, positive reimbursement developments and excellent progress advancing our clinical trials,” said Michael Clayman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “With the first full quarter of sales behind us, our confidence in ZILRETTA’s ability to make a meaningful difference for patients confronting osteoarthritis knee pain continues to grow.”\nFirst-Quarter Results & Financial Highlights\nThe Company reported a net loss of $41.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $23.9 million for the same period of 2017. Net sales of ZILRETTA for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $2.2 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company expensed $2.7 million of manufacturing costs to cost of sales.\nResearch and development expenses were $11.6 million and $10.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses of $0.8 million was primarily due to an increase of $1.0 million in personnel and other employee-related costs for additional headcount and stock compensation expense, as well as a $0.5 million increase in preclinical expenses related to our portfolio expansion and other program costs, offset by a $0.7 million decrease in development expenses for ZILRETTA.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $26.9 million and $13.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling expenses were $17.6 million and $5.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase in selling expenses of $12.4 million was primarily due to salary and related costs associated with additional headcount and costs to establish commercial marketing and sales capabilities. General and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to salary and related costs associated with additional headcount and increased stock compensation expense.\nInterest expense increased by $3.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the May 2017 issuance of an aggregate of $201.3 million in 2024 Convertible Notes.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $376.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with $423.9 million as of December 31, 2017.\nRecent News and Business Highlights :\nIn January, we fully enrolled our study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of concurrent administration of ZILRETTA in bilateral knee osteoarthritis (OA). Topline results are anticipated by the end of the second quarter of 2018.\nIn May, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) included ZILRETTA on its list of products recommended for a dedicated J code, effective January 1, 2019. Furthermore, in April, CMS issued a product-specific Q code for ZILRETTA (Q9993), which takes effect July 1, 2018. Q9993 will serve as a temporary universal code covering Medicare claims for ZILRETTA in all settings until a dedicated J code is in place.\nBased on the results of preclinical studies, in March, we determined FX101 (fluticasone ER) would not meet our defined target product profile and announced our decision to discontinue the program.\nOn April 18, the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery published the full results from the pivotal Phase 3 trial which served as the basis of ZILRETTA’s approval.\nWe reported additional results from the ongoing Phase 3 repeat administration study at the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2018 World Congress in April. These data showed:\n• the magnitude and duration of pain relief in a \"real-world\" patient group with OA of the knee are in line with the results seen in pivotal Phase 3 trial;\n• average time to second dose was more than 16 weeks; and\n• 74% (133/179) of subjects received a second administration of ZILRETTA between Weeks 16 and 24.\nThe topline results from the Phase 3 repeat administration study are expected in the third quarter of 2018.\nWe announced positive preclinical data supporting the FX201 program, which was presented in an oral session at OARSI. These data were shared with the FDA as part of a pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting, and based on the discussion and subject to successful Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies, we anticipate filing an IND and initiating first-in-human clinical trials in 2019.\nAlso in April, we presented positive results from a post-hoc analysis of patients with unilateral knee OA in a poster session at the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy Annual Meeting.\nIn May, we initiated an open-label study assessing the effect of a single administration of ZILRETTA on synovitis in patients with OA of the knee. Patients will undergo initial ultrasound examination and MRI with contrast of the index knee at baseline and then return to the clinic at Weeks 6 and 24 for MRI and other assessments. The study is expected to enroll over approximately six months and topline results are anticipated in 2019.\nZILRETTA Commercial Launch Metrics\nSince launching ZILRETTA in November 2017, our Musculoskeletal Business Managers (MBMs) have called on approximately 8,500 out of the approximately 10,500 target prescribers who practice in approximately 3,700 target accounts. The number of target prescribers increased from 9,500 to 10,500 and the number of target accounts increased from 3,500 to 3,700 during the first quarter, as our MBMs identified additional prescribers and accounts in their territories.\nSince launch, our MBMs and Field Access Managers have held in-depth discussions on reimbursement or conducted product preparation training at approximately 1,600 target accounts. Approximately 1,480 target accounts have gained experience with ZILRETTA through either purchases or product samples, and of the accounts that have purchased ZILRETTA, approximately 40% have placed a reorder.\nWith respect to commercial payers, we have engaged about 40 key commercial insurers that represent roughly 207 million covered lives and more than 95% of the benefits verifications processed through our FlexForward TM service have confirmed coverage of ZILRETTA.\nConference Call\nFlexion’s management will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET. The dial-in number for the conference call is 855-770-0022 for domestic participants and 908-982-4677 for international participants, with Conference ID # 2880817. A live webcast of the conference call can also be accessed through the “ Investors ” tab on the Flexion Therapeutics website, and a replay will be available online after the call.\nIndication and Important Safety Information\nIndication: ZILRETTA (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension) is indicated as an intra-articular injection for the management of osteoarthritis pain of the knee.\nLimitation of Use: ZILRETTA is not intended for repeat administration.*\nContraindication: ZILRETTA is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to triamcinolone acetonide, corticosteroids or any components of the product.\nWarnings and Precautions\nIntra-articular Use Only: ZILRETTA has not been evaluated and should not be administered by epidural, intrathecal, intravenous, intraocular, intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Serious events have been reported with epidural and intrathecal administration of corticosteroids and none are approved for this use. ZILRETTA should not be considered safe for epidural or intrathecal administration. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Rare instances of anaphylaxis, including serious cases, have occurred in patients with hypersensitivity to corticosteroids. Joint Infection and Damage: A marked increase in pain accompanied by local swelling, restriction of joint motion, fever and malaise are suggestive of septic arthritis. Examine joint fluid to exclude a septic process. If diagnosis is confirmed, institute appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Avoid injecting corticosteroids into a previously infected or unstable joint. Intra-articular administration may result in damage to joint tissues. Increased Risk of Infections: Infection with any pathogen in any location of the body may be associated with corticosteroid use. Corticosteroids may increase the susceptibility to new infection and decrease resistance and the ability to localize infection. Alterations in Endocrine Function: Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, with potential for adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment, which may persist for months. In situations of stress during that period, institute corticosteroid replacement therapy. Cardiovascular and Renal Effects: Corticosteroids can cause blood pressure elevation, salt and water retention and increased potassium excretion. Monitor patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension and renal insufficiency for edema, weight gain and electrolyte imbalance. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be needed. Increased Intraocular Pressure: Corticosteroid use may be associated with increased intraocular pressure. Monitor patients with elevated intraocular pressure for potential treatment adjustment. Gastrointestinal Perforation: Corticosteroid administration may increase risk of gastrointestinal perforation in patients with certain GI disorders and fresh intestinal anastomoses. Avoid corticosteroids in these patients. Alterations in Bone Density: Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption. Special consideration should be given to patients with or at increased risk of osteoporosis prior to treatment. Behavior and Mood Disturbances: Corticosteroids may cause adverse psychiatric reactions. Prior to treatment, special consideration should be given to patients with previous or current emotional instability or psychiatric illness. Advise patients to immediately report any behavior or mood disturbances.\nAdverse Reactions: The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) in clinical studies included sinusitis, cough and contusions.\nPlease see the full Prescribing Information at www.ZILRETTAlabel.com .\n* The efficacy and safety of repeat administration of ZILRETTA have not been evaluated.\nAbout ZILRETTA\nZILRETTA is the first and only FDA-approved extended-release intra-articular therapy for patients confronting osteoarthritis-related knee pain. ZILRETTA employs proprietary microsphere technology combining triamcinolone acetonide — a commonly administered, short-acting corticosteroid — with a poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) matrix to provide extended pain relief over 12 weeks.\nAbout Osteoarthritis (OA) of the Knee\nOA, also known as degenerative joint disease, affects more than 30 million Americans and accounts for more than $185 billion in annual expenditures. In 2016, more than 15 million Americans were diagnosed with OA of the knee and the average age of physician-diagnosed knee OA has fallen by 16 years, from 72 in the 1990s to 56 in the 2010s. The prevalence of OA is expected to continue to increase as a result of aging, obesity and sports injuries. Each year, more than 15 million Americans are treated for OA-related knee pain, and approximately five million OA patients receive either an immediate-release corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid intra-articular injection to manage their knee pain.\nAbout Flexion Therapeutics\nFlexion Therapeutics (Nasdaq:FLXN) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, local therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with osteoarthritis, a type of degenerative arthritis.
