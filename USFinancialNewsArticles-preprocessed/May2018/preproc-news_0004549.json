    "text": "EL PASO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- El Paso Electric Company (NYSE:EE):\nOverview\nFor the first quarter of 2018, El Paso Electric Company (\"EE\" or the \"Company\") reported a net loss of $7.0 million, or $0.17 basic and diluted loss per share. In the first quarter of 2017, EE reported a net loss of $4.0 million, or $0.10 basic and diluted loss per share.\n\"As expected, we reported a net loss in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to the seasonality of our business with higher kWh sales and revenues during the summer cooling season,\" said Mary Kipp, President and Chief Executive Officer of El Paso Electric Company. \"The net loss reported in the first quarter is comparable to last year's first quarter net loss excluding the impacts of a new accounting standard which was implemented this year.\"\nSummary Results\nThe table and explanations below present the major factors affecting the net loss in the three months ended March 31, 2018 relative to the net loss in the three months ended March 31, 2017, respectively (in thousands except Basic EPS data):\nThree Months Ended Pre-Tax\nEffect\nAfter-Tax\nEffect\nBasic\nEPS\nMarch 31, 2017 $ (3,989 ) $ (0.10 ) Changes in: Investment and interest income $ (4,108 ) (3,249 ) (0.08 ) Depreciation and amortization (1,880 ) (1,486 ) (0.04 ) Administrative and general expense (1,125 ) (888 ) (0.02 ) O&M at fossil-fuel generating plants 3,324 2,625 0.06 Retail non-fuel base revenues 326 258 0.01 Other (237 ) — March 31, 2018 $ (6,966 ) $ (0.17 ) First Quarter 2018\nIncome for the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was negatively affected by (presented on a pre-tax basis):\nDecreased investment and interest income primarily due to $3.8 million of net unrealized investment losses from the Company's Palo Verde Generating Station (\"Palo Verde\") decommissioning trust recognized in the Statements of Operations as required by ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments, which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018, and a $0.9 million decrease in realized gains on securities sold from the Company's Palo Verde decommissioning trust funds. Refer to \"Impact of New Accounting Standards and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" for further details. Increased depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant balances. Increased administrative and general expense primarily due to an increase in pension and benefits expenses as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate expenses for retirement benefit plans and an adjustment in estimated Four Corners Generation Station (\"Four Corners\") pension and benefit costs recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nIncome for the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was positively affected by (presented on a pre-tax basis):\nDecreased operations and maintenance expenses related to the Company's fossil-fuel generating plants primarily due to planned outages at Newman Power Station Units 1, 3 and 4 in 2017, partially offset by a planned outage at Rio Grande Power Station Unit 8 in 2018. Increased retail non-fuel base revenues primarily due to (i) a $2.8 million non-fuel base rate increase approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the \"PUCT\") in its final order in the Company's 2017 Texas retail rate case in Docket No. 46831 (the \"2017 PUCT Final Order\") and (ii) increased revenues from residential customers of $1.6 million due to a 2.6% increase in kWh sales which were driven by favorable weather and a 1.7% increase in the average number of residential customers compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Heating degree days increased 19.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by a reserve to refund of approximately $4.1 million to Texas customers for the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate for the period January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2018. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" for further details. Non-fuel base revenues and kilowatt-hour (\"kWh\") sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are provided by customer class on the Sales and Revenues Statistics of this news release.\nRegulatory Matters\nTexas Regulatory Matters\nOn December 18, 2017, the PUCT issued the 2017 PUCT Final Order for the Company's rate case in Docket No. 46831, which provides, among other things, for the following: (i) an annual non-fuel base rate increase of $14.5 million; (ii) a return on equity of 9.65%; (iii) all new plant in service as filed in the Company's rate filing package was prudent and used and useful and therefore is included in rate base; (iv) recovery of the costs of decommissioning Four Corners in the amount of $5.5 million over a seven year period beginning August 1, 2017; (v) the Company to recover reasonable rate case expenses of approximately $3.4 million through a separate surcharge over a three year period; and (vi) a requirement that the Company file a refund tariff if the federal statutory income tax rate, as it relates to the Company, is decreased before the Company files its next rate case. The 2017 PUCT Final Order also established baseline revenue requirements for recovery of future transmission and distribution investment costs and includes a minimum monthly bill of $30.00 for new residential customers with distributed generation, such as private rooftop solar. Additionally, the 2017 PUCT Final Order allows for the annual recovery of $2.1 million of nuclear decommissioning funding and establishes annual depreciation expense that is approximately $1.9 million lower than the annual amount requested by the Company in its initial filing. Finally, the 2017 PUCT Final Order allows for the Company to recover revenues associated with the relate back of rates to consumption on and after July 18, 2017 through a separate surcharge.\nNew base rates, including additional surcharges associated with rate case expenses and the relate back of rates to consumption on and after July 18, 2017 through December 31, 2017 were implemented in January 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\"), which made widespread changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The 2017 PUCT Final Order required the Company to file a refund tariff if the federal statutory income tax rate, as it relates to the Company, were decreased before the Company files its next rate case. Following the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017, and in compliance with the 2017 PUCT Final Order, on March 1, 2018, the Company filed with the PUCT and each of its municipalities a proposed refund tariff designed to reduce base charges for Texas customers equivalent to the expected annual decrease of $22.7 million in federal income tax expense resulting from the tax law changes. This filing was assigned PUCT Docket No. 48124. On March 27, 2018, the PUCT approved the Company's proposed refund tariff on an interim basis, subject to refund or surcharge, for customer billings effective April 1, 2018. Each of the Company's municipalities also implemented the Company's proposed tax credits on an interim basis effective April 1, 2018. The refund will be reflected in rates over a period of a year and will be updated annually until new base rates are implemented pursuant to the Company's next rate case filing. No party requested a hearing in the case before the PUCT by the deadline of April 16, 2018, and on April 18, 2018, the PUCT Staff filed its final recommendation supporting approval of the Company's application. The refund tariff case is pending with the refund tariff subject to final action by the incorporated municipalities in the Company's Texas service territory and a final order from the PUCT.\nNew Mexico Regulatory Matters\nThe Company is required to file its next New Mexico rate case no later than July 31, 2019. That rate case will reflect the Company's new corporate income tax rate. On January 24, 2018, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (the \"NMPRC\") initiated a proceeding in Case No. 18-00016-UT into the impact of the TCJA on New Mexico regulated utilities. On February 23, 2018, the Company responded to a NMPRC Staff inquiry regarding the proceeding. On April 4, 2018, the NMPRC issued an order requiring the Company to file a proposed interim rate rider to adjust the Company’s New Mexico base revenues in amounts equivalent to the Company’s reduced income tax expense for New Mexico customers resulting from the TCJA, to be implemented on or before May 1, 2018. The NMPRC order further requires that the Company record and track a regulatory liability for the excess accumulated deferred income taxes created by the change in the federal corporate income tax rate, consistent with the effective date of the TCJA, and subject to amortization determined by the NMPRC in the Company’s next general rate case. The Company recorded such a regulatory liability during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. On April 16, 2018, after consultation with the New Mexico Attorney General pursuant to the NMPRC order, the Company filed an interim rate rider, with a proposed effective date of May 1, 2018. The annualized credits expected to be refunded to New Mexico customers approximate $4.9 million. On April 25, 2018, the NMPRC approved the Company's interim rate rider to be implemented in customer bills beginning May 1, 2018.\nImpact of New Accounting Standards and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted:\n(i) ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective approach and had no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. As required by the standard, revenues of $1.9 million related to reimbursed costs of energy efficiency programs approved by the Company's regulators are reported in operating revenues from customers. Related expenses of an equal amount are reported in operations and maintenance expenses.\n(ii) ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits, retrospectively for the income statement presentation of the service cost component as part of operating income and the other components of net benefit costs outside of any subtotal of operating income for each period presented. The Company reclassified $2.1 million to \"Operations and maintenance\" in the Company’s Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 by increasing (i) \"Investment and interest income, net\" by $5.3 million, (ii) \"Miscellaneous non-operating income\" by $2.8 million, (iii) \"Miscellaneous non-operating deductions\" by $2.1 million, and (iv) \"Other interest\" by $3.9 million. As a result of the reclassifications, \"Operations and maintenance\" increased to $2.9 million in service cost from the $0.8 million in net periodic benefit cost previously reported.\n(iii) ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Upon adoption of this new standard, the Company recorded, as of January 1, 2018, a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $41.0 million, net of tax, for the unrealized gains (losses) related to equity securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds. As required by ASU 2016-01, changes in the fair value of equity securities are now recognized in the Company's Statements of Operations. The adoption of the new standard added the potential for significant volatility to the Company's reported results of operations as changes in the fair value of equity securities may occur. Furthermore, the equity investments included in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are significant and are expected to increase significantly during the remaining life (estimated to be 27 to 30 years) of Palo Verde. Accordingly, the Company has provided the following non-GAAP financial measure which reconciles GAAP net loss to non-GAAP adjusted net loss to exclude the impact of changes in fair value of equity securities and realized gains (losses) from the sale of both equity and fixed income securities.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands) Net loss (GAAP) $ (6,966 ) $ (3,989 ) Adjusting items before income tax effects Unrealized losses, net 3,781 — Realized gains, net (1,272 ) (2,191 ) Total adjustments before income tax effects 2,509 (2,191 ) Income taxes on above adjustments (502 ) 438 Adjusting items, net of income taxes 2,007 (1,753 ) Adjusted net loss (non-GAAP) $ (4,959 ) $ (5,742 ) Adjusted net loss is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss. Furthermore, the Company's presentation of any non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company believes adjusted net loss is a useful financial measure for investors and analysts in understanding the Company's core operating performance because it removes the effects of variances reported in the Company's results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company.\nCapital and Liquidity\nWe continue to maintain a strong capital structure in which common stock equity represented 43.9% of our capitalization (common stock equity, long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (the \"RCF\")) as of March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, we had a balance of $2.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Based on current projections, we believe that we will have adequate liquidity through the issuance of long-term debt, our current cash balances, cash from operations and available borrowings under the RCF to meet all of our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months.\nCash flows from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $26.2 million, compared to $26.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. A component of cash flows from operations is the change in net over-collection and under-collection of fuel revenues. The difference between fuel revenues collected and fuel expense incurred is deferred to be either refunded (over-recoveries) or surcharged (under-recoveries) to customers in the future. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we had fuel over-recoveries of $8.0 million compared to over-recoveries of fuel costs of $8.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, we had a net fuel over-recovery balance of $14.2 million, including an over-recovery of $13.3 million in Texas and an over-recovery of $0.9 million in New Mexico. On April 13, 2018, we filed a request with the PUCT to decrease our Texas fixed fuel factor by approximately 29% to reflect decreased fuel expenses primarily related to a decrease in the price of natural gas used to generate power. On April 25, 2018, the Company's proposed fuel factors were approved on an interim basis effective for the first billing cycle of the May 2018 billing month. If no party to the case requests a hearing by May 14, 2018, the Company's fuel factors will become final as provided by the PUCT's rules and no further action by the PUCT is required. The Texas fixed fuel factor will continue thereafter until changed by the PUCT.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, our primary capital requirements were for the construction and purchase of electric utility plant, payment of common stock dividends and purchases of nuclear fuel. Capital expenditures for new electric utility plant were $66.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $53.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be approximately $236 million. Capital requirements for purchases of nuclear fuel were $9.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $10.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nOn March 30, 2018, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.335 per share, or $13.6 million, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2018. We expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in 2018. We expect our board of directors to review the dividend policy in the second quarter of 2018.\nNo shares of common stock were repurchased during the three months ended March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, a total of 393,816 shares remain available for repurchase under our currently authorized stock repurchase program. We may in the future make purchases of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing prices and may engage in private transactions where appropriate.\nOur cash requirements for federal and state income taxes vary from year to year based on taxable income, which is influenced by the timing of revenues and expenses recognized for income tax purposes. The following summary describes the major impacts of the TCJA on our liquidity. We continue to evaluate the TCJA and have made assumptions based on information currently available.\nThe TCJA discontinued bonus depreciation for regulated utilities which reduced tax deductions previously available to us for 2017, 2018 and 2019. The decrease in tax deductions results in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL carryforwards”) approximately two years earlier than anticipated and is expected to result in higher income tax payments beginning in 2019, after the full utilization of NOL carryforwards. However, due to the lower federal corporate income tax rate enacted by the TCJA, our future federal corporate income tax payments will be made at the reduced rate of 21% beginning in 2018. Due to NOL carryforwards, minimal tax payments are expected for 2018, which are mostly related to state income taxes.\nThe effect of the TCJA on our rates will be beneficial to our customers. Following the enactment of the TCJA and the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, revenues collected from our customers in 2018 are reduced in an amount that approximates the savings in tax expense. This reduction in revenues is expected to negatively impact our cash flows by approximately $26 million to $31 million during 2018.\nWe maintain the RCF for working capital and general corporate purposes and financing of nuclear fuel through the Rio Grande Resources Trust (\"RGRT\"). The RGRT, the trust through which we finance our portion of nuclear fuel for Palo Verde, is consolidated in our financial statements. The RCF has a term ending on January 14, 2020. The maximum aggregate unsecured borrowing currently available under the RCF is $350.0 million. We may increase the RCF by up to $50.0 million (to a total of $400.0 million) during the term of the RCF, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions more fully set forth in the agreement, including obtaining commitments from lenders or third party financial institutions. We also have the option to extend the term of the RCF by one additional year to January 14, 2021 in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The total amount borrowed for nuclear fuel by the RGRT, excluding debt issuance costs, was $134.1 million at March 31, 2018, of which $89.1 million had been borrowed under the RCF, and $45.0 million was borrowed through the issuance of senior notes. Borrowings by the RGRT for nuclear fuel, excluding debt issuance costs, were $135.2 million as of March 31, 2017, of which $40.2 million had been borrowed under the RCF and $95.0 million was borrowed through the issuance of senior notes. Interest costs on borrowings to finance nuclear fuel are accumulated by the RGRT and charged to us as fuel is consumed and recovered through fuel recovery charges. At March 31, 2018, $144.0 million was outstanding under the RCF for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding capital expenditures. At March 31, 2017, $94.0 million was outstanding under the RCF for working capital and general corporate purposes. Total aggregate borrowings under the RCF at March 31, 2018 were $233.1 million with an additional $116.9 million available to borrow.\nWe received approval from the NMPRC on October 7, 2015, to guarantee the issuance of up to $65.0 million of long-term debt by the RGRT to finance future purchases of nuclear fuel and to refinance existing nuclear fuel debt obligations, which remains effective. We received additional approval from the NMPRC on October 4, 2017 to amend and extend the RCF, issue up to $350.0 million in long-term debt and to redeem and refinance the $63.5 million 2009 Series A 7.25% Pollution Control Bonds and the $37.1 million 2009 Series B 7.25% Pollution Control Bonds, which are subject to optional redemption in 2019. The NMPRC approval to issue up to $350.0 million in long-term debt supersedes prior approval. We requested similar approval from the FERC on September 1, 2017 and received approval on October 31, 2017. The FERC approval also includes permission to guarantee the issuance of up to $65.0 million of long-term debt by the RGRT and to continue to utilize our existing RCF with the ability to amend and extend the RCF at a future date. The authorization approved by the FERC is effective from November 15, 2017 through November 14, 2019 and supersedes prior approvals.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nWe are reiterating our earnings guidance for 2018 with a range of $2.30 to $2.65 per basic share. The guidance assumes normal operations and considers significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, expenses, capital expenditures, nuclear decommissioning trust gains/losses and the impact of the TCJA. The mid-point of the guidance range assumes 10-year average weather (cooling and heating degree days). The guidance range includes $8 million or $0.20 per share to $10 million or $0.25 per share, after-tax, of unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and realized gains (losses) from the sale of both equity and fixed income securities from the Palo Verde decommissioning trust funds.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results is scheduled for 11:30 A.M.
