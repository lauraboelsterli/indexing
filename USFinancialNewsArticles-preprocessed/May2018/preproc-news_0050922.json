    "text": "KIEV, May 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine’s state security service (SBU) on Wednesday warned of a possible cyber attack on state bodies and private companies ahead of the Champions League soccer final in Kiev on Saturday.\nThe SBU is particularly concerned that critical infrastructure appears to be a target and believes Russia is behind the possible attack.\n“Security Service experts believe that the infection of hardware on the territory of Ukraine is preparation for another act of cyber-aggression by the Russian Federation, aimed at destabilising the situation during the Champions League final,” it said in a statement.\nReporting by Pavel Polityuk; writing by Matthias Williams; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
