    "text": "NEW YORK, WeissLaw LLP, a national class action, shareholder rights law firm with offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta, announces an investigation of InnerWorkings, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"INWK\") (NASDAQ: INWK). The investigation focuses on possible breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws in connection with the Company's May 7 announcement that it would be postponing the release of its first quarter 2018 financial results due to errors in its historical financial statements. As a result of these errors, the Company stated it will be \"restating its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and all interim periods within those years.\"\nWeissLaw is investigating whether INWK's Board breached its fiduciary duties by, among other things, failing to ensure that an effective system of internal controls was maintained over the Company's financial reporting. If you own INWK shares and wish to discuss this investigation or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact Joshua Rubin of WeissLaw LLP at (888)593-4771 , or by e-mail at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.
