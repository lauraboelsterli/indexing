ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nTotal first quarter revenue of $54.8 million, up 23 percent year-over-year, and up 6 percent from the previous quarter\nQ2 Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:QTWO), a leading provider of secure, experience-driven digital banking solutions, today announced results for its first quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nPlease note these results reflect the impact from the adoption of ASC 606, Contracts with Customers, effective Jan. 1, 2018.\nRevenue $54.8 million, up 23 percent year-over-year and up 6 percent from the previous quarter. GAAP gross margin 50.8 percent, up from 48.9 percent one year ago. Non-GAAP gross margin 54.3 percent, up from 52.5 percent one year ago. GAAP net loss $6.0 million, which compares to a GAAP net loss of $7.0 million 2017, and $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA positive $5.0 million, an improvement from positive $1.1 million one year ago and positive $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“We had a strong start to 2018, sustaining our bookings momentum in what is typically a seasonally slower quarter,” said Matt Flake, CEO of Q2. “Having just wrapped up our annual client conference, I believe our customers are generally optimistic about their improving operating environments. When you combine this with three consecutive quarters of positive bookings momentum, I believe we are well positioned for solid growth in 2018.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights .\nSigned a Top 50 credit union and two Tier 1 banks in the first quarter, including a $10 billion bank in the Southeast and a $7 billion bank in the West. Exited the first quarter with approximately 10.9 million registered users on the Q2 platform, representing 22 percent year-over-year growth and up 5 percent sequentially. Continued Q2 Open momentum, signing MoneyLion, a savings and investment platform with two million customers.\nFinancial Outlook\nQ2 Holdings is providing guidance for its second quarter 2018 as follows:\nTotal revenue of $57.9 million to $58.5 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 22 percent to 23 percent. Adjusted EBITDA of $4.7 million to $5.3 million. GAAP net loss is the most comparable GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes things such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, interest, income taxes and unoccupied lease charges. Q2 Holdings is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Q2 Holdings has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss.\nQ2 Holdings is providing guidance for the full-year 2018 as follows:\nTotal revenue of $236.5 million to $238.5 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 22 percent to 23 percent. Adjusted EBITDA of $21 million to $23 million. Adjusted EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes things such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, interest, income taxes and unoccupied lease charges. Q2 Holdings is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Q2 Holdings has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss.\nConference Call Details\nDate:\nMay 3, 2018 Time:\n8:30 a.m. EDT Hosts:\nMatt Flake, CEO / Jennifer Harris, CFO Dial in:\nUS toll free: 1-833-241-4254\nInternational: 1-647-689-4205\nConference ID:\n2697347 Please join the conference call at least 10 minutes before start time to ensure the line is connected.

We are driven by a mission to build stronger communities by strengthening their financial institutions. Q2 provides the industry’s most comprehensive digital banking platform, enriched through actionable data insights, open development tools and an evolving fintech ecosystem. We help clients elevate the experience, drive efficiency and grow faster. To learn more about Q2, visit www.q2ebanking.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nQ2 uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP gross profit; non-GAAP sales and marketing expense; non-GAAP research and development expense; non-GAAP general and administrative expense; non-GAAP operating loss; and, non-GAAP net loss. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of operating performance because they exclude items that Q2 does not consider indicative of its core performance.\nIn the case of adjusted EBITDA, Q2 adjusts net loss for such things as interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, amortization of technology and intangibles, and unoccupied lease charges. In the case of non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit, Q2 adjusts gross profit and gross margin for stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired technology. In the case of non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, and non-GAAP general and administrative expense, Q2 adjusts the corresponding GAAP expense to exclude stock-based compensation. In the case of non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss, Q2 adjusts operating loss and net loss, respectively, for stock-based compensation, acquisition related-costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangibles, and unoccupied lease charges.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, the closest GAAP measures, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the closest GAAP measures of these non-GAAP measures is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nQ2’s management uses these non-GAAP measures as measures of operating performance; to prepare Q2’s annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of Q2’s business; to evaluate the effectiveness of Q2’s business strategies; to provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance; to facilitate a comparison of Q2’s results with those of other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and in communication with our board of directors concerning Q2’s financial performance.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release contains , including statements about positive sales and bookings momentum, increased activity in the bank market and the effects of the improved economic environment on banks’ decision-making, optimism about our pipeline and Q2’s performance in 2018, and Q2’s quarterly and annual financial guidance. The contained in this press release are based upon Q2’s historical performance and its current plans, estimates and expectations and are not a representation that such plans, estimates or expectations will be achieved. Factors that could cause actual results to those described herein include risks related to: (a) the risk of increased competition in its existing markets and as it enters new sections of the market with Tier 1 customers and new products and services; (b) the risk that the market for Q2’s solutions does not grow as anticipated, in particular with respect to Tier 1 customers; (c) the risk that Q2’s increased focus on selling to larger Tier 1 customers may result in greater uncertainty and variability in Q2’s business and sales results; (d) the risk that changes in Q2’s market, business or sales organization negatively impacts its ability to sell its products and services; (e) the challenges and costs associated with selling, implementing and supporting Q2’s solutions, particularly for larger customers with more complex requirements and longer implementation processes; (f) the risk that errors, interruptions or delays in Q2’s products or services or Web hosting negatively impacts Q2’s business and sales; (g) risks associated with data breaches and breaches of security measures within Q2’s products, systems and infrastructure and the resultant harm to Q2’s business and its ability to sell its products and services; (h) the impact that a slowdown in the economy, financial markets, and credit markets has on Q2’s customers and Q2’s business sales cycles, prospects and customers’ spending decisions and timing of implementation decisions, particularly in regions where a significant number of Q2’s customers are concentrated; (i) the difficulties and risks associated with developing and selling complex new solutions and enhancements with the technical and regulatory specifications and functionality required by customers and governmental authorities; (j) the risks inherent in technology and implementation partnerships that could cause harm to Q2’s business; (k) the difficulties and costs Q2 may encounter with complex implementations of its solutions and the resulting impact on reputation and the timing of its revenue from any delayed implementations; (l) the risk that Q2 will not be able to maintain historical contract terms such as pricing and duration; (m) the risks associated with managing growth and the challenges associated with improving operations and hiring, retaining and motivating employees to support such growth; (n) the risk that modifications or negotiations of contractual arrangements will be necessary during Q2’s implementations of its solutions or the general risks associated with the complexity of Q2’s customer arrangements; (o) the risks associated with integrating acquired companies and successfully selling and maintaining their solutions; (p) litigation related to intellectual property and other matters and any related claims, negotiations and settlements; and (q) the risks associated with further consolidation in the financial services industry.\nAdditional information relating to the uncertainty affecting the Q2 business are contained in Q2’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
