    "text": "May 28, 2018 / 12:46 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Cricket-Australia's Hazlewood ruled out of England ODIs with injury Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMay 28 (Reuters) - Australia’s fast bowling options have been further depleted after Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of next month’s one-day international series in England due to back soreness.\nHazlewood joins fellow quicks Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc in being out of action against their Ashes rivals, while all-rounder Mitchell Marsh also remains on the sidelines.\nUncapped Queensland seamer Michael Neser takes Hazlewood’s place in the touring squad.\n“Josh has been managing some low-level bone stress in his lumbar spine for a short period,” Cricket Australia physiotherapist David Beakley said on Monday.\n“He had a repeat scan and although it has not progressed to a fracture he is starting to experience some lower back pain.\n“As such, we are taking a conservative approach and he will not travel to England for the one-day series.”\nAustralia will play five one-dayers and a Twenty20 match against England from June 13-27.
