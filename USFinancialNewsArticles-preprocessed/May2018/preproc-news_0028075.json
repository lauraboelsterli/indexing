    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 10:30 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago Iran aims to buy Airbus jets before sanctions window closes - official Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nPARIS, May 11 (Reuters) - Iran is in contact with European planemaker Airbus to try to use a narrow window available for business following this week’s U.S. decision to withdraw from an international nuclear pact, said a senior official.\n“We are in contact with Airbus and they are exploring all possibilities that might exist to take advantage of the limited time in front of us,” said Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan, senior advisor to Iran’s Roads and Urban Development Minister.\n“It all depends on European government support and policies,” he told Reuters by telephone.\nIran also hopes to import more Franco-Italian ATR turboprops but there are some “technical issues”, he added. ATR is a joint venture between Airbus and Italian group Leonardo.\nAirbus said it had no immediate comment on the matter.\nFakhrieh-Kashan was quoted earlier as saying Airbus would announce soon whether it would sell planes to Tehran after the United States - which must approve the export of planes with a significant number of U.S. parts - said it would withdraw from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.\nWhite House National Security Adviser John Bolton said earlier this week that there would be “wind-down” periods of 90 to 180 days, and perhaps other durations, for existing Iranian contracts with companies, following President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the 2015 Iran deal.
