    "text": "Per Share Net Income of $0.25 and Normalized FFO of $0.36 Up 19% and 9% Respectively Compared to Prior Year Quarter\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (the “Company” or “MPT”) (NYSE: MPW) today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and recent highlights.\n“After a record year in 2017, MPT raised its quarterly dividend by over 4 percent in the first quarter making this the fourth consecutive year that the Company has increased its payout to shareholders,” said Edward K. Aldag, Jr., MPT’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our consistent dividend growth has contributed to superior total shareholder returns and is the result of strongly accretive acquisitions. The Company has experienced extraordinary growth over the past five years, increasing total assets at a compound rate of over 33 percent annually, and our pipeline is very strong.”\nFIRST QUARTER AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS\nNet income of $0.25 and Normalized Funds from Operations (“NFFO”) of $0.36 in the first quarter both on a per diluted share basis; Completed construction of a 40-bed, 50,985 square foot rehabilitation hospital in Flagstaff, Arizona operated by Ernest Health (“Ernest”) for a total investment of approximately $24 million; commenced rent on March 1st; Entered into a 15-year lease agreement in March with a joint venture formed by Vibra Healthcare and Ernest for an LTAC hospital in Boise, Idaho; lease has three 5-year renewal options; Increased quarterly dividend by 4.2% to $0.25 making 2018 the fourth consecutive year that MPT has increased its dividend; Added Elizabeth Pitman to Company’s Board of Directors in February.\nAldag commented on the election of Elizabeth Pitman to MPT’s Board of Directors and the recent promotions of two senior team members. “MPT will benefit greatly from Elizabeth’s addition to the Board. Her extensive healthcare and legal experience together with her expertise in cyber security is critical and complements the Board’s needs. The sustainability of MPT depends in part on the career growth of our people. In the first quarter, we were very pleased to announce the promotion of Rosa Hooper to Vice President and Managing Director, Asset Management and Underwriting in recognition of the outstanding job she has done managing MPT’s largest department. We were delighted to also announce the promotion of Charles Lambert to Treasurer and Managing Director, Capital Markets as an acknowledgement of his significant contribution to the Company over the past 12 years.”\nIncluded in the financial tables accompanying this press release is information about the Company’s assets and liabilities, net income and reconciliations of net income to NFFO, all on a basis comparable to 2017 results. In addition, a reconciliation of pro forma total gross assets to total assets is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nPORTFOLIO UPDATE\nThe Company has pro forma total gross assets of approximately $9.5 billion, including $6.6 billion in general acute care hospitals, $2.1 billion in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, and $0.4 billion in long-term acute care hospitals. This pro forma portfolio includes 275 properties representing more than 32,000 licensed beds in 29 states and in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. The properties are leased to or mortgaged by 31 hospital operating companies.\nOPERATING RESULTS AND OUTLOOK\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $90.6 million (or $0.25 per diluted share), compared to $68.0 million (or $0.21 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2017.\nNFFO for the first quarter of 2018 increased 24% to $131.5 million compared with $105.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Per share NFFO increased 9% to $0.36 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $0.33 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new accounting rules, which resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses for the first quarter. Certain third party transaction costs that were previously accounted for as acquisition expenses are now capitalized. With this accounting change, MPT will no longer charge indirect and internal transaction costs as acquisition expenses.\nThe Company reaffirms its NFFO estimates for 2018. Net income is expected to range from $1.00 to $1.04 per diluted share, while NFFO is expected to range from $1.42 to $1.46 per diluted share. This estimate assumes no additional acquisitions or investments, no asset sales and no material capital transactions. The Company also reaffirmed its expectations that it will complete negotiations of certain joint venture arrangements during the first half of 2018. However, there is no assurance that any such arrangements will be completed.\nA reconciliation of NFFO guidance to net income is included with the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nThese estimates do not include the effects, if any, of unexpected real estate operating costs, changes in accounting pronouncements, litigation costs, debt refinancing costs, acquisition costs, currency exchange rate movements, interest rate hedging activities, write-offs of straight-line rent or other non-recurring or unplanned transactions, including the previously mentioned joint venture arrangements. These estimates may change if the Company acquires or sells assets, market interest rates change, debt is refinanced, new shares are issued, additional debt is incurred, other operating expenses vary, income from investments in tenant operations vary from expectations, or existing leases do not perform in accordance with their terms.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call and webcast for Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to present the Company’s financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.

These amounts are included with the activity of all of our equity interests in the \"Other\" line on the consolidated statements of income. Investors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations, or FFO, as a supplemental performance measure. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) on sales of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose normalized FFO, which adjusts FFO for items that relate to unanticipated or non-core events or activities or accounting changes that, if not noted, would make comparison to prior period results and market expectations less meaningful to investors and analysts. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and the use of normalized FFO makes comparisons of our operating results with prior periods and other companies more meaningful. While FFO and normalized FFO are relevant and widely used supplemental measures of operating and financial performance of REITs, they should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since the measures do not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which can be significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations. FFO and normalized FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity. We calculate adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, by subtracting from or adding to normalized FFO (i) unbilled rent revenue, (ii) non-cash share-based compensation expense, and (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs. AFFO is an operating measurement that we use to analyze our results of operations based on the receipt, rather than the accrual, of our rental revenue and on certain other adjustments. We believe that this is an important measurement because our leases generally have significant contractual escalations of base rents and therefore result in recognition of rental income that is not collected until future periods, and costs that are deferred or are non-cash charges. Our calculation of AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO or similarly titled measures reported by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (calculated pursuant to GAAP) as an indicator of our results of operations or to cash flow from operating activities (calculated pursuant to GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity.

(3) Includes $123.6 million unfunded amounts on ongoing development projects and $16.2 million unfunded amounts on capital improvement projects and development projects that have commenced rent. (4) Pro forma total gross assets is total assets before accumulated depreciation/amortization, assumes all real estate binding commitments on new investments and unfunded amounts on development deals and commenced capital improvement projects are fully funded, and assumes cash on hand is fully used in these transactions. We believe pro forma total gross assets is useful to investors as it provides a more current view of our portfolio and allows for a better understanding of our concentration levels as our binding commitments close and our other commitments are fully funded.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005792/en/\nMedical Properties Trust, Inc.\nTim Berryman, 205-969-3755\nDirector – Investor Relations\ntberryman@medicalpropertiestrust.com\nSource: Medical Properties Trust, Inc.",
