    "text": "TORONTO, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SmartCentres Real Estate Investment Trust (\"SmartCentres\" or the \"Trust\") (TSX:SRU.UN) is pleased to report positive financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKey business development highlights for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include the following:\n• In January 2018, the Trust and Jadco (an unrelated party) formed a 50:50 joint venture known as Laval Centre Apartments Limited Partnership, into which the Trust contributed development lands located in Laval, Quebec.\n• On February 12, 2018, the Trust announced, that along with Penguin, it had entered into a joint venture with Revera Inc., a leading owner, operator and investor in the senior living sector to jointly develop new retirement living residences across Canada.\n• Management changes:\nOn February 14, 2018, the Board of Trustees announced that Huw Thomas, the Trust’s current CEO, will be stepping down at the end of his five-year contract in June 2018, but will be remaining as a trustee of the Trust. Mitchell Goldhar, the Trust’s current non-executive Chairman and largest Unitholder, will become Executive Chairman and in that role will increase his already significant involvement in all aspects of the Trust’s business, including strategy, development, intensification initiatives, leasing and finance. Peter Forde, the Trust’s current President and COO will assume the President and CEO role on Huw Thomas’ departure. This leadership transition is a logical step as the Trust focuses more on development and intensification opportunities on virtually its entire shopping centre portfolio.\nFinancial highlights for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include the following:\n• Net income and comprehensive income was $100.5 million, as compared to $60.0 million for the same quarter last year, representing an increase of $40.5 million or 67.4%. (1)\n• Net rental income was $120.9 million, as compared to $116.3 million for the same quarter last year, representing an increase of $4.6 million or 4.0%. (1)\n• Cash flows provided by operating activities was $44.1 million, as compared to $56.3 million over the same quarter last year, representing a decrease of $12.2 million or 21.7%. (1)\n• Net income excluding loss on disposition and fair value adjustments was $84.8 million, as compared to $76.7 million over the same quarter last year, representing an increase of $8.1 million or 10.6%. (2)\n• FFO with one time adjustment and transactional FFO increased by $6.0 million or 7.2% to $89.8 million and by $0.02 or 3.7% to $0.56 on a per Unit basis. (2)\n• ACFO with one time adjustment increased by $3.9 million to $81.8 million compared to the same quarter in 2017. (2)\n• Payout ratio to ACFO with one time adjustment increased by 0.6% to 86.1% compared to the same quarter of 2017. (2)\n• Same properties' NOI decreased by $0.5 million or 0.4% compared to the same quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of a $1.1 million reversal of previously recorded general bad debt provisions included in 2017, year-over-year same property growth for the three months ended March 31, 2018 would have been 0.5%. (2)\n• Earnouts and Developments including equity accounted investments totaling $14.0 million were completed and transferred to income properties at an average yield rate of 6.5% on investment. (2)\nSubsequent to Quarter End:\n• On April 10, 2018, the Trust announced that construction has begun on the first two towers of Transit City Condos in partnership with CentreCourt. Located in SmartCentres Place, next to the new subway station in the VMC, Transit City Condos consists of three towers of 55 storeys each, totalling over 1,700 units. All the units in each of the three towers are sold out and financing is in place for the first two towers and is expected to soon be finalized for the third tower.\n(1) Represents a GAAP measure.\n(2) Represents a non-GAAP measure.\n\"During the first quarter of the year, we remained focused on the execution of our two core strategies of optimizing the performance of our core retail portfolio despite sub optimal market conditions, and creating and now increasingly executing on our multitude of development opportunities. Our future success will in large part be built on the capability and experience of our development team and they continue to deliver quality projects on time and on budget, which bodes very well for significant future value creation for our Unitholders,\" said Huw Thomas, SmartCentres CEO.\nSelected Consolidated Financial and Operational Information:\nThe consolidated financial and operational information shown in the table below includes the Trust’s share of equity accounted investments and represents key financial and operational information for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.

(6) The diluted weighted average includes the vested portion of the deferred unit plan. Operational Highlights\nNet income and comprehensive income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased by $40.5 million compared to the same quarter last year. The primary reasons for the increase pertain to: (i) fair value adjustments on revaluation of investment properties being higher by $24.6 million principally due to changes in lease and NOI assumptions relating to the Trust's portfolio; (ii) a $6.0 million increase in fair value adjustment on financial instruments principally due to the reduction in the Trust's unit price compared to the prior period (as the financial instruments are fair valued at the balance sheet date); (iii) a $4.6 million increase in net rental income attributed to the growth of the portfolio, predominantly from the properties acquired pursuant to the Arrangement; (iv) a $3.6 million increase in earnings from equity accounted investments, primarily due to both an increase in rental revenues (from the Arrangement) of $0.8 million and an increase in the fair value adjustment on investment properties of $3.2 million, partially offset by an increase in operating costs of $0.5 million; (v) a $2.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, principally resulting from both $1.1 million in lower Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Deferred Unit Plan (DUP) costs that are tied directly to the Trust’s Unit price and $0.9 million in higher capitalized amounts, and (vi) a $0.2 million acquisition related gain, net, offset by (vii) a $0.5 million loss on sale of investment properties.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, NOI increased by $5.7 million or 4.9% compared to the same quarter in 2017, which was primarily due to: (i) a $13.8 million increase in rentals from investment properties attributed to the growth of the portfolio, predominantly from the properties acquired pursuant to the Arrangement, and other Earnouts, offset by (ii) a $6.2 million increase in recoverable property operating costs primarily attributed to the properties acquired pursuant to the Arrangement, (iii) a $1.3 million increase in non-recoverable costs primarily attributed to the reversal in the three months ended March 31, 2017 of previously recognized general bad debt provisions, and (iv) a $0.6 million increase in property management fees costs principally resulting from additional costs associated with the properties acquired pursuant to the Arrangement.\nWith respect to the total recovery ratio (including the Trust's share of equity accounted investments) both including and excluding prior year adjustments, the Trust recovered 96.5% and 96.5%, respectively, of total recoverable expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 96.1% and 96.2%, respectively, in the same quarter last year.\nFFO and ACFO Highlights\nFFO\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, FFO with one time adjustment and transactional FFO increased by $6.0 million or 7.2% to $89.8 million, and by $0.02 or 3.7% to $0.56 on a per Unit basis. The increase in FFO with one time adjustment and transactional FFO was primarily due to: (i) a $5.7 million increase in NOI, (ii) a $0.5 million gain on sale of land to a joint-venture, (iii) a $0.4 million adjustment for supplemental contribution, partially offset by (iv) an acquisition related gain, net of $0.2 million, and (v) a $0.2 million decrease in indirect interest with respect to the development portion of equity accounted investments.\nACFO\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, ACFO with one time adjustment increased by $3.9 million to $81.8 million compared to the same quarter in 2017. This increase of $3.9 million was primarily due to: (i) a $15.9 million increase in adjustments to working capital items that are not indicative of sustainable cash available for distribution, partially offset by (ii) a $12.3 million decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities.\nThe payout ratio relating to ACFO with one time adjustment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by 0.6% to 86.1% compared to the same quarter last year, for the reasons noted above.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe non-GAAP measures used in this Press Release, including FFO, Transactional FFO, ACFO, NOI, Same Property NOI, average yield rates, and payout ratio do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These non-GAAP measures are more fully defined and discussed in the 'Management Discussion and Analysis' (\"MD&A\") of the Trust for the three months ended March 31, 2018, available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nFull reports of the financial results of the Trust for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are outlined in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the related MD&A of the Trust, which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .
