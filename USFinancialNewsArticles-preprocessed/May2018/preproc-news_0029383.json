In the same period, 1,645 movies directed by men have had that honour.\nThe Cannes Film Festival runs from May 8 to May 19.\n71st Cannes Film Festival - Screening of the film \"Girls of the Sun\" (Les filles du soleil) in competition - Red Carpet Arrivals - Cannes, France, May 12, 2018. 82 women from the film industry walk the red carpet to represent the limited number of female filmmakers who have been selected for the festival's competition lineup over its 71 years.
