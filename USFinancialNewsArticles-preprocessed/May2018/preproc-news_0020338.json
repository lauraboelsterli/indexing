Over the past 12 months the Corporation has been successful in growing the loan portfolio in all segments, except for installment loans. Installment loans have declined because of the sale of the Corporation’s credit card portfolio which was acquired from The Community State Bank of St. Charles in December 2016.\nThe following tables outline the composition and changes in the deposit portfolio as of:\n3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Demand $ 224,486 $ 216,607 $ 208,494 $ 217,504 $ 213,538 Savings 227,987 224,558 229,471 223,274 230,235 Money market demand 59,370 67,387 68,567 55,736 62,229 NOW 2,984 2,253 3,565 2,810 2,554 Time deposits 168,948 162,700 115,491 114,843 121,499 Total deposits $ 683,775 $ 673,505 $ 625,588 $ 614,167 $ 630,055 3/31/2018 vs 12/31/2017 3/31/2018 vs 3/31/2017 $ Variance % Variance $ Variance % Variance Demand $ 7,879 3.64 % $ 10,948 5.13 % Savings 3,429 1.53 % (2,248 ) -0.98 % Money market demand (8,017 ) -11.90 % (2,859 ) -4.59 % NOW 731 32.45 % 430 16.84 % Time deposits 6,248 3.84 % 47,449 39.05 % Total deposits $ 10,270 1.52 % $ 53,720 8.53 % Like loans, total deposits have grown both quarter over quarter and year over year. Most of the growth continues to come in the form of demand and time deposits. The increase in demand deposits has been the direct result of our treasury management team working with municipalities and small business customers to ensure that we have the appropriate mix of products and services at a competitive price. The increase in time deposits has been the result of targeted CD specials and an increase in brokered and internet deposits to fund the remaining growth in the loan portfolio. The Corporation is implementing several strategic initiatives geared at accelerating deposit growth in upcoming periods to ensure that we have sufficient organic funding to meet loan demands.\nIncome Statement Breakdown and Analysis\nQuarter to Date 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Interest and dividend income Loans, including fees $ 8,038 $ 8,524 $ 7,226 $ 6,931 $ 6,084 Investments 341 341 339 323 343 Total interest and dividend income 8,379 8,865 7,565 7,254 6,427 Total interest expense 1,031 939 792 702 687 Net interest income 7,348 7,926 6,773 6,552 5,740 Provision for loan losses 275 348 136 125 - Net interest income, after provision for loan losses 7,073 7,578 6,637 6,427 5,740 Total noninterest income 1,801 2,220 3,396 2,138 1,234 Total noninterest expenses 6,279 7,400 5,581 5,742 5,095 Income before federal income taxes 2,595 2,398 4,452 2,823 1,879 Federal income taxes 521 236 1,164 884 592 Net income $ 2,074 $ 2,162 $ 3,288 $ 1,939 $ 1,287 Quarter to Date 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Based on GAAP net income Return on Average Assets 1.05 % 1.11 % 1.76 % 1.09 % 0.75 % Efficiency Ratio 68.63 % 72.94 % 54.88 % 66.08 % 73.06 % Earnings Per Share $ 0.57 $ 0.60 $ 0.91 $ 0.53 $ 0.35 Yield on Earning Assets 4.55 % 5.13 % 4.40 % 4.45 % 4.19 % Rate on Int.

While a portion of the increase in net income was driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced the Corporation’s Federal income tax rate from 34% to 21%, adjusted net income from operations, which excludes the impact of the reduction in tax rates, increased in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Corporation has also been successful at consistently increasing adjusted net interest income. This increase continues to be primarily driven through increases in loans. Despite the strong growth in the loan portfolio, the Corporation has maintained relatively strong interest margins. As the Corporation expects to grow its loan portfolio throughout 2018, net interest income is expected to continue to increase.\nAbout Fentura Financial, Inc. and The State Bank\nFentura Financial, Inc. is the holding company for The State Bank.
