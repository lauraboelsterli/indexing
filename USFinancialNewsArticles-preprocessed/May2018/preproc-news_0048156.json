    "text": "NEW YORK, May 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Goldman Sachs was named \"overall best employer\" as part of Asia Society's 2018 Best Asian Pacific American (APA) Employer Awards, followed by KPMG and Colgate-Palmolive. The global investment bank was also recognized as best employer for developing workforce skills.\n\"We believe we perform at our best when we foster an environment that maximizes the potential of all of our people and reflects the communities and cultures in which we operate,\" said Suzzanne Yao , co-head of the Asian Professionals Network at Goldman Sachs.\nNow in their ninth year, the awards honor employers at the forefront of promoting and developing Asian Pacific American (APA) talent. Awardees are selected based on the quality of their APA workforce initiatives and the results from Asia Society's annual Asian Corporate Survey, which measures the experience of APAs at Fortune 500 and other large companies. More than 2,800 APA employees participated in the 2018 survey.\nBuzzFeed, the tech-driven media company and a newcomer to the survey, won best employer for \"APA employee resource groups (ERG).\" Edwin Wong , BuzzFeed's senior vice president for research and insights, and the executive sponsor of APOP, the company's Asian-affinity ERG, says a third of all U.S. BuzzFeed employees have attended at least one of its events, improving company-wide understanding of the diversity of the Asian culture and experience. \"Adding to the success, the vast majority of our Asian workforce are also saying this ERG has increased their sense of belonging at BuzzFeed in our annual employee satisfaction survey,\" Wong added.\nMarriott, the global hospitality company, was recognized as the best employer for LGBT Asian employees. \"Marriott is proud of its strong people first culture and a big part of that is making sure everyone feels welcomed and included,\" said David Rodriguez , executive vice president and chief global human resources officer for Marriott International. \"This recognition underscores our commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace through promoting unity and a sense of family while creating an environment that supports growth and opportunity for all.\"\nOther best employer winners include:\nChevron for \"marketing & support to the APA community;\" Discover for \"promoting APAs into senior leadership positions;\" KPMG for \"sponsorship;\" and Medtronic for \"promoting APA women.\"\nAsia Society will present the awards on June 20 in New York City, in conjunction with the 2018 Corporate Insights Summit .\nFinalists and winners are chosen based on a combination of employee survey results (80 percent) and scores from a blind panel of expert judges (20 percent).
