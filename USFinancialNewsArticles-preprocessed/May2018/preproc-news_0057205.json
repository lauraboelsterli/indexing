    "text": "(Reuters) - Canada's main stock index dipped on Friday for the fourth straight day, as a more than 2 percent drop in oil prices pushed energy stocks lower.\n* At 9:48 a.m. ET (1348 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 27.44 points, or 0.17 percent, at 16,086.18.\nOil prices fell as Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were ready to ease supply curbs that have pushed crude prices to their highest since 2014.\n* The energy sector fell 2.6 percent, weighed down by 1.2 percent drop in shares of Suncor Energy and 1 percent dip in Canadian Natural Resources.\n* Also weighing on TSX was the 0.1 percent drop in shares of materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners.\n* Mine developer Northern Dynasty ended talks with First Quantum to partner on an Alaska mine, which sent shares of the copper miner down 0.7 percent.\n* Seven of the index's eleven major sectors were higher, led by the industrials sector that rose 0.7 percent.\n* Boosting the industrials were shares of civil aviation training provider CAE Inc, which rose 1.6 percent after posting first-quarter results.\n* The Canadian dollar weakened to a more than two-week low against the greenback as oil prices fell and the U.S. Dollar broadly climbed.\n* Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said there is about a 40 percent chance of concluding the renegotiation of NAFTA before the country's presidential election on July 1.\n* On the TSX, 122 issues were higher, while 119 issues declined for a 1.03-to-1 ratio favoring gainers, with 21.00 million shares traded.\n* The largest percentage gainers on the TSX were CAE Inc and Endeavour Mining.\n* Computer Modelling Group fell 0.7 percent, the most on the main index after IA Securities cut the stock's rating to \"hold\" from \"buy.\"\n* The second biggest decliner on TSX was MEG Energy Corp down 0.5 percent.\n* The most heavily traded shares by volume were Neovasc Inc , Nemaska Lithium and Crescent Point Energy Corp.\n* The TSX posted seven new 52-week highs and one new low.\n* Across all Canadian issues there were 13 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, with total volume of 41.74 million shares.
