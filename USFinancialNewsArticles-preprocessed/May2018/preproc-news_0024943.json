    "text": "NAIROBI, May 10 (Reuters) - Floodwater from a flower-farm dam that burst after days of torrential rain in Kenyaâ€™s Rift Valley killed at least 24 people as it swept through 450 homes, the local governor said on Thursday.\nNakuru county governor Lee Kinyanjui told Reuters as many as 2,000 people had been affected by the rupturing of the dam on Wednesday night. Engineers had been sent to carry out safety checks on three other nearby reservoirs. (Reporting by Duncan Miriri Editing by Ed Cropley/James Macharia)\n ",
