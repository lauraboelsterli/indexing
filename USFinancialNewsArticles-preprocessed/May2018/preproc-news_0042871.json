    "text": "By John Patrick Pullen May 21, 2018\nBeset by bottlenecks that not only slowed its production , but also handed the company its biggest ever quarterly loss , Tesla’s Model 3 sedan has had to deliver on some big promises — beyond those given when it was announced to great fanfare and a staggering amount of preorders . So, now two years later, as the rubber is hitting the road, does the Tesla Model 3 live up to the hype? Slow your roll—literally, Consumer Reports tells anxious auto buyers.\n“Our testers also found flaws—big flaws—such as long stopping distances in our emergency braking test and difficult-to-use controls,” writes Consumer Reports’ Patrick Olsen in his Tesla Model 3 review . The braking issues kept Consumer Reports from giving the Model 3 its recommendation. Of the 57 hybrid and electric vehicles Consumer Reports has reviewed, it ranks the Tesla Model 3 sixth, behind the front-running 2018 Toyota Prius.\n“The Tesla’s stopping distance of 152 feet from 60 mph was far worse than any contemporary car we’ve tested and about 7 feet longer than the stopping distance of a Ford F-150 full-sized pickup,” writes Olsen. Issues with braking and difficult to use controls cause the @Tesla #Model3 to fall short of a CR recommendation. https://t.co/f6r2s9oLJy\n— Consumer Reports (@ConsumerReports) May 21, 2018 SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT",
