    "text": "DAVIDSON, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Curtiss-Wright Corporation (NYSE: CW) today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an additional $50 million for share repurchases in 2018, to begin immediately via a 10b5-1 program, by using cash that the Company has begun repatriating from its foreign subsidiaries. This repurchase activity will be conducted concurrently with the Company’s ongoing $50 million share repurchase program for 2018, which began in January and is being executed via an existing 10b5-1 program.\n“We have begun repatriating cash from our foreign subsidiaries and I’m pleased to announce that our first action is to return $50 million in capital to our shareholders through additional share repurchases,” said David C. Adams, Chairman and CEO of Curtiss-Wright Corporation. “As a result, this recent buyback authorization, along with our recent opportunistic share repurchases, will raise our total 2018 share repurchase activity to more than $100 million. Curtiss-Wright remains committed to a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy that consists of reinvesting in our business, complementing our organic growth with strategic acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders to drive long-term shareholder value.”\nEarlier this month, the Company repurchased more than $12 million in shares opportunistically through a supplemental share repurchase program and has approximately $36 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. Since early 2014, the Company has repurchased more than 7 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of nearly $550 million.\nAbout Curtiss-Wright Corporation\nCurtiss-Wright Corporation (NYSE:CW) is a global innovative company that delivers highly engineered, critical function products and services to the commercial, industrial, defense and energy markets.
