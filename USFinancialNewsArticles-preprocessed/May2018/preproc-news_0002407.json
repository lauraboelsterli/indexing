    "text": "C$ unless otherwise stated\nTSX/NYSE/PSE: MFC SEHK: 945\nThe quarterly earnings news release for Manulife Financial Corporation (\"Manulife\" or the \"Company\") should be read in conjunction with the Company's First Quarter 2018 Report to Shareholders, including our unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"), which is available on our website at http://www.manulife.com/reports .\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company's reporting segments have been reorganized. Please refer to section A5 \"Changes to reporting segments and other items\" and section F3 \"Performance and Non-GAAP Measures\" in the First Quarter 2018 Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for details of these changes.\nAll percentage growth / declines in financial metrics in this news release are reported on a constant exchange rate basis. Constant exchange rate basis excludes the impact of currency fluctuations and is a non-GAAP measure. We use a number of non-GAAP measures to measure performance and to assess our businesses. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures, see \"Performance and Non-GAAP Measures\" below and in the First Quarter 2018 MD&A and 2017 MD&A for details.\nAdditional information relating to the Company is available on the SEDAR website at http://www.sedar.com and on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (\"SEC\") website at http://www.sec.gov (EDGAR filers section).\nTORONTO, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Manulife today announced net income attributed to shareholders of $1,372 million for the first quarter of 2018 (\"1Q18\"), fully diluted earnings per common share of $0.67 and return on common shareholders' equity (\"ROE\") of 14.1%, compared with $1,350 million, $0.66 and 13.7%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017 (\"1Q17\"). The increase in net income attributed to shareholders reflects growth in core earnings and lower gains from the direct impact of markets. For 1Q18, Manulife generated core earnings of $1,303 million, fully diluted core earnings per common share of $0.64 and core return on common shareholders' equity (\"core ROE\") of 13.4%, compared with $1,101 million, $0.53 and 11.1%, respectively, for 1Q17 1 .\n\"We delivered strong core earnings and net income in the first quarter, and continue to make significant strides in transforming our business to be more customer centric. We are encouraged by the early progress we have made to date. For example, the numerous initiatives we have completed in Canada have led to strong, double-digit improvements in net promoter scores in just six months. We also took several strategically important actions on our North American legacy businesses which address both profitability and capital, and demonstrate clearly that we are executing on our priorities,\" said President & Chief Executive Officer Roy Gori.\nPhil Witherington, Chief Financial Officer, said, \"We continued to deliver positive net flows in our global wealth and asset management businesses, and although annualized premium equivalent sales across the company were down from the first quarter of 2017, Asia APE sales were sustained against the backdrop of a strong prior year.\"\n\"This marks the first quarter under the new Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test or LICAT framework, and we are pleased to report a healthy capital position and a LICAT capital ratio of 129% for our operating company. This factors in only some of the expected 4 percentage point benefit from reducing the allocation to ALDA in the portfolio asset mix backing some of our North American legacy businesses,\" added Mr. Witherington.\n1\nCore earnings, diluted core earnings per common share and core ROE are non-GAAP measures. See \"Performance and Non-GAAP Measures\" below and in our First Quarter 2018 MD&A for additional information.\nHOW OUR COMPANY PERFORMED\nProfitability\nReported net income attributed to shareholders of $1,372 million in 1Q18, an increase compared with $1,350 million in 1Q17\nThe increase in net income attributed to shareholders in 1Q18 reflected higher core earnings and lower gains from the direct impact of markets. Each of these items is described below.\nGenerated core earnings of $1,303 million in 1Q18, an increase of $202 million or 22% compared with 1Q17\nThe increase in core earnings was due to higher investment-related experience gains in core earnings ($96 million in 1Q18 compared with $46 million in 1Q17), strong growth in Asia and Global Wealth and Asset Management (\"Global WAM\"), lower U.S. tax rates and improved policyholder experience in Canada. Core earnings in 1Q18 included policyholder experience charges of $3 million post-tax ($2 million pre-tax) compared with charges of $27 million post-tax ($30 million pre-tax) in 1Q17. 1\nGenerated ROE of 14.1% in 1Q18 compared with 13.7% in 1Q17, and core ROE of 13.4% compared with 11.1% in 1Q17\nThe increase in ROE and core ROE compared with 1Q17 largely reflected the higher earnings as noted above. Also contributing to the increase was 1.3% lower average equity in 1Q18 compared with 1Q17.\nGenerated investment-related experience gains of $96 million in 1Q18 compared with gains of $46 million in 1Q17\nThe $96 million of investment-related experience gains reported in 1Q18 reflected the favourable impact of fixed income reinvestment activities on the measurement of our policy liabilities and strong credit experience, partially offset by lower than expected returns (including fair value changes) on alternative long-duration assets (\"ALDA\"). In accordance with our definition of core earnings, we included $96 million of investment-related experience gains in core earnings in 1Q18 and $46 million in 1Q17. (See \"Performance and Non-GAAP Measures\" in our First Quarter 2018 Report to Shareholders.)\nReported gains related to the direct impact of markets of $50 million in 1Q18 compared with gains of $267 million in 1Q17\nThe 1Q18 gains were primarily due to increasing corporate spreads and a rising and flattening of the yield curve in the U.S., partially offset by charges from unfavourable equity markets and the sale of available-for-sale bonds.\nInsurance Growth\nAchieved annualized premium equivalent (\"APE\") sales 2 of $1.4 billion in 1Q18, a decrease of 10% compared with 1Q17\nIn Asia, APE sales decreased 3% from a particularly strong 1Q17 (1Q17 increased 31% compared with 1Q16) due to lower APE sales in Japan. APE sales increased 10% in Hong Kong and 16% in Asia Other 3 . In Canada, APE sales declined 23% from 1Q17 reflecting elevated sales volumes in the prior year primarily due to regulatory changes on individual insurance and a large-case group benefit sale. In the U.S., APE sales decreased by 20% from 1Q17 due to lower international and variable universal life sales and the impact of our decision to exit sales of corporate and bank-owned life insurance.\nGenerated new business value (\"NBV\") 2 of $384 million in 1Q18, in line with 1Q17\nIn Asia, NBV increased 1% from 1Q17 to $325 million, as improvements in business mix offset the lower sales volumes.\nAchieved embedded value (\"EV\") 2 of $49.2 billion as at December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.8 billion compared with December 31, 2016\nContributions from in-force and new business increased EV by $6.3 billion or 14% from 2016. This increase was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and shareholder dividends which together reduced EV by $4.5 billion. The EV of $49.2 billion, or $24.88 per share, attributes no value to our new business franchise, and only tangible book value to our Global Wealth and Asset Management, Manulife Bank, and Property and Casualty Reinsurance businesses. The 2017 Embedded Value Report is available on our website at http://www.manulife.com .\n1 Effective 1Q18, policyholder experience is being reported excluding minority interest. Comparative prior periods have been updated.\n2 APE sales, NBV and EV are non-GAAP measures. See \"Performance and Non-GAAP Measures\" below and in our First Quarter 2018 MD&A for additional information.\n3 Asia Other excludes Japan and Hong Kong.\nWealth and Asset Management (\"WAM\") Growth\nGenerated gross flows 1 of $36.5 billion in our Global Wealth and Asset Management segment in 1Q18, an increase of 16% compared with 1Q17\nGross flows increased across all regions. In Asia, the increase was primarily driven by broad-based growth in our institutional asset management business from a variety of clients across multiple countries. In Canada, we experienced significant growth in our retail business and received funding for a large institutional mandate. Institutional asset management was also the driver of growth in the U.S., with additional funding from an existing large client.\nGenerated net flows 1 of $10.0 billion in our Global Wealth and Asset Management segment in 1Q18 compared with $4.6 billion in 1Q17\nNet flows increased across all regions driven by higher gross flows as mentioned above and lower redemptions in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by higher redemptions in mainland China, primarily in money market funds.\nAchieved WAM assets under management and administration (\"AUMA\") 1 of $627 billion as at March 31, 2018, an increase of less than 1% compared with December 31, 2017\nThe increase in WAM AUMA was mainly driven by positive net flows in 1Q18 which more than offset the negative impact of market performance on our investment returns. WAM also manages $185 billion in assets for non-WAM reporting lines, and including those managed assets, WAM AUMA was $812 billion as at March 31, 2018.\nTotal Company Growth\nDelivered total assets under management and administration of $1.1 trillion as at March 31, 2018\nAssets under management and administration were in line with December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Strength\nReported a Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (\"LICAT\") ratio of 129% for The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company (\"MLI\") as at March 31, 2018\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions' new LICAT regulatory capital regime came into effect in Canada on January 1, 2018, replacing the Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus framework. As at March 31, 2018, the LICAT ratio for MLI was 129%, compared to a supervisory target level of 100%. As this is the first quarter we are reporting under LICAT, there are no prior period comparatives.\nReported a financial leverage ratio for Manulife of 29.7% as at March 31, 2018 compared with 30.3% as at December 31, 2017\nFinancial leverage decreased from the prior quarter reflecting an increase in equity due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and growth in retained earnings.\n1\nGross flows, net flows and assets under management and administration are non-GAAP measures. See \"Performance and Non-GAAP Measures\" below and in our First Quarter 2018 MD&A for additional information.\nHOW OUR BUSINESSES PERFORMED\nEffective January 1, 2018, as a result of organizational changes made to drive better alignment with our strategic priorities as well as to increase focus and leverage scale in our global wealth and asset management businesses, the Company's wealth and asset management businesses are now a primary reporting segment, Global Wealth and Asset Management.\nAs previously announced, the new financial reporting segments are as follows:\nGlobal Wealth and Asset Management – providing fee-based wealth solutions with little or no guarantees to our retail, retirement and institutional customers around the world. Asia – providing insurance products and insurance-based wealth accumulation products in Asia. Canada – providing insurance products, insurance-based wealth accumulation products and banking services in Canada. U.S. – providing life insurance products and administering in-force long-term care and insurance-based wealth accumulation products in the U.S. Corporate and Other – comprised of investment performance on assets backing capital, net of amounts allocated to operating segments; costs incurred by the corporate office related to shareholder activities (not allocated to operating segments); financing costs; our Property and Casualty Reinsurance business; and run-off reinsurance business lines. Previously we reported the impact of updates to actuarial methods and assumptions in Corporate and Other. These are now reported in the operating segments.\nThe table below reconciles core earnings to net income (loss) attributed to shareholders.\n($ millions)\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\nCore earnings (1)\nAsia\n$\n427\n$\n372\n$\n357\nCanada\n290\n273\n255\nU.S.\n432\n463\n441\nGlobal Wealth and Asset Management\n227\n198\n188\nCorporate and Other (excluding core investment gains)\n(169)\n(201)\n(186)\nCore investment gains\n96\n100\n46\nTotal core earnings\n$\n1,303\n$\n1,205\n$\n1,101\nItems excluded from core earnings\nInvestment-related experience outside of core earnings\n-\n18\n-\nDirect impact of equity markets and interest rates and variable annuity guarantee\nliabilities\n50\n(68)\n267\nChanges in actuarial methods and assumptions\n-\n(33)\n-\nCharge related to decision to change portfolio asset mix supporting our legacy\nbusinesses\n-\n(1,032)\n-\nCharge related to U.S. Tax Reform\n-\n(1,777)\n-\nOther\n19\n81\n(18)\nNet income (loss) attributed to shareholders\n$\n1,372\n$\n(1,606)\n$\n1,350\n(1)\nAll values, including comparative periods, are shown based on the Company's new reporting segments. Please see Section A5 \"Changes to reporting segments and other items\"\nof the First Quarter 2018 MD&A for details on these and other reporting changes.\nAsia\nBusiness highlights\nAsia delivered strong core earnings in 1Q18, with double-digit growth of 21%. While our APE sales declined by 3%, our new business value increased 1% and new business value margin (\"NBV margin\") 1 increased 1.4 percentage points (to 35.9%) compared with 1Q17, reflecting improved business mix.\nWith respect to our strategic priorities we launched our ManulifeMOVE program in Singapore and enhanced the program in mainland China with Apple Watch. We also enhanced our WeChat eClaims process in mainland China by introducing facial recognition, which allows real time verification, thereby dramatically improving customer experience. In Hong Kong we introduced e-claims, which simplified the filing and claims process for our customers.\nEarnings\nExpressed in U.S. dollars, the presentation currency of the segment, net income attributed to shareholders was US$355 million in 1Q18 compared with US$412 million in 1Q17 and core earnings were US$338 million in 1Q18 compared with US$270 million in 1Q17. Items excluded from core earnings were a net gain of US$17 million in 1Q18 compared with a net gain of US$142 million in 1Q17.\nCore earnings in 1Q18 increased 21% compared with 1Q17 on a constant exchange rate basis. The increase in core earnings was driven by a combination of growth in new business volumes, favorable product mix, solid in-force business growth and scale benefits in Hong Kong and Asia Other, partially offset by lower core earnings in Japan due to lower new business volumes.\nThe US$125 million unfavourable change in items excluded from core earnings was primarily due to a net charge related to the direct impact of markets in 1Q18 compared with a net gain in 1Q17 and lower investment-related experience gains in 1Q18 compared with 1Q17.\nSales and new business value\nAnnualized premium equivalent sales in 1Q18 were US$778 million, a decrease of 3% compared with 1Q17 as strong growth in Hong Kong and Asia Other was more than offset by lower sales volumes in Japan. New business value in 1Q18 reached US$257 million, a 1% increase compared with 1Q17.\nJapan APE sales were US$257 million, a decrease of 26% compared with 1Q17 due to increased competition in the corporate market segment and the impact of product re-pricing. Japan NBV in 1Q18 of US$75 million decreased 33% driven by lower APE sales. NBV margin was 29.0%, a decrease of 3.2 percentage points compared with 1Q17. Hong Kong APE sales in 1Q18 were US$149 million, a 10% increase compared with 1Q17. The increase was driven by new customer solutions launched in 2017, and growth as well as increased productivity of our agency channel. Hong Kong NBV in 1Q18 of US$92 million increased 31%, due to higher sales and improvement in product margins. NBV margin was 61.8%, an increase of 9.7 percentage points compared with 1Q17, reflecting product margin improvements implemented in the second half of 2017. Asia Other APE sales in 1Q18 were US$372 million, a 16% increase compared with 1Q17 driven by strong growth in the bancassurance channel. Asia Other NBV in 1Q18 of US$90 million increased 24%. NBV margin was 29.1%, an increase of 0.7 percentage points compared with 1Q17.\nCanada\nBusiness highlights\nIn 1Q18, we entered into a reinsurance transaction on our legacy business to reduce risk and free up $240 million of capital. Our group insurance long-term disability results improved over 1Q17 due to claims experience and repricing. The Manulife Vitality program has been added to all Family Term products and new product launches are under development. Enhancements to our customer-focused digital platforms across our product lines have led to a noticeable improvement in our recent net promoter score results.\n1 NBV margin is a non-GAAP measure. See \"Performance and Non-GAAP Measures\" below and in our First Quarter 2018 MD&A for additional information.\nEarnings\nNet income attributed to shareholders was $459 million in 1Q18 compared with $128 million in 1Q17. Net income attributed to shareholders is comprised of core earnings, which were $290 million in 1Q18 compared with $255 million in 1Q17, and items excluded from core earnings, which were a net gain of $169 million in 1Q18 compared with a net charge of $127 million in 1Q17.\nCore earnings increased $35 million or 14% compared with 1Q17 due to improved claims experience in our group insurance long-term disability business.\nThe 1Q18 gains in items excluded from core earnings included $145 million of favourable investment-related experience gains and $86 million of in-force reinsurance actions. In 1Q17, the charges were primarily related to the direct impact of markets.\nSales\nAnnualized premium equivalent sales were $290 million in 1Q18, a decrease of $85 million or 23% compared with 1Q17. The decline was primarily attributed to the 1Q17 large-case sale in group benefits and elevated 1Q17 individual insurance sales due to tax-exempt changes.\nIndividual insurance APE sales in 1Q18 of $54 million decreased 41% compared with 1Q17. The 1Q17 sales of permanent life insurance were elevated due to tax-exempt changes and, as noted in 1Q17, we did not expect sales to continue at that level. The 1Q18 sales also reflect the impact of repricing actions in 2017 to improve profitability. Group Insurance APE sales in 1Q18 of $163 million decreased $45 million or 22% compared with 1Q17, driven by the timing of large-case group insurance sales. Annuities APE sales in 1Q18 of $73 million decreased $3 million or 4% compared with 1Q17 due to actions to de-emphasize fixed product and higher risk segregated fund 1 sales. We are focused on growth in lower risk segregated fund products and have seen an increase in sales of 19% from $45 million in 1Q17 to $54 million in 1Q18.\nManulife Bank average net lending assets were $20.6 billion as at March 31, 2018, up $0.3 billion or 2% from December 31, 2017.\nU.S.\nBusiness highlights\nWe are making progress on transforming our U.S. business. On the expense front, we signed an outsourcing agreement for 17 legacy IT infrastructure platforms which we expect will result in substantial efficiencies over the next few years. We also announced plans to consolidate our head office real estate footprint in the U.S. over the next year, reducing overall costs and providing a more modern collaborative work environment. With respect to improving returns in our insurance portfolio, we discontinued sales of a low return product category (corporate and bank-owned life insurance or \"COLI/BOLI\") and with respect to our customer-focused initiatives, our John Hancock Vitality sales reached an all-time high in 1Q18, surpassing 1Q17 by 9%.\nEarnings\nExpressed in U.S. dollars, the functional currency of the segment, 1Q18 net income attributed to shareholders was US$425 million compared with US$524 million in 1Q17, core earnings were US$341 million in 1Q18 compared with US$333 million in 1Q17, and items excluded from core earnings were a net gain of US$84 million in 1Q18 compared with a net gain of US$191 million in 1Q17.\nThe US$8 million increase in core earnings was driven by the favourable impact of lower U.S. tax rates and a gain related to a historical annuity reinsurance item, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, product mix changes and less favourable policyholder experience (policyholder experience was favourable in both periods).\nThe net gains in items excluded from core earnings were US$107 million less favourable in 1Q18 compared with 1Q17 primarily due to unfavourable investment-related experience on private equity investments in 1Q18.\nSales\nAnnualized premium equivalents sales in 1Q18 of US$90 million decreased 20% compared with 1Q17, primarily due to lower international and variable universal life sales and the impact of our decision to exit sales of COLI/ BOLI products. The lower international sales were impacted by increased competitive pressures from domestic carriers. Partially offsetting these headwinds, term sales increased and sales of the John Hancock Vitality feature benefited multiple product categories in 1Q18.\n1 Segregated fund products include guarantees. These products are also referred to as variable annuities.\nGlobal Wealth and Asset Management\nBusiness highlights\nWe continued our trend of positive quarterly net flows, and reported $10 billion of net flows in 1Q18. With respect to our growth and customer priorities, we enhanced the PlanRight service in Canada by providing individual in-person retirement advice and gained traction with the recently launched goals-based Managed Individual Retirement Accounts offering for pension rollover clients in the U.S.\nEarnings\nGlobal Wealth and Asset Management's net income attributed to shareholders was $223 million compared with $175 million in 1Q17. Net income attributed to shareholders is comprised of core earnings, which were $227 million in 1Q18 compared with $188 million in 1Q17, and items excluded from core earnings, which were a net charge of $4 million in 1Q18 compared with a net charge of $13 million in 1Q17.\nCore earnings in 1Q18 increased 24% compared with 1Q17 on a constant exchange rate basis. The increase in core earnings was driven by higher fee income on higher average asset levels, and lower U.S. tax rates.\nCore EBITDA 1 was $360 million in 1Q18, an increase of 8% compared with 1Q17 on a constant exchange rate basis. The increase was driven by higher fee income as noted above.\nThe $9 million favourable change in the items excluded from core earnings in 1Q18 was primarily due to higher integration costs in our retirement businesses in Hong Kong and Canada in 1Q17.\nGross Flows and Net Flows\nAs noted above, gross flows were $36.5 billion in 1Q18, an increase of 16% compared with 1Q17 and net flows were $10.0 billion in 1Q18, an increase of $5.4 billion compared with 1Q17. By geography the results were:\nWAM Asia:\nGross flows in Asia in 1Q18 were $7.4 billion, an increase of 35% compared with 1Q17, reflecting growth across all business lines.\nRetail gross flows of $3.8 billion in 1Q18 increased 1% compared with 1Q17, driven by the continued success of our bank distribution partnerships across several markets, partially offset by lower gross flows in mainland China. Retirement gross flows of $1.2 billion in 1Q18 increased 20% compared with 1Q17, mainly driven by higher gross flows in Hong Kong, which benefited from solid organic growth. Institutional asset management gross flows in 1Q18 of $2.4 billion increased 242% compared with 1Q17, driven by additional contributions from existing clients in Japan, a large mandate in Hong Kong, and new clients in Indonesia.\nNet flows in 1Q18 were $2.0 billion, compared with net flows of $1.0 billion in 1Q17, driven by higher gross flows as mentioned above and a large redemption from an institutional client in 1Q17, partially offset by higher redemptions in mainland China money market funds.\nWAM Canada:\nGross flows in Canada in 1Q18 were $8.0 billion, an increase of 33% compared with 1Q17, driven by growth across all business lines.\nRetail gross flows of $3.3 billion in 1Q18 increased 56% compared with 1Q17, driven by strong fund performance and continued sales force and marketing momentum. Retirement gross flows of $2.4 billion in 1Q18 increased 15% compared with 1Q17, mainly due to higher sales of defined contribution plans and recurring contributions from existing clients. Institutional asset management gross flows were $2.3 billion, an increase of 29% compared with 1Q17, driven by the funding of a $1.0 billion fixed income mandate.\nNet flows were $3.5 billion in 1Q18, up from $1.4 billion in 1Q17 with increases across all three business lines due to higher gross flows as mentioned above.",
