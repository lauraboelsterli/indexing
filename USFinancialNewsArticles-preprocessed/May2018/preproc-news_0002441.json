    "text": "TULSA, OK, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (NYSE:LPI) (\"Laredo\" or \"the Company\") today announced its 2018 first-quarter results, reporting net income attributable to common stockholders of $86.5 million, or $0.36 per diluted share. Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, of 2018 was $57.6 million, or $0.24 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, of 2018 was $143.4 million. Please see supplemental financial information at the end of this news release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.\n2018 First-Quarter Highlights\nProduced a Company record 63,314 barrels of oil equivalent (\"BOE\") per day and increased anticipated production growth for full-year 2018 to greater than 12%\nReduced unit cash costs to $8.74 per BOE, a decrease of approximately 4% from the first quarter of 2017\nIncreased Adjusted EBITDA to $143.4 million, up 33% from the first quarter of 2017\nRepurchased 6,727,901 shares of common stock at a weighted-average price of $8.69 per share for $58.5 million under the Company's share repurchase program\n\"Operational results in the first quarter were in-line with expectations as we overcame delays from adverse weather at the beginning of the quarter,\" stated Randy A. Foutch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We completed four more wells than projected, driven by efficiency gains in our completions operations that pulled wells forward from the second quarter. The results our drilling and completions teams were able to accomplish to shorten cycle times significantly improved efficiency during the quarter.\"\n\"We are increasing our production expectations for 2018 as our work to optimize contract areas on our contiguous acreage is increasing both the working interest and lateral lengths of our wells. Additionally, the longer-term results from well packages designed to test tighter spacing are encouraging. We are aggressively moving forward with our development utilizing 32 Upper/Middle Wolfcamp wells per drilling spacing unit which, coupled with shorter cycle times and an accelerated pace of drilling, is expected to drive improved capital efficiency. We now anticipate adding a fifth horizontal drilling rig around the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019.\"\nE&P Update\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Laredo produced a Company record 63,314 BOE per day, completing 20 gross (20 net) horizontal wells with an average completed lateral length of approximately 9,700 feet. The number of completions in first-quarter 2018 was positively impacted by shortened cycle times, reflecting efficiency improvements related to contracting a second dedicated completions crew and completion design modifications.\nLaredo continued to utilize various completion designs during the first quarter with the goal of improving productivity, reducing capital costs and driving improved capital efficiency. Design refinements included lengthening stages, reducing fluid concentrations and utilizing PerfExtra, the Gas Technology Institutes' patented hydraulic fracturing technology. These completion designs were planned as parts of larger well packages wherein the remaining wells were completed with the Company's standard design in order to obtain a direct comparison of the wells' productivity. Well productivity is balanced with the capital savings to assess the value of the completion design modifications. Lengthening stages and reducing fluid concentrations both contributed to cycle time and capital costs reductions. The initial productivity of the wells with reduced fluid concentration has been below expectations, although additional production data will be needed to determine the impact on longer-term capital efficiency. The Company does expect to continue to phase in longer stage lengths and PerfExtra on wells throughout the year, as they are positive for capital efficiency.\nUnit lease operating expenses (\"LOE\") were $3.85 per BOE in the first quarter of 2018, the seventh consecutive quarter of unit LOE less than $4.00 per BOE. Cost pressure and non-recurring well work contributed to the increase from fourth-quarter 2017. The Company's guidance for second-quarter 2018 unit LOE of $3.70 per BOE is expected to be more reflective of unit LOE for the remainder of 2018.\nLaredo expects to complete 17 gross horizontal wells (16.5 net) in the second quarter of 2018 with an average completed lateral length of approximately 10,800 feet. Eleven of these wells are being developed as a package and are not expected to begin flowback until the end of second-quarter 2018. The Company is currently operating three horizontal drilling rigs and is in the process of adding a fourth rig at the beginning of the third quarter. Laredo also expects to add a fifth horizontal rig around the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019 as completion efficiency gains and the current commodity price environment drive increasing operating cash flow.\nThe Company expects average completed lateral length to increase throughout 2018. Laredo's first three 15,000-foot horizontal wells have continued to improve since they were completed in the third quarter of 2017 and their average cumulative production is now performing in-line with the Company's Upper/Middle Wolfcamp type curve, adjusted for their lateral length. Laredo's contiguous acreage currently supports more than 500 land-ready Upper/Middle Wolfcamp locations of at least 15,000 feet.\nPositive results from previously drilled co-developed packages support Laredo's transition to a 32 Upper/Middle Wolfcamp wells per drilling spacing unit (\"DSU\") development plan. The Sugg-A 157/158 five-well package, developed on 32 Upper/Middle Wolfcamp wells per DSU spacing and completed in the second and third quarters of 2017, is performing above type curve after approximately nine months. The nine-well Lane Trust package, developed on 24 Upper/Middle Wolfcamp wells per DSU spacing and completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, is also performing above type curve. Throughout the remainder of 2018, Laredo expects approximately 20 to 25 of its remaining completions in 2018 to be developed on 32 Upper/Middle Wolfcamp wells per DSU spacing.\nThe Company is increasing its anticipated full-year 2018 total production growth guidance to greater than 12% and reiterating previously-issued oil production growth guidance of greater than 10% as compared to 2017. Quarterly production growth is expected to be uneven as three packages of at least eight wells are scheduled to be brought on production throughout the last seven months of 2018.\nCrude Marketing\nLaredo crude marketing has focused on achieving the ability to sell crude in multiple markets and protecting the Company's oil pricing from basin differentials. The Company entered into a crude oil purchase agreement with Shell Trading (US) Company (\"Shell\") effective October 1, 2016 through June 30, 2020 (\"the Contract\"), for this purpose. The Contract provided a menu of pricing alternatives that enabled Laredo, at the Company's option, to take advantage of Midland market pricing as well as U.S. Gulf Coast market pricing.\nAs previously reported, on May 3, 2017, Shell sued Laredo, alleging that the Contract did not accurately reflect the compensation to be paid to Shell under one of the pricing options due to a drafting mistake, despite clear language in the Contract to the contrary. Laredo does not believe that there was a drafting mistake. Although the Contract is still the subject of litigation regarding the alleged mistake and other related claims asserted by Shell, as of May 1, 2018, Shell has terminated the Contract and informed Laredo that it will no longer continue to purchase crude oil from Laredo, as well as sell crude oil to Laredo, as it is required to do under the Contract. Laredo believes the termination was improper and the Company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under the terminated Contract and seek all appropriate damages from Shell. The Company continues to believe that Shell's claims are without merit.\nAlthough not reflective of the total damages caused by Shell's wrongful termination, the estimated current net impact to Laredo's crude oil price realization as a result of the Shell breach is the reduction of aggregate second-quarter 2018 forecasted crude oil price realizations from 95% of West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") to 91% of WTI. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of its anticipated crude oil production for the remainder of 2018 is still protected from the Midland basis differential through a combination of 10,000 barrels of oil per day (\"BOPD\") of Midland-Cushing basis swaps and 10,000 BOPD of Laredo's firm capacity on the Bridgetex pipeline, hedged with Midland-Houston basis swaps, providing Laredo exposure to pricing at the U.S. Gulf Coast market.\nFurther discussion regarding the litigation will be included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nNatural Gas Marketing\nThe Company, through Laredo Midstream Services, LLC (\"LMS\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Laredo, owns approximately 170 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines. By owning the pipelines that deliver natural gas to processors' systems instead of utilizing gathering infrastructure owned by a processor, Laredo is better able to manage the delivery of its gas for sales. Should a processor be unable to accept the Company's natural gas production due to curtailments, Laredo's owned natural gas gathering system has the ability to shift production to another processor for continued natural gas sales.\nIn addition to the Company's focus on field-level flow assurance, Laredo makes substantial efforts to protect anticipated cash flows generated from the sales of the Company's produced natural gas. For 2018, the Company has hedged approximately 75% of anticipated natural gas production to protect from a widening Waha basis. For the second quarter of 2018, resulting from a severe widening of the Waha basis, Laredo anticipates the Company's realized price for natural gas will be approximately 36% of Henry Hub. If the Company's natural gas hedges and basis swaps were included in realized pricing, the anticipated realized price would rise to 62% of Henry Hub.\n2018 Capital Program\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Laredo invested approximately $140 million in drilling and completion activities. Other expenditures incurred during the quarter included approximately $3 million in bolt-on land acquisitions, lease extensions and data, approximately $8 million in infrastructure, including LMS investments, and approximately $10 million in other capitalized costs.\nThe Company's expected working interest and lateral length for wells completed in 2018 has increased from original budget expectations to approximately 95% and 10,600 feet, respectively. Additionally, delayed implementation of in-basin sand is impacting well costs. Including these new expectations, drilling and completion capital for 2018 is expected to increase $30 million to $500 million. Other capital expenditures are expected to remain unchanged at $85 million, bringing total annual capital expenditures to $585 million.\nLiquidity\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $56 million and undrawn capacity under the senior secured credit facility of $945 million, resulting in total liquidity of approximately $1.0 billion.\nOn April 19, 2018, in connection with the semi-annual redetermination of the Company's senior secured credit facility, lenders increased the Company's borrowing base to $1.3 billion and Laredo increased its elected commitment to $1.2 billion. The pricing grid for the facility was reduced by 75 basis points for drawn amounts at all utilization breakpoints.\nAt May 1, 2018, the Company had cash and equivalents of approximately $81 million and available capacity under the senior secured credit facility of $1.09 billion, resulting in total available liquidity of approximately $1.17 billion.\nCommodity Derivatives\nLaredo maintains a disciplined hedging program to reduce the variability in its anticipated cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices. The Company utilizes a combination of puts, swaps and collars, entering into contracts solely with banks that are part of its senior secured credit facility. Laredo currently has hedges in place for approximately 90% of anticipated oil production in 2018 and has oil hedges through 2020. Laredo has also entered into NGL and natural gas hedges through 2018 and basis hedges through 2020. Details of the Company's hedge positions are included in the current Corporate Presentation available on the Company's website at www.laredopetro.com .\nGuidance\nThe Company is increasing its anticipated full-year 2018 total production growth guidance to greater than 12% and reiterating previously issued oil production growth guidance of greater than 10% as compared to 2017. The table below reflects the Company's guidance for the second quarter of 2018.\n2Q-2018E Total production (MBOE/d) 64.0 Oil production (MBO/d) 27.4 Price Realizations (pre-hedge): Crude oil (% of WTI) 91% Natural gas liquids (% of WTI) 28% Natural gas (% of Henry Hub) 36% Operating Costs & Expenses: Lease operating expenses ($/BOE) $ 3.70 Midstream expenses ($/BOE) $ 0.15 Production and ad valorem taxes (% of oil, NGL and natural gas revenue) 6.25% General and administrative expenses: Cash ($/BOE) $ 2.70 Non-cash stock-based compensation ($/BOE) $ 1.85 Depletion, depreciation and amortization ($/BOE) $ 8.00 Conference Call Details\nOn Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 7:30 a.m. CT, Laredo will host a conference call to discuss its first-quarter 2018 financial and operating results and management’s outlook, the content of which is not part of this earnings release.

Laredo’s business strategy is focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and midstream and marketing services, primarily in the Permian Basin of West Texas.\nAdditional information about Laredo may be found on its website at www.laredopetro.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and any oral statements made regarding the subject of this release, including in the conference call referenced herein, contain as defined under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities that Laredo assumes, plans, expects, believes, intends, projects, estimates or anticipates (and other similar expressions) will, should or may occur in the future are . The are based on management’s current belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events.\nGeneral risks relating to Laredo include, but are not limited to, the decline in prices of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas and the related impact to financial statements as a result of asset impairments and revisions to reserve estimates, the increase in service costs, hedging activities, possible impacts of pending or potential litigation, the suspension or discontinuance of share repurchases at any time and other factors, including those and other risks described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and those set forth from time to time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). These documents are available through Laredo’s website at www.laredopetro.com under the tab “Investor Relations” or through the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval System at www.sec.gov . Any of these factors could cause Laredo’s actual results and plans to differ materially from those in the . Therefore, Laredo can give no assurance that its future results will be as estimated. Laredo does not intend to, and disclaims any obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statement.\nThe SEC generally permits oil and natural gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are reserve estimates that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and certain probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC’s definitions for such terms. In this press release and the conference call, the Company may use the terms “resource potential” and “estimated ultimate recovery,” or \"EURs,\" each of which the SEC guidelines restrict from being included in filings with the SEC without strict compliance with SEC definitions. These terms refer to the Company’s internal estimates of unbooked hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially added to proved reserves, largely from a specified resource play. A resource play is a term used by the Company to describe an accumulation of hydrocarbons known to exist over a large areal expanse and/or thick vertical section potentially supporting numerous drilling locations, which, when compared to a conventional play, typically has a lower geological and/or commercial development risk. EURs are based on the Company’s previous operating experience in a given area and publicly available information relating to the operations of producers who are conducting operations in these areas. Unbooked resource potential or EURs do not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or SEC rules and do not include any proved reserves. Actual quantities of reserves that may be ultimately recovered from the Company’s interests may differ substantially from those presented herein. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of the Company’s ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, decreases in oil and natural gas prices, drilling costs and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, negative revisions to reserve estimates and other factors as well as actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates. Estimates of unproved reserves may change significantly as development of the Company’s core assets provides additional data. In addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price declines or drilling cost increases.\nLaredo Petroleum, Inc.\nCondensed consolidated statements of operations\nThree months ended March 31, (in thousands, except per share data) 2018 2017 (unaudited) Revenues: Oil, NGL and natural gas sales $ 197,434 $ 138,736 Midstream service revenues 2,359 2,999 Sales of purchased oil 59,903 47,271 Total revenues 259,696 189,006 Costs and expenses: Lease operating expenses 21,951 16,992 Production and ad valorem taxes 11,812 8,781 Midstream service expenses 693 916 Costs of purchased oil 60,664 50,256 General and administrative 24,725 25,597 Depletion, depreciation and amortization 45,553 34,112 Other operating expenses 1,106 1,026 Total costs and expenses 166,504 137,680 Operating income 93,192 51,326 Non-operating income (expense): Gain on derivatives, net 9,010 36,671 Income from equity method investee (1) — 3,068 Interest expense (13,518 ) (22,720 ) Other, net (2,164 ) (69 ) Non-operating income (expense), net (6,672 ) 16,950 Income before income taxes 86,520 68,276 Income tax: Deferred — — Total income tax — — Net income $ 86,520 $ 68,276 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.36 $ 0.29 Diluted $ 0.36 $ 0.28 Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic 238,228 238,505 Diluted 239,319 244,379\n(1) On October 30, 2017, LMS, together with Medallion Midstream Holdings, LLC, which is owned and controlled by an affiliate of the third-party interest holder, The Energy & Minerals Group, completed the sale of 100% of the ownership interests in Medallion Gathering & Processing, LLC, a Texas limited liability company formed on October 12, 2012, which, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, \"Medallion\"), to an affiliate of Global Infrastructure Partners (\"GIP\"), for cash consideration of $1.825 billion (the \"Medallion Sale\").

Therefore, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in conjunction with net income or loss and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or loss or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, such as net income or loss, operating income or loss or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate performance, prior to income tax expense or benefit, mark-to-market on derivatives, premiums paid for derivatives, gains or losses on disposal of assets and other non-recurring income and expenses and after applying adjusted income tax expense. We believe Adjusted Net Income helps investors in the oil and natural gas industry to measure and compare our performance to other oil and natural gas companies by excluding from the calculation items that can vary significantly from company to company depending upon accounting methods, the book value of assets and other non-operational factors.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of income before income taxes (GAAP) to Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP):\nThree months ended March 31, (in thousands, except per share data) 2018 2017 (unaudited) Income before income taxes $ 86,520 $ 68,276 Plus: Mark-to-market on derivatives: Gain on derivatives, net (9,010 ) (36,671 ) Settlements (paid) received for matured derivatives, net (2,236 ) 7,451 Premiums paid for derivatives (4,024 ) (2,107 ) Loss on disposal of assets, net 2,617 214 Adjusted income before adjusted income tax expense 73,867 37,163 Adjusted income tax expense (1) (16,251 ) (13,379 ) Adjusted Net Income $ 57,616 $ 23,784 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.36 $ 0.29 Diluted $ 0.36 $ 0.28 Adjusted Net Income per common share: Basic $ 0.24 $ 0.10 Diluted $ 0.24 $ 0.10 Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic 238,228 238,505 Diluted 239,319 244,379\n(1) Adjusted income tax expense is calculated by applying a statutory tax rate of 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, in response to recent changes in the tax code, and 36% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income or loss plus adjustments for depletion, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation, net, accretion expense, mark-to-market on derivatives, premiums paid for derivatives, interest expense, gains or losses on disposal of assets, income or loss from equity method investee, proportionate Adjusted EBITDA of equity method investee and other non-recurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA provides no information regarding a company’s capital structure, borrowings, interest costs, capital expenditures, working capital movement or tax position. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary use because those funds are required for debt service, capital expenditures, working capital, income taxes, franchise taxes and other commitments and obligations. However, our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because this measure:\nis widely used by investors in the oil and natural gas industry to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors;\nhelps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating structure; and\nis used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of operating performance, in presentations to our board of directors and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nThere are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance, including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non-recurring items that materially affect our net income or loss, the lack of comparability of results of operations to different companies and the different methods of calculating Adjusted EBITDA reported by different companies. Our measurements of Adjusted EBITDA for financial reporting as compared to compliance under our debt agreements differ.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP):\nThree months ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 (unaudited) Net income $ 86,520 $ 68,276 Plus: Depletion, depreciation and amortization 45,553 34,112 Non-cash stock-based compensation, net 9,339 9,224 Accretion expense 1,106 928 Mark-to-market on derivatives: Gain on derivatives, net (9,010 ) (36,671 ) Settlements (paid) received for matured derivatives, net (2,236 ) 7,451 Premiums paid for derivatives (4,024 ) (2,107 ) Interest expense 13,518 22,720 Loss on disposal of assets, net 2,617 214 Income from equity method investee (1) — (3,068 ) Proportionate Adjusted EBITDA of equity method investee (1)(2) — 6,365 Adjusted EBITDA $ 143,383 $ 107,444",
