Join us at our London offices on May 11 for a discussion of how the risks are changing in sanctions. Mara Lemos Stein will interview Michael O’Kane of Peters & Peters and Justine Walker of U.K. Finance. http://go.dowjones.com/BreakfastBriefingMay11London .\nThe logo of Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. is shown next to a Chinese flag in Shanghai in 2014. AFP PHOTO/JOHANNES EISELE/China OUT Good morning. Chinese telecommunications equipment companies could face additional restrictions on their U.S. sales as the Trump administration considers executive actions it says may be needed to address national security concerns.\nThe move would represent a significant escalation of a growing feud between the U.S. and China over tech and telecommunications, The Wall Street Journal’s John D. McKinnon reports .\nAffected firms likely would include Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. The U.S. Department of Defense this week said it is moving to halt the sale of phones made by the two companies on U.S. military bases world-wide.\nU.S. officials are concerned Beijing could order manufacturers to hack into products they make to spy or disable communications. Huawei and ZTE have said that would never happen.\nThe U.S. is considering barring companies that do business with the government from using network equipment made by companies that could pose a national-security risk, people familiar with the matter told WSJ. The exact scope of an executive order is under discussion and no final decisions have been made, the report said.\nA spokesman for the White House National Security Council said officials “have no comment on the matter at this time.” Huawei declined to comment on the potential executive order. ZTE didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nAttention turns to U.K. crown dependencies on corporate registers. The U.K. crown dependencies may have avoided new anti-money laundering regulations for now, but attention is set to turn their way, say some observers.\nLeaders of the U.K. crown dependencies welcomed the decision not to target the islands , which also have a reputation as havens of financial secrecy, following moves this week to tighten rules on Scottish Limited Partnerships and open up corporate registries in overseas territories.\nJersey remains “absolutely aligned with the U.K.” in its commitment to fight money laundering and financial crime, said Geoff Cook, chief of Jersey Finance, an organization representing the bailiwick’s financial center.\nThe Jersey registry of corporate owners is “available to the people who need that vital information,” said Mr. Cook. “Through our ongoing alignment with and adoption of all international standards, we are confident in our ability to fight financial crime while protecting the compliant confidentiality of our investors,” he said.\nCorporate-ownership registries are a hot-button issue now as countries tighten their anti-money laundering rules. Companies don’t have to disclose their ultimate owner in some jurisdictions; in others they make the disclosure but it’s not open to the public. Companies registered in so-called secrecy jurisdictions are legal but could be abused by criminals seeking to launder money.\nAntigraft group Transparency International said in early April the U.K. is the only country to make its corporate registry publicly available but noted overseas territories and crown dependencies still pose problems.\nMembers of the U.K. parliament who were behind the move opening up the overseas territories have the crown dependencies in their sights.\nAndrew Mitchell, a Conservative member of Parliament, was Quote: : d by the Financial Times as saying he expects the crown dependencies to adopt the policies imposed on overseas territories. “If they do not, then parliament will seek to ensure that they do,” he said. — Samuel Rubenfeld\nSurvey roundup: cyberattacks in energy. A look at recent research on risk issues finds 70% of technology professionals at energy firms surveyed by Tripwire Inc . fear a cyberattack could cause a catastrophe. More than half said it would take a significant attack to compel their organization to put appropriate resources into industrial control systems.\nOutdoor-ad firm sees risk under bribery law. Investigations of misappropriated funds at a Hong Kong-listed unit of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings could lead to sanctions against it under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nCOMPLIANCE\nKKR to ditch partnership structure. KKR will convert to a corporation from a partnership, a shift many publicly traded private-equity firms have been contemplating on the heels of sweeping U.S. tax legislation, the WSJ reports. The law lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.\nDATA SECURITY\nCambridge Analytica to close. Cambridge Analytica , a data firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, is shutting down following allegations about its misuse of Facebook data and the campaign tactics it pitched to clients, the WSJ reports.\nCambridge Analytica’s offices in London.

Facebook Inc. has fired an employee who bragged about his access to private user information, the WSJ reports. The employee’s alleged remarks highlight the potential for employees to abuse their access to the private information of the social network’s users.\nGOVERNANCE\nSprint CEO to step aside. Sprint Corp. ’s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, is stepping back from day-to-day management to be executive chairman of Sprint and chief operating officer of SoftBank Group Corp ., its controlling shareholder. Sprint finance chief Michel Combes will be CEO, the WSJ reports.\nZynga moves to single-class share structure. Social and mobile-game maker Zynga Inc. is moving to a single-class stock structure, diminishing the control of its founder as other technology companies maintain systems that give insiders extra voting power, the WSJ reports.\nREPUTATION\nStarbucks settles with arrested men. Starbucks Corp. and Philadelphia reached settlements with two black men whose arrest at a Starbucks in the city sparked protests. Starbucks will pay the men an unspecified sum. Philadelphia will pay each man $1 and fund a $200,000 grant aimed at helping local students, the WSJ reports.\nRISK\nPlayer alleges collusion by football league. Free agent safety Eric Reid filed a grievance against the NFL and all 32 teams alleging they have colluded to keep him unsigned. His former teammate Colin Kaepernick previously sued, alleging the league effectively blackballed him because of his political views, the WSJ reports.\nOPERATIONS\nStorm kills at least 72 in India. A powerful dust and rainstorm swept parts of northern and western India, killing 72 people and injuring more than 100 others as houses collapsed and trees toppled, officials said Thursday, the AP reports.\nThe rainstorm caught people by surprise. Here, children swim during the storm in New Delhi. PHOTO: CHANDAN KHANNA/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES STRATEGY\nRelativity Media aims for reboot. The upstart film studio Relavity Media , which emerged from bankruptcy two years ago after a string of box-office flops, has agreed to be acquired by a joint venture that intends to revitalize the business, the WSJ reports.\nAUDIT\nKPMG South Africa loses banking client. Barclays Africa Group dropped KPMG LLP South Africa as an auditor, Bloomberg reports. The auditing firm did work for the Gupta family, who are being probed for using connections with former President Jacob Zuma to win government contracts. The family denies wrongdoing.\nThe Morning Risk Report from WSJ’s Risk & Compliance Journal cues up the most important news in risk and compliance every weekday morning.
