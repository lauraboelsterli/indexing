    "text": "ERBIL, Iraq, May 13 (Reuters) - The Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Party (PUK) emerged from national elections firmly ahead of its rivals in Sulaimaniya province, its traditional stronghold, initial tallies showed on Sunday.\nThe PUK looked to have won eight seats, sources in the country’s election commission said, well ahead of smaller rivals which had hoped for significant gains from Saturday’s vote.\nSupporters of the PUK and Movement for Change, known as Gorran, clashed in the northern city of Sulaimaniya late on Saturday amid accusations of ballot rigging.\nInitial tallies showed Gorran had won three seats.
