    "text": "9:00 AM ET Tue, 29 May 2018 | 02:38\nIf the nuclear talks between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un do actually happen, it will mark the culmination of a long and unusual path.\nJust last year, Kim and Trump were exchanging insults and threats. Now they're on the verge of a historic summit – apparently.\n\"One has to treat this like a soap opera,\" Vipin Narang, a professor at MIT who studies nuclear proliferation, told CNBC. \"Every day brings a new, mostly predictable twist, but just stay tuned for the finale and to see if the season will be renewed for next year.\"Since March 8, when Trump first agreed to meet with Kim, the president has canceled the summit, which was set for June 12 in Singapore. Likewise, North Korea has threatened to exit negotiations, and its negotiators failed to show up to attend a planning meeting. Yet, since Trump called it off, the administration has all but confirmed that the meeting will go on.\nPlanning continues. According to the White House, teams are working in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea and in Singapore. On Wednesday, a leading North Korean official, Kim Yong Chol, arrived in New York ahead of planned discussions with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo .\n\"I think that anybody who has negotiated with North Korea in the past knows that these changes, threats, not showing up — that's not really new in North Korean behavior,\" said Lisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"What's different here is the personalities involved, which is Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump.\"\nHere is a timeline of how things have developed in the U.S. relationship with North Korea since Trump took office. North Korea taunts Trump administration with missile tests STR | AFP | Getty Images This photo taken on February 12, 2017 and released on February 13 by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (C) surrounded by soldiers of the Korean People's Army as he inspects the test-launch of a surface-to-surface medium long-range ballistic missile Pukguksong-2 at an undisclosed location.\nNorth Korea launched its most aggressive year yet for missile testing less than a month into the Trump administration. The regime tested the KN-15 (Pukkuksong-2) medium range ballistic missile in February.\nBy the summer, the country launched its first intercontinental missile on July 4, which is Independence Day in the U.S. The Hwasong-14 long-range intercontinental ballistic missile had the capacity to reach the continental United States, according to experts.\nIn September, Kim tested the country's most powerful nuclear missile . The country claimed the test was a \"perfect success,\" and experts agreed that the detonation was larger than any from the reclusive country's previous testing. 'Fire and fury like the world has never seen' Jonathan Ernst | Reuters President Donald Trump (R) speaks about North Korea as he sits beside U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tom Price (L) during an opioid-related briefing at Trump's golf estate in Bedminster, New Jersey, U.S., August 8, 2017.\n\"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,\" Trump told reporters Aug. 8, from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. \"They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. He has been very threatening ... and as I said they will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.\"\nTrump's warning came the same day that news outlets reported North Korea could fit miniaturized nuclear devices inside its missiles , a key step in its nuclear program that upped the ante for U.S. defense strategists. Shortly after Trump's remarks, North Korea responded by threatening to strike Guam , an American territory in the Pacific ocean. Trump tells Tillerson not to bother with 'Little Rocket Man' Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks alongside Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L) during a Cabinet Meeting in the Cabinet Room at the White House in Washington, DC, December 20, 2017.\nTrump chided his then-secretary of State publicly over attempts to negotiate with North Korea in an October Twitter post, writing that he told \" Rex Tillerson , our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.\" I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man...\nTrump publicly adopted the \"Rocket Man\" monicker for North Korea's leader the month before, first tweeting that he had asked South Korean leader Moon Jae-in \"how Rocket Man is doing.\" ",
