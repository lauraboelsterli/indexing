    "text": "BOTHELL, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGEN) today announced the appointment of Roger D. Dansey, M.D., as Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Dansey brings extensive experience in cancer drug development, most recently from Merck Inc. where he was Therapeutic Area Head for Late Stage Oncology, responsible for the ongoing registration efforts for KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) across multiple tumor types.\n“Roger’s appointment reflects the growing importance of late-stage clinical drug development at Seattle Genetics as we transition to a global, multi-product oncology company,” said Clay Siegall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Seattle Genetics. “Roger’s drug development and approval experience at industry leaders, including Merck, Gilead and Amgen, his deep oncology background and proven ability to collaborate and lead teams, make him an ideal fit for Seattle Genetics as we strive to bring transformative therapies to people with cancer.”\nDr. Dansey stated, “This is an exciting time at Seattle Genetics with both a growing, approved drug in ADCETRIS as well as a product pipeline with important new opportunities, including three solid tumor programs in ongoing or planned pivotal trials. I look forward to working with the many talented individuals at Seattle Genetics to bring these new therapies to patients.”\nRoger D. Dansey was Senior Vice President at Merck Inc. from January 2015 to April 2018, where he led the company’s late-stage oncology development efforts including the approved PD-1 inhibitor, KEYTRUDA ® . Prior to joining Merck, Dr. Dansey was Vice President, Oncology Clinical Research at Gilead Sciences. He initially joined the industry at Amgen working in roles of increasing responsibility in Amgen’s oncology and hematology therapeutic area, including as Global Development Leader for XGEVA ® . He received his Medical Degrees from the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.\nDr. Dansey succeeds Jonathan Drachman, M.D., who will remain with Seattle Genetics as a strategic advisor for innovation. Dr. Siegall added, “Jonathan has been a key contributor and leader at Seattle Genetics since joining the company nearly 14 years ago. He has been instrumental in the development of ADCETRIS, the expansion of Research and Development and advancement of our robust pipeline of both antibody-drug conjugates and novel immuno-oncology programs. I look forward to working with Jonathan on innovation initiatives that can ultimately benefit cancer patients.”\nAbout Seattle Genetics\nSeattle Genetics, Inc. is an emerging multi-product, global biotechnology company that develops and commercializes transformative therapies targeting cancer to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives. ADCETRIS ® (brentuximab vedotin) utilizes the company’s industry-leading antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology and is currently approved for the treatment of multiple CD30-expressing lymphomas. Beyond ADCETRIS, the company has established a pipeline of novel targeted therapies at various stages of clinical testing, including three in ongoing or planned pivotal trials for solid tumors. Enfortumab vedotin for metastatic urothelial cancer and tisotumab vedotin for metastatic cervical cancer utilize our proprietary ADC technology. Tucatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is in a pivotal trial for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In addition, we are leveraging our expertise in empowered antibodies to build a portfolio of proprietary immuno-oncology agents in clinical trials targeting hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The company is headquartered in Bothell, Washington, and has a European office in Switzerland.

Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include that the company may be delayed in its planned clinical trial initiations, the enrollment in and conduct of its clinical trials, obtaining data from clinical trials, planned regulatory submissions, and regulatory approvals in each case for a variety of reasons including the difficulty and uncertainty of pharmaceutical product development, unexpected adverse events or regulatory discussions or actions, including with respect to special protocol assessment agreements defining trial endpoints and the inherent uncertainty associated with the regulatory approval process. The company may also be unable to expand ADCETRIS’ labeled indications due to unexpected or delayed data from its ongoing phase 3 trials or regulatory action, including the risks that the company’s supplemental BLA submissions may not be accepted for filing by, or ultimately approved by, the FDA in a timely manner or at all or with the requested label, and may be unable to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, its product candidates. More information about the risks and uncertainties faced by Seattle Genetics is contained under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Seattle Genetics disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180517005355/en/\nSeattle Genetics, Inc.\nInvestors:\nPeggy Pinkston, 425-527-4160\nppinkston@seagen.com\nor\nMedia:\nMonique Greer, 425-527-4641\nmgreer@seagen.com\nSource: Seattle Genetics, Inc.",
