Delta Dental maintains a more than 30-year presence in San Francisco as it relocates its corporate headquarters to 560 Mission Street. Delta Dental will also expand its footprint in the Bay Area with a new Oakland office at 1333 Broadway. In conjunction with the move, Delta Dental Community Care Foundation donated $200,000 to four local charities, delivering on its commitment to improve the health and enhance the lives of the people in its communities, especially those who are most in need.\n“As we pursue a strategy for growth, we’re proud to enhance our Bay Area presence and create two new environments that put our people first,” said Tony Barth, president and chief executive officer of Delta Dental. “Our offices are designed to represent our culture and uncap our potential as a high-performing organization by promoting engagement, communication and collaboration, while helping to foster individual and team success.”\nThe Delta Dental Community Care Foundation has donated a total of $200,000 to local Oakland and San Francisco-based organizations, building on its long-standing commitment to philanthropy and community investment. Covenant House California, SF Marin Food Bank, Larkin Street Youth Services and Alameda County Community Food Bank have each received a $50,000 grant, and an additional donation of 10,000 dental kits have been gifted to Covenant House California and Larkin Street Youth Services.\n“We’re excited by our continued investment and a strong, visible presence in the Bay Area. We have a long history of helping to build healthier, happier communities, and are thrilled to collaborate with these worthy partners,” said Karen L. Robinson, vice president of corporate affairs for Delta Dental and executive director of the Delta Dental Community Care Foundation. “We’re passionate about creating smiles, and the work carried out through our Foundation helps us deliver more smiles to deserving groups and individuals. These donations are part of our ongoing pledge to give at least 10 percent of our net income back to the communities we serve.”\nThe Foundation’s focus areas include access to care, oral health education, supporting scientific research and community giving. In 2017, the Delta Dental Community Care Foundation awarded more than $9.6 million to hundreds of community groups, dental clinics, oral health education and research grants.\nTo learn more about Delta Dental please visit deltadentalins.com and to learn more about the Delta Dental Community Care Foundation please visit deltadentalins.com/about/philanthropy .\nAbout Delta Dental\nDelta Dental of California, Delta Dental Insurance Company, Delta Dental of Pennsylvania, Delta Dental of New York, Inc., and their affiliated companies together provide dental benefits to 36.5 million people in 15 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
