    "text": "Nick Ahmed hit Sean Manaea’s seventh pitch of the game for a home run and later contributed an RBI single to a three-run fourth inning, sending the Arizona Diamondbacks on their way to a 7-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics in the opener of a three-game interleague series Friday night in Oakland, Calif.\nLeft-hander Patrick Corbin (5-1) allowed two or fewer runs for the fourth time in five starts this month, limiting the A’s to four hits and one run in seven innings and helping the Diamondbacks snap a seven-game losing streak.\nMark Canha homered for Oakland’s only run.\nAfter Ahmed’s seventh home run of the season had given the Diamondbacks a 1-0 lead, the visitors tacked on a pair in the third on John Ryan Murphy’s two-run double. Jeff Mathis, who had walked, and David Peralta, who had singled, scored on the hit.\nCanha’s homer, his seventh of the year, got Oakland back within 3-1 in the bottom of the third before Arizona busted the game open and chased Manaea in the fourth.\nSingles by Jarrod Dyson and Mathis set the stage for Ahmed’s run-scoring single that re-established Arizona’s three-run cushion.\nPaul Goldschmidt ended Manaea’s night with a two-out, two-run triple, increasing the Arizona lead to 6-1.\nGoldschmidt doubled and scored on Ketel Marte’s triple in the ninth to cap the scoring.\nCorbin walked one and struck out seven in his seven innings. Yoshihisa Hirano and Andrew Chafin finished up a five-hitter with one shutout inning apiece.\nManaea (5-5) was charged with six runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out two.\nAhmed, Murphy and Goldschmidt drove in two runs apiece, while Peralta, Goldschmidt and Jake Lamb joined Ahmed with two hits for the Diamondbacks, who had opened a nine-game trip with six straight losses to the New York Mets and Milwaukee.\nAhmed and Mathis scored twice for Arizona, which improved to 3-1 in interleague play.\nMatt Olson had two hits, including a double, for the A’s, who have dropped two of three in interleague play this season and six of their last seven home games.\nThe Diamondbacks out-hit the A’s 12-5.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
