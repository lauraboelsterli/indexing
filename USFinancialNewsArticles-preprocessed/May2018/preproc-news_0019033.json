    "text": "BELLEVUE, Wash., May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Radiant Logistics, Inc. (NYSE American: RLGT), a third-party logistics and multimodal transportation services company, today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nThird Fiscal Quarter Financial Highlights (Quarter Ended March 31, 2018)\nRevenues were $203.9 million for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $22.1 million or 12.2% compared to revenues of $181.8 million for the comparable prior year period. Net revenues were $49.1 million for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $3.4 million or 7.5% compared to net revenues of $45.7 million for the comparable prior year period. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $0.2 million, or $0.00 per basic and fully diluted share, compared to a net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per basic and fully diluted share for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders was $2.7 million, or $0.05 per basic and fully diluted share for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to adjusted net income of $3.7 million, or $0.07 per basic and fully diluted share for the comparable prior year period. Periods are calculated by applying a normalized tax rate of 31% and excluding other items not considered part of regular operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 million for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, down $0.8 million or 12.3% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 million for the comparable prior year period.\nStock Buy-back\nIn March 2018, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock through December 31, 2019. As of May 3, 2018, the Company had 49,359,283 shares outstanding. There have been no purchases of common stock executed under the repurchase program.\nFinancing Activity\nIn April 2018, the Company, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Clipper Exxpress, entered into a lease financing agreement with Banc of America Leasing & Capital, for the lease of up to 100 refrigerated trailers with the aggregate acquisition cost not to exceed $5.0 million through December 31, 2018. The term of the lease shall, at the Company's option, be 60 or 84 months from an agreed upon starting date and as lessee, the Company will be obligated to purchase the trailers at the end of the lease for a nominal amount.\nCEO Comments\n\"We are pleased to report solid growth with record third fiscal quarter gross and net revenues in our seasonally slowest quarter ended March 31, 2018,\" said Bohn Crain, Founder and CEO. \"Top line revenues were $203.9 million for the quarter, up $22.1 million or 12.2% over the comparable prior year period. We saw revenue growth across all categories with forwarding revenues up $17.5 million and 13.4%, brokerage revenues up $2.7 million and 5.5%, and value-added services revenues up $2.0 million and 122.7%. Net revenues were $49.1 million for the quarter, up $3.4 million or 7.5% over the comparable prior year period with net transportation revenues contributing $1.4 million and value-added services contributing an additional $2.0 million in net revenues. We experienced continued margin pressure with our underlying asset-based carrier partners taking prices higher in this tight capacity market environment but believe we are well positioned to deliver sequential improvement over the next several quarters as we work to pass these increases on to our end customers while continuing to grow our overall shipment volumes. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our Canada-based materials management and distribution solutions offering and believe our strategic decision to bundle value-added logistics solutions with our core transportation service offering will continue to deliver positive results.\"\n\"These positive results were negatively impacted over the short-term principally as a result of an increase in our personnel costs, up $2.1 million and an increase in our SG&A costs, up $1.6 million in connection with our recent acquisitions of Lomas and DLT along with several sales and technology initiatives which are expected to deliver organic growth and productivity improvement in future periods. As a result, we posted Adjusted EBITDA of $5.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.5 million in the comparable prior year period. On the sales front we continue to grow our industry vertical and field sales organizations and have recently deployed the Salesforce CRM (customer relationship management) tool to help us better manage our growing sales pipeline. We also continue to make progress on a number of other strategic technology initiatives, including (1) blue-printing efforts to operationalize international air and ocean functionality within our new SAP TM platform, (2) accelerating the digitization of our back-office operations through the deployment of X-Suite's optical character recognition and process automation solution to streamline our procure-to-pay processes with our carriers and (3) migrating our mission critical systems to Amazon's cloud computing platform AWS (\"Amazon Web Services\") which will give us cost effective access to the computing power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help us scale and grow our business.\"\nCrain Continued: \"While we continue to look for interesting acquisition opportunities, we have also recently authorized a stock buy-back program. We believe the current share price does not accurately reflect Radiant's long-term growth prospects, and therefore, represents an excellent investment opportunity for both the Company and our shareholders. In addition, given the current and anticipated future financial performance of Radiant Clipper's temperature controlled business, we have recently entered into a capital lease program to begin to refresh our refrigerator trailer fleet at Clipper Exxpress. The lease program allows us to mobilize equipment into what we believe will continue to represent an interesting market opportunity while maximizing our financial flexibility to pursue acquisition opportunities, the stock buy-back and/or the retirement of our $21.0 million redeemable perpetual preferred stock later this year should we choose to do so.\"\nThird Fiscal Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 – Financial Results\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Radiant reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.2 million on $203.9 million of revenues, or $0.00 per basic and fully diluted share.

Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are presented herein because they are important metrics used by management to evaluate and understand the performance of the ongoing operations of Radiant's business. For Adjusted Net Income, management uses a 31% tax rate for calculating the provision for income taxes before preferred dividend requirement to normalize Radiant's tax rate to that of its competitors and to compare Radiant's reporting periods with different effective tax rates. In addition, in arriving at Adjusted Net Income, the Company adjusts for certain non-cash charges and significant items that are not part of regular operating activities. These adjustments include depreciation and amortization, change in contingent consideration, amortization of loan fees, write-off of loan fees, impairment of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related costs, transition costs, lease termination costs, legal costs and non-recurring costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA means earnings before preferred stock dividends, interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is then further adjusted for changes in contingent consideration, expenses specifically attributable to acquisitions, lease termination costs, extraordinary items, share-based compensation expense, legal costs, non-recurring costs, material management and distribution (\"MM&D\") start-up costs, write off of loan fees, impairment of acquired intangible assets and foreign exchange losses or gains.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, represent a useful method of assessing the performance of our operating activities, as they reflect our earnings trends without the impact of certain non-cash charges and other non-recurring charges. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the GAAP financial information by providing additional insight regarding results of operations to allow a comparison to other companies, many of whom use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures will not be defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other companies. Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any of the consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as an indication of Radiant's operating performance or liquidity.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nNine Months Ended March 31,\nReconciliation of net income to adjusted net income:\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n167\n$\n396\n$\n3,813\n$\n3,846\nAdjustments to net income:\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n123\n540\n(1,091)\n3,281\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,640\n3,005\n10,783\n9,039\nChange in contingent consideration\n35\n737\n(75)\n1,793\nLease termination costs\n—\n—\n107\n25\nAcquisition related costs\n57\n308\n154\n525\nLitigation costs\n53\n25\n132\n138\nNon-recurring costs\n—\n—\n—\n14\nAmortization of loan fees\n60\n79\n184\n239\nTransition costs associated with acquisitions\n—\n446\n—\n1,263\nAdjusted net income before income taxes\n4,135\n5,536\n14,007\n20,163\nProvision for income taxes at 31% before preferred dividend\nrequirement\n(1,440)\n(1,875)\n(4,818)\n(6,726)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n2,695\n$\n3,661\n$\n9,189\n$\n13,437\nAdjusted net income per common share:\nBasic\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.07\n$\n0.19\n$\n0.28\nDiluted\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.07\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.27\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic shares\n49,334,300\n48,817,330\n49,197,218\n48,822,882\nDiluted shares\n50,630,307\n50,169,571\n50,660,478\n49,834,591\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nNine Months Ended March 31,\nReconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n167\n$\n396\n$\n3,813\n$\n3,846\nPreferred stock dividends\n511\n511\n1,534\n1,534\nNet income attributable to Radiant Logistics, Inc.\n678\n907\n5,347\n5,380\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n123\n540\n(1,091)\n3,281\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,640\n3,005\n10,783\n9,039\nNet interest expense\n745\n608\n2,312\n1,856\nEBITDA\n5,186\n5,060\n17,351\n19,556\nShare-based compensation\n386\n323\n1,116\n983\nChange in contingent consideration\n35\n737\n(75)\n1,793\nAcquisition related costs\n57\n308\n154\n525\nLitigation costs\n53\n25\n132\n138\nNon-recurring costs\n—\n—\n—\n14\nLease termination costs\n—\n—\n107\n25\nMM&D start-up costs\n—\n—\n410\n—\nForeign exchange loss (gain)\n(7)\n35\n132\n(354)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n5,710\n$\n6,488\n$\n19,327\n$\n22,680\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Net Revenues\n11.6\n%\n14.2\n%\n13.5\n%\n15.7\n%\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/radiant-logistics-announces-results-for-the-third-fiscal-quarter-ended-march-31-2018-300645548.html\nSOURCE Radiant Logistics, Inc.",
