    "text": " Meghan McCain on Friday questioned how the White House aide who disparaged her ailing father, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, during a meeting, still has a job.\nFILE PHOTO: Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) speaks at a press conference about the National Defense Authorization Act in Washington, U.S., October 25, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo Kelly Sadler, a White House communications aide, dismissed Senator McCain’s objection to President Donald Trump’s nominee to be CIA director, Gina Haspel, by saying that it “doesn’t matter, he’s dying anyway,” a source familiar with the closed White House meeting told Reuters.\nSpeaking on the ABC show “The View,” which she co-hosts, Meghan McCain said she wanted to inform Sadler that her father’s battle with brain cancer has made her realize the meaning of life was “not how you die, it is how you live.”\n“I don’t understand what kind of environment you’re working in when that would be acceptable, and then you can come to work the next day and still have a job,” McCain said.\nJohn McCain, who has spent the last several weeks convalescing at his home in Arizona as he battles brain cancer, released a statement after Haspel’s confirmation hearing on Wednesday, slamming her for refusing to condemn torture. He recommended his fellow senators vote against her.\nMcCain is not expected to return to Washington to cast a vote on her nomination.\nMcCain was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, sustaining injuries from which he has never completely recovered.\nSeveral of McCain’s fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill have condemned Sadler’s remarks.\nJeff Flake, Arizona’s other senator and a frequent critic of the White House under Trump, tweeted an article about the comments Quote: : “There are no words.”\nIowa Senator Joni Ernst tweeted that the United States should “treat this war hero and his family with the civility and respect they deserve.”\nRepublican Representative Walter Jones of North Carolina said Sadler’s comments were “outrageous & unacceptable” and demanded a public apology.\nMeghan McCain thanked the public for its support and said nobody should feel sorry for her or her family.\n“My father’s legacy is going to be talked about for hundreds and hundreds of years,” she said. “These people - nothing burgers.”\nSadler’s comments were reported the same day that a guest on Fox Business Network, retired Air Force Lieutenant General Thomas McInerney, suggested McCain divulged critical information to the North Vietnamese after being tortured.\nA network spokesperson said McInerney would no longer be invited on the Fox Business Network or Fox News.\nReporting by Justin Mitchell, Additional reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Dan Grebler\n ",
