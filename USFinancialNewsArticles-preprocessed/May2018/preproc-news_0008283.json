    "text": "ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Belden Inc. (NYSE: BDC), a global leader in high quality, end-to-end signal transmission solutions for mission-critical applications, today reported fiscal first quarter 2018 results for the period ended April 1, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018\nOn a GAAP basis, revenues for the quarter totaled $605.6 million, increasing $54.2 million, or 9.8%, compared to $551.4 million in the first quarter 2017. Net income was $2.6 million, a decrease of $23.1 million from the prior-year period. Net income was impacted by a $15.2 million after-tax loss on debt extinguishment related to our recent debt refinancing and repayment. In addition, net income for the first quarter 2018 included after-tax restructuring and acquisition integration costs of $16.0 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Snell Advanced Media (“SAM”), which was completed during the quarter. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 0.4% compared to 4.7% in the prior-year period. EPS was $(0.15) compared to $0.40 in the first quarter 2017.\nAdjusted revenues for the quarter totaled $607.4 million, increasing $56.0 million, or 10.2%, compared to $551.4 million in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 17.0%, increasing 10 basis points from 16.9% in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS was $1.16 compared to $0.92 in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted results are non-GAAP measures, and a non-GAAP reconciliation table is provided as an appendix to this release.\nJohn Stroup, President, CEO, and Chairman of Belden Inc., said, “I am pleased to start the year with 10% revenue growth and robust adjusted earnings growth. During the first quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy, which included an attractive acquisition and debt refinancing at very favorable terms. In addition, we allocated a quarterly record $75 million towards our share repurchase program.”\nOutlook\n“We are increasing our full-year revenue guidance to reflect the SAM acquisition. We are also updating our EPS guidance to reflect the impact of this acquisition, our recent debt refinancing, and our share repurchases,” said Mr. Stroup.\nOn a GAAP basis, the Company expects second quarter 2018 revenues to be $647 - $667 million and EPS to be $0.37 - $0.47. For the full year ending December 31, 2018, the Company now expects revenues to be $2.623 - $2.673 billion, compared to prior guidance of $2.528 - $2.578 billion and EPS to be $2.44 - $2.69, compared to prior guidance of $3.96 - $4.21. The decline in EPS is primarily attributable to acquisition integration costs and losses on debt extinguishment.\nThe Company expects second quarter 2018 adjusted revenues to be $650 - $670 million and adjusted EPS to be $1.41 - $1.51. For the full year ending December 31, 2018, the Company increased adjusted revenue and EPS guidance to reflect the recent acquisition, debt refinancing, and share repurchases. The Company now expects adjusted revenues to be $2.633 - $2.683 billion, compared to prior guidance of $2.528 - $2.578 billion and adjusted EPS to be $6.23 - $6.48, compared to prior guidance of $5.95 - $6.20.\nSegment Combination\nIn the first quarter, the Company changed its organizational structure and, as a result, now will be reporting two segments. The segments formerly known as Enterprise Solutions and Broadcast Solutions now will be presented as the Enterprise Solutions segment, and the segments formerly known as Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions now will be presented as the Industrial Solutions segment. The reorganization allows the Company to further accelerate progress in key strategic areas, and the segment consolidation properly aligns our external reporting with the way the businesses are now managed. Prior period segment information has been revised to conform to the change in the composition of reportable segments and is included as an appendix to this release.\nEarnings Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call today at 8:30 am ET to discuss results of the quarter. The listen-only audio of the conference call will be broadcast live via the Internet at http://investor.belden.com . The dial-in number for participants in the U.S. is 800-281-7973; the dial-in number for participants outside the U.S. is 323-794-2093. A replay of this conference call will remain accessible in the investor relations section of the Company’s website for a limited time.\nNet Income and Earnings per Share (EPS)\nAll references to Net Income and EPS within this earnings release refer to net income attributable to Belden and income from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to Belden common stockholders, respectively.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nAdjusted results are non-GAAP measures that reflect certain adjustments the Company makes to provide insight into operating results. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this release and have been published to the investor relations section of the Company’s website at http://investor.belden.com .\nBELDEN INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 (In thousands, except per share data) Revenues $ 605,565 $ 551,381 Cost of sales (374,971 ) (329,007 ) Gross profit 230,594 222,374 Selling, general and administrative expenses (124,872 ) (112,586 ) Research and development (37,101 ) (34,522 ) Amortization of intangibles (24,418 ) (23,669 ) Operating income 44,203 51,597 Interest expense, net (16,978 ) (23,506 ) Non-operating pension costs (275 ) (260 ) Loss on debt extinguishment (19,960 ) — Income before taxes 6,990 27,831 Income tax expense (4,420 ) (2,250 ) Net income 2,570 25,581 Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (48 ) (106 ) Net income attributable to Belden 2,618 25,687 Less: Preferred stock dividends 8,733 8,733 Net income (loss) attributable to Belden common stockholders $ (6,115 ) $ 16,954 Weighted average number of common shares and equivalents: Basic 41,633 42,216 Diluted 41,633 42,675 Basic income (loss) per share attributable to Belden common stockholders: $ (0.15 ) $ 0.40 Diluted income (loss) per share attributable to Belden common stockholders: $ (0.15 ) $ 0.40 Common stock dividends declared per share $ 0.05 $ 0.05 BELDEN INC.\nOPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION\n(Unaudited)\nEnterprise Solutions\nIndustrial Solutions\nTotal Segments\n(In thousands, except percentages) For the three months ended April 1, 2018\nSegment Revenues $ 350,990 $ 256,433 $ 607,423 Segment EBITDA 57,452 46,426 103,878 Segment EBITDA margin 16.4 % 18.1 % 17.1 % Depreciation expense 7,220 4,645 11,865 Amortization of intangibles 11,170 13,248 24,418 Amortization of software development intangible assets 236 — 236 Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs 14,534 5,860 20,394 Purchase accounting effects of acquisitions 502 — 502 Deferred revenue adjustments 1,858 — 1,858 For the three months ended April 2, 2017\nSegment Revenues $ 314,278 $ 237,103 $ 551,381 Segment EBITDA 49,523 43,847 93,370 Segment EBITDA margin 15.8 % 18.5 % 16.9 % Depreciation expense 6,548 4,835 11,383 Amortization of intangibles 10,439 13,230 23,669 Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs 5,281 1,319 6,600 For the three months ended July 2, 2017\nSegment Revenues $ 348,804 $ 261,829 $ 610,633 Segment EBITDA 56,441 54,081 110,522 Segment EBITDA margin 16.2 % 20.7 % 18.1 % Depreciation expense 6,753 4,775 11,528 Amortization of intangibles 13,882 13,231 27,113 Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs 9,111 449 9,560 Purchase accounting effects of acquisitions 1,167 — 1,167 For the three months ended October 1, 2017\nSegment Revenues $ 360,842 $ 260,903 $ 621,745 Segment EBITDA 62,109 55,747 117,856 Segment EBITDA margin 17.2 % 21.4 % 19.0 % Depreciation expense 6,828 4,855 11,683 Amortization of intangibles 13,920 13,242 27,162 Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs 9,309 7,370 16,679 Purchase accounting effects of acquisitions 2,922 — 2,922 For the three months ended December 31, 2017\nSegment Revenues $ 332,381 $ 272,503 $ 604,884 Segment EBITDA 48,485 60,515 109,000 Segment EBITDA margin 14.6 % 22.2 % 18.0 % Depreciation expense 6,143 4,860 11,003 Amortization of intangibles 12,813 13,240 26,053 Amortization of software development intangible assets 56 — 56 Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs 5,342 4,609 9,951 Purchase accounting effects of acquisitions 2,044 — 2,044 BELDEN INC.\nOPERATING SEGMENT RECONCILIATION TO CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 (In thousands) Total Segment Revenues $ 607,423 $ 551,381 Deferred revenue adjustments (1,858 ) — Consolidated Revenues $ 605,565 $ 551,381 Total Segment EBITDA $ 103,878 $ 93,370 Income from equity method investment — 1,007 Non-operating pension costs (275 ) (260 ) Eliminations (308 ) (1,128 ) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (1) 103,295 92,989 Amortization of intangibles (24,418 ) (23,669 ) Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs (20,394 ) (6,600 ) Loss on debt extinguishment (19,960 ) — Interest expense, net (16,978 ) (23,506 ) Depreciation expense (11,865 ) (11,383 ) Deferred revenue adjustments (1,858 ) — Purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions (502 ) — Amortization of software development costs (236 ) — Loss on sale of assets (94 ) — Consolidated income before taxes $ 6,990 $ 27,831 (1) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

We adjust for the items listed above in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements. When we calculate the tax effect of the adjustments, we include all current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the adjusted measure of pre-tax profitability.\nWe utilize the adjusted results to review our ongoing operations without the effect of these adjustments and for comparison to budgeted operating results. We believe the adjusted results are useful to investors because they help them compare our results to previous periods and provide important insights into underlying trends in the business and how management oversees our business operations on a day-to-day basis. As an example, we adjust for the purchase accounting effect of recording deferred revenue at fair value in order to reflect the revenues that would have otherwise been recorded by acquired businesses had they remained as independent entities. We believe this presentation is useful in evaluating the underlying performance of acquired companies. Similarly, we adjust for other acquisition-related expenses, such as amortization of intangibles and other impacts of fair value adjustments because they generally are not related to the acquired business' core business performance. As an additional example, we exclude the costs of restructuring programs, which can occur from time to time for our current businesses and/or recently acquired businesses. We exclude the costs in calculating adjusted results to allow us and investors to evaluate the performance of the business based upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of these programs, provides valuable insight.\nAdjusted results should be considered only in conjunction with results reported according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nThree Months Ended April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 (In thousands, except percentages and per share amounts) GAAP revenues $ 605,565 $ 551,381 Deferred revenue adjustments 1,858 — Adjusted revenues $ 607,423 $ 551,381 GAAP gross profit $ 230,594 $ 222,374 Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs 9,431 5,928 Deferred revenue adjustments 1,858 — Purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions 502 — Amortization of software development intangible assets 236 — Accelerated depreciation — 266 Adjusted gross profit $ 242,621 $ 228,568 GAAP gross profit margin 38.1 % 40.3 % Adjusted gross profit margin 39.9 % 41.5 % GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses $ (124,872 ) $ (112,586 ) Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs 9,402 728 Loss on sale of assets\n94 — Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses $ (115,376 ) $ (111,858 ) GAAP research and development $ (37,101 ) $ (34,522 ) Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs 1,561 (56 ) Adjusted research and development $ (35,540 ) $ (34,578 ) GAAP net income attributable to Belden $ 2,618 $ 25,687 Interest expense, net 16,978 23,506 Loss on debt extinguishment 19,960 — Income tax expense 4,420 2,250 Noncontrolling interest (48 ) (106 ) Total non-operating adjustments 41,310 25,650 Amortization of intangible assets 24,418 23,669 Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs 20,394 6,600 Deferred revenue adjustments 1,858 — Purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions 502 — Amortization of software development intangible assets 236 — Loss on sale of assets 94 — Accelerated depreciation — 266 Total operating income adjustments 47,502 30,535 Depreciation expense 11,865 11,117 Adjusted EBITDA $ 103,295 $ 92,989 GAAP net income margin 0.4 % 4.7 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 17.0 % 16.9 % GAAP net income attributable to Belden $ 2,618 $ 25,687 Operating income adjustments from above 47,502 30,535 Loss on debt extinguishment 19,960 — Tax effect of adjustments above (12,112 ) (8,376 ) Impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enactment (473 ) — Amortization expense attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax (17 ) (15 ) Adjusted net income attributable to Belden $ 57,478 $ 47,831 GAAP net income attributable to Belden $ 2,618 $ 25,687 Less: Preferred stock dividends 8,733 8,733 GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Belden common stockholders $ (6,115 ) $ 16,954 Adjusted net income attributable to Belden $ 57,478 $ 47,831 Less: Preferred stock dividends 8,733 8,733 Adjusted net income attributable to Belden common stockholders $ 48,745 $ 39,098 GAAP income (loss) per diluted share attributable to Belden common stockholders $ (0.15 ) $ 0.40 Adjusted income per diluted share attributable to Belden common stockholders $ 1.16 $ 0.92 GAAP diluted weighted average shares 41,633 42,675 Adjustment for anti-dilutive shares that are dilutive under adjusted measures 377 — Adjusted diluted weighted average shares 42,010 42,675 BELDEN INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(Unaudited)\nWe define free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities adjusted for capital expenditures net of the proceeds from the disposal of tangible assets. We believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one financial measure to monitor and evaluate performance and liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only in conjunction with financial measures reported according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.\nThree Months Ended April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 (In thousands) GAAP net cash used for operating activities $ (83,860 ) $ (12,263 ) Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the disposal of tangible assets (15,875 ) (10,399 ) Non-GAAP free cash flow $ (99,735 ) $ (22,662 ) BELDEN INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\n2018 REVENUES AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended July 1, 2018\nAdjusted revenues $2.633 - $2.683 billion $650 - $670 million Deferred revenue adjustments ($10 million) ($3 million) GAAP revenues $2.623 - $2.673 billion $647 - $667 million Adjusted income per diluted share attributable to Belden common stockholders $6.23 - $6.48 $1.41 - $1.51 Amortization of intangible assets $(1.85) $(0.47) Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs $(1.29) $(0.45) Loss on debt extinguishment $(0.43) $(0.06) Deferred revenue adjustments $(0.19) $(0.05) Purchase accounting effects of acquisitions $(0.03) $(0.01) GAAP income per diluted share attributable to Belden common stockholders $2.44 - $2.69 $0.37 - $0.47 Our guidance for income per diluted share attributable to Belden common stockholders is based upon information currently available regarding events and conditions that will impact our future operating results. In particular, our results are subject to the factors listed under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" in this release.

Forward-looking statements include statements regarding future financial performance (including revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, cash flows, dividends, capital expenditures and financial condition), plans and objectives, and related assumptions.

Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including, without limitation: the impact of a challenging global economy or a downturn in served markets; the competitiveness of the global broadcast, enterprise, and industrial markets; volatility in credit and foreign exchange markets; the inability to execute and realize the expected benefits from strategic initiatives (including revenue growth, cost control, and productivity improvement programs); the inability to achieve our strategic priorities in emerging markets; the presence of substitute products in the marketplace; the inability of the Company to develop and introduce new products and competitive responses to our products; the increased prevalence of cloud computing; the inability to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions in furtherance of the Company’s strategic plan; foreign and domestic political, economic and other uncertainties, including changes in currency exchange rates; changes in tax laws and variability in the Company’s quarterly and annual effective tax rates; the increased influence of chief information officers and similar high-level executives; disruptions in the Company’s information systems including due to cyber-attacks; perceived or actual product failures; risks related to the use of open source software; the cost and availability of raw materials including copper, plastic compounds, electronic components, and other materials; difficulty in forecasting revenue due to the unpredictable timing of large orders; disruption of, or changes in, the Company’s key distribution channels; the inability to retain senior management and key employees; assertions that the Company violates the intellectual property of others and the ownership of intellectual property by competitors and others that prevents the use of that intellectual property by the Company; the impact of regulatory requirements and other legal compliance issues; the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and the resulting impact on financial performance; disruptions and increased costs attendant to collective bargaining groups and other labor matters; and other factors.\nFor a more complete discussion of risk factors, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2018.
