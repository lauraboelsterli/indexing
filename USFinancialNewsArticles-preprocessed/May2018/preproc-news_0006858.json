    "text": "ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Graham Holdings Company (NYSE: GHC) today reported net income attributable to common shares of $42.9 million ($7.78 per share) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $21.1 million ($3.75 per share) for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe results for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were affected by a number of items as described in the following paragraphs. Excluding these items, net income attributable to common shares was $49.8 million ($9.04 per share) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $14.1 million ($2.50 per share) for the first quarter of 2017. (Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Information schedule at the end of this release for additional details.)\nItems included in the Company’s net income for the first quarter of 2018:\na $4.3 million gain on the Kaplan University Transaction (after-tax impact of $1.8 million, or $0.33 per share); $14.1 million in net losses on marketable equity securities (after-tax impact of $10.7 million, or $1.94 per share); $0.2 million in non-operating foreign currency gains (after-tax impact of $0.1 million, or $0.02 per share); and $1.8 million in income tax benefits related to stock compensation ($0.33 per share).\nItems included in the Company’s net income for the first quarter of 2017:\n$1.7 million in non-operating foreign currency gains (after-tax impact of $1.1 million, or $0.19 per share); and $5.9 million in income tax benefits related to stock compensation ($1.06 per share).\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $659.4 million, up 13% from $582.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The revenue increase is due largely to growth at the television broadcasting and manufacturing businesses. The Company reported operating income of $44.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. The operating income increase is driven by higher earnings at the education, television broadcasting and manufacturing businesses.\nOn April 27, 2017, certain subsidiaries of Kaplan, Inc. (Kaplan), a subsidiary of Graham Holdings Company entered into a Contribution and Transfer Agreement (Transfer Agreement) to contribute the institutional assets and operations of Kaplan University (KU) to an Indiana non-profit, public-benefit corporation that is a subsidiary affiliated with Purdue University (Purdue). The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Transfer Agreement occurred on March 22, 2018. At the same time, the parties entered into a Transition and Operations Support Agreement (TOSA) pursuant to which Kaplan will provide key non-academic operations support to the new university. The new university will operate almost exclusively online as a new Indiana public university affiliated with Purdue under the name Purdue University Global (Purdue Global).\nDivision Results\nEducation\nEducation division revenue totaled $375.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, up 1% from $372.9 million for the same period of 2017. Kaplan reported operating income of $22.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $9.4 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAs a result of the KU Transaction that closed on March 22, 2018, the Company has revised the financial reporting for its education division to provide operating results for Higher Education and Professional (U.S.).\nA summary of Kaplan’s operating results is as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31 (in thousands) 2018 2017 % Change Revenue Kaplan international $ 183,582 $ 164,562 12 Higher education 99,830 111,111 (10 ) Test preparation 59,151 64,568 (8 ) Professional (U.S.) 33,356 33,199 — Kaplan corporate and other 285 14 — Intersegment elimination (705 ) (557 ) — $ 375,499 $ 372,897 1 Operating Income (Loss) Kaplan international $ 20,404 $ 7,707 — Higher education 1,355 2,446 (45 ) Test preparation 521 (2,864 ) — Professional (U.S.) 9,315 10,158 (8 ) Kaplan corporate and other (7,746 ) (6,943 ) (12 ) Amortization of intangible assets (1,149 ) (1,120 ) (3 ) Intersegment elimination — 53 — $ 22,700 $ 9,437 — Kaplan International includes English-language programs, and postsecondary education and professional training businesses largely outside the United States. Kaplan International revenue increased 12% for the first quarter; 3% on a constant currency basis. Operating income increased to $20.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to improved results at Pathways, UK Professional, MPW and English-language.\nPrior to the KU Transaction closing on March 22, 2018, Higher Education included Kaplan’s domestic postsecondary education businesses, made up of fixed-facility colleges and online postsecondary and career programs. Following the KU Transaction closing, the Higher Education division includes the results as a service provider to higher education institutions.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Higher Education revenue was down 10% and operating results declined, due largely to the sale of KU on March 22, 2018 and fewer average enrollments at KU prior to the sale.\nKaplan Test Preparation (KTP) includes Kaplan’s standardized test preparation programs. KTP revenue declined 8% for the first quarter of 2018 due to the disposition of Dev Bootcamp, which made up the majority of KTP's new economy skills training programs, and soft enrollments in certain preparation programs. In comparison to 2017, KTP operating results improved in the first quarter of 2018, due mostly to decreased losses from the new economy skills training programs. Operating losses for the new economy skills training programs were $0.5 million and $3.8 million for the first three months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Dev Bootcamp was closed in the second half of 2017.\nKaplan Professional (U.S.) includes the domestic professional and other continuing education businesses. In the first quarter of 2018, Kaplan Professional (U.S.) revenue was even with the first quarter of 2017, while operating results declined 8%, due to increased spending on sales and technology.\nKaplan corporate and other represents unallocated expenses of Kaplan, Inc.’s corporate office, other minor businesses and certain shared activities.\nTelevision Broadcasting\nRevenue at the television broadcasting division increased 19% to $108.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, from $91.5 million in the same period of 2017 due primarily to $8.6 million in 2018 incremental winter Olympics-related advertising revenue at the Company's NBC affiliates and an $8.2 million increase in retransmission revenues. Operating income for the first quarter of 2018 increased 53% to $40.5 million, from $26.5 million in the same period of 2017 due to higher revenues. The Company's television broadcasting stations operate under a retransmission contract with Comcast that was effective on April 1, 2017.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing includes four businesses: Dekko, a manufacturer of electrical workspace solutions, architectural lighting and electrical components and assemblies; Joyce/Dayton Corp., a manufacturer of screw jacks and other linear motion systems; Forney, a global supplier of products and systems that control and monitor combustion processes in electric utility and industrial applications; and Hoover Treated Wood Products, Inc., a supplier of pressure impregnated kiln-dried lumber and plywood products for fire retardant and preservative applications that the Company acquired in April 2017.\nManufacturing revenues and operating income increased in the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to the Hoover acquisition.\nHealthcare\nThe Graham Healthcare Group (GHG) provides home health and hospice services in three states. At the end of June 2017, GHG acquired Hometown Home Health and Hospice, a Lapeer, MI-based healthcare services provider. Healthcare revenues increased 2% in the first three months of 2018, while operating results were down, due largely to continued integration costs.\nSocialCode\nSocialCode is a provider of marketing solutions on social, mobile and video platforms. SocialCode revenue increased 6% in the first quarter of 2018 due to growth in digital advertising service revenues. SocialCode reported operating losses of $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOther Businesses\nOther businesses include Slate and Foreign Policy, which publish online and print magazines and websites; and two investment stage businesses, Panoply and CyberVista. Losses from each of these businesses in the first quarter of 2018 adversely affected operating results.\nCorporate Office\nCorporate office includes the expenses of the Company’s corporate office and certain continuing obligations related to prior business dispositions.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company held interests in a number of home health and hospice joint ventures, and interests in several other affiliates. In the second half of 2017, the Company acquired approximately 11% of Intersection Holdings, LLC, which provides digital marketing and advertising services and products for cities, transit systems, airports, and other public and private spaces. The Company recorded equity in earnings of affiliates of $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Expense and Related Balances\nThe Company incurred net interest expense of $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company had $497.7 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 6.2% and cash, marketable equity securities and other investments of $819.6 million.\nNon-operating Pension and Postretirement Benefit Income, net\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that changes the income statement classification of net periodic pension and postretirement pension cost. Under the new guidance, service cost is included in operating income, while the other components (including expected return on assets) are included in non-operating income. The new guidance was required to be applied retrospectively, with prior period financial information revised to reflect the reclassification. From a segment reporting perspective, this change had a significant impact on Corporate office reporting, with minimal impact on the television broadcasting and Kaplan corporate reporting.\nThe Company recorded net non-operating pension and postretirement benefit income of $21.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $18.8 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nLoss on Marketable Equity Securities, net\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted new guidance that requires changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities to be included in non-operating income (expense) on a prospective basis. Overall, the Company recognized $14.1 million in net losses on marketable equity securities in the first quarter of 2018.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense)\nThe Company recorded total other non-operating income, net, of $9.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 amounts included a $5.9 million gain on sales of businesses; $0.2 million in foreign currency gains; and other items. The 2017 amounts included $1.7 million in foreign currency gains, partially offset by other items.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first three months of 2018 was 24.0%. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017, which included lowering the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the first three months of 2017 was 11.4%. This low effective tax rate is due to a $5.9 million income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock awards. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted a new accounting standard that requires all excess income tax benefits and deficiencies from stock compensation to be recorded as discrete items in the provision for income taxes. Excluding this $5.9 million benefit, the overall income tax rate for the first three months of 2017 was 36.3%.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe calculation of diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 was based on 5,472,643 weighted average shares outstanding, compared to 5,568,903 for the first quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2018, there were 5,373,325 shares outstanding. On November 9, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to acquire up to 500,000 shares of its Class B common stock; the Company has remaining authorization for 341,098 shares as of March 31, 2018.\nAdoption of Revenue Recognition Standard\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition guidance using the modified retrospective approach. If the company applied the accounting policies under the previous guidance, revenue would have been $1.3 million lower and operating expenses would have been $3.0 million higher for the first quarter of 2018.\nThis press release contains certain that are based largely on the Company’s current expectations.
