    "text": "SPOKANE VALLEY, Wash., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Key Tronic Corporation (Nasdaq:KTCC), a provider of electronic manufacturing services (EMS), today announced its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, Key Tronic reported total revenue of $108.4 million, compared to $113.6 million in the same period of fiscal year 2017. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, total revenue was $329.3 million, compared to $349.3 million in the same period of fiscal year 2017.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company had net income of approximately $0.6 million or $0.06 per share, compared to net income of $1.0 million or $0.09 per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. As expected, the results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 include expenses in connection with a binding arbitration hearing and severance expenses related to streamlining the company’s facilities in Mexico, totaling $0.10 per diluted share. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, net income was $0.9 million or $0.08 per share, compared to net income of $4.3 million or $0.39 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2017.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, gross margin was 7.5% and operating margin was 0.7%, compared to 8.0% and 1.6%, respectively, in the same period of fiscal 2017.\n“Most of our new programs continued to ramp steadily during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, though our productivity was adversely impacted by industry wide shortages in key components and an unexpected delay from one large new customer,” said Craig Gates, President and Chief Executive Officer. “At the same time, we have continued to win significant new business from both EMS competitors and from existing customers, including 5 new programs involving gaming equipment, medical devices and a consumer security product.\nMoving into the fourth quarter, although we continue to see significant supply chain issues, we expect significant growth in revenue and earnings. A large longstanding customer is significantly increasing its demand, our new programs continue to ramp and we have a strong pipeline of potential new business. In preparation for future growth, we continue to invest in new equipment and processes to be more productive with less labor content in our Mexico facilities, and we’re expanding and enhancing our highly profitable US facilities.”\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company expects to report revenue in the range of $112 million to $117 million, and earnings in the range of $0.11 to $0.16 per diluted share. These expected results assume an effective tax rate of 20% in the quarter.\nConference Call\nKey Tronic will host a conference call today to discuss its financial results at 2:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Eastern).
