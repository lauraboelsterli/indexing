    "text": "Minnesota first baseman Logan Morrison was one of the few players to get to Los Angeles Angels rookie Shohei Ohtani on Sunday, but that didn’t stop him from heaping some eye-popping praise on the Japanese star.\nMay 13, 2018; Anaheim, CA, USA; Los Angeles Angels starting pitcher Shohei Ohtani (17) throws a pitch to a Minnesota Twins batter during the first inning at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports “He was really good,” Morrison said after the game, according to MLB.com Angels beat writer Maria I. Guardado. “He’s only 23 years old and is going to get better. I think he’s doing something that nobody has probably ever done and it might be a long time before you see it again. There’s another guy (Mike Trout) in that clubhouse who is a really good player, but to me, with what he does on the mound and with the bat, he’s probably the best player in the world.”\nOhtani threw a season-high 103 pitches Sunday, striking out 11 and surrendering just one run on three hits in 6 1/3 innings. He received a no-decision in Los Angeles’ 2-1 walk-off win.\nMay 13, 2018; Anaheim, CA, USA; Minnesota Twins first baseman Logan Morrison (99) runs to first base on a single during the fifth inning against the Los Angeles Angels at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports Morrison reached base all three times he faced the right-hander, picking up a pair of singles and later drawing a one-out walk in the seventh that chased Ohtani from the game.\nOhtani has set MLB abuzz this season, garnering comparisons to Babe Ruth with his prowess as a two-way player. He is 3-1 with a 3.58 ERA in six starts on the mound, and is batting .348 with five home runs and 16 RBIs at the plate.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
