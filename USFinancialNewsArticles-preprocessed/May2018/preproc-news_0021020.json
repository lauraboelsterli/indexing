    "text": "Stocks fell on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal signed three years ago.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average traded 59 points lower, with Verizon as the worst-performing stock in the index. The S&P 500 declined 0.3 percent as utilities fell 2.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite was 0.2 percent lower.\nBack in 2015, the Obama administration and Iran signed a deal to defer sanctions on Iranian oil exports, while Iran curbed its nuclear program. On Tuesday, Trump said the U.S. was pulling out of that deal and restoring sanctions.\nCrude recovered some of its losses, but still traded 2 percent lower at $69.25 per barrel. Oil briefly fell more than 3 percent.\n\"If financials weren't performing well today, we'd be looking at a much darker picture,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"If you look at the rest of the board, things are kind of pink.\"\nThe finanicals sector was one of two that traded positive on Tuesday, climbing 0.5 percent. Industrials also rose, as shares of defense companies jumped. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) rose 1.3 percent.\nQuincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said the market will view the announcement as preview on \" how he deals with other foreign policy matters such as North Korea.\"\nMichael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Monday, April 23, 2018. Trump had threatened numerous times to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran deal unless allies in Europe amend what he sees as shortcomings of the agreement.\nIn spite of the Trump's threats to pull out, Iran President Hassan Rouhani has stated that Iran had a plan to counter any move made by Trump when it comes to the deal.\n\"Allowing Iran to produce nuclear fuel again would further boost the dollar and lower US Treasury yields,\" said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, in an email. \"The US withdrawal from Iran the treaty would be another step in isolating the US from rest of the world.\"\nU.S. Treasury yields rose slightly on Tuesday, while the dollar climbed 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies.\nEquities closed off their session highs on Monday after Trump tweeted the announcement was coming. The major averages were propelled to their highs by energy stocks, which rose more than 2 percent on Monday before closing slightly higher.\nIn corporate news on Tuesday, sources told CNBC that NBCUniversal-parent Comcast is planning an all-cash bid for most of 21-Century Fox's assets if the U.S. government approves AT&T's purchase of Time Warner. Comcast shares slipped 5 percent, while Fox was flat.\nIn central bank news, Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered remarks in Zurich Tuesday. At the Swiss National Bank and International Monetary Fund's High Level Conference, the chair of the U.S. central bank said that the Fed's interest rate hikes may not end up having as great of a risk on emerging market economies and stock markets as many had initially thought.\nPowell added that the central bank would however continue to communicate its policies clearly, to avoid market disruptions.\n—CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.",
