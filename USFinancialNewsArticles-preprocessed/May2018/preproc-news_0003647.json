    "text": "CLINTON, Conn., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTWS) today issued the following statement regarding commentary on Eversource Energy's (NYSE: ES) first quarter 2018 earnings call held today:\nConnecticut Water notes that multiple independent industry analysts today questioned the merits of Eversource's proxy campaign and unsolicited takeover attempt of Connecticut Water and whether Eversource is able to sustain its targeted earnings growth rate on its own.\nAmong the targeted questions posed to Eversource management on the call:\n\"there has been some contemplation that perhaps this Connecticut Water bid is a function of you starting to see a lack of opportunity to deploy incremental capital in your core electricity and gas businesses in ways that allow you to be sustainably inside that 5% to 7% earnings growth rate. Would you care to comment on that impression that some people are drawing from it?\"\nWhen Eversource management dismissed that impression, they were further pressed:\n\"If you really don't need this acquisition for the 5% to 7% growth, I'm struggling a little bit with the need to pursue this acquisition so aggressively. It is a relatively small acquisition, but you're going to now spend time and resources to try and pursue the deal. I'm struggling a little bit to understand why kind of push it so much if it's really not needed.\"\nThis commentary underscores our belief that Eversource's actions are an overt attempt to derail the SJW Group merger of equals and the many benefits it provides in order to promote Eversource's inferior proposal and distract from its record of chronic underperformance and highly-publicized poor customer service.\nWe believe that Eversource's decision to use their shareholders' resources to pursue a costly and distracting proxy campaign speaks to Eversource's desperation, not their focus on value creation.\nWhile Eversource may need Connecticut Water for growth and value creation, Connecticut Water does not need Eversource. Connecticut Water already has a superior record of shareholder returns and have a merger agreement in place that will help ensure we maintain this momentum well into the future. Indeed, we believe the SJW Group merger of equals will create greater value than the unsolicited acquisition that Eversource has proposed both at close and over the long-term – with more compelling benefits for shareholders, customers, employees and communities.\nWe believe Eversource is pursuing this transaction and touting its dividend in an attempt to compensate for its inability to deliver meaningful stock price appreciation on its own, including given the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee denying Eversource's 192 mile Northern Pass pipeline project, which in our view is highlighted by questions raised this morning on Eversource's earnings conference call. Absent the benefit of its dividend, Eversource delivered only a 35% stock price return over the past five years as compared to 143% from Connecticut Water, as of April 27, 2018.\nEversource's performance raises questions about its value creation ability and its commitment to customers. Eversource has consistently ranked in the bottom of customer service rankings. Eversource is also currently under investigation by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) regarding the 100% increase in its service shutoffs. In contrast, Connecticut Water has customer satisfaction rankings that consistently exceed 90% in customer surveys conducted by an independent research firm – underscoring that delivering safe, clean drinking water is Connecticut Water's top priority.\nSince announcing the SJW Group merger on March 15, 2018, Connecticut Water has received strong support from multiple stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers. Connecticut Water and SJW Group have received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in connection with their merger, are preparing the remaining regulatory filings, and are on track to close their merger transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTo find out more about Connecticut Water's merger of equals with SJW Group, please visit www.SJW-CTWS.com .\nConnecticut Water will mail to shareholders its proxy statement and GREEN proxy card as well as additional information about the Company's merger with SJW Group. Connecticut Water shareholders are advised to take no action in response to any materials they may receive from Eversource Energy and to DISCARD ALL BLUE proxy cards or other materials from Eversource Energy.\nConnecticut Water shareholders who have questions or would like additional information should contact Connecticut Water's proxy solicitor, Morrow Sodali, toll-free at (800) 662−5200 or by e-mail at CTWS@morrowsodali.com .\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC is serving as Connecticut Water's financial advisor and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP as its legal counsel.\nAbout CTWS\nCTWS is a publicly traded holding company headquartered in Clinton, Connecticut. CTWS is the parent company of The Connecticut Water Company, The Maine Water Company, The Avon Water Company, and The Heritage Village Water Company.
