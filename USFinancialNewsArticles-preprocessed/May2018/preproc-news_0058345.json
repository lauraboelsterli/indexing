    "text": "11 COMMENTS Former Apollo 12 astronaut and painter Alan Bean, who was the fourth person to walk on the moon and later turned his passion for space into art, has died. He was 86.\nMr. Bean was the lunar module pilot for the second moon-landing mission in November 1969. He spent 31 hours on the moon deploying surface experiments with Commander Charles Conrad and collecting 75 pounds of rocks and lunar soil for study back on Earth, according to a statement from NASA.\nMr. Bean died Saturday in Houston following a short illness, the statement said.\nHe is the eighth of 12 Apollo moonwalkers to die and the second this year, after the passing of Apollo 16 Commander John Young in January.\nRelated\nPhoto-Op: How Alan Bean Took a Photo on the Moon (March 14, 2014) “As all great explorers are, Alan was a boundary pusher,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement that credited Mr. Bean with being part of 11 world records in the areas of space and aeronautics. “We will remember him fondly as the great explorer who reached out to embrace the universe.”\nIn 1998 NASA oral history, Mr. Bean recalled his excitement at preparing to fly to the moon.\n“When you’re getting ready to go to the moon, every day’s like Christmas and your birthday rolled into one. I mean, can you think of anything better?” Mr. Bean said.\nAfter Apollo, Mr. Bean commanded the second crewed flight to the U.S.’s first space station, Skylab, in 1973. On that mission, he orbited the Earth for 59 days and traveled 24.4 million miles, setting a world record at the time.\nBorn March 15, 1932, in Wheeler, Texas, Mr. Bean received a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Texas in 1955. He attended the Navy Test Pilot School and was one of 14 trainees selected by NASA for its third group of astronauts in October 1963.\n“I’d always wanted to be a pilot, ever since I could remember,” Mr. Bean said in the NASA oral history. “I think a lot of it just had to do with it looked exciting. It looked like brave people did that. I wanted to be brave, even though I wasn’t brave at the time. I thought maybe I could learn to be, so that appealed to me.”\nMr. Bean retired from NASA in 1981 and devoted much of his time to creating an artistic record of space exploration.\nHis Apollo-themed paintings feature canvases textured with lunar-boot prints and embedded with small pieces of his moon-dust-stained mission patches.\nHis wife of 40 years, Leslie Bean, said in a statement that Mr. Bean died peacefully surrounded by those who loved him.\nHe is survived by Mrs. Bean, a sister and two children.\n—Copyright 2018 the Associated Press",
