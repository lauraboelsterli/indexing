    "text": "DENVER, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet sales of $852.0 million, a quarterly record and increase of 16.7% year-over-year Net income attributable to shareholders of $24.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to prior-year quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $18.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share Adjusted Net Income of $71.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, an increase of 35.8% per diluted share compared to the prior-year quarter Record quarterly Adjusted EBITDA of $183.9 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.6% In April 2018, completed bolt-on acquisition of Rapro, expanding fluid power replacement business in Europe Updating guidance to include Rapro acquisition â€“ otherwise maintaining 2018 outlook\nGates Industrial Corporation plc (NYSE:GTES), a leading global provider of application-specific fluid power and power transmission solutions, today reported results for the first- 2018.\nIvo Jurek, Gates Industrial's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are pleased to report a solid start to 2018. Double-digit revenue growth was driven by a combination of core revenue growth, the performance of recent acquisitions and favorable foreign currency impacts. We executed with discipline, expanding our Adjusted EBITDA margin while continuing to invest in the growth of the business. The environment in our end markets remains positive and supportive of our full-year commitments. We continue to execute on our strategy and growth initiatives, and have demonstrated success in securing incremental market opportunities in both our Power Transmission and Fluid Power segments.\"\n\"We also recently announced the acquisition of Rapro, a Turkey-based manufacturer of fluid power products focused primarily on replacement markets. Rapro's products will fit seamlessly into our distribution network and provide further opportunities for growth in industrial transportation markets. The acquisition of Rapro demonstrates our ability to execute bolt-on acquisitions in our fragmented core markets,\" continued Mr. Jurek.\nMr. Jurek added, \"During the quarter we successfully completed our initial public offering and utilized the net proceeds, along with cash on hand, for debt reduction purposes. Following the IPO, our net leverage was reduced from just over five times Adjusted EBITDA to 3.9 times.\"\nFirst-Quarter Financial Results\nFirst-quarter revenue of $852.0 million increased 16.7% over the prior-year quarter, including 6.2% core revenue growth, which includes increased volumes across both segments as we continued to experience strong demand in many industrial end markets, as well as in many emerging markets, particularly China. Revenue in the quarter also benefitted 4.7% from our 2017 acquisitions and 5.8% from foreign currency effects.\nNet income attributable to shareholders in the first quarter was $24.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to $18.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted Net Income, which primarily excludes amortization of certain intangibles, transaction-related expenses and foreign currency financing gains and losses, was $71.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $46.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nFirst-quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $183.9 million, or 21.6% of sales, compared to $153.0 million, or 21.0% of sales in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, which was not in the prior-year quarter, Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by approximately 115 basis points to 22.1% in the first quarter.\nPower Transmission Segment Results\n(USD in millions)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\n% Change\n% Core\nChange\nRevenue\n$546.0\n$485.6\n+12.4%\n+5.8%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$125.3\n$107.5\n+16.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n22.9%\n22.1%\n+80 bps\nDepreciation & amortization (1)\n$15.5\n$13.9\n+11.5%\nAmort. of intangibles from acq. of Gates\n$19.6\n$20.8\n(5.8%)\n(1)\nExcludes the amortization of intangible assets arising from the 2014 acquisition of Gates.\nPower Transmission revenue increased 12.4% to $546.0 million in the first quarter, which reflects strong core revenue growth of 5.8%, and a 6.6% benefit from foreign currency effects. During the quarter, we continued to see increased demand across many of our end markets and geographies. Growth in emerging markets modestly outpaced growth in developed regions, with our highest global growth rate being in China.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew double-digits over the prior-year quarter, while Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 80 basis points, primarily attributable to benefits from higher revenue and continued manufacturing productivity improvements.\nFluid Power Segment Results\n(USD in millions)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\n% Change\n% Core\nChange\nRevenue\n$306.0\n$244.6\n+25.1%\n+7.2%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$58.6\n$45.5\n+28.8%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n19.2%\n18.6%\n+60 bps\nAdjusted EBITDA margin, excluding acquisitions\n20.4%\n18.6%\n+180 bps\nDepreciation & amortization (1)\n$8.9\n$7.2\n+23.6%\nAmort. of intangibles from acq. of Gates\n$11.0\n$10.5\n+4.8%\n(1)\nExcludes the amortization of intangible assets arising from the 2014 acquisition of Gates.\nFluid Power revenue increased 25.1% to $306.0 million in the first quarter, which reflected core revenue growth of 7.2%, incremental revenue from recent acquisitions of 13.9% and favorable foreign currency effects of 4.0%. Core revenue growth continued to be driven by strong demand in many industrial end markets, particularly in hydraulic applications. We also saw significant strength in emerging markets during the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin increased 60 basis points over the prior-year quarter and was favorably impacted by higher revenue and manufacturing productivity improvements, which offset the dilutive impact of our 2017 acquisitions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company utilized $26.5 million of cash from operations, reflecting normal seasonality in working capital. First-quarter capital expenditures were $60.5 million, the largest portion of which represented investment in new manufacturing capacity in the Fluid Power segment.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had total cash of $328.5 million and total outstanding debt of $3.0 billion. In January 2018, the Company completed its initial public offering, raising net proceeds of $799.1 million. The net proceeds were used, along with cash on hand, to repay approximately $914 million of outstanding debt, plus applicable premiums and unpaid interest, resulting in significantly improved leverage metrics. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 289,756,379 actual shares outstanding.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company's full-year outlook remains unchanged, with the exception of the acquisition of Rapro in April 2018. Taking into account the expected 2018 impact of the Rapro acquisition, total revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 8.0% to 11.0%, with the core revenue growth expectation unchanged at 5.0% to 6.0%. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $738 million to $758 million for 2018.\nAdditionally, for the full year 2018, the Company projects maintenance capital expenditures to be in line with the historical average of approximately 1.5% of revenue, with total capital expenditures for the year in the range of $150 million to $170 million, largely comprised of investments in capacity expansion.\nConference Call and Webcast\nGates Industrial Corporation plc will host a conference call today at 5:00 pm ET to discuss the Company's financial results.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as its key profitability measure. This is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA before certain items that impact comparison of the performance of our business either period-over-period or with other businesses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our measure of segment profitability to assess the performance of our businesses and it is used for total Gates as well because we believe it is important to consider our profitability on a basis that is consistent with that of our operating segments.\nManagement uses Adjusted Net Income as an additional measure of profitability. Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income attributable to shareholders before certain items that impact comparison of the performance of our business, either period-over-period or with other businesses.\nCore revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that represents net sales for the period excluding the impacts of movements in foreign currency rates and the first-year impacts of acquisitions and disposals. We present core revenue growth because it allows for a meaningful comparison of year-over-year performance without the volatility caused by foreign currency gains or losses, or the incomparability that would be caused by the impact of an acquisition or disposal.\nManagement uses Free Cash Flow to measure cash generation and liquidity. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that represents cash provided by (used in) operations less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow Conversion is a measure of Free Cash Flow for the preceding twelve months expressed as a percentage of Adjusted Net Income for the same period. We use this metric as a measure of the success of our business in converting Adjusted Net Income into cash.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, and not as superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are not accessible, and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort, we have not provided reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP measures.\nGates Industrial Corporation plc\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended\n(USD in millions)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nApril
