    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - E.ON expects a planned British retail energy joint venture between Innogy’s npower and SSE to go ahead despite intensifying regulatory scrutiny, Chief Financial Officer Marc Spieker said.\nEarlier, British regulators launched an in-depth investigation into the tie-up, saying it may reduce competition and increase prices for some households.\nThe deal bears significance for E.ON, which last month unveiled plans to acquire Innogy’s European customer businesses as part of a larger asset swap with Innogy’s parent RWE.\nSpieker said that deal would be unaffected should regulators eventually decide to block the npower-SSE transaction.\nReporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Douglas Busvine\n ",
