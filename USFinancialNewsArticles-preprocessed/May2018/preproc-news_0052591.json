    "text": "LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - Italian debt insurance costs hit the highest level in more than four months on Friday after markets grew nervous over the government programme of Italy’s two anti-establishment parties.\nSovereign five-year credit default swaps traded at 113 basis points (bps), up 1 bps from Thursday’s close and 20 bps over the last week, according to data from IHS Markit.\nThe programme of Italy’s two anti-establishment parties includes the issuance of short-term government bonds to pay companies owed money by the state.
