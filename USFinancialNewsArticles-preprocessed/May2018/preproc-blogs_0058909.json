    "text": "EXCLUSIVE-U.S. to press China to allow poultry imports in trade talks- sources Dominique Patton Reuters\nsources@\nBEIJING, May 29 (Reuters) - The United States will push China to drop a ban on U.S. poultry imports as part of trade talks, according to three sources briefed on the matter, eyeing a potential $600 million market for chicken feet and other parts.\nAlong with better access for genetically modified crops, the issue will be a top priority as U.S. Under Secretary of Agriculture Ted McKinney heads to Beijing this week as part of a U.S. trade delegation, the sources said.\nChina already imports about $1 billion of poultry a year from other countries and accounts for most of the world trade in chicken feet, a specialty dish in many regions and a popular snack throughout the country.\nWashington wants Beijing to end the ban on U.S. product imposed in January 2015 after outbreaks of avian influenza. The industry believes it can quickly re-establish its position against competitors such as Brazil.\nAmong the many issues that Washington wants resolved to improve market access and boost sales of its farm goods, poultry is \"one of the top items,\" said one of the sources who has been briefed on the matter.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) did not respond to requests for comment on Monday, which was a national holiday.\nChina's General Administration of Customs, which handles quarantine issues for agricultural imports, did not respond to a fax seeking comment on the issue. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to a fax seeking comment. (Reporting by Dominique Patton; editing by Richard Pullin)",
