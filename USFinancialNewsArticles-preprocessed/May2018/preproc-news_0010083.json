CAS Series 2018-C03, a $1.050 billion note offering, is scheduled to settle on May 9, 2018. CAS is Fannie Mae's benchmark issuance program designed to share credit risk on its single-family conventional guaranty book of business.\n\"Our third deal of 2018 was met with strong investor demand, as we remain focused on maintaining consistency in our deal structure and transparency in our overall program,\" said Laurel Davis, vice president of credit risk transfer, Fannie Mae. \"We continue to see diversified demand in our primary market issuance and will continue to work to expand the investor base.\"\nFannie Mae expects to come to the market with its fourth deal of 2018, subject to market conditions.\nThe reference pool for CAS Series 2018-C03 consists of more than 127,000 single-family mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding unpaid principal balance of approximately $31.1 billion. The loans in this reference pool have original loan-to-value ratios between 60.01 and 80 percent and were acquired from September 2017 through November 2017. The loans included in this transaction are fixed-rate, generally 30-year term, fully amortizing mortgages, and were underwritten using rigorous credit standards and enhanced risk controls.\nFannie Mae will retain a portion of the 1M-1, 1M-2, and 1B-1 tranches in order to align its interests with investors throughout the life of the deal. Fannie Mae will retain the full 1B-2 and 1A-H tranches.\nClass\nOffered Amount\n($MM)\nPricing Level\nExpected\nRating\n1M-1\n$251.415\n1-month Libor plus 68 bps\nBBB-sf from Fitch Ratings and BBB (sf)\nfrom DBRS.\n1M-2\n$606.354\n1-month Libor plus 215 bps\nBsf from Fitch Ratings and B (high) (sf)\nfrom DBRS.\n1B-1\n$192.259\n1-month Libor plus 375 bps\nThis class will not be rated\nBarclays Capital Inc.
