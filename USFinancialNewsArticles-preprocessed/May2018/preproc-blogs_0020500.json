Photo: Angus Loten / The Wall Street Journal\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif. — Oracle Corp. plans to launch in June an “Internet Weather Map” aimed at helping businesses better anticipate latency issues and outages caused by storms, earthquakes, state intervention or other network disruptions, the company says.\nThe new service is expected to be available next month.\nBeyond targeted cyberattacks, one of the biggest challenges that chief information officers face is the volatility of the internet, said Kyle York, the general manager and vice president of business and product strategy for the Oracle Dyn Global Business Unit.\nThis is becoming increasingly important as more workloads, tools and services shift to third-party web-enabled systems, he said.\nAccess to a company’s cloud applications can travel through multiple networks— or a so-called edge network — which can have a significant impact on performance.\n“The world’s most important network is the internet,” said Mr. York, a former chief strategy officer at web-service provider Dyn, which was acquired by Oracle in a deal that closed last year. “And it’s a black box,” he said.\nLaunched in 2001, Dyn was among a dozen or so com­pa­nies op­er­at­ing do­main-name sys­tems, which help di­rect traf­fic across the in­ter­net.\nThe deal is part of a broader strategy by Oracle to rapidly build out its cloud-com­puting busi­ness that sells ac­cess to web-based business ap­plications and tools.\nWithin Oracle, Mr. York’s team tracks ups and downs in internet performance globally, such as the surge in online traffic last year across Puerto Rico in the days before Hurricane Maria made landfall. Or recurring declines in internet traffic in Iraq every spring, as state officials block online access during statewide exams to prevent cheating, Mr. York said.\nOracle’s internet performance map, which will be available to cloud users, is a mix of monitoring and analytics that leverages “15-plus years of benchmarking how the internet is supposed to work,” he said.\nIt involves gathering countless micro-data points on paths and routing on the internet worldwide, and feeding it into artificial intelligence tools and machine learning.\nThe goal is to provide companies the added insights they need to fully capitalize on the strengths of the internet, while avoiding downtime whenever possible by performing IP troubleshooting and IP planning inside Oracle Cloud, Mr. York added.\nOne challenge facing the new service is the lack of reliable global data on internet activity: “Some areas of the world the picture is not as robust, like in China where data is harder to come by,” Mr. York said.\nShare this: INTERNET ORACLE Previous The Morning Download: AI Startup ThoughtSpot Raises $145 Million Next Seeking Insights into Rare Diseases, Pfizer Scales AI Analytics Platform ",
