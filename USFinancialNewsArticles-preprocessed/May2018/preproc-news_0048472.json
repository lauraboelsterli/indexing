    "text": "EditorsNote: revises seventh and ninth grafs\nTyson Ross held the Nationals to one run over 6 2/3 innings, and the San Diego Padres scored three runs on a pair of two-out, opposite-field hits Wednesday afternoon to score a 3-1 win in Washington and salvage the finale of a three-game series.\nAll the Padres’ runs came against right-hander Erick Fedde, the Nationals’ top pitching prospect who was promoted from Triple-A for the start.\nThe game was scoreless in the fifth when Padres shortstop Freddy Galvis doubled to right-center with one out and scored on a two-out, opposite-field single to right by Manuel Margot.\nIn the sixth, Eric Hosmer singled with one out and advanced to second when Fedde walked Franchy Cordero with two outs. Christian Villanueva then hit a fly deep toward the right field corner. After a long run, Bryce Harper had the ball hit off his glove, allowing Hosmer and Cordero to score.\nAt first, the play was ruled a double, then changed to an error on Harper, then eventually changed back to a double.\nMatt Adams homered off Ross leading off the bottom of the seventh for the Nationals’ lone run. Adams finished with three hits.\nRoss (4-3) allowed five hits and a walk while striking out nine (tying for his second-highest total in 2018). He lowered his earned run average to 3.13. Before Adams’ homer, Ross had retired eight consecutive batters.\nLeft-hander Brad Hand entered the game with one out in the eighth to face left-handers Juan Soto and Harper and recorded his first five-out save of the season, his 15th of the season overall.\nIn the ninth, Hand gave up a leadoff double to Anthony Rendon and a single to pinch hitter Mark Reynolds. Hand then struck out Michael Taylor and got catcher Spencer Kieboom to ground into a game-ending, around-the-horn double play.\nFedde (0-1), the Nationals’ first-round pick in the 2014 draft, gave up three runs on five hits and a walk with six strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
