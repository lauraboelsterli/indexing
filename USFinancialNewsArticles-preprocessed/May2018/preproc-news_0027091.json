    "text": "HOUSTON, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Flotek Industries, Inc. (\"Flotek\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: FTK) today announced results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nGAAP earnings (loss) per share (\"EPS\") from continuing operations of $0.00 for the first quarter 2018, compared to ($0.14) for the fourth quarter 2017 and ($0.01) for the first quarter 2017. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.01 for the first quarter 2018, compared to $0.00 for the fourth quarter 2017 and ($0.00) for the first quarter 2017. Revenue of $60.5 million for the first quarter 2018 decreased 16.5% compared to the fourth quarter 2017 and decreased 24.3% compared to the first quarter 2017. Cash SG&A of $13.7 million for the first quarter 2018 (excluding stock compensation expense of $2.0 million) decreased 5.8% compared to fourth quarter 2017 and decreased 30.2% compared to the first quarter 2017. Net income (loss) from continuing operations of $0.1 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to ($7.8) million for the fourth quarter 2017 and ($0.7) million for the first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of ($1.0) million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $7.7 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $6.5 million in the first quarter 2017. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) of ($13.5) million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $13.1 million for the fourth quarter 2017 and ($4.4) million for the first quarter 2017. Net debt position of $36.9 million at first quarter end 2018, up from $23.4 million at year end 2017 due to funding of working capital.\n(Please refer to GAAP reconciliation tables in this release)\nJohn Chisholm, Flotek's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, \"Our first quarter results reflect a difficult start to 2018 in our Energy Chemistry Technologies (ECT) segment, which experienced sequentially improving monthly results on the top line through the quarter. Our organization is aggressively responding to the rapidly changing demands of our industry. We have continued to streamline costs, prioritize new product development and demonstrate the superior performance of our customized chemistry solutions.\n\"As we had anticipated back in early 2015, our value proposition is aligned with operator needs who are seeking to maximize the value of their assets, and as such we are responding to an evolving channel-to-market shift driven by industry forces. We have seen strong interest in our Prescriptive Chemistry Management ® (PCM ® ) platform, which is providing our clients an onsite chemistry experience with solutions tailored to their reservoir development and cash flow requirements.\n\"Our Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies (CICT) segment continued to execute at a high level, which has afforded us top line and margin stability during the volatility we have experienced in our ECT segment. CICT is also providing invaluable inventory positioning as citrus terpene prices have doubled over the past two years, which are a key input for our patented Complex nano-Fluids ® (CnF ® ) product line. We expect to continue to expand our market channels in our CICT segment due to industry leading position in our supply chain and manufacturing capabilities.\n\"Consistent with recent quarters, our only debt consists of our revolver borrowings, which is used to fund working capital. Our debt levels increased during the quarter primarily due to seasonal inventory builds in our CICT segment, which purchases during the summer and fall in South America. Our balance sheet flexibility will allow us to remain financially sound and affords us the ability to pursue growth opportunities that we see in the marketplace today.\n\"Since the beginning of 2018, we have introduced several new products targeted at addressing the specific needs of operators today and in the future. In late April, we introduced MicroSolv™, a new patented line of microemulsion technologies designed to deliver cost-effective performance, surpassing conventional surfactants by a significant margin, and is positioned to benefit our clients in a cost conscious operating environment. Earlier this year, we introduced StimLube ® MAX, a patent pending high-viscosity, friction reducing solution that offers fast polymer hydration and friction reduction coupled with sustaining viscosity over broad brine loadings.\n\"Finally, RheoFlo ® CAT300 is our patented cationic Pressure reducing Fluid ® (PrF ® ) technology customized to perform in both high brine and high iron environments, which enables clients to manage the variable waters used in their frac fluid systems. In the Northeast, for example, we see that brine levels in the water can change significantly from one frac stage to the next; our technology offers an excellent solution to managing this challenge, while simplifying operations.\n\"The steps we have aggressively undertaken in recent quarters to address our cost structure, our customer alignment and our product development are set to positively impact our Company as we look ahead through 2018 and beyond. Our first quarter cash SG&A was down 30% year-over-year, or down approximately $24 million in annualized cost reductions. Although our evolution has been, and may continue to be, turbulent in the near term, we are making the right changes to our organization such that Flotek is positioned for growth and profitability in the long run.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Flotek reported revenue of $60.5 million, a decrease of $19.4 million, or 24.3%, compared to $80.0 million in the same period of 2017. Revenue decreased $12.0 million, or 16.5%, compared to fourth quarter of 2017.\nFlotek reported income (loss) from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $0.1 million, an increase of $0.8 million compared to ($0.7) million in the same period of 2017. Income (loss) from continuing operations increased $7.8 million compared to fourth quarter 2017. On a GAAP basis, Flotek reported income (loss) per share (fully diluted) from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $0.00 compared to ($0.01) for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nExcluding select items, comprised primarily of inventory write-down totaling $0.8 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per share, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.01 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to ($0.00) for the three months ended March 31, 2017. (See our Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items and Non-Cash Items Impacting Earnings at the conclusion of this release.)\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was ($4.1) million, compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which excludes select items comprised primarily of stock compensation expense, loss on sale of assets, executive retirement/severance expense and inventory write-down, was ($1.0) million compared to first quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 million and fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $7.7 million. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors to better assess and understand operating performance and cash flows. (See our Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items and Non-Cash Items Impacting Earnings at the conclusion of this release.)\nA summary income statement reflecting first quarter results can be found at the conclusion of this release, as well as GAAP reconciliation tables.\nFirst Quarter 2018 – Segment Highlights\n1Q 2018\n4Q 2017\n% Change\n1Q 2017\n% Change\nEnergy Chemistry Technologies (\"ECT\")\nRevenue\n$41.1 million\n$55.3 million\n(25.7%)\n$60.8 million\n(32.4%)\nIncome From Operations\n($0.2) million\n$8.9 million\n(101.9%)\n$8.5 million\n(101.9%)\nAdj.

EBITDA excludes stock based compensation, loss on sale of assets, R&I allocations and select items.\nEnergy Chemistry Technologies Highlights (ECT):\nFirst quarter revenue decreased 25.7% sequentially to $41.1 million, and decreased 32.4% year-over-year. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 12.7 percentage points sequentially to 13.7% and decreased 9.6 percentage points year-over-year. The declines in both comparable periods were driven primarily by lower revenues and a higher proportion of PCM ® work which encompass an overall lower margin product mix. Five new patents granted during the first quarter 2018, further bolstering the Company's intellectual property portfolio. Three new product introductions in 2018: MicroSolv™, our line of microemulsion technologies designed to deliver cost-effective performance; StimLube ® MAX, our high-viscosity, friction reducing technologies; and RheoFlo ® CAT300, our cationic PrF ® technology customized to perform in high brine and high iron environments.\nConsumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies Highlights (CICT):\nFirst quarter revenue increased 13.0% sequentially to $19.4 million, and increased 1.3% year-over-year. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 303 basis points sequentially to 17.2% due to higher margin product mix in Flavor and Fragrance compounds. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 622 basis points year-over-year. Completed the first distillation campaign on the newly installed distillation column.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nNet Debt increased $13.5 million from $23.4 million at year end to $36.9 million at quarter end, but decreased $11.0 million year-over-year from $47.9 million at the end of the first quarter 2017. Working capital requirements were $10.5 million for the first quarter 2018, primarily driven by seasonal inventory builds in the CICT segment. Total liquidity at quarter end was $38.1 million. The balance on our credit facility as of March 31, 2018 was $39.7 million, compared to $28.0 million at year end 2017. We expect to continue to fund working capital as customary with our inventory purchases during the front half of 2018 and continue to work closely with our lender to assure financial flexibility and stability.\nFlotek Outlook\nIn commenting about Flotek's outlook, Mr. Chisholm added, \"While we saw improvement as we progressed through the quarter, our current cadence remains below our internal expectations. Our efforts are focused on our sales and marketing strategy, and expanding our product portfolio and client base. We continue to see an increase in inbound requests directly from operators for our PCM ® platform, which provides unparalleled control and reliability of our clients' fluids systems and positively impacts their cash returns. Within our business, visibility remains challenged in the ECT top line as we adapt to changes in industry dynamics. Thus, given what we see in the market today, we continue to respond to new market channels but we do not expect an immediate snap back. In our CICT segment, we expect second quarter revenues to increase in the low single digit range on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. We do not foresee any material increases to our cash SG&A moving forward.\"\nConference Call Details\nFlotek will host a conference call on Thursday, May 10, at 9:30 AM CT (10:30 AM ET) to discuss its operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
