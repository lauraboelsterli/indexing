    "text": "Reblog President Donald Trump proposed to executives from the worldâ€™s biggest auto makers Friday imposing a 20% tariff on vehicles brought into the U.S. and also subjecting imports to tougher emissions standards than domestic vehicles, according to people familiar with the session. During a tense meeting at the White House that was billed as a discussion of U.S. auto-emissions standards, Mr. Trump brought up the issue of trade and targeted European auto makers for not building more vehicles in the U.S., according to the people briefed on the meeting.",
