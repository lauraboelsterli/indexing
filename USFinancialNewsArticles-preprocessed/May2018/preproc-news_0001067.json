Meanwhile, the number of TV watchers is expected to decrease more than half a percentage point to 295.9 million over the same period.\nThe agreement will also allow advertisers to place “native ads,” or advertisements that blend in with the content where they appear, within Oath’s apps as Samsung’s Galaxy app.\n“This gets ads one step closer to being direct to consumer,” Armstrong said. “You can’t be more direct than being on the mobile phone home screen and app environment.”\nSamsung and Oath will share ad revenue, Armstrong said, declining to comment on the terms of the deal.\nNine-month-old Oath was created after Verizon bought Yahoo and merged it with AOL. Oath plans to announce its deal with Samsung as part of its presentation to media buyers in New York Tuesday evening, outlining its strategy for the year.
