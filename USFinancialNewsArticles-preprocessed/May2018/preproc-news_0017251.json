    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., The Navigators Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NAVG) reported Net Income of $30.9 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $21.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017. Net Operating Earnings 1 were $32.9 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $20.4 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.\nGross Written Premiums and Net Written Premiums for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $495.2 million and $393.3 million, respectively, increasing 10.0% and 16.6%, respectively, from the comparable period in 2017. The Combined Ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 94.0%, compared to 96.4% for the same period in 2017.\nNet Investment Income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $23.7 million, an increase of 10.5% as compared to the same period in 2017. The annualized pre-tax investment yield, excluding Total Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses recognized in the Results of Operations, was 2.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOther Income (Loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $(0.1) million, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2017. Other Income (Loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 included revenue from the sale of renewal rights for the Company’s fixed-premium protection and indemnity (“P&I”) business, offset by net realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses. Other Income (Loss) for the same period in 2017 primarily consisted of net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains.\nStan Galanski, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are very pleased with our financial performance for the first quarter, reporting strong net income, a record level of operating earnings, double digit premium growth and underwriting profit in all three of our reporting segments. GlobalRe was a stand-out, achieving significant premium growth, driven by our Accident & Health and Latin American business, and a combined ratio of 86.6%. Importantly, our International Insurance reporting segment returned to profitability, reflecting the concerted effort to re-position our portfolio by exiting non-performing product lines and reducing our cost structure. Our U.S. Insurance reporting segment produced profitable results, consistent with our expectations, while achieving growth in our Marine and Professional Liability operating segments during the quarter.”\nAs disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, accounting guidance for financial instruments changed under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standard Update 2016-01 (“ASU 2016-01\"), which upon adoption as of January 1, 2018, required Equity Securities to be measured at Fair Value through Net Income. Prior to adoption, these securities were classified as Available-For-Sale with unrealized gains and losses excluded from Net Income and reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The adoption of this guidance required a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the adoption date that moved the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to Retained Earnings. As a result of this guidance, for 2018 and forward, the Results of Operations will be impacted by the volatility in the performance of these Equity Securities. The unrealized gains and losses on Equity Securities will be excluded from Net Operating Earnings.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio mainly consists of fixed income securities with an average quality rating of “AA-/Aa3” as defined by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, with an effective duration of 3.5 years as of March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, Net Unrealized Losses within the Available-For-Sale investment portfolio recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income were $(16.6) million, a decrease of $(58.0) million compared to December 31, 2017. Included in this decrease was the reclassification of $11.8 million of net unrealized gains, before tax, from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to Retained Earnings as a result of adopting ASU 2016-01.\nThe Company recognized $(2.0) million of Total Net Realized and Unrealized Losses within the Results of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $(44) thousand of Total Net Realized and Unrealized Losses for the same period in 2017. The Net Realized and Unrealized Losses within the Results of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 included $(3.2) million of net unrealized losses on Equity Securities.\nThe effective tax rate was 16.8% for the first quarter of 2018, which compares to 26.6% for the same period in 2017, primarily as a result of changes related to 2017 tax reform.\nStockholders’ Equity was $1.2 billion, or $40.96 per share, as of March 31, 2018 compared to $41.55 per share, as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of Common Stock.\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 starting at 8:30 a.m. (ET) to discuss the 2018 first quarter results. The call will be available via live webcast on Navigators’ website ( www.navg.com ).\nTo participate by telephone, the domestic dial-in number is 800-850-2903 and the international dial-in is 224-357-2399.
