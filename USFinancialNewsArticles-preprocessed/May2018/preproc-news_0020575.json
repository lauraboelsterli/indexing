    "text": "5 COMMENTS Regarding Peter Wood and David Randall’s “ How Bad is the Government’s Science? ” (op-ed, April 17 and Letters, May 1): It has been my experience that the major issue with reproducibility of results in the environmental science area is due to erroneous assumptions about the statistical design and analysis of data collected during experiments and field projects.\nMost scientists and engineers use assumptions of an independent and normal, or Gaussian, distribution of data. These assumptions are rarely, if ever, strictly met in nature. Log-normal or other skewed distributions and time-dependent or auto-correlated data are more typical. I think the major reason behind these erroneous assumptions is the ease of data analysis if these assumptions are made.\nSo-called distribution-free, auto-correlational and Bayesian analytical techniques are available, but they often aren’t used because of statistical robustness issues or lack of familiarity on the part of researchers. Researchers often take their cue for statistical decisions from peer-reviewed literature, but this is often a case of the blind leading the blind. Strict attention to the use of appropriate statistical assumptions and analytical techniques would lead to more accurate studies with more reproducible results.\nJoe Visalli\nSchodack, N.Y.",
