    "text": "Edwin Encarnacion went 2-for-4 with a homer, a double and four RBIs, and the Cleveland Indians rallied for a 9-6 win over the Chicago White Sox on Monday afternoon at Progressive Field.\nYonder Alonso added two doubles and an RBI as the Indians scored eight unanswered runs to erase a 5-1 deficit. Francisco Lindor finished 3-for-4 with an RBI as Cleveland won its third game in a row.\nWhite Sox first baseman Matt Skole shined in his big league debut. He ripped a single to right field on the first pitch he saw, and he homered to right field in his second at-bat. Earlier in the day, Chicago promoted the 28-year-old from Triple-A Charlotte to replace Matt Davidson, who was placed on the 10-day disabled list with back spasms.\nSkole reached the majors after playing 712 games and logging 2,500 at-bats in eight seasons in the minors.\n“It was surreal,” Skole told the team’s official website. “I was shaking.”\nIndians right-hander Adam Plutko (3-0) recovered from Skole’s early outburst to win his third consecutive start. Plutko gave up five runs on six hits in five innings. He walked one and struck out two.\nWhite Sox right-hander Chris Volstad (0-3) drew the loss in relief.\nA five-run fifth inning keyed Cleveland’s comeback. The Indians loaded the bases with one out to chase White Sox starter Dylan Covey from the game. Jose Ramirez popped up to shortstop for the second out, but Encarnacion delivered with a bases-clearing double to even the score at 5.\nIn the next at-bat, Alonso doubled to score Encarnacion and give the Indians the lead for good. Alonso scored moments later on a fielding error by White Sox second baseman Yoan Moncada.\nChicago scored the first three runs on a sacrifice fly by Jose Abreu, a run-scoring triple by Adam Engel and a sacrifice fly by Charlie Tilson. The Indians cut the deficit to 3-1 before Chicago struck again with back-to-back home runs by Skole and Tim Anderson.\nCleveland supplemented its five-run fifth with one run apiece in the fourth, sixth and seventh innings.\nThe White Sox added one run in the ninth before Indians right-hander Ben Taylor secured the final out.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
