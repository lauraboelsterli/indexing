    "text": "0 COMMENTS Valeant Pharmaceuticals International wants a fresh start.\nThe drug company announced Tuesday that it plans to change its name to Bausch Health this summer as it tries to put several scandals behind it.\nA new name is a smart idea, but it won’t be the first time the organization has rebranded itself. In 2010, Biovail merged with Valeant and assumed the name of its lesser-known partner less than two years after the Securities and Exchange Commission had charged Biovail with accounting fraud; those charges were eventually settled.\nBack in 2003, ICN Pharmaceuticals , once controlled by the former Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, changed its name to Valeant. “Our new name embodies the core principles that underpin this newly invigorated pharmaceutical company,” the CEO said at the time.\nThe future Bausch Health is off to a good start. Shares were up 13% Tuesday afternoon after first quarter results pleased investors.\nShare this: Heard on the Street Overheard Valeant Previous Citigroup Shares Jump Nearly 4% After Investor ValueAct Reveals Stake",
