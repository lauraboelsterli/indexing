Information about the outbreak in Bikoro, Iboko and Wangata health zones in Equateur province was still limited, the WHO said in a statement.\nAt present the outbreak did not meet the criteria for declaring a \"public health event of international concern\", which would trigger the formation of an emergency WHO committee.",
