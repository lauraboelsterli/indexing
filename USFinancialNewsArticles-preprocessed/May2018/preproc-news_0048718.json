    "text": "Ellevest caters to the needs of female investors Men outnumber women as financial advisors, Wall Street traders, mutual-fund managers and hedge-fund managers. \"It's not ... particularly surprising that industries that are dominated by men tend to do a better job for men,\" says Sallie Krawcheck, CEO and co-founder of Ellevest, a female-focused financial advisory firm. Ellevest helps female investors understand the unique set of obstacles they face as women. 10 Hours Ago | 06:01\nAs a former CEO of Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney and Citi Private, Sallie Krawcheck has worked with all kinds of people. But there was still one group she said Wall Street has underserved: female investors.\n\"It's not ... particularly surprising that industries that are dominated by men tend to do a better job for men,\" Krawcheck told CNBC's \" Fast Money \" on Tuesday. \"And there's an opportunity for businesses serving women.\" Meet the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 companies\nSo in 2016, Krawcheck co-founded Ellevest , an investment group focused on serving female investors. This year, the company made CNBC's 2018 Disruptor 50 list of start-ups that are changing traditional ways of doing business.\n\"All of those articles ... that are about mistakes investors make — over-trading, falling in love with the winners, panicking in downturns, paying too much in fees because of over-trading — really all need to be renamed mistakes that gentlemen investors make,\" said Krawcheck, who is CEO.\n\"The real mistake [women make] is that they tend to under-invest, which is what we're trying to help them with,\" she said.\nWhile the Wall Street veteran said men are welcome at Ellevest — the co-founder and VP of operations are both men — she's \"pretty happy serving half the population that's been underserved in the investing arena.\" Adam Jeffery | CNBC Sally Krawcheck, CEO and Co-Founder of Ellevest.\nThe company, based in New York, helps women understand they have a different set of obstacles in investing, such as longer lifespans, different base salaries than their male counterparts and child-rearing, which can potentially interrupt savings plans.\nEllevest is one of nine companies on this year's Disruptor 50 list with female CEOs, compared with only three in 2017. Thirteen companies on the list have female founders. More from CNBC Disruptor 50:",
