(the “Company,” “we” or “Kandi”) (NASDAQ GS:KNDI), today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nTotal revenues increased 95.0% to $8.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, from $4.3 million for the same period of 2017. Electric Vehicle (“EV”) parts sales increased 139.1% to $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $2.7million in the same period of 2017.\nKandi Electric Vehicles Group Co., Ltd. (the “JV Company”) sold 3,295 EV products in the first quarter of 2018, compared to no EV products sold in the same period in 2017.\nOff-road vehicle revenues increased 22.0% to $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $1.6 million in the same period of 2017.\nGAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.7 million, or $0.07 per fully diluted share, compared with net loss of $24.2 million, or $0.51 loss per fully diluted share in the same period of 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net loss 1 , which excludes stock compensation expenses of $1.0 million net of a reversal for forfeited stock option of $2.6 million and the change in fair value of contingent consideration which was a gain of $2.7 million, was $0.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with non-GAAP net loss of $21.7 million for the same period of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted loss per share 1 was approximately $0.01 per fully diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 compared with Non-GAAP adjusted loss per share 1 of $0.45 per fully diluted share for the same quarter of 2017.\nWorking capital surplus was $50.1 million as of March 31, 2018.Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $8.5 million as of March 31, 2018.\n1 Non-GAAP measures, including the Non-GAAP net income (loss) and Non-GAAP EPS are defined as the financial measures excluding the change of the fair value of contingent consideration and the effects of the stock compensation expense. We supply non-GAAP information because we believe it allows our investors to obtain a clearer understanding of our operations. Any non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, and should only be read in conjunction with, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nMr. Hu Xiaoming, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kandi, commented, “We have taken strides to accelerate our EV sales and we are very pleased with our strong performance given the first quarter being a slow season. In March, the JV Company unveiled its first all-electric SUV model Geely Global HawkEX3, although it is not yet in production, there has already been overwhelming requests from interested dealers. At the end of March, Kandi Model K23 production was launched and sales are expected to be advanced in the second half of 2018. We are confident in these new EV products becoming a driving force that will fuel the growth of Kandi’s EV business.”\n“In the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Jinhua An Kao Power Technology Co., Ltd. and have consolidated its financial statements. An Kao’s unique system of pure electric car battery replacement technology is a major step forward to our existing EV offering. The acquisition is expected to generate additional revenues and provide a considerably competitive advantage in product delivery and services that will lead to market share gain. Looking forward, we expect continued momentum of Kandi’s EV business to a new phase of growth in 2018.” Mr. Hu concluded.\nNet Revenues and Gross Profit\n1Q18 1Q17 Y-o-Y% Net Revenues (US$mln) $8.3 $4.3 95.0% Gross Profit (US$mln) $1.3 $0.7 101.7% Gross Margin 16.1% 15.6% -\nNet revenues for the first quarter increased 95.0%compared to the same period last year. The increase in revenue was mainly due to the increase in EV parts sales during this quarter.\nOperating Income (Loss)\n1Q18 1Q17 Y-o-Y% Operating Expenses (US$mln) $1.1 $29.4 (96.2%) Operating Income (Loss) (US$mln) $0.2 ($28.8) (100.8%) Operating Margin 2.9% (673.3%) -\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter were $1.1 million, compared with $29.4 million in the same quarter of 2017. The decrease in total operating expenses was primarily due to decreased research and development, which was$0.8 million in this quarter, compared with $20.8 million in the same quarter last year.\nGAAP Net Income\n1Q18 1Q17 Y-o-Y% Net Income (Loss) (US$mln) $3.7 ($24.2) (115.4%) Earnings（loss） per Weighted Average Common Share Outstanding Basic $0.07 ($0.51) - Earnings (loss) per Weighted Average Common Share Outstanding Diluted $0.07 ($0.51) - Stock Compensation expenses ($1.6) $2.5 - Change in fair value of contingent consideration ($2.7) - - Non-GAAP net loss ($0.6) ($21.7) (97.4%)\nNet income was $3.7 million in the first quarter, compared with net loss of $24.2 million in the same quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales and gross profits, increased profits from the JV Company and significantly decreased R&D expenses this period.\nNon-GAAP net loss was $0.6million, a 97.4% decreased loss in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net loss of $21.7 million in the same quarter of 2017. The decrease in Non-GAAP net loss was primarily attributable to increased sales and gross profits, increased profits from the JV Company and significantly decreased R&D expenses this period.\nJV Company Financial Results\nIn the first quarter, the JV Company sold a total of 3,295 units of EV products, compared to no EV product sales in the same period of 2017.In this quarter, total revenue was $33.8 million as compared to $1.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe condensed financial income statement of the JV Company in the first quarter is as below:\n1Q18 1Q17 Y-o-Y% Net Revenues (US$mln) $33.8 $1.3 2500.0% Gross Profit (Loss) (US$mln) $5.6 ($0.3) (1966.7%) Gross Margin 16.5% (26.4%) - Net Income (Loss) $1.0 ($10.6) (109.4%) % of Net revenue 3.0% (830.3%) -\nKandi’s investments in the JV Company are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, as Kandi has a 50% ownership interest in the JV Company. As a result, Kandi recorded 50% of the JV Company’s income for $0.5 million for this quarter. After eliminating intra-entity profits and losses, Kandi’s share of the after tax profit of the JV Company was $0.8 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter of 2018 Conference Call Details\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call and live webcast to discuss its financial results at 8:00 A.M.
