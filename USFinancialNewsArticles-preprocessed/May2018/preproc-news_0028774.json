    "text": "(Correct to show company suspending just one service)\nBEIJING, May 11 (Reuters) - China’s biggest ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing said on Friday it would halt one of its services, which it calls “ride-hitching”, in China for a week following the death of a passenger that has raised questions about safety.\nThe company said it would suspends its Hitch service - a pooling service for passengers and drivers going to the same destination - from Saturday nationwide, and would start checks on drivers.\nA female passenger was killed in Zhengzhou city last week and the company apologized amid a public outcry.
