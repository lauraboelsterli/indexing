FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - AFC Bournemouth vs Swansea City - Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth, Britain - May 5, 2018 Swansea City's Nathan Dyer in action with Bournemouth's Simon Francis REUTERS/David Klein\nThe 33-year-old defender, who had one year remaining on his previous deal, has made 286 appearances for the Cherries since arriving from Charlton Athletic in 2011.\n\"The most important thing was to retain our Premier League status for another year and then once that was achieved it was a chance to sit down and discuss things,\" Francis told the club website www.afcb.co.uk .\n“It all happened fairly quickly because negotiations don’t take too long when a player wants to stay at the club.”\nEddie Howe’s Bournemouth finished 12th in the Premier League with 44 points to secure a fourth consecutive campaign in top-flight football.
