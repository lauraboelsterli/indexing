    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp plans to carry out work on the coker at its 362,300 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery in May and June while a hydrotreater is shut for overhaul, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin confirmed that the Beaumont refinery was overhauling some units.\n“The Beaumont plant has shut down some of its units and associated operations for planned maintenance beginning May 13,2018,” Nordin said. “We have communicated this turnaround to our customers and expect to meet all contractual commitments.”\nExxon is overhauling the 40,000 bpd CHD-2 diesel hydrotreater through the last week of June, the sources said. Maintenance work is also being done on a sulfur recovery unit.\nWork will be performed on two of the furnaces on the 40,000 bpd coker. One furnace will remain in operation while the other is shut, the sources said.\nThe Beaumont refinery coker converts residual crude oil from distillation units into motor fuel feedstocks and petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute.\nHydrotreaters remove hydrogen sulfide from motor fuels and their feedstocks in compliance with U.S. environmental rules.\nSulfur recovery units extract sulfur from hydrogen sulfide removed by hydrotreaters.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Susan Thomas\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
