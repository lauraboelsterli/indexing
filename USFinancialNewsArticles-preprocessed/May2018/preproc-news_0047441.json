A volcano is seen erupting in Central Java, Indonesia, in this May 11, 2018 still image taken from a video obtained from social media. Courtesy of Shopan Pangestu/via REUTERS\nA series of eruptions at Mount Merapi in 2010 killed more than 350 people and authorities are taking no chances after plumes of smoke and ash billowed into the sky late on Monday.\n“There can be no public activity within a 3 km radius. Hiking is also temporarily prohibited,” a spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said in a text message.\nThe agency raised the alert level a notch on Tuesday.
