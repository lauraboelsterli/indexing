    "text": "Johnson and Johnson said it would stop mid-stage trials testing its experimental Alzheimer's drug after observing safety issues, the latest drugmaker to abandon developing treatments for the memory-robbing disease.\nSome trial participants showed serious elevations of liver enzymes and the company concluded that the benefit-risk ratio offered by the drug, atabecestat, no longer supported its development, said Janssen , a unit of Johnson and Johnson.\nAtabecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer's drugs called BACE inhibitors that block an enzyme involved in the production of a protein that creates brain plaques, which are considered a major cause for the disease.\nAnalysts expect the successful development of a treatment for the disease, which affects about 5.7 million Americans, to virtually guarantee multi-billion dollar annual sales.\nHowever, several drugmakers, including Pfizer , Merck and Co , have been forced to abandon trials over lack of effectiveness or safety concerns.\nEli Lilly and AstraZeneca are testing their BACE inhibitor, lanabecestat, in late-stage trials and are due to report results next year.\nJohnson & Johnson was testing atabecestat to slow cognitive decline in certain patients identified to be progressing to Alzheimer's dementia.",
