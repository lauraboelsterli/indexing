(\"Mountain Province\"). Forward-looking statements and forward-looking information include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to estimated production and mine life of the project of Mountain Province; the realization of mineral reserve estimates; the timing and amount of estimated future production; costs of production; the future price of diamonds; the estimation of mineral reserves and resources; the ability manage debt; capital expenditures; the ability to obtain permits for operations; liquidity; tax rates; and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Except for statements of historical fact relating to Mountain Province, certain information contained herein constitutes . Forward-looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as \"anticipates,\" \"may,\" \"can,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"projects,\" \"targets,\" \"intends,\" \"likely,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"to be\", \"potential\" and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions \"may\", \"should\" or \"will\" occur. Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the statements are made, and are based on a number of assumptions and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the . Many of these assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of Mountain Province and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct.\nFactors that could cause actual results to vary materially from results anticipated by such include variations in ore grade or recovery rates, changes in market conditions, changes in project parameters, mine sequencing; production rates; cash flow; risks relating to the availability and timeliness of permitting and governmental approvals; supply of, and demand for, diamonds; fluctuating commodity prices and currency exchange rates, the possibility of project cost overruns or unanticipated costs and expenses, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry, failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated.\nThese factors are discussed in greater detail in Mountain Province's most recent Annual Information Form and in the most recent MD&A filed on SEDAR, which also provide additional general assumptions in connection with these statements. Mountain Province cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Investors and others who base themselves on should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail. Mountain Province believes that the expectations reflected in those are reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such included in this press release should not be unduly relied upon. These statements speak only as of the date of this press release.\nAlthough Mountain Province has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in , there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Mountain Province undertakes no obligation to update if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change except as required by applicable securities laws. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on . Statements concerning mineral reserve and resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute to the extent they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered as the property is developed.\nFurther, Mountain Province may make changes to its business plans that could affect its results. The Principal assets of Mountain Province are administered pursuant to a joint venture under which Mountain Province is not the operator.
