    "text": "EditorsNote: Adds winning/losing pitchers\nThe Minnesota Twins scored three runs in the ninth inning, rallying from a 4-2 deficit to upend the Los Angeles Angels 5-4 Friday night at Angel Stadium.\nThe Angels went into the ninth inning with a lead thanks mostly to a two-run homer by Justin Upton and six strong innings from starter Tyler Skaggs, but the bullpen couldn’t hold the lead.\nAngels reliever Justin Anderson pitched a perfect eighth inning, but he found trouble in the ninth.\nThe Twins scored their first run of the inning on a solo homer by Eddie Rosario, his second homer of the game. He also homered off Skaggs in the sixth.\nLogan Morrison doubled with one out, and after an intentional walk to Max Kepler, Anderson (0-1) was replaced by Jim Johnson.\nTwins manager Paul Molitor countered with pinch hitter Mitch Garver, who slapped an RBI single to right field, tying the game at 4-4. Catcher Bobby Wilson followed with a sacrifice fly to put Minnesota up 5-4 before Johnson could get out of the inning.\nFernando Rodney, the last of five Minnesota relievers, pitched a scoreless bottom of the ninth for his sixth save, getting Mike Trout on a liner to short to end it.\nMatt Magill (1-0) pitched a perfect eighth inning for the Twins to earn the win.\nSkaggs went six innings, giving up two runs on six hits and two walks. He struck out seven and made 98 pitches. It was just the third time in eight starts this season Skaggs has lasted at least six innings.\nAfter getting four hits on Thursday, Twins second baseman Brian Dozier picked up where he left off with a home run against Skaggs in the first inning for a 1-0 Minnesota lead.\nDozier also had a single and a walk in the game and is 6-for-7 with a walk in the first two games of the series.\nSkaggs, though, settled in after the first as the Angels offense got things going in the third against Twins starter Lance Lynn. Kole Calhoun and Martin Maldonado began the inning with back-to-back singles, and Calhoun scored when Zack Cozart grounded into a force play.\nOne out later, Upton hit a two-run homer and the Angels had a 3-1 lead. It was Upton’s fourth consecutive game with a home run.\nIn the fifth, a single by Maldonado, a walk by Upton and a single by Shohei Ohtani loaded the bases with two out. Andrelton Simmons followed with a walk to score Maldonado for a 4-1 Los Angeles lead. It also knocked Lynn out of the game.\nLynn gave up four runs on eight hits and two walks in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out three and made 99 pitches.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
