    "text": "HOUSTON, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Exterran Corporation (NYSE:EXTN) (“Exterran” or the “Company”) today announced net income from continuing operations of 2018 of $3.9 million, or $0.11 per share, on revenue of $350.4 million. This compares to net income from continuing operations of $2.1 million, or $0.06 per share, on revenue of $337.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and net loss from continuing operations of $12.3 million, or $0.35 per share, on revenue of $245.4 million of 2017.\nAndrew Way, Exterran’s President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “Revenue was the highest reported in eight quarters as we benefited from conversion of strong 2017 product bookings and contractual recoveries in our contract operations business. In addition, first quarter product bookings rebounded as expected from fourth quarter 2017 levels, with bookings of $193.4 million.\n“We are pleased with the way the year has started, coupled with what we believe will be a very strong second quarter for contract operations and product orders, provides us strong momentum as we look to the second half of the year and beyond. Product segment margins continue to improve and our commercial teams continue to work their extensive project pipelines to capture new contract operations and aftermarket opportunities.”\nNet income of 2018 was $5.3 million. This compares to net income of $6.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and net income of $20.3 million of 2017.\nEBITDA, as adjusted, was $50.7 million of 2018, as compared with EBITDA, as adjusted, of $50.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $34.5 million of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $44.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared with $44.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $44.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nContract Operations Segment\nContract operations revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $96.5 million, a 1% increase from fourth quarter of 2017 revenue of $95.3 million and a 5% increase from first quarter of 2017 revenue of $92.0 million.\nContract operations gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 was $61.1 million, unchanged from fourth quarter of 2017 gross margin of $61.1 million and slightly lower from first quarter of 2017 gross margin of $61.2 million. Gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018 was 63%, as compared with 64% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 67% in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe sequential revenue increase was primarily due to contractual recoveries, while the sequential gross margin percentage decrease was due to an increase in project expenses which are not expected to repeat.\nAftermarket Services Segment\nAftermarket services revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $26.4 million, a 14% decrease from fourth quarter of 2017 revenue of $30.5 million and a 17% increase from first quarter of 2017 revenue of $22.5 million.\nAftermarket services gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 was $7.5 million, a 7% decrease from fourth quarter of 2017 gross margin of $8.1 million and a 26% increase from first quarter of 2017 gross margin of $5.9 million. Gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018 was 28%, as compared with 26% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 26% in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe sequential decrease in aftermarket service revenue and gross margin were driven by the normal first quarter decrease in parts sales and maintenance services in the Latin America region.\nProduct Sales Segment\nProduct sales revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $227.5 million, a 7% increase from fourth quarter of 2017 revenue of $211.9 million, and a 74% increase from first quarter of 2017 revenue of $130.9 million.\nProduct sales gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 was $27.2 million, an 11% increase from fourth quarter of 2017 gross margin of $24.5 million and a 140% increase from first quarter of 2017 gross margin of $11.3 million. Gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018 improved 40 basis points as compared to fourth quarter of 2017 and 330 basis points as compared to first quarter of 2017.\nThe sequential increase in revenue and gross margin was primarily due to an increase in processing and treating equipment and compression equipment sales, resulting from higher activity in the North America region. The gross margin was positively impacted as a result of a continued strong focus on productivity.\nProduct sales backlog was $426.9 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $461.0 million at December 31, 2017 and $424.6 million at March 31, 2017. Product bookings of 2018 were $193.4 million, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 85%. This compares to bookings of $113.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and bookings of $249.2 million of 2017.\nSale of PEQ Assets\nOn April 17, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of its North America production equipment manufacturing facility and associated inventory to Titan Production Equipment Acquisition, LLC, an affiliate of Castle Harlan, Inc. The sale is not expected to have a material financial impact to the Company, and it allows Exterran to accelerate its growth strategy by focusing as a systems and process company for oil, gas, water and power. The Company will continue to manufacture production equipment outside of North America. In addition, Exterran will continue to offer its customers complete solutions in gas gathering, processing, treating and compression, including offering production equipment in North America through Titan.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call at 10 a.m. Central Time on Thursday, May 3, 2018.

share 0.07 (0.09 ) 0.13 Diluted adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations per common share (4) (5) $ 0.18 $ (0.03 ) $ (0.22 ) (1) Management evaluates the performance of each of the Company’s segments based on gross margin. Total gross margin, a non-GAAP measure, is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary measure used by our management to evaluate the results of revenue and cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), which are key components of our operations. Management believes total gross margin is important supplemental information for investors because it focuses on the current performance of our operations and excludes the impact of the prior historical costs of the assets acquired or constructed that are utilized in those operations, the indirect costs associated with our SG&A activities, the impact of our financing methods, restatement related charges, restructuring and other charges and income taxes. In addition, the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense may not accurately reflect the costs required to maintain and replenish the operational usage of our assets and therefore may not portray the costs from current operating activity. (2) Management believes EBITDA, as adjusted, is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest expense from outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), our subsidiaries’ capital structure (non-cash gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on intercompany obligations), tax consequences, impairment charges, restatement related charges, restructuring and other charges, expensed acquisition costs and other items. Management uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as supplemental measures to review current period operating performance, comparability measures and performance measures for period to period comparisons. In addition, the Company's compensation committee has used EBITDA, as adjusted, in evaluating the performance of the Company and management and in evaluating certain components of executive compensation, including performance-based annual incentive programs. (3) The tax impacts of adjustments were based on the Company’s statutory tax rates applicable to each item in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. Using statutory tax rates for presentation of the non-GAAP measures allows a consistent basis for investors to understand financial performance of the Company across historical periods. The overall effective tax rate on adjustments was impacted by the inability to recognize tax benefits from charges in jurisdictions that are in cumulative-loss positions. (4) Management believes adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations and diluted adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations per common share provide useful information to investors because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of impairment charges, restructuring and other charges, restatement related charges, expensed acquisition costs and other items not appropriately reflective of our core business. (5) Diluted adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations per common share, was computed using the two-class method to determine the net income (loss) per share for each class of common stock and participating security (restricted stock and certain of our stock settled restricted stock units) according to participation rights in undistributed earnings. Accordingly, we have excluded adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to participating securities of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from our calculation of diluted adjusted net income from continuing operations per common share.\nSource:Exterran Corporation",
