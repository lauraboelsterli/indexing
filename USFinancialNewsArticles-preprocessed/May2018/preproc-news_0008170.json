    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Summit Hotel Properties, Inc. (NYSE: INN) (the \"Company\"), today announced results ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We continue to be encouraged by the improved demand trends experienced in the first quarter, which drove our key operating and financial metrics above our expectations going in to the quarter,\" said Dan Hansen, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"RevPAR for our pro forma portfolio grew 2.1% in the quarter, which was driven primarily by an increase in average rate, in part as the result of better corporate travel demand. We also continue to make great progress on our strategic capital recycling program as we entered into contracts to sell four hotels for $43.3 million. The pending transactions further demonstrate our ability to recycle capital out of lower RevPAR hotels with lower return profiles and deploy capital at similar initial yields into hotels with higher RevPAR and margins with superior growth profiles,\" commented Mr. Hansen.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet Income: Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased to $0.9 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared with $28.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the same period of 2017. When excluding the $3.3 million non-cash preferred stock redemption premium during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the $19.5 million pretax net gain on disposal of assets during the three months ended March 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders decreased by $5.3 million as compared to the same period in 2017. Pro Forma RevPAR: Pro forma revenue per available room (\"RevPAR\") increased 2.1 percent to $117.60 from the same period in 2017. Pro forma average daily rate (\"ADR\") grew to $154.22, an increase of 1.2 percent from the same period in 2017. Pro forma occupancy increased 0.9 percent to 76.3 percent. Same-Store RevPAR: Same-store RevPAR remained unchanged at $114.78. Same-store ADR increased 1.0 percent to $150.73 compared to the same period in 2017, which was offset by an occupancy decline of 1.0 percent to 76.2 percent. Pro Forma Hotel EBITDA: Pro forma hotel EBITDA was $50.4 million, a decrease of 0.5 percent from the same period in 2017. Pro forma hotel EBITDA margin contracted by 106 basis points to 35.9 percent from 37.0 percent in the same period of 2017. Excluding the effect of a 12.0 percent increase in property taxes, pro forma hotel EBITDA margin contracted by 40 basis points to 36.6 percent. Adjusted EBITDAre: Adjusted EBITDAre increased 13.9 percent to $46.7 million from $41.1 million in the same period of 2017.

See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this release. Non-GAAP financial measures are unaudited.\n(2)\nAmounts are based on 104,403,000 weighted average diluted common shares and units and 93,623,000 weighted average diluted common shares and units for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The Company includes the outstanding common units of limited partnership interests (\"OP Units\") in Summit Hotel OP, LP, the Company's operating partnership, held by limited partners other than the Company in the determination of weighted average diluted common shares and units because the OP Units are redeemable for cash or, at the Company's option, shares of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis.\n(3)\nUnless stated otherwise in this release, all pro forma information includes operating and financial results for 83 hotels owned as of March 31, 2018, as if each hotel had been owned by the Company since January 1, 2017. As a result, all pro forma information includes operating and financial results for hotels acquired since January 1, 2017, which includes periods prior to the Company's ownership. Pro forma and non-GAAP financial measures are unaudited.\nPending Disposition Activity\nDuring the first quarter, the Company entered into agreements to sell the 88-guestroom Holiday Inn Express & Suites in Sandy, Utah and the 87-guestroom Hampton Inn in Provo, Utah for an aggregate sales price of $19.0 million. The Company also entered into agreements to sell the 143-guestroom Holiday Inn and 122-guestroom Hilton Garden Inn in Duluth, Georgia for an aggregate sales price of $24.3 million. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, the four hotels had an average RevPAR of $87.49, which was 26% lower than the Company's pro forma portfolio RevPAR of $118.29, and hotel EBITDA margin of 32.4 percent, which was 470 basis points lower than the portfolio average for the same period.\nThe transactions are expected to close during the second quarter and the Company anticipates applying the net proceeds to the outstanding balance on its senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company estimates that the hotels would have contributed approximately $3.5 million of EBITDA through the remainder of 2018. The aggregate sales price of $43.3 million, plus estimated future capital improvements, represents a capitalization rate of 8.0 percent for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2018.\nCapital Investment\nThe Company invested $13.0 million in capital improvements during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The scope of work ranged from common space improvements to complete guestroom renovations, as well as revamped bar areas and fitness centers to enhance the guest experience. Notably, the 252-guestroom Holiday Inn Express & Suites San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf is currently undergoing a $6.3 million comprehensive renovation that will feature complete guestroom and lobby upgrades. The project is expected to be completed late in the second quarter of 2018, and the hotel will be well-positioned for the Moscone Center's expansion project completion scheduled for December 2018.\nCapital Markets & Balance Sheet\nDuring the first quarter and subsequent to quarter end, the Company completed the following capital markets transactions:\nOn February 15, 2018, the Company closed on a new seven-year $225 million unsecured term loan. The term loan includes an accordion feature that, subject to certain conditions, allows the Company to request an increase in lender commitments up to an aggregate of $375 million. The unsecured term loan matures on February 14, 2025, carries an interest rate based on an improved pricing grid ranging from 180 basis points to 255 basis points plus LIBOR depending upon the Company's leverage ratio, and includes a delayed draw feature. At closing, the Company received an initial loan advance of $140 million and used the proceeds to replace its existing seven-year $140 million unsecured term loan. On or before May 16, 2018, the Company expects to advance the remaining $85.0 million and apply the proceeds to outstandings under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility. On March 20, 2018, the Company paid $85.3 million to redeem all 3,400,000 of its outstanding 7.125% Series C preferred shares at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. On April 2, 2018, the Company repaid four mortgage loans totaling $23.9 million that had an average interest rate of 5.39%. The loans were repaid without penalty and all four hotels that secured the loans are now unencumbered. As a result, 54 hotels and over 70 percent of the Company's EBITDA is now unencumbered.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had the following:\nTotal outstanding debt of $981.1 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.13 percent. Undrawn capacity on its senior unsecured credit facilities of $260.0 million, of which $175.0 million was available on its senior unsecured revolving credit facility and $85.0 million was available on its new 7-year $225 million unsecured term loan. Total net debt, which the Company defines as total outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents, to trailing twelve month pro forma adjusted EBITDAre of 4.7x.\nAt April 20, 2018, the Company had the following:\nTotal outstanding debt of $971.5 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.10 percent. Undrawn capacity on its senior unsecured credit facilities of $245.0 million, of which $160.0 million was available on its senior unsecured revolving credit facility and $85.0 million was available on its new 7-year $225 million unsecured term loan.\nDividends\nOn April 30, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share on its common stock and per common unit of limited partnership interest in Summit Hotel OP, LP. The annualized dividend of $0.72 per common share and per common unit represents an annual dividend yield of 4.9 percent based on the May 1, 2018 closing stock price.\nIn addition, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of:\n$0.403125 per share on its 6.45% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. $0.390625 per share on its 6.25% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.\nThe common and preferred dividends are payable on May 31, 2018 to holders of record as of May 16, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company is providing its outlook for the second quarter and full year 2018 based on its 83 hotels owned as of May 2, 2018 and investment activity it expects to complete in the second quarter, including the opening of the 168-guestroom Hyatt House Orlando Universal development and the sale of four hotels containing 440 guestrooms for an aggregate sales price of $43.3 million.

Non-GAAP financial measures are financial measures not prescribed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"non-GAAP\"). These measures are as follows: (i) Funds From Operations (\"FFO\") and Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), (ii) Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"), Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (\"EBITDAre\") and Adjusted EBITDAre. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of FFO and EBITDAre may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner. Our non-GAAP measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of our operating performance. Our non-GAAP measures may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, debt service obligations and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that our non-GAAP measures can enhance the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily better indicators of any trend as compared to a comparable measure prescribed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") such as net income (loss).\nFunds From Operations (\"FFO\") and Adjusted FFO (\"AFFO\")\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, (\"Nareit\"), FFO represents net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding preferred dividends, gains (or losses) from sales of real property, impairment losses on real estate assets, items classified by GAAP as extraordinary, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. AFFO represents FFO excluding amortization of deferred financing costs, franchise fees, equity based compensation, debt transaction costs, premiums on redemption of preferred shares, losses from net casualties, non-cash interest income and non-cash income tax related adjustments to our deferred tax asset. Unless otherwise indicated, we present FFO and AFFO applicable to our common shares and common units. We present FFO and AFFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operational performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO and AFFO when reporting their results. FFO and AFFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO and AFFO excludes depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, gains and losses from real property dispositions and impairment losses on real estate assets, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the effect to operations from trends in occupancy, guestroom rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. Our computation of FFO differs slightly from the computation of Nareit-defined FFO related to the reporting of corporate depreciation and amortization expense. Our computation of FFO may also differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. Where indicated in this release, FFO is based on our computation of FFO and not the computation of Nareit-defined FFO unless otherwise noted.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA\nEBITDA\nEBITDA represents net income or loss, excluding: (i) interest, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. Our management team also uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nIn September 2017, Nareit proposed a standardized performance measure, called EBITDAre, which is based on EBITDA and is expected to provide additional relevant information about REITs as real estate companies in support of growing interest among generalist investors. The conclusion was reached that, while dedicated REIT investors have long been accustomed to utilizing the industry's supplemental measures such as FFO and net operating income (\"NOI\") to evaluate the investment quality of REITs as real estate companies, it would be helpful to generalist investors for REITs as real estate companies to also present EBITDAre as a more widely known and understood supplemental measure of performance. EBITDAre is intended to be a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure that is independent of a company's capital structure and will provide a uniform basis to measure the enterprise value of a company compared to other REITs.\nEBITDAre, as defined by Nareit, is calculated as net income or loss, excluding: (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) loss and gains on disposition of property, (v) impairment and (vi) adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. We believe EBITDAre is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results.\nWe make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results.\nHotel EBITDA\nWith respect to hotel EBITDA, we believe that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. We believe the property-level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and effectiveness of the third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis.\nWe caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative measure of our net income (loss) or operating performance. EBITDA, EBITDAre adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel EBITDA may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre, and hotel EBITDA can enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily a better indicator of any trend as compared to a comparable GAAP measure such as net income (loss). Above, we include a quantitative reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDAre, adjusted EBITDAre and hotel EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income (loss) and operating income (loss).\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/summit-hotel-properties-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300641287.html\nSOURCE Summit Hotel Properties, Inc.",
