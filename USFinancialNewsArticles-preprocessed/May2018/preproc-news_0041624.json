(NASDAQ:CATS), a leading AI and techno l ogy-enabled healthcare company, today reported its financial results for the first quarter The Company provides big data-based analytics and predictive-modeling-driven healthcare services to health plans and their members through its OnTrak™ solution.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Business Highlights\nCatasys’ enrollment for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 74% year over year Catasys’ outreach pool of eligible members continued to rapidly increase due to new program launches with two large insurers and expansions with two existing health plan partners in early 2018. By June 2018, the Company expects its outreach pool to be at approximately 36,000, 44% higher than at the end of 2017. New customer launches continue to take approximately 12 months to reach an annual 20% enrollment rate. One year after launch, the Company generally enrolls in excess of 20% of its outreach pool. Catasys receives approximately $6,500 per enrolled member. January 2018 – Expanded OnTrak-HC to Illinois, representing the second state with this customer which is the fourth largest health insurance plan in the country February 2018 – Launched enrollment of OnTrak-Ci program in Tennessee with another top 10 health insurer, representing the fourth national health plan to launch OnTrak March 2018 – Expanded OnTrak-HA with a leading regional health insurer in Illinois, making OnTrak-HA available to eligible commercial and Medicare members with anxiety and depression March 2018 – Launched enrollment of OnTrak-H solution with leading national health plan partner in 16 states The OnTrak program is currently available through six health plans in 19 states.\n2018 Guidance\nCatasys reiterates its expectation to report annual billings (amount invoiced in a particular period pursuant to existing contracts based on enrolled members) of $20.0 million based solely on the current outreach pool of eligible members, finishing the year at an approximate $25.0 million billings annual run rate. This guidance does not include any additional new contracts, subsequent launches, additional new expansions within existing contracts or increases in the Company’s outreach pool above the end of 2017 levels.\nManagement Commentary\nMr. Rick Anderson, President and COO of Catasys, stated, “Enrollment trends continued their positive trajectory as we entered 2018, resulting in higher billings in the first quarter. With our outreach pool of eligible members continuing to increase, we anticipate steady growth in enrollments in the coming quarters. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we expanded and launched several of our programs with existing and new health insurance partners. Our expansions of OnTrak in Illinois further validate this program’s ability to improve member health and lower healthcare costs for our health plan partners. During the quarter, we also launched enrollment of the OnTrak solution specifically addressing substance use disorders with a leading national health plan partner in 16 states, further increasing our outreach pool of eligible members. We expect to see additional program expansions with existing health plan partners, as well as enrollment launches with new partners as we progress further into 2018. We anticipate these expansions and launches to provide the Company’s primary business growth drivers in 2018.”\nOutlook for 2018\nMr. Terren Peizer, Chairman and CEO of Catasys, stated, “Billings for the first quarter of 2018 were in line with our expectations, and in April, we significantly exceeded our internal projections, as a result of strong enrollment. With ongoing program expansions and enrollment launches, we are cautiously optimistic that our outreach pool of eligible members will expand significantly throughout the year. Commensurate with this outreach expansion, we expect enrollment growth will continue to accelerate as the year progresses. We will continue to invest in the expansion of our platform, as well as data-driven analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities, to effectively serve a growing customer base, further driving revenue growth.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Review\nBillings\nCatasys’ billings increased 33% to $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, from $2.3 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher enrollment in new plans and expansions in existing plans. Billings increased approximately 7% sequentially from $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding a bi-annual savings share performance payment from one customer, billings were up 20% sequentially. Catasys contracts are generally designed to provide cash fees on a monthly basis based on enrolled members.\nRevenues\nRevenue increased 5% to $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, from $1.8 million during the same period in 2017. The increase was driven by the launch of enrollment with two new health plans and continued enrollment growth from existing plans, resulting in a net increase in the number of members enrolled in our OnTrak solution during the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same period in 2017. Enrolled members as of March 31, 2018, were 74% greater than at March 31, 2017.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue was $1.7 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of 42% from $2.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was driven by a $1.9 million one-time catch-up to retained earnings as the Company adopted the new revenue accounting standard for services delivered in prior years, partially offset by revenue recognized for services delivered and new billings for services to be delivered in future quarters. When fees are received in advance, deferred revenue is recognized over the period the member is enrolled. Catasys has historically been able to record its deferred revenue as actual revenue during the course of the business cycle, except for cases where members terminated from the program early.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $6.2 million, compared to $4.0 million in the prior-year period. This increase was mainly due to increased costs of healthcare services to support growth; incremental investments in data science, IT and software development to drive growth and efficiency; and approximately $0.3 million related to non-cash stock option expense compared to the prior-year period. Cost of healthcare services consists primarily of salaries for Catasys’ care coaches and outreach specialists, healthcare provider claims payments to Catasys’ network of physicians and psychologists, and fees charged by third party administrators for processing these claims. In addition, the Company hires staff in preparation for anticipated future customer contracts and corresponding increases in members eligible for OnTrak. The costs for such staff are included in Cost of Healthcare Services during training and ramp-up periods.\nNet Income (Loss)\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net loss was $4.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $21.8 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. The improvement in net loss was a result of the prior-year period being impacted by $5.2 million in change in fair value of warrant liability as well as $10.6 million in change in fair value of derivative liability resulting from the issuance of convertible debentures in July 2015, which converted into common stock in April 2017.\nConference Call – May 15, 2018 – 4:30 pm ET\nThe Company will host a conference call/webcast on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 4:30 pm ET/1:30 pm PT.
