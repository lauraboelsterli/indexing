Strong market conditions combined with the expansion of our sales effort drove sales up 14% to $11.0 million,” commented Dr. Christopher L. Coccio, Chairman and CEO. “Additionally, the strong operating leverage inherent in our business was evident in our measurable margin expansion.”\nDr. Coccio added, “We believe our continued implementation of LEAN manufacturing practices this past year were apparent in our strong cash generation. Our productivity focus has resulted in a significant reduction in inventory requirements and is also increasingly contributing to improved operating efficiencies and cycle time reduction.”\nCash and cash equivalents increased $1.5 million to $6.4 million, even as we continued to invest in engineering as well as product and market development.”\nDr. Coccio concluded, “Based on our current backlog, shipments, and proposals, we expect stronger sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with last year’s first quarter. In fact, we anticipate solid growth in revenue for fiscal year 2019 from our new products and applications, supported by the strong global economy and fiscal improvements in the U.S.”\nFiscal 2018 Review ($’s in thousands, except per share data)\nFiscal Year Ended February 28, Change 2018 2017 $ % Net Sales $11,008 $9,635 $1,373 14% Gross Profit $5,296 $4,363 $933 21% Gross Margin 48.1% 45.3% Operating Income (Loss) $382 ($179) $560 - Operating Margin 3.5% (1.9%) Net Income (Loss) $368 $96 $273 284.7% Net Margin 3.3% 1.0% Basic Earnings Per Share $0.02 $0.01 Diluted Earnings Per Share $0.02 $0.01 Weighted Average Shares -Basic 14,968,450 14,961,076 Weighted Average Shares - Diluted 15,095,123 15,018,282 The increase in net sales reflects higher volume in Multi-Axis Systems and Integrated Coating Systems due in large part to growth in the medical and alternative energy markets, the latter being led by fuel cell development programs in China. Higher sales to the medical industry was the result of specialized application expertise for polymer and other active nanomaterial coatings on implantable devices.\nIn fiscal 2018, approximately 56% of sales originated outside of the United States and Canada. This compares with 60% in fiscal 2017. The geographic shift was mostly because of higher sales to the U.S. medical market.\nGross margin was up 280 basis points primarily due to product mix, as a greater portion of the sales growth was from higher margin Multi-Axis Systems and Integrated Coating Systems. In addition, fixed overhead costs were marginally down during the fiscal year.\nThe Company continued to invest in new product development and sales and marketing as it addressed market expansion opportunities. However, with strong sales growth, as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were down 250 basis points to 44.6%. As a result, operating margin improved to 3.5%.\nSono-Tek achieved net income of $0.4 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, up $0.01 from the prior year.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Review ($’s in thousands except per share data)\nThree Months Ended February 28, Change 2018 2017 $ % Net Sales $2,894 $2,558 $336 13% Gross Profit $1,350 $1,179 $171 15% Gross Margin 46.7% 46.1% Operating Income (Loss) $94 $29 $65 224% Operating Margin 3.3% 1.1% Net Income (Loss) $103 $67 $36 54% Net Margin 3.6% 2.6% Basic Earnings Per Share $0.01 $0.00 Diluted Earnings Per Share $0.01 $0.00 Weighted Average Shares - Basic 14,981,902 14,961,076 Weighted Average Shares - Diluted 15,181,331 15,058,366 Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Overview\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 million, up $0.8 million, or 75%.
