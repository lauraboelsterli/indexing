An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nCastlight adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018, and used the full retrospective method of adoption. As such, all historical financial information has been adjusted to reflect the impact of adoption of ASC 606. For more information, please refer to a supplemental presentation available on the company's investor relations website at http://ir.castlighthealth.com .\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company is reiterating its previously-issued 2018 outlook.

Follow us on Twitter and LinkedIn and Like us on Facebook .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Castlight Health's financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we also use and provide investors and others with non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance, including non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP other income, net, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share. Non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP other income, net and non-GAAP net loss exclude stock-based compensation, litigation settlement, amortization of intangibles, capitalization and amortization of internal-use software, loss on sublease, gain on sale of investment in related party, expense related to expiration of SAP warrant, changes in fair value of contingent consideration liability, and charges related to the acquisition of Jiff and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors and others, facilitate the analysis of the company's core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods, and can help enhance overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance.\nWe have provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, except that we have not reconciled our non-GAAP operating loss and net loss per share guidance for the full year 2018 to comparable GAAP operating loss and net loss per share guidance because we do not provide guidance for stock-based compensation expense, and capitalization and amortization of internal-use software, which are reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP operating loss. The factors that may impact our future stock-based compensation expense, and capitalization and amortization of internal-use software are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and therefore we are unable to provide such guidance without unreasonable effort. Factors include our market capitalization and related volatility of our stock price and our inability to project the cost or scope of internally produced software.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFurther, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Castlight Health encourages investors and others to review the company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nSafe Harbor For Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements about Castlight Health's expectations, plans, intentions, and strategies, including, but not limited to, statements regarding Castlight Health's 2018 full year projections, our expectations for our future business and financial performance. Statements including words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"will,\" \"continue,\" \"expect,\" or \"future,\" and statements in the future tense are forward-looking statements.
