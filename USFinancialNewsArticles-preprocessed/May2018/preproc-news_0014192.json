    "text": "German Marquez tossed six solid innings Friday night, when the Colorado Rockies scored five runs in the first inning before holding on for an 8-7 win over the New York Mets at Citi Field.\nThe Rockies have won three straight.\nThe Mets dropped their fourth straight game hours after general manager Sandy Alderson announced the team would designate for assignment one-time ace Matt Harvey after Harvey declined to be optioned to the minor leagues. Harvey, who started for the National League in the 2013 All-Star Game at Citi Field, was 0-2 with a 7.00 ERA in eight games (four starts) this season.\nSix of the first seven Rockies to bat in the first inning reached base. Nolan Arenado’s single — the third of three straight singles to open the game — produced Colorado’s first run. After Carlos Gonzalez lofted a sacrifice fly, Trevor Story hit a two-run double. Story could only advance to third on a bloop double by Ian Desmond, but both runners scored on Daniel Castro’s single.\nThe Mets immediately closed the gap to 5-2 in the bottom of the first, when Brandon Nimmo led off with a single and Asdrubal Cabrera followed with a homer. But Marquez (2-3) allowed only one runner to advance beyond first base the rest of the evening. He gave up the two runs on six hits and no walks while striking out eight.\nCharlie Blackmon (second inning) and Tony Wolters (sixth inning) added homers and Desmond delivered an RBI single in the seventh.\nThose insurance runs came in handy when Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the eighth for the Mets, who nearly pulled off a stunning comeback in the ninth. Wilmer Flores doubled leading off the ninth and scored on Amed Rosario’s single. Cabrera tripled Rosario home two batters later. With two outs, Jay Bruce walked and Frazier laced an RBI single, but Wade Davis struck out Michael Conforto to strand the tying run at third base.\nDavis earned his 12th save despite allowing a run on two hits and one walk.\nWheeler (2-2) allowed eight runs on 10 hits and three walks while striking out three over six-plus innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
