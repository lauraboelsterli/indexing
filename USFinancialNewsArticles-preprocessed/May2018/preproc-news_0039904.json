    "text": "LIVINSTON, N.J., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Milestone Scientific Inc. (NYSE:MLSS), a dental and medical company that develops and commercializes a growing portfolio of proprietary injection technologies, today provided a business update and announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nLeonard Osser, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Milestone Scientific, commented, “We have begun to ramp up our commercial efforts around the CompuFlo® Epidural system. We recently hired two experienced sales and marketing executives to spearhead these commercial efforts. Milestone Scientific is now commencing the next phase of our strategy, which involves building out our distribution channels. We have decided to pursue a decentralized sales strategy employing regional distributors with strong physician relationships within their respective territories and clinical specialties. This week we announced that we signed an agreement with a Midwestern distributor. We are targeting distributors with highly specialized sales forces that have the ability to both educate and inform anesthesiologists on the clinical benefits of the CompuFlo® Epidural System. In addition, we are in discussions with distributors around the world and look forward to having the results of our clinical trials published in leading industry journals later this year, which should help drive market adoption. At the end of March, we announced that Health Canada issued a medical device license for the CompuFlo® Epidural System. This is another important step and validation in our global roll-out strategy.”\n“As anticipated, we experienced a short term weakness within our dental division in the first quarter of 2018. This was due to the timing of domestic and international promotions, as well as the timing and revenue recognition of orders from China. Nevertheless, we anticipate our dental division will achieve continued growth and maintain solid margins in 2018. Last week, we announced that The Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in New York will now utilize The Wand® computer assisted anesthesia system for its advanced education program in Pediatric Dentistry. In addition, The Wand® will be incorporated for regular use in the Department of Dental Medicine & Oral Maxillofacial Surgery. We are pleased to see another university utilizing our technology in their curriculum and ongoing practice.”\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, revenues were approximately $1.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the revenue recognition of orders from China and advanced purchases from Henry Schein in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the planned price increase in 2018. The gross profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1.2 million, or 69% of revenue, versus $2.3 million, or 62% of revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $(1.9) million, or $(0.06) per share, versus a net loss of $(0.57) million, or $(0.02) per share, in the prior year.\nConference Call\nMilestone Scientific’s executive management team will host a conference call at 8:00 AM Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 16, 2018 to discuss the Company’s financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, as well as the Company’s corporate progress and other developments.\nThe conference call will be available on the Company’s website at www.milestonescientific.com , or via telephone by dialing toll free 800-263-0877 and entering the pass code: 6112920.
