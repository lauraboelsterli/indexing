But U.S. restrictions on vehicle and component imports could raise the cost of doing business in the country.\nMost of Japan’s major automakers operate plants in the United States and its top three locally manufacture the majority of cars and trucks they sell in the country.\nToyota, Nissan and Honda also produce vehicles in Mexico, while Toyota and Honda also operate plants in Canada, and face risks if an updated NAFTA raises tariffs on vehicles and parts made in those two countries.\nJapan is considering tariffs on U.S. exports worth $409 million in retaliation against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports imposed in March. Japan is the only major U.S. ally which has not received exemptions from the duties, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported on Thursday.\nReporting by Naomi Tajitsu Editing by Christopher Cushing\n ",
