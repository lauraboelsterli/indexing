We are pleased to be among DiversityInc's Noteworthy Companies, especially given the rigorous benchmarking that is associated with DiversityInc's annual awards.\"\nThe DiversityInc Top 50 and Noteworthy Company lists, issued yearly since 2001, recognize the nation's top companies for diversity and inclusion management. These companies excel in such areas as hiring, retaining and promoting women, minorities, people with disabilities, LGBT and veterans.\n\"Events of the past year have demonstrated that decisive ethical leadership is necessary to guide any organization to success,\" notes Luke Visconti, founder and CEO of DiversityInc. \"Successful leaders hold themselves accountable to be culturally competent, a skill that requires constant learning. DiversityInc Top 50 Companies have a metrics-evidenced ability to treat people more fairly than other large companies. They also have a greater-than-average return for their shareholders.\"\nDiversityInc's extensive annual survey yields an empirically driven ranking based on recruitment, talent development, senior leadership commitment and supplier diversity. This year's competition was improved by new survey questions, increased emphasis on fairness over chasing numbers and more sophisticated analysis from DiversityInc's data scientists.
