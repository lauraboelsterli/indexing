    "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viveve Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIVE), a medical technology company focused on women's intimate health, today announced it will report financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 on Thursday, May 10, 2018 after the close of the U.S. financial markets. The company will also host a live conference call and webcast to discuss these financial results and provide an update on corporate and commercial developments. Participating on the call will be Patricia Scheller, chief executive officer and director, Scott Durbin, chief financial officer, and James Atkinson, chief business officer and president. Following management’s formal remarks there will be a question and answer session.\nThe conference call is scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, May 10, 2018. The conference call may be accessed by dialing 1-866-777-2509 (domestic) or 1-412-317-5413 (international) or via live webcast at http://services.choruscall.com/links/vive180510.html . Participants may also pre-register for the conference call at http://dpregister.com/10119472 .\nA recording of the webcast will be posted on the company’s investor relations website following the call at http://ir.viveve.com and will be available online for 90 days.\nAbout Viveve\nViveve Medical, Inc. is a women's intimate health company passionately committed to advancing new solutions to improve women's overall well-being and quality of life. The internationally patented Viveve® System, that delivers the Viveve treatment, incorporates clinically-proven cryogen-cooled, monopolar radiofrequency (CMRF) technology to uniformly deliver volumetric heating while gently cooling surface tissue to generate robust neocollagenesis in a single 30-minute in-office session.\nInternational regulatory approvals and clearances have been received for vaginal laxity and/or improvement in sexual function indications from over 55 countries. Viveve received approval of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March of 2018 to proceed with VIVEVE II, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study to assess improvement of sexual function in women following childbirth. Initiation of the trial is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2018 and if successful, could support a marketing application for a new U.S. commercial indication. Currently, in the United States, the Viveve System is cleared by the FDA for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis.\nViveve has submitted an Investigational Trial Application to the Canadian Ministry of Health and plans to submit an IDE to the FDA to conduct two independent multicenter randomized registration trials (LIBERATE-International and LIBERATE-U.S. respectively) for use of the CMRF device in stress urinary incontinence treatment.\nInControl Products by Viveve are FDA cleared medical devices that treat stress, urge, and mixed incontinence conditions and products to improve pelvic floor strength. Viveve exclusively distributes InControl Medical's products to healthcare providers in the United States.\nFor more information visit Viveve's website at www.viveve.com .\nSafe Harbor Statement\nAll statements in this press release that are not based on historical fact are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
