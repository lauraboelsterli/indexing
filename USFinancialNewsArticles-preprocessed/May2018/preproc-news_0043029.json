    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has personally pushed the postmaster general to double the rates the U.S. Postal Service charges Amazon.com and other companies to ship packages, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing three unnamed sources.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is pictured inside the company's office in Bengaluru, India, April 20, 2018. Picture taken April 20, 2018. REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File Photo Postmaster General Megan Brennan resisted Trumpâ€™s suggestion in private conversations in 2017 and 2018, telling him that package delivery rates are set by contract and reviewed by an independent commission, the sources said, according to the newspaper.\nShe also told Trump, using a set of slides that showed other companies besides Amazon that partner for deliveries, that the arrangements have helped the financially challenged Postal Service, the Post said, citing the sources.\nTrump has repeatedly said without evidence that deliveries for Amazon were costing the service money.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon and the Postal Service declined to comment.\nTrump has criticized both Amazon and Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive officer of the online retailer. Bezos also privately owns The Washington Post, which has published stories that have angered the president.\nTrump has repeatedly said without evidence that deliveries for Amazon were costing the service money. Last month, he ordered the creation of a task force to study the Postal Service and its financial difficulties.\nBig increases in its parcel delivery rates could cost Amazon and other businesses billions, leading to higher prices for consumers.\nReporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Nick Zieminski\n ",
