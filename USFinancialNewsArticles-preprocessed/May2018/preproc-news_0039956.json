    "text": "Following is the text of the address by U.S. Episcopalian bishop, Michael Bruce Curry , at the wedding of Britain's Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle, as released by Kensington Palace on Saturday.\nSet me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. (Song of Songs 8:6-7)\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: \"We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.\"\nThere's power in love. Do not underestimate it. Anyone who has ever fallen in love, knows what I mean. But think about love in any form or experience of it. It actually feels good to be loved, and to express love. There is something right about it. And there's a reason.\nAn old medieval poem says it: \"Where true love is found, God himself is there.\"\nThe Bible, 1 John 4 says it this way. \"Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; Everyone who loves is born of God; Whoever does not love does not know God. For God is love.\" (1 John 4:4-8)\nThere's power in love.\nLove can help and heal when nothing else can.\nLove can lift up and liberate for living when nothing else will.\nAnd the love that brings two people together is the same love that can bind them together. Whether on mountaintops of happiness and through valleys of hardship. Love is strong as death. Its flashes are flashes of fire. Many waters cannot quench love. Love can see you through! There's power in love.\nii\nBut the love of which we speak is not only for couples getting married or just for interpersonal relationships.\nJesus of Nazareth taught us that the way of love is the way to a real relationship with the God who created all of us, and the way to true relationship with each other as children of that one God, as brothers and sisters in God's human family.\nOne scholar said it this way: \"Jesus had founded the most revolutionary movement in human history: a movement built on the unconditional love of God for the world and the mandate to live that love.\" (Charles Marsh's The Beloved Community)\nAnd in so doing, to change lives and the world itself! There's a reason.\nAn old spiritual may suggest why: \"If you cannot preach like Peter, There is a balm in Gilead, And if you cannot pray like Paul, To make the wounded whole, You can tell the love of Jesus, There is a balm in Gilead, How he died to save us all, To heal the sin-sick soul.\"\n\"Just tell the love of Jesus, how he died to save us all.\"\nHe didn't sacrifice his life for himself or anything he could get out of it. He did it for others, for the other, for the good and wellbeing of others. That's love.\nHow does St. Paul say it?\nLove is not jealous, rude, or boastful.\nLove does not insist on its own way.\nLove is unselfish, sacrificial, kind and just.\nLove seeks the good and the well-being of the other.\nLove makes room and space for the other to be.\n(See 1 Corinthians 13:4-7)\nThis love, this is the way of Jesus. And it's game changer.\nImagine our homes and families when this way of love is the way.\nImagine our neighborhoods and communities when love is the way.\nImagine our governments and countries when love is the way.\nImagine business and commerce when this love is the way.\nImagine our world when love is the way.\nNo child would go to bed hungry in such a world as that.\nPoverty would become history in such a world as that.\nThe earth would be as a sanctuary in such a world as that.\nWe would treat one another as children of God, regardless of differences.\nWe would learn how to lay our swords and shields down by the riverside to study war no more.\nThere would be a new heaven, a new earth, a new world. A new and beautiful human family. The very dream of God.\nLove is strong as death. Its flashes are flashes of fire.\nMany waters cannot quench love.\niii\nThe late French Jesuit, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, was at once a scientist, a Roman Catholic priest, a theologian, a true mystic. His was one of the great minds and spirits of the 20th century.\nHe suggested that the discovery and harnessing of fire was one of the great technological discoveries of human history.\nFire made it possible to cook food, thereby reducing the spread of disease.\nFire made it possible to stay warm in cold climates, thereby making human migration possible.\nFire made the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the Industrial Revolution possible.\nIf you drove here this morning, you did so in part because of harnessed fire.\nI flew here from the U.S. due to controlled burn of fire.\nFire is involved in broadcasting this wedding around the world. And we can text, tweet, email, and otherwise socially engage one another due to fire. Fire was one of the great technological discoveries of humanity.\nIn light of this, de Chardin said that if human beings ever harness the energies of love, then for the second time in the history of the world, we will have discovered fire.\nLove is the very fire and energy of real life!\nDr. King was right: \"We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.\"\nMy brother, my sister, God love you, God bless you.\nMy brothers, my sisters, God love you, God bless you.\nAnd may God hold us all In those almighty hands of love.",
