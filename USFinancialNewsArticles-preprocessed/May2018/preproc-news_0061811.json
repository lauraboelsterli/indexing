    "text": "White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump thinks talks with North Korea are going well and is prepared for a summit with Kim Jong Un to take place on June 12, as originally planned.\nSanders said denuclearization must be on the table for the summit to proceed as planned.\n\"We're going to be prepared if it takes place on June 12,\" Sanders said. \"We'll certainly be prepared if it for some reason takes place at a later date â€” we'll be prepared for that as well.\"\nshow chapters US-North Korea not giving up hope on summit 17 Hours Ago | 02:39 The development came after earlier comments from Sanders that the summit with the North Korean leader was still \"expected\" to happen in Singapore. No date was given at the time.\nTrump's engagement with North Korea has been volatile. Last year, he and Kim Jong Un exchanged insults, while North Korea continued testing missiles, some of which flew over the northern regions of Japan.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has sought to improve relations with his country's northern neighbor, and smooth things out between Trump and Kim. Trump's announcement last week that the summit was off came as a surprise to Moon's government, which scrambled to get things back on track.\nSince then, talks between the Trump administration and North Korea have resumed.\nWATCH: White House continues N.
