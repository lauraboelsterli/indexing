    "text": "TOANO, Va., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL), the largest specialty retailer of hardwood flooring in North America, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Results\nNet sales for 2018 increased $13.4 million, or 5.4%, to $261.8 million from $248.4 million in 2017. Net sales in comparable stores increased $7.3 million, or 2.9%, driven by a 4.7% increase in the average sale partially offset by a 1.8% decline in the number of customers invoiced. Merchandise sales in comparable stores grew 0.2% over the same quarter in the prior year. Net sales in non-comparable stores increased $6.1 million. The Company opened five new stores during 2018, bringing the total store count to 398 as of March 31, 2018.\nGross margin increased to 36.3% in 2018 from 34.9% in 2017. This improvement was primarily driven by the higher mix of manufactured products, specifically, engineered vinyl plank, that carry higher gross margins than some of the Company's other product categories. These factors were partially offset by transportation costs, primarily related to rising fuel prices.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses decreased 14.1% in 2018 to $96.4 million from $112.2 million in the comparable period in 2017. The $15.8 million decrease in SG&A was primarily attributable to the absence of the prior year's $18 million accrual in connection with the MDL and Abrasion MDL, discussed in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, that was recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and related incremental legal and professional fees of approximately $3.1 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding these items, which are shown in the attached supplemental schedule, from both periods, Adjusted SG&A (a non-GAAP measure) increased by $1.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year-ago period, driven by modest increases in occupancy, depreciation and legal and professional fees while advertising was essentially flat to the prior-year period.\nOperating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.4 million compared to an operating loss of $25.4 million in the comparable period in 2017. Operating loss as a percent of net sales was (0.5)% and (10.2)% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding the items shown below in the attached supplemental schedule, Adjusted Operating Income (a non-GAAP measure) was $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to an Adjusted Operating Loss (a non-GAAP measure) of $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This improvement was driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin.\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $26.4 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $129 million in liquidity, comprised of cash and cash equivalents and availability under its revolving credit facility. The Company had $26 million outstanding on its revolving credit facility at March 31, 2018, compared to $15 million at December 31, 2017.\nDennis Knowles, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We continued solid execution of our strategy in the first quarter, and made progress across our installation and Pro initiatives, gross margin expansion, and improved SG&A leverage. In addition, we continue to receive positive customer feedback, particularly around our expanded and exclusive product offerings. We remain focused on driving traffic, increasing customer conversion and leveraging our complete service offering as we make beautiful flooring possible and easy for all.\"\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company reaffirmed its full-year 2018 expectations as follows:\nTotal revenue growth\nMid-to-upper single digits\nComp store sales growth\nMid-single digits\nAdjusted operating profit margin (a non-GAAP measure)\nLow-to-mid single digits (2% - 3%)\nStore openings\n20 - 25\nCapital spending\n$15 million to $20 million\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nThe Company plans to host a conference call and audio webcast on May 1, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Although we believe that the expectations expressed in these are reasonable, we cannot promise that our expectations will turn out to be correct. Our actual results could be materially different from and worse than our expectations. With respect to such , we seek the protections afforded by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These risks include, without limitation, the impact on us of any of the following:\ngovernment investigations and related legal proceedings; other current and former legal proceedings; obligations under various settlement agreements and other compliance matters; impact of liquidity in the settlement of legal proceedings; new laws and regulations; impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1); the inability to open new stores; capital expenditures; managing growth; increased transportation costs; damage to our assets; operating stores in Canada and an office in China; managing third-party installers; renewing leases; having sufficient suppliers; our, and our suppliers', compliance with complex and evolving rules, regulations, and laws at the federal, state, and local level; product liability claims; obtaining products from abroad, including effects of antidumping and countervailing duties, as well as other governmental measures aimed at balancing trade; availability of suitable hardwood; changes in economic conditions, both domestic and abroad; sufficient insurance coverage; access to capital; handling of confidential customer information; management information systems disruptions; alternative e-commerce offerings; our advertising strategy; anticipating consumer trends; competition; internal controls; impact of changes in accounting guidance; stock price volatility; and anti-takeover provisions.\nThe Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these statements, which speak only as of the dates on which such statements are made, except as may be required under the federal securities laws. Information regarding these and other additional risks and uncertainties is contained in the Company's other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" section of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP and Other Information\nTo supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: (i) Adjusted SG&A; (ii) Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales; (iii) Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and (iv) Adjusted Operating Profit Margin. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies. The Adjusted Operating Profit margin items guidance cannot be reconciled to GAAP guidance without unreasonable effort because we are unable to accurately forecast the impact of legacy legal and unusual items on operating profit.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's operating performance and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The presented non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management does not believe reflect the Company's core operating performance, which include regulatory and legal settlements and associated legal and operating costs, changes in antidumping and countervailing duties, as such items are outside the control of the Company or are due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature.\nFor further information contact:\nLumber Liquidators Investor Relations\nSteve Calk or Jackie Marcus\nTel: 757.566.7512\nLumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited, in thousands)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nAssets\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n$\n12,606\n$\n19,938\nMerchandise Inventories\n273,411\n262,280\nPrepaid Expenses\n10,028\n9,108\nOther Current Assets\n9,459\n6,670\nTotal Current Assets\n305,504\n297,996\nProperty and Equipment, net\n98,894\n100,491\nGoodwill\n9,693\n9,693\nOther Assets\n2,566\n2,615\nTotal Assets\n$\n416,657\n$\n410,795\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts Payable\n$\n60,701\n$\n67,676\nCustomer Deposits and Store Credits\n43,493\n38,546\nAccrued Compensation\n7,710\n12,101\nSales and Income Tax Liabilities\n5,499\n4,273\nAccrual for MDL and Related Other Matters\n37,193\n36,960\nOther Current Liabilities\n20,061\n18,605\nTotal Current Liabilities\n174,657\n178,161\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\n19,674\n19,787\nRevolving Credit Facility\n26,000\n15,000\nTotal Liabilities\n220,331\n212,948\nStockholders' Equity:\nCommon Stock ($0.001 par value;
