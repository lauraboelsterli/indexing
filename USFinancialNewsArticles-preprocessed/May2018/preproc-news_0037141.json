    "text": "NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Interest rates on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to their highest levels in seven years as a bond market selloff this week propelled 10-year yields to their highest since July 2011, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.\nThirty-year mortgage rates averaged 4.61 percent in the week ended May 17, matching the level last seen in May 2011. A week earlier, 30-year rates averaged 4.55 percent, the U.S. mortgage finance agency said. (Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Bernadette Baum)\n ",
