    "text": "MUMBAI, May 28 (Reuters) - The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has filed an objection to Walmart Inc’s $16 billion merger with e-commerce company Flipkart with the country’s competition watchdog, it said on Monday.\nU.S. retail giant Walmart said this month that it would pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart, which CAIT’s filing said would create unfair competition and result in predatory pricing.\nThe deal is aimed at helping Walmart to compete with Amazon.com in a major growth market, prompting protests from trade and nationalist groups that say small traders will suffer.
