FILE PHOTO: A general view shows The Palace Theatre where the Harry Potter and The Cursed Child parts One and Two play is being staged, in London, Britain July 30, 2016. REUTERS/Neil Hall\nGlenda Jackson and Denzel Washington were nominated for acting Tonys, while “Mean Girls” and “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical” scored the most nominations with 12 each, including for best musical.\n“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” a new play about the grown wizard and his troubled relationship with his teen-aged son, won 10 nominations, including best play and best actor for star Jamie Parker.\nThe more than five-hour, two-part saga earned raves on Broadway after winning record Olivier awards in London last year.\nAnother monumental two-part drama, a revival of “Angels in America,” took 11 nominations, including best play revival, best actor Andrew Garfield and best featured actor for Nathan Lane as closeted conservative firebrand Roy Cohn.\nJackson, marking a return to Broadway after three decades, was nominated for best actress in a revival of Edward Albee’s “Three Tall Women” while Washington won a nod for his star turn in “The Iceman Cometh.” Both shows were nominated for best play revival.\nOther best musical nominees were “The Band’s Visit,” about Egyptian musicians stranded in a small Israeli town, and “Frozen,” adapted from the hit Disney film.\nThe other nominees for best new play were “Junk,”“The Children,”“Farinelli and the King” and John Leguizamo’s one-man show “Latin History for Morons.”\nThe 72nd Tony awards will be presented on June 10 at Radio City Music Hall in New York at a gala ceremony hosted by pop star Josh Groban and singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, who wrote the musical “Waitress.” Reporting by Chris Michaud; Editing by Frances Kerry",
