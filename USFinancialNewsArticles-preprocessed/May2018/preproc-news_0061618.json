Unlike some other ‚Äúdays‚Äù that have been introduced as marketing stunts in recent years, Doughnut Day has been around since 1938 and was originally established as a way to honor The Salvation Army Donut Lassies who served donuts to soldiers during World War I.\nIf you‚Äôre looking to get your hands on one of the circular treats this National Doughnut Day, there are a number of places where you can score a free or discounted one on Friday.\nIn addition to these, your local shop might also be offering deals. Be sure to check out their Twitter and Facebook channels to find out.\nKrispy Kreme: Possible the greatest doughtnut deal out there, Krispy Kreme is offering a free doughnut to all guests, with no purchase necessary.
