Mittal, ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO, said:\n\"The improvement in global steel market dynamics has continued into 2018, supporting an encouraging financial performance in the first quarter. EBITDA increased 13% year-on-year to $2.5 billion, while net income improved by 19% to $1.2 billion. The outlook for 2018 has strengthened as the year has progressed, with the combination of growing demand and supply-side reform driving higher capacity utilisation rates and healthy steel spreads globally. Against this improving backdrop, we continue to focus on structural improvement - through the delivery of our Action 2020 strategic plan - and investing with focus and discipline in opportunities that will drive higher future returns. Our acquisition of Ilva has now received competition clearance from the European Commission and we expect to complete this acquisition by the end of the second quarter 2018.\"\nSustainable development and safety performance\nHealth and safety - Own personnel and contractors lost time injury frequency rate\nHealth and safety performance based on own personnel figures and contractors lost time injury frequency (LTIF) rate of 0.62x in the first quarter of 2018 (\"1Q 2018\") as compared to 0.87x in the fourth quarter of 2017 (\"4Q 2017\"), and 0.80x in the first quarter of 2017 (\"1Q 2017\").\nThe Company's efforts to improve its Health and Safety record remain focused on both further reducing the rate of severe injuries and preventing fatalities.\nOwn personnel and contractors - Frequency rate\nLost time injury frequency rate 1Q 18 4Q 17 3Q 17 2Q 17 1Q 17 Mining 0.34 0.86 1.05 0.58 0.58 NAFTA 0.39 0.76 0.57 0.51 0.85 Brazil 0.41 0.46 0.45 0.37 0.41 Europe 0.77 1.00 0.79 1.08 1.20 ACIS 0.79 0.97 0.42 0.62 0.45 Total Steel 0.66 0.88 0.60 0.75 0.83 Total (Steel and Mining) 0.62 0.87 0.67 0.72 0.80 Key sustainable development highlights for 1Q 2018:\nAchieved status of 'Steel sustainability champion' in new worldsteel award scheme, recognising our high standards in sustainable development data reporting, safety and life cycle analysis. Response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (TFCD) developed, with additional disclosures made in 2017 Integrated Annual Review. Gold standard achieved in Ecovadis sustainability rating - required by many customers.\nAnalysis of results for 1Q 2018 versus 4Q 2017 and 1Q 2017\nTotal steel shipments in 1Q 2018 were 1.7% higher at 21.3Mt as compared with 21.0Mt for 4Q 2017 primarily due to higher steel shipments in NAFTA (+7.9%) and Europe (+5.4%), offset in part by lower steel shipments in ACIS (-6.9%) and by seasonally lower steel shipments in Brazil (-18.7%). Total steel shipments in 1Q 2018 were 1.4% higher as compared with 21.1Mt for 1Q 2017 primarily due to higher steel shipments in Brazil (+11.5%) and Europe (+4.8%) offset in part by lower shipments in ACIS (-6.0%) and NAFTA (-0.9%).\nSales in 1Q 2018 were $19.2 billion as compared to $17.7 billion for 4Q 2017 and $16.1 billion for 1Q 2017. Sales in 1Q 2018 were 8.3% higher as compared to 4Q 2017 primarily due to higher average steel selling prices (+8.2%), higher steel shipments (+1.7%), higher seaborne iron ore reference prices (+13.6%) and higher market-priced iron ore shipments (+8.1%). Sales in 1Q 2018 were 19.3% higher as compared to 1Q 2017 primarily due to higher average steel selling prices (+18.2%), higher steel shipments (+1.4%), and higher market-priced iron ore shipments (+5.5%), offset in part by lower seaborne iron ore reference prices (-13.1%).\nDepreciation for 1Q 2018 was lower at $711 million as compared to $747 million for 4Q 2017. Depreciation was higher in 1Q 2018 as compared to $655 million in 1Q 2017 primarily due to depreciation of the US dollar against the Euro. Full year 2018 depreciation is expected to be approximately $2.9 billion (based on current exchange rates).\nImpairment charges for 1Q 2018 were $86 million related to the agreed remedy package required for the approval of the Votorantim acquisition [4] . Impairment charges for 4Q 2017 were $160 million related to a downward revision of cash flow projections across all steel facilities in ArcelorMittal South Africa. Impairment charges for 1Q 2017 were nil.\nExceptional charges for 1Q 2018 were $146 million related to a provision taken in respect of an ongoing case in which a settlement is pending. Exceptional charges for 4Q 2017 and 1Q 2017 were nil.\nOperating income for 1Q 2018 was $1.6 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in 4Q 2017 and $1.6 billion in 1Q 2017. Operating income for 1Q 2018 and 4Q 2017 were impacted by impairments and exceptional charges as discussed above.\nIncome from associates, joint ventures and other investments for 1Q 2018 was $212 million as compared to $125 million for 4Q 2017, increasing primarily on account of the annual dividend declared by Erdemir ($87 million) and improved performance of Calvert investee. Income from associates, joint ventures and other investments for 1Q 2017 was $86 million and included the dividend from Erdemir ($45 million), positive contribution from Calvert and China Oriental investees offset in part by a loss on dilution of the Company's stake in China Oriental [5] .\nNet interest expense in 1Q 2018 was $164 million as compared to $188 million in 4Q 2017 and $223 million in 1Q 2017. Net interest expense was lower in 1Q 2018 as compared to 4Q 2017 and 1Q 2017, primarily due to debt repayments and lower cost of debt.\nForeign exchange and other net financing losses in 1Q 2018 were $174 million as compared to losses of $261 million for 4Q 2017 and $133 million in 1Q 2017. For 1Q 2018, a foreign exchange gain of $72 million was recorded (as compared to a gain of $83 million for 4Q 2017) mainly on account of a 2.7% depreciation of the USD against the Euro (versus 1.6% depreciation in 4Q 2017). 1Q 2018 includes non-cash mark to market losses of $35 million related to mandatory convertible bond call options following the market price decrease of the underlying shares as compared to gains of $174 million and $158 million in 4Q 2017 and 1Q 2017, respectively. 4Q 2017 includes mark-to-market losses on a derivative relating to a pellet purchase agreement in the US of $0.3 billion. 1Q 2017 was additionally impacted by $159 million in premium accrued on early repayment of bonds (settled in April 2017).\nArcelorMittal recorded an income tax expense of $203 million for 1Q 2018 as compared to an income tax benefit of $119 million for 4Q 2017 and an income tax expense of $283 million in 1Q 2017. The tax benefit of 4Q 2017 is the result of recording a deferred tax asset of $275 million in Luxembourg following expectation of higher future taxable profits.\nArcelorMittal recorded a net income for 1Q 2018 of $1,192 million, or $1.17 earnings per share, as compared to a net income for 4Q 2017 of $1,039 million, or $1.02 earnings per share, and a net income for 1Q 2017 of $1,002 million, or $0.98 earnings per share.\nAnalysis of segment operations\nNAFTA\n(USDm) unless otherwise shown 1Q 18 4Q 17 3Q 17 2Q 17 1Q 17 Sales 4,752 4,296 4,636 4,607 4,458 Operating income 308 155 256 378 396 Depreciation (132) (137) (125) (128) (128) EBITDA 440 292 381 506 524 Crude steel production (kt) 5,864 5,598 5,904 5,762 6,216 Steel shipments (kt) 5,559 5,150 5,655 5,419 5,610 Average steel selling price (US$/t) 779 748 741 760 719 NAFTA segment crude steel production increased by 4.8% to 5.9Mt in 1Q 2018 as compared to 5.6Mt for 4Q 2017, primarily reflecting market improvement in the US and recovery following an operational issue in Mexico in the prior quarter.\nSteel shipments in 1Q 2018 increased by 7.9% to 5.6Mt as compared to 5.2Mt in 4Q 2017, driven primarily by an increase in volumes in flat products on account of improved market fundamentals, following the destock that negatively impacted 4Q 2017.\nSales in 1Q 2018 increased by 10.6% to $4.8 billion as compared to $4.3 billion in 4Q 2017, primarily due to higher steel shipment volumes as discussed above, and higher average steel selling prices +4.3% (for both flat products +3.5% and long products +9.1%).\nOperating income in 1Q 2018 of $308 million was higher as compared to $155 million in 4Q 2017 and lower as compared to $396 million in 1Q 2017.\nEBITDA in 1Q 2018 increased by 50.7% to $440 million as compared to $292 million in 4Q 2017 primarily due to higher steel shipment volumes (+7.9%).

Market-priced coal shipments in 1Q 2018 decreased by 46.0% as compared to 1Q 2017 primarily due to decreased shipments at Kazakhstan.\nOperating income in 1Q 2018 increased to $242 million as compared to $159 million in 4Q 2017, and was lower than $378 million in 1Q 2017.\nEBITDA in 1Q 2018 increased by 30.7% to $349 million as compared to $267 million in 4Q 2017, primarily due to increased seaborne iron ore reference prices (+13.6%) and higher market-priced iron ore shipments (+8.1%). EBITDA in 1Q 2018 was lower as compared to $480 million in 1Q 2017, primarily due to lower seaborne iron ore reference prices (-13.1%), lower coal shipments offset in part by higher market-priced iron ore shipment volumes (+5.5%).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor 1Q 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $160 million as compared to $2,885 million in 4Q 2017 and net cash used in operating activities of $299 million in 1Q 2017. The lower net cash provided by operating activities during 1Q 2018 reflects working capital investment of $1,869 million (which follows the normal seasonal pattern and reflects the effect of higher steel shipments as well as the impact of higher selling prices and higher raw material prices), as compared to working capital release of $1,657 million in 4Q 2017.\nNet cash used in investing activities during 1Q 2018 was $676 million as compared to $931 million during 4Q 2017 and $598 million in 1Q 2017. Capital expenditures decreased to $752 million in 1Q 2018 as compared to $1,036 million in 4Q 2017 and higher as compared to $580 million in 1Q 2017. FY 2018 capital expenditure is expected to be $3.8 billion.\nCash provided by other investing activities in 1Q 2018 of $76 million primarily includes proceeds from the sale of Frydek Mistek in Czech Republic [7] . Cash provided by other investing activities in 4Q 2017 of $105 million primarily included tangible asset disposals and disposal proceeds of US long products (Georgetown).\nNet cash used by financing activities in 1Q 2018 of $33 million includes proceeds from commercial paper issuances ($0.2 billion) offset by $0.2 billion used under the share buyback program. Net cash used by financing activities in 4Q 2017 of $2.2 billion includes $1.2 billion of bonds repurchased in October 2017 pursuant to cash tender offers, $0.6 billion (€540 million) repayment at maturity of the euro 4.625% Notes due November 17, 2017, $644 million used to early redeem in December 2017 the 6.125% Notes due June 1, 2018 and partial repayment of borrowings offset in part by a new $0.4 billion (€300 million) Schuldschein loan in October 2017 and $0.6 billion (€500 million) euro 0.95% bond due January 17, 2023 issued in December 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities for 1Q 2017 of $666 million primarily includes proceeds from the European Investment Bank loan [8] of €350 million ($373 million) and $0.3 billion of commercial paper issuances.\nDuring 1Q 2018, the Company paid dividends of $50 million to minority shareholders in AMMC (Canada) as compared to $21 million in 4Q 2017 (primarily to minority shareholders in Bekaert (Brazil)) and $40 million in 1Q 2017 (primarily to minority shareholders in AMMC (Canada)).\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.3 billion as compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.4 billion at March 31, 2017.\nGross debt increased to $13.4 billion as of March 31, 2018, as compared to $12.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and decreased as compared to $14.5 billion at March 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, net debt increased to $11.1 billion as compared with $10.1 billion at December 31, 2017 primarily due to lower net cash provided by operating activities less capex ($0.6 billion), negative foreign exchange impacts on Euro-denominated debt ($0.2 billion) and share buyback ($0.2 billion). Net debt as of March 31, 2018, was lower as compared to $12.1 billion as of March 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had liquidity of $7.8 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion and $5.5 billion of available credit lines [9] . The $5.5 billion credit facility contains a financial covenant of 4.25x Net debt / EBITDA (as defined in the facility). As of March 31, 2018, the average debt maturity was 5.2 years.\nKey recent developments\nOn May 9, 2018, the Annual General Meeting of shareholders of ArcelorMittal held in Luxembourg approved all resolutions. The results of the votes are posted on www.arcelormittal.com under \"Investors > Equity Investors > Shareholders' meetings > Annual General Meeting of shareholders, 9 May 2018\" where the full documentation regarding the general meeting is available. The shareholders re-elected Mrs. Karyn Ovelmen and Mr. Tye Burt as directors of ArcelorMittal for a term of three years each.\nOn April 13, 2018, ArcelorMittal announced that, as part of the ongoing European Commission ('EC') review into its acquisition of Ilva, it submitted a proposed divestment package to the EC to address concerns the EC has raised during its review. The divestment package includes the following assets: ArcelorMittal Piombino, the Company's only galvanized steel plant in Italy ArcelorMittal Galati, Romania ArcelorMittal Skopje, Macedonia ArcelorMittal Ostrava, Czech Republic ArcelorMittal Dudelange, Luxembourg Hot dipped galvanizing lines 4 and 5 in Flemalle; hot-rolled pickling, cold rolling and tin packaging lines in Tilleur, all of which are in Liège, Belgium.\nOn May 7, 2018, ArcelorMittal announced that it has been granted merger clearance by the EC for AM Investco Italy S.r.l. (AM Investco)'s proposed acquisition of Ilva S.p.A (Ilva). EC merger clearance follows the conclusion of the Commission's Phase II investigation into the proposed acquisition of Ilva, and has been granted on the basis that the Company has committed to dispose of assets in the divestment package. Approval by the EC is a significant milestone in the transaction to acquire Ilva and represents a major step towards closing the deal, which is now expected end of June 2018.\nIn February 2018, the Brazilian antitrust authority - CADE - approved the acquisition, by ArcelorMittal, of the entire representative shares of Votorantim Siderurgia's equity capital. The closing of the transaction occurred on April 1, 2018, Votorantim Siderurgia, under the new corporate name of ArcelorMittal Sul Fluminense, became a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal Brasil. The combination of the businesses will result in a long product steel producer with annual crude steel capacity of 5.1 million metric tonnes. CADE's approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain divestment commitments: ArcelorMittal Brasil agreed to dispose of its two production sites of Cariacica and Itaúna, as well as some drawing equipment, which disposal was completed early May 2018. This acquisition aims to create value through cost, logistical and operational synergies totaling ~$110 million per annum.\nOn April 12, 2018, ArcelorMittal published a convening notice for its Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders, which will be held on May 16, 2018 at 11.00 a.m. CET at the company's registered office, 24-26, Boulevard d'Avranches, L-1160 in Luxembourg. The convening notice, the amended draft of the articles of association, the voting forms and all other meeting documentation are available on ArcelorMittal's website under \"Investors - Equity investors - Shareholders' meetings - Extraordinary General Meeting May 16, 2018\".\nOn March 28, 2018, ArcelorMittal announced the completion of its share buyback program. ArcelorMittal repurchased 7 million shares for a total value of approximately €184 million (equivalent USD 226 million) at an approximate average price per share of €26.34. All details are available on its website on: http://corporate.arcelormittal.com/investors/equity-investors/share-buyback .\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company's subsidiary ArcelorMittal India Private Limited (AMIPL) submitted a Resolution Plan for Essar Steel India Limited (Essar Steel) which set out a detailed plan to restore Essar Steel's fortunes and enable it to realise its full potential and participate in the anticipated steel demand growth in India. On March 2, 2018, ArcelorMittal signed a joint venture formation agreement with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMC) in relation to its offer to acquire Essar Steel.\nThis will involve a multi staged approach: initial steps will be to stabilize the operation and increase production from the current 5.6Mtpa level to 8.5Mtpa in the medium term and ultimately have long term aspirations to produce between 15-20Mtpa.\nOn February 1, 2018, Standard and Poors Global Ratings (S&P) raised its long-term corporate credit rating on ArcelorMittal to 'BBB-' from 'BB+' and assigned a stable outlook. At the same time, S&P raised the short-term corporate rating to 'A-3' from 'B' and raised its issue-level ratings on ArcelorMittal's unsecured debt to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'. Because these ratings are now investment grade, S&P has withdrawn the associated recovery ratings.\nRecent filings\nDuring May 2018, ArcelorMittal published the 2017 investor relations fact book. The report is available on http://corporate.arcelormittal.com under \"Investors > Financial reports > Factbook.\"\nOn March 12, 2018, ArcelorMittal published the statutory financial statements of ArcelorMittal parent company for the year ended December 31, 2017. These financial statements have been filed with the electronic database of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange ( www.bourse.lu ) and are available on http://corporate.arcelormittal.com under \"Investors > Financial reports > Annual reports\".\nOn February 16, 2018, ArcelorMittal published its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2017. The report has been filed with the electronic database of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange ( www.bourse.lu ) and are available on http:// corporate.arcelormittal.com under \"Investors > Financial reports > Annual reports\".\nOn February 15, 2018, ArcelorMittal filed its Annual Report 2017 on Form 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The report is available on ArcelorMittal's website http://corporate.arcelormittal.com under \"Investors > Financial reports > SEC filings\".\nOutlook and guidance\nThe following global apparent steel consumption (\"ASC\") figures reflect the Company's 2018 estimates, which remain unchanged from those presented in connection with the full year 2017 results announcement in January 2018.\nMarket conditions are favorable. The demand environment remains positive (as evidenced by the continued high readings from the ArcelorMittal weighted PMI), and steel spreads remain healthy.\nGlobal apparent steel consumption (\"ASC\") is estimated to have expanded by +3.2% in 2017. Based on the current economic outlook, ArcelorMittal expects global ASC to grow further in 2018 by between +1.5% to +2.5%. By region: ASC in US is expected to grow +1.5% to +2.5% in 2018 (including pipes and tubes) (versus +1.3% in 2017 (excluding pipes and tubes)) driven by demand in machinery and construction. In Europe, we expect underlying demand to continue to grow, supported by the strength of machinery and construction end markets, and overall demand is expected to be +1.0% to +2.0% in 2018 (versus growth of +1.5% in 2017). In Brazil, ASC is expected to grow by +6.5% to +7.5% in 2018 (an acceleration of growth versus +4.6% in 2017), as the economy starts to turnaround with improved consumer confidence and pick up in longs as construction recovers. In the CIS, ASC is expected to grow +2.0% to +3.0% in 2018 (a moderation of growth versus +5.4% in 2017). In China, ASC grew by +3.5% in 2017, higher than our initial expectations. Overall demand is expected to remain close to this level in 2018 (between -0.5% to +0.5%), as the anticipated weakness in the real estate sector is expected to be offset in part by robust infrastructure and automotive end markets. Nevertheless, ex-China ASC is expected to grow by approximately +3.0% to +4.0% in 2018 (versus +2.8% in 2017), which supports global ASC growth of +1.5% to +2.5% in 2018 (as compared to growth of ~3.2% in 2017).\nThe Company expects cash needs of the business (excluding working capital investment) to increase in 2018 to approximately $5.6 billion from $4.4 billion in 2017. The expected increase in capex to $3.8 billion in 2018 from $2.8 billion in 2017 largely reflects the Mexico hot strip mill project and anticipated ILVA capex as well as additional strategic projects ($0.3 billion, including further investment to enhance downstream optimization in Europe and HAV in Canada and Europe). Net interest is expected to decline to $0.6 billion from $0.8 billion in 2017 reflecting the benefits of liability management exercises completed in 2017. Other cash needs are expected to increase to $1.2 billion from $0.8 billion in 2017, primarily on account of higher expected cash taxes due to timing impacts.\nWorking capital requirements for 2018 are expected to be driven by market conditions.\nThe Company will continue to prioritize deleveraging and believes that $6 billion is an appropriate net debt target that will sustain investment grade metrics even at the low point of the cycle. The Company will continue to invest in opportunities that will enhance future returns. By investing in these opportunities with focus and discipline, the cash flow generation potential of the Company is expected to increase. The Board has agreed on a new dividend policy which has been approved by the shareholders at the AGM on May 9, 2018. Given the current deleveraging bias, dividends will begin at $0.10/share in 2018 (paid from 2017 results [10] ). Once it achieves net debt at or below its target, the Company is committed to returning a portion of annual FCF to shareholders.\nArcelorMittal Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 1\nMar 31, Dec 31, Mar 31, In millions of U.S. dollars 2018 2017 2017 ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents (C) 2,260 2,786 2,402 Trade accounts receivable and other 5,012 3,863 3,971 Inventories 18,952 17,986 16,393 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 2,653 1,931 2,251 Assets held for sale [11] 224 179 126 Total Current Assets 29,101 26,745 25,143 Goodwill and intangible assets 5,759 5,737 5,716 Property, plant and equipment 37,031 36,971 35,049 Investments in associates and joint ventures 5,231 5,084 4,470 Deferred tax assets 7,170 7,055 5,931 Other assets 3,671 3,705 2,182 Total Assets 87,963 85,297 78,491 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt (B) 4,084 2,785 3,452 Trade accounts payable and other 13,494 13,428 12,043 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 5,389 5,147 4,853 Liabilities held for sale 11 42 50 38 Total Current Liabilities 23,009 21,410 20,386 Long-term debt, net of current portion (A) 9,309 10,143 11,047 Deferred tax liabilities 2,605 2,684 2,626 Other long-term liabilities 10,349 10,205 10,503 Total Liabilities 45,272 44,442 44,562 Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent 40,608 38,789 31,743 Non-controlling interests 2,083 2,066 2,186 Total Equity 42,691 40,855 33,929 Total Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity 87,963 85,297 78,491 Net Debt (D=A+B-C) 11,133 10,142 12,097 ArcelorMittal Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations 1\nThree months ended In millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise shown Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Sales 19,186 17,710 17,639 17,244 16,086 Depreciation (B) (711) (747) (690) (676) (655) Impairment (B) (86) (160) -

The plan involved idling redundant operations including the #1 aluminize line, 84\" hot strip mill (HSM), and #5 continuous galvanizing line (CGL) and No.2 steel shop (idled in 2Q 2017) whilst making further planned investments totalling ~$200 million including a new caster at No.3 steel shop (completed in 4Q 2016), restoration of the 80\" hot strip mill and Indiana Harbor finishing are ongoing. The full project scope is expected to be completed in 2018.\nb) On September 28, 2017, ArcelorMittal announced a major US$1 billion, three-year investment programme at its Mexican operations, which is focussed on building ArcelorMittal Mexico's downstream capabilities, sustaining the competitiveness of its mining operations and modernising its existing asset base. The programme is designed to enable ArcelorMittal Mexico to meet the anticipated increased demand requirements from domestic customers, realise in full ArcelorMittal Mexico's production capacity of 5.3 million tonnes and significantly enhance the proportion of higher-value added products in its product mix, in-line with the Company's Action 2020 strategic plan. The main investment will be the construction of a new hot strip mill. Construction will take approximately three years and, upon completion, will enable ArcelorMittal Mexico to produce c. 2.5 million tonnes of flat rolled steel, long steel c. 1.8 million tonnes and the remainder made up of semi-finished slabs. Coils from the new hot strip mill will be supplied to domestic, non-auto, general industry customers. The project commenced late 4Q 2017 and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020. The Company expects capital expenditures of approximately $350 million with respect to this programme in 2018.\nc) Investment in ArcelorMittal Dofasco (Canada) to modernise the hot strip mill. The project is to install two new state of the art coilers and runout tables to replace three end of life coilers. The strip cooling system will be upgraded and include innovative power cooling technology to improve product capability. The project is expected to be completed in 2020.\nd) Although the Monlevade wire rod expansion project and Juiz de Fora rebar expansion were completed in 2015, the Juiz de Fora melt shop project is currently on hold and is expected to be completed upon Brazil domestic market recovery.\ne) ArcelorMittal Liberia has moved ore extraction from its depleting DSO (direct shipping ore) deposit at Tokadeh to the nearby, lower impurity DSO Gangra deposit with planned production of 5Mt in 2018. The Gangra mine, haul road and related existing plant and equipment upgrades have now been completed. Following a period of exploration cessation caused by the onset of Ebola, ArcelorMittal Liberia recommenced drilling for DSO resource extensions in late 2015. During 2016, the operation at Tokadeh was right-sized to focus on its \"natural\" Atlantic markets. The originally planned phase 2 project of 15Mtpa of concentrate sinter fine ore product was delayed in August 2014 due to the declaration of force majeure by contractors following the Ebola virus outbreak, and then reassessed following rapid iron ore price declines over the ensuing period since.\nNow that mining at the Gangra deposit has commenced, ArcelorMittal Liberia has launched a feasibility study to identify the optimal concentration solution in a phased approach for utilising the significant lower grade resources at Tokadeh. The results of the feasibility study are anticipated at the end of 2018.\nArcelorMittal remains committed to Liberia where it operates a full value chain of mine, rail and port and where it has been operating the mine on a DSO basis since 2011. The Company believes that ArcelorMittal Liberia presents a strong, competitive source of product ore for the international market based on continuing DSO mining and subsequent shift to a high grade, long-term sinter feed concentration phase.\nAppendix 3: Debt repayment schedule as of March 31, 2018\nDebt repayment schedule (USD billion) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 >=2023 Total Bonds 0.5 0.9 1.9 1.4 1.6 2.8 9.1 Commercial paper 1.3 - - - - - 1.3 Other loans 1.2 0.4 0.2 0.4 0.2 0.6 3.0 Total gross debt 3.0 1.3 2.1 1.8 1.8 3.4 13.4 Appendix 4: Terms and definitions\nUnless indicated otherwise, or the context otherwise requires, references in this earnings release report to the following terms have the meanings set out next to them below:\nAverage steel selling prices: calculated as steel sales divided by steel shipments.\nCash and cash equivalents: represents cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments.\nCapex: represents the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles.\nEBITDA: operating income plus depreciation, impairment expenses and exceptional income/ (charges).\nEBITDA/tonne: calculated as EBITDA divided by total steel shipments.\nExceptional income / (charges): relate to transactions that are significant, infrequent or unusual and are not representative of the normal course of business of the period.\nForeign exchange and other net financing (loss) / gain: include foreign currency exchange impact, bank fees, interest on pensions, impairments of financial instruments, revaluation of derivative instruments and other charges that cannot be directly linked to operating income/(loss).\nFree cash flow (FCF) : Refers to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capex.\nGross debt : long-term debt, plus short-term debt (including those held as part of liabilities held for sale).\nLiquidity: Cash and cash equivalents plus available credit lines excluding back-up lines for the commercial paper program.\nLTIF: lost time injury frequency rate equals lost time injuries per 1,000,000 worked hours, based on own personnel and contractors.\nMT: Refers to million metric tonnes\nMarket-priced tonnes: represent amounts of iron ore and coal from ArcelorMittal mines that could be sold to third parties on the open market.

The interim financial information included in this announcement has been also prepared in accordance with IFRS applicable to interim periods, however this announcement does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in International Accounting Standard 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". The numbers in this press release have not been audited. The financial information and certain other information presented in a number of tables in this press release have been rounded to the nearest whole number or the nearest decimal. Therefore, the sum of the numbers in a column may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column. In addition, certain percentages presented in the tables in this press release reflect calculations based upon the underlying information prior to rounding and, accordingly, may not conform exactly to the percentages that would be derived if the relevant calculations were based upon the rounded numbers. This press release also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. ArcelorMittal presents EBITDA, and EBITDA/tonne, which are non-GAAP financial measures and defined in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations, as additional measurements to enhance the understanding of operating performance. ArcelorMittal believes such indicators are relevant to describe trends relating to cash generating activity and provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of the Company's operating results to the operating results of other companies. ArcelorMittal also presents net debt as an additional measurement to enhance the understanding of its financial position, changes to its capital structure and its credit assessment. ArcelorMittal also presents free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash flows, because it believes it is a useful supplemental measure for evaluating the strength of its cash generating capacity. Non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with and not as an alternative for, ArcelorMittal's financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. Such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures applied by other companies.\n[2] On March 28, 2018, ArcelorMittal announced the completion of its share buyback program. ArcelorMittal has repurchased 7 million shares for a total value of approximately €184 million (equivalent $226 million) at an approximate average price per share of €26.34 (equivalent to $32.36)\n[3] At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on May 10, 2017, the shareholders approved a share consolidation based on a ratio 1:3, whereby every three shares were consolidated into one share (with a change in the number of shares outstanding and the accounting par value per share). The figures presented for the basic and diluted earnings per share reflect this change.\n[4] On April 20, 2018, following the approval by the Brazilian antitrust authority - CADE of the combination of ArcelorMittal Brasil's and Votorantim's long steel businesses in Brazil subject to the fulfilment of divestment commitments, ArcelorMittal Brasil agreed to dispose of its two production sites of Cariacica and Itaúna, as well as some drawing equipment of ArcelorMittal Brasil and ArcelorMittal Sul-Fluminense.

In January 2018, China Oriental issued 192 million additional shares in connection with the exercise of all outstanding stock option plans.
