    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 12:28 PM / in 36 minutes Germany's AfD decides not to expel critic of Holocaust memorial Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nBERLIN (Reuters) - A senior member of the far-right Alternative for Germany party will not be expelled for criticizing the Holocaust memorial in Berlin, the party said on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: Bjoern Hoecke of the right-wing Alternative for Germany stands outside the former Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald near Weimar, Germany, January 27, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo/File Photo\nMember of the AfD had voted to expel Bjoern Hoecke after a speech in which he criticized the memorial in Berlin to victims of the Nazi Holocaust as a “monument of shame”. AfD leaders reprimanded Hoecke, who is the party head in the eastern state of Thuringia, for damaging the party’s image.\nThe decision by the AfD’s internal arbitration court in Thuringia, already made on Monday, puts an end to legal proceedings that have been going on since February last year.\nThe arbitration court decided that Hoecke’s speech did not indicate an allegiance to Nazi ideology and that he had not violated the party’s regulations. It found no grounds for his expulsion.
