The facility matures in April 2021, subject to certain one-year extension options. This facility increases RSO's financing capacity to $900.0 million from $650.0 million.\nDiscontinued Operations\nPursuant to the Plan, the assets and liabilities of Primary Capital Mortgage, LLC (\"PCM\") and RSO's middle market lending segment, NEW NP, LLC, were reclassified to held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, PCM sold its remaining loans held for sale generating total cash proceeds of $1.9 million.

The denominators for the calculations are 31,184,609 and 30,946,819 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. (2) Per share amount calculation includes the impact of 237,790 additional shares. (3) Common stock book value is calculated as total stockholders' equity of $550.2 million less preferred stock equity of $116.0 million at March 31, 2018. Common stock book value includes $13.4 million of unamortized discount resulting from the value of the conversion option on RSO's convertible senior notes. The convertible senior notes' discounts will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of each note issuance. At March 31, 2018, common stock book value excluding this item would have been $420.9 million, or $13.50 per common share.\nTotal stockholders' equity at March 31, 2018, which measures equity before accounting for non-controlling interests, was $550.2 million, of which $116.0 million was attributable to preferred stock. Total stockholders' equity at December 31, 2017 was $671.5 million, of which $223.8 million was attributable to preferred stock.\nPreferred Stock Redemptions\nIn the first quarter of 2018, RSO redeemed all of its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock for $166.8 million. These redemptions eliminated approximately $13.7 million of preferred stock dividends on an annual basis, or $0.44 per common share.\nCorporate Name Change\nEffective at 5:00 p.m. (EDT) on May 25, 2018, RSO will change its name to \"Exantas Capital Corp.\" The Company's common stock and 8.625% Fixed-to-Floating Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"preferred stock\") will continue to be listed on the NYSE, and the Company anticipates that on May 29, 2018 its common stock will begin trading under the symbol \"XAN\" and its preferred stock will begin trading under the symbol \"XAN PrC.\" The new CUSIP number for the Company's common stock following the name change will be 30068N105, and the new CUSIP number for its preferred stock will be 30068N402.\nInvestment Portfolio\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and net carrying amount of RSO's investment portfolio at March 31, 2018, classified by asset type (in thousands, except percentages and amounts in footnotes):\nAt March 31, 2018 Amortized\nCost Net Carrying\nAmount Percent of\nPortfolio Weighted\nAverage\nCoupon Core Assets: CRE whole loans (1)(2) $ 1,362,520 $ 1,357,991 80.23 % 6.34 % CRE preferred equity investment (2) 19,008 19,008 1.12 % 11.50 % CMBS (3) 251,343 250,746 14.81 % 4.36 % Total Core Assets 1,632,871 1,627,745 96.16 % Non-Core Assets: Structured notes (4) 1,218 164 0.01 % N/A (10) Investments in unconsolidated entities (5) 4,891 4,891 0.29 % N/A (10) Direct financing leases (6) 824 89 0.01 % 5.66 % Legacy CRE loans held for sale (7)(8) 63,882 57,341 3.39 % 1.71 % Middle market loan held for sale (7)(9) 13,837 1,978 0.12 % — % Life settlement contracts (7) 177 177 0.01 % N/A (10) Property available-for-sale (7) 117 117 0.01 % N/A (10) Total Non-Core Assets 84,946 64,757 3.84 % Total investment portfolio $ 1,717,817 $ 1,692,502 100.00 % (1) Net carrying amount includes an allowance for loan losses of $4.5 million at March 31, 2018.\n(2) Classified as CRE loans on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3) Classified as investment securities available-for-sale on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(4) Classified as investment securities, trading on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(5) Classified as investments in unconsolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(6) Net carrying amount includes an allowance for lease losses of $735,000 at March 31, 2018.\n(7) Classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(8) Net carrying amount includes a lower of cost or market value adjustment of $6.5 million at March 31, 2018.\n(9) Net carrying amount includes the lower of cost or market value adjustment of $11.9 million at March 31, 2018.\n(10) There are no stated rates associated with these investments.\nSupplemental Information\nThe following schedules of reconciliations and supplemental information at March 31, 2018 are included at the end of this release:\nSchedule I - Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Core Earnings;\nSchedule II - Summary of Securitization Performance Statistics;\nSchedule III - Strategic Plan Update;\nSchedule IV - CRE Loan Activities; and\nSchedule V - Supplemental Information.\nAbout Resource Capital Corp.\nResource Capital Corp. is a real estate investment trust that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial mortgage loans and commercial real estate-related debt investments.\nThe Company is externally managed by Resource Capital Manager, Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) TO CORE EARNINGS\n(unaudited)\nRSO uses Core Earnings as a non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate its operating performance. RSO previously used Adjusted Funds from Operations as a non-GAAP measure of operating performance.\nCore Earnings exclude the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that RSO believes are not indicative of its current CRE loan portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations. Core Earnings exclude income (loss) from all non-core assets, such as commercial finance, middle market lending, residential mortgage lending, certain legacy CRE loans and other non-CRE assets designated as assets held for sale at the initial measurement date. (1)\nCore Earnings, for reporting purposes, is defined as GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) unrealized gains and losses, (iii) non-cash provisions for loan losses, (iv) non-cash impairments on securities, (v) non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings, (vi) net income or loss from a limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date, (vii) net income or loss from non-core assets, (2)(3) (viii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (ix) foreign currency gains or losses and (x) income or loss from discontinued operations. Core Earnings may also be adjusted periodically to exclude certain one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash items.\nAlthough pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement RSO calculates incentive compensation using Core Earnings excluding incentive fees payable to the Manager, beginning with the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 RSO includes incentive fees payable to the Manager in Core Earnings for reporting purposes.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or as a measure of liquidity under GAAP. RSO's methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from methodologies used by other companies to calculate similar supplemental performance measures, and, accordingly, its reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to similar performance measures used by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from GAAP net (loss) income allocable to common shares to Core Earnings allocable to common shares for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data): For the Three\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net (loss) income allocable to common shares - GAAP $ (12,582 ) $ 2,700 Adjustment for realized gain on CRE assets — — Net (loss) income allocable to common shares - GAAP, adjusted (12,582 ) 2,700 Reconciling items from continuing operations: Non-cash equity compensation expense 967 788 Non-cash (recovery of) provision for CRE loan losses (799 ) 860 Realized loss on core activities (4) (2,167 ) — Non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings 778 414 Net income from limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date (1) — (358 ) Income tax (benefit) expense from non-core investments (2)(3) (32 ) 1,499 Net realized loss on non-core assets (2)(3) 215 — Net loss (income) from non-core assets (3) 397 (1,429 ) Reconciling items from discontinued operations and CRE assets: Net interest income on legacy CRE loans held for sale (322 ) (1,324 ) Realized gain on liquidation of CRE loans — (6,954 ) Fair value adjustments on legacy CRE loans held for sale 4,672 — Net loss (income) from other non-CRE investments held for sale 478 (25 ) (Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes (247 ) 561 Core Earnings allocable to common shares (5) (8,642 ) (3,268 ) Reconciling items for nonrecurring activities: Loss on redemption of Series B Preferred Stock 7,482 — Realized loss on core activities 2,167 — Core Earnings allocable to common shares, adjusted $ 1,007 $ (3,268 ) Weighted average common shares - diluted 31,111 30,752 Core Earnings per common share - diluted (5) $ (0.28 ) $ (0.11 ) Core Earnings per common share, adjusted - diluted $ 0.03 $ (0.11 )\n(1) Initial measurement date is December 31, 2016. (2) Income tax expense from non-core investments and net realized gain on non-core assets are components of net income or loss from non-core assets. (3) Non-core assets are investments and securities owned by RSO at the initial measurement date in (i) commercial finance, (ii) middle market lending, (iii) residential mortgage lending, (iv) legacy CRE loans designated as held for sale and (v) other non-CRE assets included in assets held for sale. (4) Payment of pending settlement of a securities litigation, previously accrued in 2017. (5) Core Earnings include a non-recurring charge of $7.5 million, or $(0.24) per common share-diluted, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 in connection with the redemption of the remaining Series B Preferred Stock.
