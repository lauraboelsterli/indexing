    "text": "May 30 (Reuters) - Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded the credit rating of Australian wealth manager AMP Ltd’s life insurance unit, citing growing competitive challenges, but affirmed its holding company’s debt ratings.\nMoody’s downgraded AMP Life’s Insurance Financial credit rating to Aa3 from Aa2, citing the challenging operating environment for life insurers in Australia including competition from international firms.\nAMP Life’s competitive position may come under pressure from reputational damage to its brand and franchise from allegations raised by an inquiry into Australia’s financial sector, which may result in lower net cash inflows to the group, Moody’s said.\nReporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
