    "text": "2 COMMENTS LUCKNOW, India—A powerful dust and rainstorm swept parts of northern and western India, killing 72 people and injuring more than 100 others as houses collapsed and trees toppled, officials said Thursday.\nThe damage was particularly severe on Wednesday night in Agra, the northern Indian city where the white marble Taj Mahal is located. Thirty-six people died there as the wind speed reached 80 miles an hour, said Relief Commissioner Sanjay Kumar of Uttar Pradesh state.\nThe monument wasn’t damaged.\nThe Press Trust of India news agency said at least 27 others died and that an additional 100 were injured in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. Most of the deaths were caused by house collapses and lightning.\nThe rainstorm caught people by surprise, as the monsoon season is still more than six weeks away.\nUprooted trees flattened mud huts of the poor, Sanjay Kumar said. Electricity supply and telephone lines were snapped in parts of Uttar Pradesh state, Mr. Kumar said.\n—Copyright 2018 the Associated Press",
