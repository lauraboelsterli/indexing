REUTERS/Leah Millis “Our greatest hope is for peace,” said Trump, whose recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and relocation of the embassy to the holy city from Tel Aviv, has outraged Palestinians and drawn international concern.\n“The United States remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement,” Trump said. “The United States will always be a great friend of Israel and a partner in the cause of freedom and peace.”\nReporting by Steven Scheer; Editing by Jeffrey Heller\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
