    "text": "(Reuters) - Kindred Biosciences Inc has received the first U.S. approval for a treatment for unintended weight loss in cats, opening the door to a market it says extends to up to 9 million potential cases in the United States alone.\nMiratazm, which helps cats gain weight, combats the potentially fatal disease and is applied to the cat’s inner ear once a day, avoiding what can be difficult oral treatment.\n“Based on our market research, we estimate that veterinarians in the U.S. see as many as 9 million cats each year with unintended weight loss due to various underlying conditions,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Chin said in a statement.\nTrading of shares in the company were halted in premarket trade.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Patrick Graham\n ",
