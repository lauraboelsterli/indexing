    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gencor Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:GENC) announced today net revenues increased 37% to $30.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $22.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Gross margins were 28.4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 29.6% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as material costs have increased. Product engineering and development expenses increased $288,000 to $758,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 due to increased staffing to meet the higher demands for our engineered products. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased $794,000 to $2,921,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Headcount additions, higher sales commissions and increased advertising and trade show expenses to capitalize on the renewed optimism within the highway construction industry contributed to most of the increase in SG&A expenses. Operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $5.1 million compared to $4.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company had non-operating expense of $0.3 million compared to non-operating income of $0.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The effective income tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 20.9% versus 30.0% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 reflecting the lower corporate tax rates to comply with the recently enacted U.S. tax law, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $3.8 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018 the Company had net revenue of $54.0 million and net income of $6.1 million ($0.41 per diluted share) versus net revenue of $38.3 million and net income of $4.8 million ($0.33 per diluted share) for the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $110.9 million of cash and marketable securities compared to $110.8 million at September 30, 2017. Net working capital was $128.2 million at March 31, 2018. The Company had no short-term or long-term debt outstanding at March 31, 2018.\nThe Company’s backlog was $45.6 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $42.9 million at March 31, 2017.\nJohn Elliott, Gencor’s CEO, commented, “Second quarter revenues of $30.8 million grew by 37% year to year and 33% sequentially from the first quarter. First half fiscal 2018 revenues of $54 million increased 41% from the first half of fiscal 2017. Gencor has experienced growth in all regions across the U.S. as demand for our equipment continues to be strong.\nIn the second quarter, gross margins declined slightly to 28.4% due to higher material costs, in particular carbon steel. However, gross margins are well above our historic margins of low to mid twenty percent. We continue to invest in and grow our research and development efforts to support the increased business and new products.\nNet income benefitted from the lower tax rate of 21% resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform bill of 2017.\nBacklog of $45.6 million increased from the prior year. Quoting activity remains strong and we expect to close new asphalt plant orders in the coming weeks.\nThe March 2018 World of Asphalt construction equipment show was a success resulting in many promising opportunities.\nWe are well prepared to continue to provide our customers with the best technology and the highest quality products and support in the industry.\nI am proud of the hard work and dedication of our Gencor employees that delivered these solid results. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our execution and remain focused on delivering strong performance.”\nGencor Industries is a diversified heavy machinery manufacturer for the production of highway construction materials, synthetic fuels and environmental control machinery and equipment used in a variety of applications.\nGENCOR INDUSTRIES, INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n(Unaudited)\nFor the Quarters Ended\nMarch 31, For the Six Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net revenue $ 30,829,000 $ 22,526,000 $ 53,951,000 $ 38,309,000 Costs and expenses: Production costs 22,059,000 15,869,000 40,098,000 27,502,000 Product engineering and development 758,000 470,000 1,458,000 886,000 Selling, general and administrative 2,921,000 2,127,000 5,613,000 4,317,000 25,738,000 18,466,000 47,169,000 32,705,000 Operating income 5,091,000 4,060,000 6,782,000 5,604,000 Other income (expense), net: Interest and dividend income, net of fees 383,000 162,000 676,000 203,000 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities (719,000 ) 656,000 (558,000 ) 1,063,000 Other 3,000 - 7,000 - (333,000 ) 818,000 125,000 1,266,000 Income before income tax expense 4,758,000 4,878,000 6,907,000 6,870,000 Income tax expense 994,000 1,463,000 797,000 2,061,000 Net income $ 3,764,000 $ 3,415,000 $ 6,110,000 $ 4,809,000 Basic Income per Common Share: Net income per share $ 0.26 $ 0.24 $ 0.42 $ 0.33 Diluted Income per Common Share: Net income per share $ 0.26 $ 0.23 $ 0.41 $ 0.33\nGENCOR INDUSTRIES, INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets March 31, September 30, 2018 2017 ASSETS (Unaudited) Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 22,883,000 $ 22,933,000 Marketable securities at fair value (cost $88,520,000 at March 31, 2018\nand $86,967,000 at September 30, 2017) 88,004,000 87,886,000 Accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts of $181,000 at\nMarch 31, 2018 and $207,000 at September 30, 2017 1,830,000 1,184,000 Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 10,928,000 6,768,000 Inventories, net 15,076,000 16,687,000 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 783,000 1,660,000 Total Current Assets 139,504,000 137,118,000 Property and equipment, net 7,783,000 5,722,000 Other assets 53,000 53,000 Total Assets $ 147,340,000 $ 142,893,000\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 3,704,000 $ 1,320,000 Customer deposits 5,187,000 8,628,000 Accrued expenses 2,410,000 2,426,000 Total Current Liabilities 11,301,000 12,374,000 Deferred and other income taxes 634,000 1,601,000 Total Liabilities 11,935,000 13,975,000 Commitments and contingencies Shareholders’ Equity: Preferred stock, par value $.10 per share; 300,000 shares authorized;\nnone issued - - Common stock, par value $.10 per share; 15,000,000 shares authorized; 12,196,837 and 12,154,829 shares issued and outstanding at March 31,\n2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively 1,220,000 1,215,000 Class B Stock, par value $.10 per share; 6,000,000 shares authorized; 2,288,857 and 2,263,857 shares issued and outstanding at March 31,\n2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively 229,000 226,000 Capital in excess of par value 11,547,000 11,178,000 Retained earnings 122,409,000 116,299,000 Total Shareholders’ Equity 135,405,000 128,918,000 Total Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity $ 147,340,000 $ 142,893,000 Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements - This press release and our other communications and statements may contain “forward-looking statements,” including statements about our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, estimates, projections and intentions.
