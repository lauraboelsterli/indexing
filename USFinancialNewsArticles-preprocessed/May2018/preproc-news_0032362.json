Follow him on Twitter @MurrayMatt.\nGood morning,\nDirect Line President Trump said in a tweet Sunday that he was working with President Xi Jinping to keep Chinese smartphone maker ZTE in business after the telecommunications giant was laid low by a U.S. action to cut off its suppliers. The surprise move comes less than a month after the Commerce Department hit ZTE with an order banning U.S. companies from selling products to the Chinese company for seven years. Washington and Beijing are negotiating over trade and intellectual property, with further discussions between top officials set to take place this week. The two countries are threatening to slap tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other’s goods.\nThe Outsiders Italy’s 5 Star Movement and the League, a pair of antiestablishment parties, have reached an agreement on the outlines of a government program, paving the way for a likely governing coalition. With new elections looming, the parties recently overcome their tactical and policy differences. They said they would slash and simplify taxes while increasing spending on pensions and antipoverty benefits. 5 Star and the League were set to present their program Monday to President Sergio Mattarella, who formally appoints the government. Italians and the European Union will be looking to see whether the rebel parties can counter the deep malaise in one of Europe’s biggest—but most troubled—economies.\nChanging Drivers Tesla will be without two important executives just as the electric-car maker struggles to increase production of its first mass-market vehicle and faces doubts about its ability to raise cash. Matthew Schwall—who was the company’s main technical contact with U.S. safety investigators as the Silicon Valley auto maker races to develop driverless-car technology—left the company for rival self-driving-car company Waymo, a unit of Google parent Alphabet. His departure comes as the National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating multiple crashes involving Tesla vehicles. Mr. Schwall’s exit also comes after Tesla said Friday that its engineering chief, Doug Field, was taking a leave of absence to recharge and spend time with his family. We report Mr. Field is stepping away from the company for several weeks.\nNBA Transformers The Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets are not who you think they are. The two best teams in the NBA have reinvented themselves and turned popular notions into myths, Journal reporter Ben Cohen writes . The Warriors no longer rely on 3-pointers. They still lead the NBA in three-point-shooting percentage, which is what happens when Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant play for the same team. But insisting that they are reliant on the 3-pointer is like saying Facebook is cool: Simply because it used to be doesn’t mean it still is. The Rockets, meanwhile, don’t play fast but they do play defense. They are brutally efficient in transition, but they are also ruthlessly boring in the half-court, where James Harden destroys the poor defender he picks to isolate. Their bacchanalia of a playoff series begins with Game 1 tonight.\nToday’s Video WSJ’s Financial Inclusion Challenge Hope Credit Union, which provides banking services in impoverished communities in Mississippi and four other states, was selected winner of the Journal’s first Financial Inclusion Challenge in the U.S. The competition, launched in January, was developed to identify and spotlight enterprises that address financial security for low- and moderate-income people.\nTOP STORIES U.S. Bolton: U.S. to Impose Sanctions on European Companies in Iran\nMembers of House Freedom Caucus Face Tough Fights in Fall Elections\nWORLD Family of Suicide Bombers Attacks Churches in Indonesia\nU.S. Embassy in Jerusalem Opens in Climate Fraught With Tension\nBUSINESS Xerox Drops Fujifilm Merger Plan, Strikes Deal With Activists\nRecycling Is Now Under Siege\nMARKETS Malaysia’s Antigraft Boss Quits as Mahathir Prepares 1MDB Probe\nWall Street Is Getting In on House-Flipping Game\nNumber of the Day $2.86 The national average retail price of a gallon of gasoline last week.

Today’s Question Going back to our story above , what are your thoughts on President Trump’s intention to extend a lifeline to China’s ZTE? Send your comments, which we may edit before publication, to 10point@wsj.com . Please include your name and location.\n—Compiled by Jessica Menton\nReader Response Responding to Friday’s question on the planned Apple-Goldman credit card , Cathie Greene of Massachusetts said: “I would apply for this card. I presently have a Barclays [card] solely due to its relationship with Apple. So I would switch lenders. I would hope the new Goldman/Apple card would continue or improve upon the no-finance-charge promos and the Apple gift cards.” Jack Hallett of Illinois responded: “No, we won’t use it, though we are very much an Apple family. We have too many credit cards already.” Diane Brighton of Quote: : “You bet I’d use it if there is no yearly fee and the rewards that are offered are good. It’s all about the rewards.” And Joel Litman of Texas replied: “[I] have no intent on using the card. One more card doesn’t put cash in your pocket or bank. It simply creates more opportunity to weaken creditworthiness.”\nThis daily briefing is named “The 10-Point” after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary “What’s News” digest of top stories. Technically, “10-point” referred to the size of the typeface. The type is smaller now but the name lives on.\nSign up here for a curated weekly tour of WSJ’s unique take on the sports world including news, smart features, data and Jason Gay.\nThe 10-Point In Your Inbox CLICK HERE to sign up for this briefing by email.",
