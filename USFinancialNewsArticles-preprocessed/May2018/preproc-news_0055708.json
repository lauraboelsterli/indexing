A logo of Shell is pictured at a gas station in the western Canakkale province, Turkey April 25, 2016. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\nShell plans to restore production at its Ram Powell Hub in the Viosca Knoll area of the Gulf as it soon as it confirms the platform can be operated safely, the company said in a statement. A Chevron gas station sign is pictured at one of their retain gas stations in Cardiff, California October 9, 2013. REUTERS/Mike Blake\nOn Friday, Shell shut in production at its offshore Ram Powell hub ahead of the stormâ€™s move into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The facility is capable of processing about 60,000 barrels of oil and 200 million cubic feet of gas per day.\nSeparately, Chevron restored production on the Blind Faith and Petronius production platforms in the Gulf after the passage of Storm Alberto, a company spokeswoman said on Monday.\nThe two platforms were shut in as Alberto, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018, was charging across the eastern Gulf. The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1.\nThe Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of daily U.S. crude output and 5 percent of natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nMore than 45 percent of U.S. refining capacity and 51 percent of natural gas processing capacity are located along the Gulf.
