(NASDAQ: INVA) (“Innoviva”) today announced the appointment of Geoffrey Hulme as interim Principal Executive Officer effective May 21, 2018. Mr. Hulme has a 25 year career in finance and investment management with a record of creating and maximizing shareholder value.\nPrior to joining Innoviva, Mr. Hulme served as the owner and manager of Steel Valley Capital LLC and Steel Valley Advisors LLC, a Registered Investment Adviser. Previously, he worked at Amici Capital, LLC, serving in various roles, including as Director of Research, a portfolio manager and a director of various funds managed by Amici.\nDr. Odysseas Kostas, Chairman of the Board of Innoviva, stated, “We are excited to welcome Geoff as we begin a new chapter. Geoff, as an investor, brings to the role the much-needed mindset of an owner and joins us in our strong commitment to making the right capital allocation decisions and considering all avenues to maximize shareholder value.”\nMr. Hulme stated, “I look forward to working with the new board to create value for shareholders. After the last few years, a focus on capital allocation, the cost structure and accountability is exactly what the company needs at this time.”\nIn addition, Innoviva’s new board plans to launch an investigation into the conduct of the advisors to the former board who enabled Innoviva in connection with the 2017 proxy contest conducted by Sarissa Capital. Recall, the previous board breached the agreement to reconstitute the board and subsequently wasted millions of dollars of shareholder capital in an unsuccessful attempt to defend that breach. At this year’s annual meeting, the old board was replaced in its entirety.\nAbout Innoviva\nInnoviva is focused on the management of royalty revenues from the respiratory inhalers RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, ANORO® ELLIPTA® and TRELEGY® ELLIPTA® commercialized by Glaxo Group Limited (GSK).
