While we have a great foundation in place, our focus will be on continuing to execute our highly differentiated strategic initiatives to further grow our business, our backlog and stockholder returns. I look forward to working with Michael and the rest of the Board to achieve these shared objectives.\"\nAbout U.S. Concrete, Inc.\nU.S. Concrete, Inc.
