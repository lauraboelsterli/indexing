    "text": "0 COMMENTS\nRobert Klein’s father once told him: “God blessed you with a brain and cursed you with a mouth.” Working for a boss would be difficult.\nSo Mr. Klein, a high-school dropout, was always his own boss, starting as a New York taxi driver and later running his own fruit-and-vegetable wholesaling business in Cleveland. In 1990, he founded Safeguard Properties in the obscure business of mortgage field services. Such firms do foreclosure-related chores for lenders, including changing locks on abandoned homes, sealing broken windows and handling basic repairs so houses can be resold.\nHe started with one employee and grew to around 1,000 as Safeguard expanded nationwide and became one of the largest companies of its type. The surge in mortgage defaults starting around 2006 meant higher revenue but also controversy, as local officials sometimes accused lenders and their agents of blighting neighborhoods by failing to keep up with maintenance.\n“Everything is not perfect,” he told the Washington Post in 2011 , but “I think we’re doing a decent job.”\nObituaries\nLeslie Rudd, a Kansas Boy Who Dreamed Big May 11, 2018 Donald Seldin Transformed a Ramshackle Med School Into a Research Powerhouse May 11, 2018 He set up a second company providing clear plastic sheets to cover broken windows, an alternative to plywood, making houses look less forlorn.\nMr. Klein died May 3 in Cleveland, apparently of a heart attack. He was 65.\nThe polycarbonate panels sold by his SecureView company, formed about five years ago, are designed to make it harder to tell that homes are unoccupied. Windows boarded up with plywood were an invitation to vandals and squatters, he said. “Our goal is to eliminate plywood, period,” Mr. Klein told The Wall Street Journal in 2013.\nRobert Klein, known to friends as Mendy, was born Oct. 16, 1952, in Hungary. His parents emigrated to the U.S. a few years later and settled in Brooklyn. His father worked for a kosher-food plant. At 16, Mr. Klein became a cabdriver, a job he kept for about five years. He then bought an uncle’s wholesale-produce business in Cleveland.\nMr. Klein said he succeeded in field services by proving himself a reliable partner for lenders. In the firm’s early days, he said in an interview with Smart Business Cleveland, a mistake by one of the firm’s contractors caused $18,000 of plumbing damages at one foreclosed home.\n“We have a problem,” Mr. Klein recalled being told by his client’s chief executive.\nMr. Klein said he responded: “We don’t have a problem. I have a problem. You hired me to do the job right, and it wasn’t.” He then made sure the damages were repaired at Safeguard’s expense.\nMr. Klein helped create and finance a partnership that renovated homes in Cleveland’s Slavic Village neighborhood after it was devastated by the foreclosure wave. He also donated to numerous Jewish and other causes.\nIn 2010, Mr. Klein passed the CEO job at Safeguard to a son-in-law, Alan Jaffa, but remained chairman.\nHe is survived by his wife, Ita, four children, 20 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\nWrite to James R.
