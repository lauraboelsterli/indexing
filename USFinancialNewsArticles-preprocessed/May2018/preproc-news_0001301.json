    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 4:07 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Rebels agree withdrawal deal for enclave near Syria's Homs - official Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBEIRUT (Reuters) - Rebels accepted a deal with the Syrian government on Wednesday to evacuate their enclave near the city of Homs, a rebel official said.\n“The Syrian army and armed groups reached an agreement with Russian sponsorship for the armed groups to exit,” said a military media unit run by Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which fights in support of Damascus. It cited reports by opposition groups.\nThe enclave under insurgent control includes the towns of Houla, Rastan, and Talbiseh and villages around them, on a main highway between the cities of Homs and Hama.\nFighters and civilians who refuse the return of state rule will be shuttled to insurgent territory in the north near the Turkish border starting Saturday, the rebel official in Homs said.\n(This corrected versioin of the story fixes sourcing to clarify Hezbollah media unit citing opposition reports).
