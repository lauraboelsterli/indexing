    "text": "With an \"above average\" hurricane season just weeks away, now is the time to go over your homeowners policy and ensure that your coverage is watertight.\nThis year we can expect to see 14 named storms, according to forecasts from the Colorado State University. That includes seven that could become hurricanes — three of which will be major or at least register a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale .\nThe 2017 season (which forecasters had also pegged as above average) proved devastating for the Caribbean and the southeastern part of the U.S, as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused a combined $92 billion in insured losses, according to insurer Swiss Re .\nHurricane season runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, so you have about three weeks to review the insurance policy covering your dwelling and belongings.\nScience Photo Library - NASA | Getty Images \"It's key to understand the nuances of your insurance policy and be fully protected before the storm hits,\" said Annmarie Camp, executive vice president at Chubb Personal Risk Services.\n\"You don't want to find out that you're underinsured after a storm,\" she said.\nHaving the appropriate amount of coverage is all the more important this year, as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limits your ability to take a tax deduction for personal casualty and theft losses.\nFrom 2018 to the end of 2025, you can only claim these losses if the damage is attributable to a disaster declared by the president.\nHere's where to begin shoring up your home and your insurance policy.\nMind the coverage gap Karl Spencer | Getty Images Pop quiz: What's your hurricane deductible?\nSeparate from the standard deductible on your homeowner's coverage, there may be an additional amount you'll need to pay out-of-pocket before your insurer will cover hurricane damage.\nDepending on your policy and where you reside, your hurricane deductible can be as high as 5 percent of your home's insured value . You could be on the hook for even more if you reside in a high-risk location: Hurricane deductibles in Florida can be up to 10 percent of the insured value.\nThese deductibles are in effect in 19 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\nThe states are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.\nBe sure to have the money you'll need either in your emergency fund or in a home equity line.\nFurther, if you've made updates to your home, contact your insurance agent or broker. You'll probably need to increase your coverage, Camp said.\nKnow your flood insurance Byba Sepit | Getty Images While your homeowner's insurance policy may cover damage from wind and hail, it almost certainly doesn't cover flooding .\nIn that case, you'll have to buy separate coverage through the National Flood Insurance Program or through a private insurer. There's a 30-day waiting period for new policies to take effect, so it's better to assess your needs now, before hurricane season begins.\nUnder the federal program, the structure of your dwelling is covered up to $250,000. You can buy a separate policy to cover the contents of your home, up to $100,000.\nIf your dwelling exceeds the $250,000 mark, you'll need excess flood insurance.\nDon't be lulled into a false sense of security if your home is in a \" moderate risk \" zone based on the flood maps.\n\"When we look at Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, both were significant flooding events, and even people in preferred zones can still flood,\" said Camp.\nInsurance review prep At a glance, here's what you need to know about your policy.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHarvey is a wake-up call to check your homeowners insurance\nHow to make sure your summer vacation won't wreck your finances\nDog owners: Here's what you need to know about liability insurance",
