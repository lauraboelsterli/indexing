Industrial revenue grew over 11% on a constant currency average daily sales basis with strength in both our core and expanding product categories and across our end markets. Gross and operating margins showed improvement as we increased leverage across our operations and continued to capitalize on our productivity initiatives. As a result, Industrial's operating income grew 30% in the first quarter. France generated strong revenue growth of 12% on a constant currency average daily sales basis, as it continued to outperform the local market. It delivered exceptional operating margin of almost 7%, and a 60% increase in operating income. With a strong reputation for customer service, excellent vendor relationships and a growing service offering, France is deepening relationships with its loyal customer base and strengthening its position as a one stop shop for business IT.\"\n\"2018 is off to a great start and we remain well positioned to execute on our business plans and enhance the value of our businesses. Industrial and France are both highly successful and we remain focused on driving long-term performance through our growth and optimization initiatives. We are generating strong cash flows and continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividend, while maintaining significant financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions that can enhance our growth.\"\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total working capital of $190.3 million, cash and cash equivalents of $141.0 million and excess availability under its credit facility of approximately $71.1 million. The Company has significant flexibility to return capital to shareholders, execute on its business plans, invest in strategic M&A, and continue investing in growth opportunities. The Company's board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.11 per share to common stock shareholders of record at the close of business on May 14, 2018, payable on May 21, 2018. The Company anticipates continuing a regular quarterly dividend in the future.\nEarnings Conference Call Details\nSystemax Inc. will provide pre-recorded remarks on its first quarter 2018 results today, May 1, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

For clarity of presentation, fiscal years and quarters are described as if they ended on the last day of the respective calendar month. The actual fiscal quarters ended on March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017. The first quarter of both 2018 and 2017 included 13 weeks.\n** On December 1, 2015 the Company closed on the sale of certain assets of its North American Technology Group (\"NATG\"). Pursuant to this transaction, the Company continues to wind down the remaining operations of NATG during 2018. Costs of the wind down in 2018 and 2017 are included in discontinued operations. On March 24, 2017, the Company closed on the sale of its European Technology Group businesses, other than its operations in France. Prior and current year results of these divested businesses, along with the associated loss on the sale recorded in 2017, have been classified as discontinued operations.\n*** During the second quarter of 2017, the Company decided to amend its presentation of certain costs associated with operating our Distribution Centers as well as costs associated with our Purchasing and Product Development Teams. Historically these costs have been included as a component of costs of goods sold. We are now including those costs as a component of Selling, Distribution, and Administrative Expenses. This change is reflected in current and prior year periods and is not a restatement of any amounts, rather, an amendment to the presentation of these costs to better align with the Company's MRO-oriented peer group in North America.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations – GAAP - Unaudited\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet sales\n$\n355.2\n$\n302.5\nCost of sales\n258.5\n220.7\nGross profit\n96.7\n81.8\nGross margin\n27.2\n%\n27.0\n%\nSelling, distribution and administrative expenses\n76.6\n69.4\nOperating income from continuing operations\n20.1\n12.4\nOperating margin\n5.7\n%\n4.1\n%\nInterest and other (income) expense, net\n0.1\n(0.2)\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes\n20.0\n12.6\nProvision for income taxes\n5.8\n2.3\nNet income from continuing operations\n14.2\n10.3\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations\n0.4\n(28.8)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n14.6\n$\n(18.5)\nNet income per common share from continuing operations:\nBasic\n$\n0.38\n$\n0.28\nDiluted\n$\n0.37\n$\n0.28\nNet income (loss) per common share from discontinued operations:\nBasic\n$\n0.01\n$\n(0.78)\nDiluted\n$\n0.01\n$\n(0.78)\nNet income per common share:\nBasic\n$\n0.39\n$\n(0.50)\nDiluted\n$\n0.38\n$\n(0.50)\nWeighted average common and common equivalent shares:\nBasic\n37.2\n37.2\nDiluted\n37.9\n37.2\nSYSTEMAX INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets – GAAP - Unaudited\n(In millions)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n141.0\n$\n184.5\nAccounts receivable, net\n186.3\n174.3\nInventories\n130.9\n131.5\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n5.5\n3.8\nTotal current assets\n463.7\n494.1\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n14.7\n15.1\nGoodwill, intangibles and other assets\n41.9\n42.2\nTotal assets\n$\n520.3\n$\n551.4\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\n273.4\n$\n260.1\nDividend payable\n—\n55.7\nTotal current liabilities\n273.4\n315.8\nDeferred tax liability\n0.1\n0.1\nOther liabilities\n22.8\n23.7\nShareholders' equity\n224.0\n211.8\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$\n520.3\n$\n551.4\nSupplemental Continuing Operations\nBusiness Unit Summary Results - Unaudited (In millions)\nIndustrial Products Group\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nSales\n$\n212.2\n$\n190.2\n11.6\n%\nAverage daily sales*\n$\n3.3\n$\n3.0\n11.6\n%\nGross profit\n$\n72.5\n$\n63.4\n14.4\n%\nGross margin\n34.2\n%\n33.3\n%\nOperating income (Non-GAAP)**\n$\n16.7\n$\n12.9\n29.5\n%\nOperating margin (Non-GAAP)\n7.9\n%\n6.8\n%\nEuropean Technology Products Group (France)\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nSales\n$\n143.0\n$\n112.3\n27.3\n%\nAverage daily sales*\n$\n2.2\n$\n1.7\n29.3\n%\nGross profit\n$\n24.2\n$\n18.4\n31.5\n%\nGross margin\n16.9\n%\n16.4\n%\nOperating income (Non-GAAP)**\n$\n9.4\n$\n6.0\n56.7\n%\nOperating margin (Non-GAAP)\n6.6\n%\n5.3\n%\nCorporate & Other\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nOperating expenses (Non-GAAP)**\n$\n(5.3)\n$\n(5.6)\n5.4\n%\nConsolidated (1,2)\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nSales\n$\n355.2\n$\n302.5\n17.4\n%\nGross profit\n$\n96.7\n$\n81.8\n18.2\n%\nGross margin\n27.2\n%\n27.0\n%\nOperating income (Non-GAAP)**\n$\n20.8\n$\n13.3\n56.4\n%\nOperating margin (Non-GAAP)\n5.9\n%\n4.4\n%\n*\nPercentages are calculated using sales data in hundreds of thousands.
