    "text": "Shin-Soo Choo’s grand slam highlighted a five-run third inning, and the Texas Rangers beat the struggling Chicago White Sox 12-5 Friday at Guaranteed Rate Field in Chicago.\nJoey Gallo and Jurickson Profar each had three RBIs for the Rangers, who bounced back from a loss in the series opener. But it was Choo who delivered the big blast.\nThe Rangers knocked Chicago starter Carson Fulmer out of the game in the third inning. The first four batters reached, forcing White Sox manager Rick Renteria to pull the right-hander.\nReliever Chris Volstad entered the game with the bases loaded and no outs. He retired the first two batters he faced before Choo came to the plate and pulled a high sinker into the seats in right field for his sixth home run of the season.\nJose Abreu and Matt Davidson each hit RBI doubles for the White Sox, who have 10 of their last 12 games.\nWhite Sox left fielder Nicky Delmonico left the game in the second inning after being hit by a pitch that fractured his right hand. He is expected to miss four to six weeks.\nNeither starter — Texas’ Matt Moore nor Fulmer — lasted long.\nMoore gave up five runs (four earned) on five hits in 3 2/3 innings. He struck out five and walked three before leaving in the fourth inning.\nDavidson doubled off Texas reliever Jesse Chavez (2-0) in the fourth inning to bring home Tim Anderson and Abreu and bring the White Sox within four, trailing 9-5.\nThe Rangers got to Fulmer early, scoring three runs in the top of the first inning. Profar had a two-run single, and Gallo followed with an RBI single to give the visitors the early lead.\nFulmer (2-4) surrendered eight runs on just three hits. He struck out two and walked five in two-plus innings. Fulmer was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte after the game.\nThe White Sox answered in the bottom half of the first inning. Jose Abreu had an RBI double, and Welington Castillo added an RBI single to cut the Rangers’ lead to 3-2.\nThe teams exchanged runs in the second inning. Isiah Kiner-Falefa had an RBI sacrifice fly for Texas, and Abreu doubled home Trayce Thompson in the bottom half of the inning for the White Sox.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
