RECALLS HOT DOG AND SAUSAGE PRODUCTS\nDUE TO MISBRANDING AND AN UNDECLARED ALLERGEN\nWASHINGTON, May 16, 2018 – Kent Quality Foods, Inc., a Grand Rapids, Mich. establishment, is recalling approximately 308,430 pounds of ready-to-eat hot dog and sausage products due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products contain soy, a known allergen, which is not declared on the product label.\nThe ready-to-eat (RTE) hot dog and sausage items were produced on various dates from September 9, 2017 through April 29, 2018. The complete list of products with lot codes and labels can be found here: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/4a2fea08-4c76-4b29-8d4a-b75fa9477eb4/038-2018-label.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\nThe products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 5694” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distribution and restaurant locations nationwide.\nThe problem was discovered on May 12, 2018 by the establishment during product inventory activities. The establishment noticed that the label for the spice mixture used in the production of one of their Beef Polish sausage contained hydrolyzed soy protein as an ingredient. However, the Beef Polish Sausage does not list the soy ingredient on the finish product label. Although the Beef Polish sausage product is the only product that is formulated with the spice mix containing the soy ingredient, there are several other ready-to-eat sausage and hot dog products that are implicated in this recall action due to potential cross contamination via shared equipment during the raw and ready-to-eat processing steps.\nThere have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.\nThe restaurants cook and prepare the product for consumers, who may take the product home as leftovers. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.\nFSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms are notifying their customers of the recall and that actions are being taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.\nConsumers and members of the media with questions about the recall can contact Stephen Soet, with Kent Quality Foods Inc., at (616) 459-4595.\nConsumers with food safety questions can \"Ask Karen,\" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov .
