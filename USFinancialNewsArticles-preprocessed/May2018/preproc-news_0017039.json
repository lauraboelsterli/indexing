    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AECOM (NYSE:ACM), a premier, fully integrated global infrastructure firm, today reported second quarter revenue of $4.8 billion. Net loss and diluted loss per share were $120 million and $0.75 in the second quarter, respectively, which includes a $168 million non-cash charge on non-core Oil & Gas assets held for sale. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share 1 was $0.67.\n($ in millions, except EPS) As Reported\nAdjusted\n(Non-GAAP)\nAs Reported\nYoY % Change\nAdjusted\nYoY %\nChange\nRevenue $4,791 - 8% - Operating (Loss) Income ($44) $179 1 NM (5%) Net (Loss) Income ($120) $109 1 NM (23%) EPS (Fully Diluted) ($0.75) $0.67 1 NM (25%) Operating Cash Flow $118 - NM - Free Cash Flow - $95 2 - NM Backlog $49,936 - 18% 3 - Second Quarter 2018 Accomplishments:\nOrganic 4 revenue increased by 5%, which was led by growth in the higher-margin DCS and MS segments and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. Wins of $6.9 billion were highlighted by a greater than 1 book-to-burn 5 ratio in all three segments; in addition, the Company has already delivered more than $6 billion of wins in April in MS, which will be added to backlog in the fiscal third quarter. Total backlog reached a new record of $50 billion, an 18% 3 increase over the prior year, which includes a continued favorable margin mix shift in backlog to the DCS and MS segments. Free cash flow 2 of $95 million contributed to $129 of free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2018; the Company continues to expect annual free cash flow within its guidance range of between $600 million and $800 million.\nStrategic Decisions and Financial Outlook:\nFollowing management’s strategic review of the Company’s risk profile and due to unfavorable market conditions, the Company will no longer pursue fixed-price combined-cycle gas power plant EPC projects. Importantly, construction of Alliant’s Riverside combined-cycle gas plant, AECOM’s only such project currently underway, is expected to be completed profitably and on schedule in 2019. The Company also intends to sell and exit certain non-core Oil & Gas operations. The Company is reducing its adjusted EBITDA 1 guidance from $910 million to $880 million, primarily from the removal of two combined cycle gas power plant EPC projects from backlog that were expected to positively contribute to earnings this year.\n“Our revenue growth and $6.9 billion of wins reflect the competitive advantages of our diversified mix of geographies and leading capabilities, strong presence as a leading government services contractor, and strengthening markets in the Americas,” said Michael S. Burke, AECOM’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Our backlog is at a new high of $50 billion, which is an 18% year-over-year increase with the fastest growth in our higher-margin DCS and MS segments. Importantly, this momentum is continuing into the third quarter, including more than $6 billion of wins since early April in MS. Furthermore, with our intention to sell and exit certain non-core Oil & Gas operations and our decision to no longer pursue fixed price gas power plant EPC work, we are positioning the business to deliver consistent operational and financial performance for our shareholders. As a result, we are confident in reiterating our industry-leading five-year financial targets through fiscal 2022, including a 5%+ organic revenue CAGR, a 7%+ adjusted EBITDA CAGR, a 12 – 15% adjusted EPS CAGR and at least $3.5 billion of free cash flow.”\n“We are pleased with our cash flow performance through the first half of the year,” said W. Troy Rudd, AECOM’s chief financial officer. “During the quarter, we undertook a refinancing of our credit facility, including the repayment of our 2022 Senior Notes, which improved the cost and extended the maturity profile of our debt. With this transaction and our progress through the first half of the fiscal year, we are positioned to operate the business and execute our capital allocation policy with a great degree of certainty.”\nWins and Backlog\nWins were $6.9 billion, and resulted in a book-to-burn ratio 5 of 1.4. Wins were highlighted by strength across the business, including greater than 1 book-to-burn ratios in the DCS, CS and MS segments. Total backlog increased 18% 3 over the prior-year period to $50 billion, and continued to reflect a favorable mix shift to the higher-margin DCS and MS segments.\nBusiness Segments\nDesign & Consulting Services (DCS)\nThe DCS segment delivers planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design services to commercial and government clients worldwide in markets such as transportation, facilities, environmental, energy, water and government.\nRevenue in the second quarter was $2.0 billion. Constant-currency organic 4 revenue increased by 5% and included strong performance in the Company’s transportation and water markets in the Americas, which are benefiting from improved levels of funding and a solid backlog position.\nOperating income was $123 million compared to $113 million in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, operating income 1 was $130 million compared to $120 million in the year-ago period. Profitability in the Americas and APAC regions was strong, which was partially offset by slower growth and profitability in the EMIA region.\nConstruction Services (CS)\nThe CS segment provides construction services for energy, sports, commercial, industrial, and public and private infrastructure clients.\nRevenue in the second quarter was $1.9 billion. Constant-currency organic 4 revenue increased by 4%, led by continued strong growth in the Building Construction business. Total revenue growth included strong performance from the recently acquired Shimmick Construction business.\nOperating loss was $180 million compared to operating income of $26 million in the year-ago period due to a non-cash charge relating to Oil & Gas assets held for sale as described above. On an adjusted basis, operating income 1 was $26 million compared to $34 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to two projects in the building construction and civil construction businesses.\nManagement Services (MS)\nThe MS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems-integration services and information technology services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government, national governments around the world and commercial customers.\nRevenue in the second quarter was $898 million. Organic 4 revenue increased by 9%, which included strong performance across the Company’s portfolio of projects.\nOperating income was $43 million compared to $52 million in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, operating income 1 was $53 million compared to $65 million in the year-ago period.\nTax Rate\nThe effective tax rate in the second quarter was 18%. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 2%. The adjusted tax rate was derived by re-computing the expected annual effective tax rate on earnings from adjusted net income. 7 The adjusted tax expense differs from the GAAP tax expense based on the taxability or deductibility and tax rate applied to each of the adjustments.\nCash Flow\nOperating cash flow for the second quarter was $118 million and free cash flow 2 was $95 million. The Company remains on track with its annual free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $800 million for fiscal 2018 and to achieve 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA 6 by the end of fiscal year 2018 and thereafter intends to return substantially all free cash flow to investors under a $1 billion stock repurchase authorization.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, AECOM had $867 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $3.1 billion of net debt and $1.16 billion in unused capacity under its $1.35 billion revolving credit facility.\nFinancial Impacts of Strategic Decisions\nAECOM also announced its intention to no longer pursue fixed-price combined-cycle gas power plant EPC projects and to sell and exit certain non-core Oil & Gas operations.\nThe following financial impacts are associated with these decisions:\nClassified certain Oil & Gas assets as held for sale. Removed $500 million of backlog associated with two fixed-price combined-cycle gas power plant EPC contracts. Reduced fiscal year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $30 million to $880 million, primarily to reflect the removal of anticipated profit contributions from the decision to no longer proceed on the aforementioned two EPC contracts.\nExpected proceeds from the Oil & Gas business sales will be deployed to accelerate debt reduction towards the Company’s 2.5x net leverage 6 target, which is expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2018.\nFinancial Outlook\nAECOM’s fiscal year 2018 financial guidance is as follows:\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook Adjusted EBITDA 1 $880 million Adjusted EPS 1 $2.50 – $2.90 Free Cash Flow 2 $600 million – $800 million Interest Expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing fees)\n$210 million Amortization 8 $100 million Full-Year Share Count 162 million Effective Tax Rate for Adjusted Earnings 7 ~18% Capital Expenditures 9 $110 million Conference Call\nAECOM is hosting a conference call today at 12 p.m. Eastern Time, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the Company's results, strategies and operating trends.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements.\nImportant factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our business is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns and client spending reductions; we are dependent on long-term government contracts and subject to uncertainties related to government contract appropriations; governmental agencies may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts; government contracts are subject to audits and adjustments of contractual terms; impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts; we may experience losses under fixed-price contracts; we have limited control over operations run through our joint venture entities; we may be liable for misconduct by our employees or consultants or our failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to our business; we may not maintain adequate surety and financial capacity; we are highly leveraged and may not be able to service our debt and guarantees; we have exposure to political and economic risks in different countries where we operate as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations; we may not be able to retain and recruit key technical and management personnel; we may be subject to legal claims and we may have inadequate insurance coverage; we are subject to environmental law compliance and we may have inadequate nuclear indemnification; there may be unexpected adjustments and cancellations related to our backlog; we are dependent on partners and third parties who may fail to satisfy their obligations; we may not be able to manage pension costs; we may face cybersecurity issues and IT outages; as well as other additional risks and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements set forth in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement.\nThis press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In particular, the Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted tax rate, adjusted interest expense, organic revenue, and free cash flow also provide a meaningful perspective on its business results as the Company utilizes this information to evaluate and manage the business. We use adjusted EBITDA, net and operating income to exclude the impact of non-operating items, such as amortization expense, taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, and non-core operating losses. We use free cash flow to represent the cash generated after capital expenditures to maintain our business. Our non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is found in the Regulation G Information tables at the back of this release.\nWhen we provide our long term projections for organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS growth, and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, the closest corresponding GAAP measure and a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectation and the corresponding GAAP measure generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to length of the forecasted period and potential high variability, complexity and low visibility as to items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period.\nAECOM Consolidated Statements of Income (unaudited -
