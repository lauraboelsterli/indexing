    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 10:06 AM / Updated 44 minutes ago Russian Olympic Committee chair will not run for re-election - TASS Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Olympic Committee president Alexander Zhukov will not run for re-election when his term ends on May 29, TASS news agency cited him as saying on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: Russian Olympic Committee President Alexander Zhukov delivers a speech during a welcoming ceremony for Russia's athletes turning back from the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics, at Sheremetyevo International Airport outside Moscow, Russia February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Tatyana Makeyeva\nZhukov’s presidency coincided with a turbulent time for Russian sport as a doping scandal led to the country being banned from February’s Winter Olympics in South Korea, with some Russian athletes able to compete only under a neutral flag.\n“In the current complicated situation in international sport it is very important that the head of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) can work in the ROC full-time,” Zhukov, who is also a lawmaker in Russia’s lower house of parliament, was cited as saying.\n“I am unable to do that at the moment due to my heavy workload in parliament,” the 61-year-old, who has led the Russian Olympic Committee since 2010, reportedly added.\nAllegations that Russia carried out a widespread doping cover-up scheme at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics led to suspensions from subsequent Games and a string of investigations by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\nRussian authorities acknowledged transgressions have taken place but have repeatedly denied the existence of a systematic state-sponsored doping programme.
