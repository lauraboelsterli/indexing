Our aim is to become the preferred mobility service company for our customers, offering an attractive alternative to vehicle ownership with a wide range of services ranging from vehicle rentals to chauffeur-services, as well as vehicle-sharing and peer-to-peer rental services.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Group delivered strong revenue growth of 28% as a result of solid momentum within our recently acquired companies, but also within our historical perimeter. Hence, the company’s organic revenue reached 3.9% in the first quarter of the year, mainly driven by the leisure and Low Cost segments.\nThe Group achieved significant progress in the execution of its transformation strategy and delivered results in several key areas. First, we are well on track in terms of managing the integration of recent acquisitions and delivering the expected synergies. Second, we have continued to improve our Net Promoter Score which reached a new high in the first quarter. Third, we have continued to make significant progress in the further digitalization of our customer experience and services through the completion of the roll out of a new CRM platform. And finally, we have taken action and delivered encouraging initial results in the UK.\nOur adjusted Corporate EBITDA was impacted by (1) the integration of Goldcar, which as expected significantly increases the seasonality of the Group’s profitability generation, (2) a negative mix effect generated by the strong growth of the Low Cost and the Vans & Trucks business units, and (3) an increase in our digital transformational costs.\nNevertheless, our Q1 results are fully in line with our expectations at this stage and were factored in our 2018 outlook.\nAs a result, we confirm all of our targets for 2018 in terms of revenue, adjusted Corporate EBITDA and operating Free Cash Flow conversion. In that context of strong confidence in the Group’s future prospects, we have decided to launch a tactical share buyback programme, which is consistent with our cash allocation strategy, at a point in time that we find appropriate”.\nAll data in €m, except if mentioned 3M 2018 3M 2017 Change Change at\nconstant\ncurrency*\nNumber of rental days (million) 17,1 12,9 32,6% Average Fleet (thousand) 260,0 192,1 35,4% Financial Utilization rate 73,1% 74,6% -1,5pt Total revenues 556 439 26,7% 28,5% Rental revenues 520 403 28,8% 30,8% Adjusted Corporate EBITDA (24) (6) n.m. n.m.

On an organic basis, i.e. at constant exchange rates and constant perimeter, the Group revenues grew by 3.9%.\nThis significant increase in Group revenues was supported by the recent acquisitions made by the Group in the last months of 2017. As a result, the Group delivered solid growth across all of its major business units with Cars growing by 16%, Vans & Trucks growing by 62% and Low Cost growing by 279%. On an organic basis, our three major business units of Cars, Vans & Trucks and Low Cost grew by respectively 3.5%, 8.0% and 18%, showing that our increased focus on the Vans & Trucks and Low Cost segments is a significant generator of additional revenue growth for the Europcar Group.\nThese solid revenue numbers were delivered thanks to good momentum in both the leisure and corporate businesses and are once again proof of the strength and robustness of the Group balanced business model. As is traditionally the case during the first quarter of the year which represents a low point in the touristic season, revenues were more evenly split between the Group’s corporate customers and its leisure customers, representing each an even 50% of Group revenues.\nThe number of rental days increased to 17.1 million in Q1 2018, up 33% versus Q1 2017 with an organic growth of 4.6%. This growth in rental days was spread across all the key divisions with cars growing 15%, Vans & Trucks growing 50% and Low Cost growing 207%. Revenue per rental day (RPD) decreased by 1.4% at Group level, mostly impacted by the recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, RPD was steady in Q1 2018 versus last year as a result of (1) a stable pricing environment in Cars during the quarter with RPD up 0.3%, (2) a 4.4% decline in the\nVans & Trucks business unit which continues to reflect the Group’s strategic focus on expanding its corporate business, and (3) a positive 9.9% increase in RPD in Low Cost reflecting a good ancillary product sales momentum.\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA 1\nExcluding the impact of New Mobility, Q1 2018 Adjusted Corporate EBITDA declined significantly to -€21.4 million compared to -€6.3 million in Q1 2017 at constant exchange rate.\nThis decrease has three major causes:\n(1) the negative impact of the Goldcar acquisition, which as expected adds more seasonality to the Group’s overall profitability generation,\n(2) the negative mix impact generated by the strong organic growth of our existing Low Cost and Vans & Trucks business units,\n(3) the increase in our digital & IT spending which is key to the success of the Group’s transformation.\nIt is important to note that this decline in Adjusted Corporate EBITDA was expected and is fully factored within the Group’s expectations for FY 2018.\nCorporate Operating Free Cash Flow\nQ1 2018 Corporate Operating Free Cash Flow was -€76 million compared to -€27 million in Q1 2017 impacted by a lower level of adjusted Corporate EBITDA as well as a deterioration in non-fleet working capital compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nThis change in non-fleet working capital was caused by a technical timing delay in Italy and a weak performance in terms of cash collection in the UK to be recovered. We expect this negative trend to be reversed during the rest of the year.\nNet income\nIn Q1 2018, the Group posted a net profit of €2.5 million, compared to a net profit of €18.6 million in Q1 2017. This decline was caused by a lower level of adjusted Corporate EBITDA, a higher level of non-fleet D&A and an increase in interest costs on corporate bonds as a result of the financing of the Goldcar acquisition. Non-recurring items contributed positively up to €60m (vs €40m in Q1 2017), on the back of a €68m capital gain on the disposal of the Group’s 25% stake in car2go.\nNet debt\nCorporate net debt increased to reach €947 million as of March 31, 2018 (vs €827 million as of December 31, 2017) mainly as a result of the increased seasonality of the business during the first quarter of the year.\nThe Group’s pro forma corporate net leverage reached 3.1x at the end of the first quarter of 2018. When including the proceeds for the sale of the Group’s 25% stake in car2go, the Group’s pro forma corporate net leverage reached 2.9x at the end of the first quarter of 2018.\nThe fleet net debt was €3,953 million as of March 31, 2018 vs €4,061 million as of December 31, 2017.\nSale of 25% stake in car2go\nOn February 28, 2018, the Europcar Group signed an agreement with Daimler Mobility Services on the sale of its 25% stake in car2go Europe GmbH. The completion of the sale generated a pre-tax gain of 68 million euros which has been accounted for in the company’s Q1 results.\nLaunch of share buyback programme (post-closing event)\nEuropcar has decided to implement a share buyback programme as authorized by the Combined General Meeting of Shareholders on May 10th 2017.\nThis mandate, signed on May 16th, 2018, targets a maximum amount of shares not to exceed a value of 30 million euros, representing approximately 2.1% of the share capital.\nThe repurchases of shares will occur over a period of six months starting on May 17 th 2018.\n2018 guidance confirmed\nEuropcar confirms its four financial targets for 2018 compared to 2017:\n- Accelerating organic revenue growth i.e. above 3%\n- Adjusted corporate EBITDA (excluding New Mobility) above 350 million euros\n- Corporate operating free cash flow conversion rate above 50%\n- Dividend payout ratio above 30%\nConference Call with Analysts and Investors\nCaroline Parot, Group Chief Executive Officer and Luc Peligry, Group Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call in English today at 6.30 p.m. Paris time (CEST).\nYou can follow this conference call live via webcast .\nA replay will also be available for a period of one year.
