    "text": "STOCKHOLM, May 4 (Reuters) - Wet snuff and cigar maker Swedish Match reported on Friday a bigger first-quarter operating profit than expected and predicted a growing but competitive Scandinavian snus market in 2018.\nOperating profit fell to 1.05 billion crowns ($119 million) from a year-ago 1.24 billion which included one-off gains of 238 million. The mean forecast in Reutersâ€™ poll of analysts was for 1.03 billion.\nThe operating margin for snus and snuff widened more than expected to 45.0 percent from 41.2 percent, against a forecast 43.2 percent. The margin for the Other Tobacco Products division, which includes cigars, shrank. ($1 = 8.8080 Swedish crowns) (Reporting by Anna Ringstrom, editing by Helena Soderpalm)\n ",
