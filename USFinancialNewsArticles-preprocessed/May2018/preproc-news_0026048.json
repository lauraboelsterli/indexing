(2) The expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses to net earned premiums and other income. (3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. First Quarter 2018 Premiums\nGross Written Premiums\nGross written premiums decreased 10.3% in the first quarter of 2018 to $23.7 million, compared to $26.5 million in the prior year period. The decline in gross written premiums was largely attributable to a 59.6% decrease in the Company’s personal lines of business, despite a slight increase in the Company’s commercial lines.\nNet Earned Premiums\nNet earned premiums decreased 1.4% to $23.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $24.1 million for the prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to the repositioning of its personal lines, offset by the expansion of the Company’s commercial lines, which increased 2.2%.\nCommercial Lines Financial and Operational Review\nCommercial Lines Financial Review Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change (dollars in thousands) Gross written premiums $ 21,788 $ 21,644 0.7 % Net written premiums 19,422 19,479 -0.3 % Net earned premiums 20,127 19,689 2.2 % Underwriting ratios: Loss ratio 50.3 % 62.8 % Expense ratio 44.1 % 37.8 % Combined ratio 94.4 % 100.6 % Contribution to combined ratio from net (favorable) adverse prior year development -4.5 % 14.3 % Accident year combined ratio (1) 98.9 % 86.3 % (1) The accident year combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio, less changes in net ultimate loss estimates from prior accident year loss reserves. The accident year combined ratio provides management with an assessment of the specific policy year's profitability and assists management in their evaluation of product pricing levels and quality of business written. The Company’s commercial lines of business, representing 92% of total gross written premiums in the first quarter of 2018, and primarily consisted of property and liability coverage offered to owner-operated small- to mid-sized businesses, such as hospitality risks which includes restaurants, bars, taverns and professional organizations.\nCommercial lines gross written premiums increased by 0.7%, or $144,000, to $21.8 million in the first quarter of 2018. This was largely due to 2.8% increase in small business programs.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the commercial lines combined ratio was 94.4%, compared to 100.6% in the prior year period, due to the reduction of adverse development from $2.8 million in 2017 to $909,000 of favorable development in 2018.\nPersonal Lines Financial and Operational Review\nPersonal Lines Financial Review Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change (dollars in thousands) Gross written premiums $ 1,949 $ 4,830 -59.6 % Net written premiums 423 2,845 -85.1 % Net earned premiums 3,673 4,451 -17.5 % Underwriting ratios: Loss ratio 81.2 % 70.9 % Expense ratio 37.4 % 43.9 % Combined ratio 118.6 % 114.8 % Contribution to combined ratio from net (favorable) adverse prior year development 23.2 % 5.3 % Accident year combined ratio 95.4 % 109.5 % Personal lines, which consist of low-value dwelling and wind-exposed homeowners insurance, represented 8% of total gross written premiums for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 18% in 2017. Personal lines gross written premiums decreased 59.6% to $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was the result of management's strategic decision to deemphasize the Company’s Florida homeowners business and other wind-exposed business in Texas and Hawaii. The Florida homeowners business decreased by 51% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the personal lines combined ratio was 118.6%, compared to 114.8% in the prior year period. There was $274,000 of additional losses relating to Hurricane Harvey in Texas and $184,000 of reinstatement reinsurance premiums relating to Hurricane Irma in Florida, which also increased the combined ratio in the first quarter.\nCombined Ratio Analysis\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (dollars in thousands) Underwriting ratios: Loss ratio 55.2 % 64.2 % Expense ratio 44.3 % 44.9 % Combined ratio 99.5 % 109.1 % Contribution to combined ratio from net (favorable) adverse prior year development 0.0 % 12.5 % Accident year combined ratio 99.5 % 96.6 % Combined Ratio\nThe Company's combined ratio was 99.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 109.1% for the same period in 2017.\nLoss Ratio : The impact of prior accident year reserves on the Company's loss ratio has been significantly reduced due to the benefits of the ADC.

The Company’s losses and loss adjustment expenses were $13.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $15.7 million in the prior year period.

The Company is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CNFR. Additional information is available on the Company's website at IR.CNFRH.com .\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nConifer prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.\nWe believe that investors’ understanding of Conifer’s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of adjusted operating income. Our method for calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. We define adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure, as net income (loss) excluding net realized investment gains and losses, and other gains and losses, after-tax, and excluding the tax impact of changes in unrealized gains and losses. Beginning in 2018, the change in fair value of equity securities, net of tax, and the deferred gain on losses ceded to the ADC are also excluded from net income to arrive at adjusted operating income. We use adjusted operating income as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance.\nReconciliations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (dollar in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Net income (loss) $ 213 $ (1,798 ) Less: Net realized gains (losses) and other gains, net of tax 161 (8 ) Change in fair value of equity securities, net of tax (297 ) - (Increase) in deferred gain on losses ceded to ADC, net of tax (1,431 ) - Adjusted operating income (loss) $ 1,780 $ (1,790 ) Weighted average common shares, diluted 8,520,328 7,633,069 Diluted income (loss) per common share: Net income (loss) $ 0.02 $ (0.24 ) Less: Net realized gains (losses) and other gains, net of tax 0.02 - Change in fair value of equity securities, net of tax (0.04 ) - (Increase) in deferred gain on losses ceded to ADC, net of tax (0.17 ) - Adjusted operating income (loss), per share $ 0.21 $ (0.24 ) Forward-Looking Statement\nThis press release contains made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
