Such statements should be read along with the accompanying tables, which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures. This news release and the accompanying tables discuss financial measures, including but not limited to, core deposits, tangible book value, operating earnings and net income related to segments of the Company, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that such non-GAAP measures are useful because they enhance the ability of investors and management to evaluate and compare the Company’s operating results from period to period in a meaningful manner. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP. Investors should consider the Company’s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.\nPlease refer to the Non-GAAP reconciliation tables later in this release for additional information.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this news release contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements relating to future plans and expectations, and are thus prospective. Such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements with respect to our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts, and other statements identified by words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “targets,” and “projects,” as well as similar expressions. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate. Therefore, we can give no assurance that the results contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized. The inclusion of this forward-looking information should not be construed as a representation by the Company or any person that the future events, plans, or expectations contemplated by the Company will be achieved.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: (1) competitive pressures among depository and other financial institutions may increase significantly and have an effect on pricing, spending, fourth-party relationships and revenues; (2) the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations may be different than expected resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in the credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including the resultant effect on the Company’s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses; (3) the rate of delinquencies and amounts of charge-offs, the level of allowance for loan loss, the rates of loan growth, or adverse changes in asset quality in our loan portfolio, which may result in increased credit risk-related losses and expenses; (4) the risk that the preliminary financial information reported herein and our current preliminary analysis will be different when our review is finalized; (5) changes in the U.S. legal and regulatory framework including, but not limited to, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and regulations adopted thereunder; (6) adverse conditions in the stock market, the public debt market and other capital markets (including changes in interest rate conditions) could have a negative impact on the Company; (7) the business related to acquisitions may not be integrated successfully or such integration may take longer to accomplish than expected; (8) the expected cost savings and any revenue synergies from acquisitions may not be fully realized within expected timeframes; and (9) disruption from acquisitions may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients, associates, or suppliers. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in our reports (such as our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s Internet site ( http://www.sec.gov ). All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the Company or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.\nCAROLINA FINANCIAL CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (Unaudited) (Audited) (Dollars in thousands) ASSETS Cash and due from banks $ 25,761 25,254 Interest-bearing cash 35,603 55,998 Cash and cash equivalents 61,364 81,252 Securities available-for-sale 753,363 743,239 Federal Home Loan Bank stock, at cost 17,913 19,065 Other investments 3,432 3,446 Derivative assets 4,913 2,803 Loans held for sale 24,618 35,292 Loans receivable, gross 2,380,018 2,319,528 Allowance for loan losses (12,708 ) (11,478 ) Loans receivable, net 2,367,310 2,308,050 Premises and equipment, net 62,593 61,407 Accrued interest receivable 11,502 11,992 Real estate acquired through foreclosure, net 1,963 3,106 Deferred tax assets, net 4,952 2,436 Mortgage servicing rights 21,719 21,003 Cash value life insurance 57,604 57,195 Core deposit intangible 18,795 19,601 Goodwill 127,592 127,592 Other assets 13,443 21,538 Total assets $ 3,553,076 3,519,017 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Liabilities: Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 547,744 525,615 Interest-bearing deposits 2,129,225 2,079,314 Total deposits 2,676,969 2,604,929 Short-term borrowed funds 308,500 340,500 Long-term debt 67,303 72,259 Derivative liabilities 164 156 Drafts outstanding 10,133 7,324 Advances from borrowers for insurance and taxes 3,302 3,005 Accrued interest payable 1,288 1,126 Reserve for mortgage repurchase losses 1,742 1,892 Dividends payable to stockholders 1,053 1,051 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 7,576 11,394 Total liabilities 3,078,030 3,043,636 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity: Preferred stock -
