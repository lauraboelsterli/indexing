Highlights include:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nComparable RevPAR was $165.57, an increase of 1.1% from the same period in 2017; excluding the effect of renovations at several key hotels during the quarter, Comparable RevPAR increased 2.0% from the same period in 2017; Net income was $149 million and net income attributable to stockholders was $150 million; Adjusted EBITDA was $174 million, a decrease of 1.7% over the same period in 2017; Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders was $137 million, a decrease of 0.7% over the same period in 2017; Diluted earnings per share was $0.71; Diluted Adjusted FFO per share was $0.65, an increase of 1.6% over the same period in 2017; Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.9%, a decrease of 10 bps from the same period in 2017; Completed the sale of 12 hotels for total gross proceeds of $379 million and used most of the net proceeds to repurchase 14,000,000 shares of Park’s common stock at $24.85 per share; and Under contract to sell the Hilton Berlin (40% JV interest) at a price per key of over $610,000.\nThomas J. Baltimore, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am pleased to report another successful quarter with results coming in ahead of our expectations. I am incredibly proud of the team’s unwavering focus on creating shareholder value as we continue to execute on our stated objectives of prudent capital allocation and operational excellence by recycling capital from the sale of non-core assets to repurchase stock at a price significantly below our NAV and by delivering relative margin outperformance. As we look out over the balance of the year, we continue to observe improving fundamentals across our portfolio, especially on the group side with pace up 60 basis points in 2018 to 3.6%, while 2019 pace is nearing 7%.”\nSelected Statistical and Financial Information\n(unaudited, dollars in millions, except per share data, Comparable RevPAR and Comparable ADR)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change Comparable RevPAR $ 165.57 $ 163.83 1.1 % Comparable Occupancy 78.5 % 78.5 % — % pts Comparable ADR $ 210.83 $ 208.64 1.0 % Net income (1) $ 149 $ 2,350 NM (2) Net income attributable to stockholders (1) $ 150 $ 2,350 NM (2) Adjusted EBITDA $ 174 $ 177 (1.7 )% Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA $ 159 $ 159 — % Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin 26.9 % 27.0 % (10 ) bps Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders $ 137 $ 138 (0.7 )% Earnings per share - Diluted (1)(3) $ 0.71 $ 11.01 NM (2) Adjusted FFO per share - Diluted (3) $ 0.65 $ 0.64 1.6 % Weighted average shares outstanding - Diluted 212 213 (1 )\n(1)\nThe three months ended March 31, 2017 includes an income tax benefit from the derecognition of deferred tax liabilities of $2,288 million associated with Park’s intent to elect REIT status. (2)\nPercentage change is not meaningful. (3)\nPer share amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Top 10 Hotels\nRevPAR at Park’s Top 10 Hotels, which account for approximately 70% of Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, increased 1.5% due to a 0.4% pt. increase in occupancy and a 1.0% increase in rate, as compared to the same period in 2017. Highlights within the Top 10 Hotels include:\nHilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort : RevPAR growth was 0.9% due to an increase in rate from increased transient demand offset by weaker group demand for the quarter; New York Hilton Midtown : RevPAR declined 1.0% due to weak transient demand coupled with disruption from rooms renovation during the quarter; excluding the renovation disruption RevPAR would have increased an estimated 1.8%; Hilton San Francisco Union Square / Parc 55 San Francisco – a Hilton Hotel : Combined RevPAR declined 0.7% due to decreases in rate driven by a decrease in group events as compared to the prior year coupled with the disruption from the last phase of rooms renovation at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square completed in early February; excluding the renovation disruption combined RevPAR would have increased an estimated 0.2%; Hilton Waikoloa Village : RevPAR growth was 9.5% due to an increase in the number of flights to Kona and group demand, which yielded an increased transient rate; Hilton New Orleans Riverside : RevPAR growth was 3.2% due to an increase in occupancy from very strong transient demand offset by weaker group demand due to the loss of a city-wide event in January; Hilton Chicago : RevPAR declined 7.2% as a result of a decrease in rate from group business relative to last year; Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek / Waldorf Astoria Orlando : Combined RevPAR growth was 7.2% primarily from strong growth in transient rate across the complex and strong group business; and Casa Marina, A Waldorf Astoria Resort : RevPAR declined 0.4% from a decrease in transient demand that was partially offset by a strong increase in group business.\nTotal Consolidated Comparable Hotels\nComparable RevPAR increased 1.1% for the quarter primarily due to a 1.0% increase in rate, as compared to the same period in 2017. Transient rooms revenue increased 1.0%, offset by a 2.2% decline in group rooms revenue primarily due to a decrease in corporate events and conventions. Highlights across comparable hotels and select markets include:\nFlorida : RevPAR growth was 6.0%, attributable to strong group business in both Orlando and Key West as well as increased transient revenue from leisure business due to the timing of the Easter holiday occurring earlier than in 2017; Northern California : RevPAR growth was 1.9%, primarily attributable to increased occupancy as a result of increased transient and contract demand; New Orleans : RevPAR growth was 2.3%, primarily attributable to increased occupancy from an increase in transient business; Southern California : RevPAR declined 6.7% due to decreases in both rate and occupancy, primarily from the renovation at the recently converted Hilton Santa Barbara Beachfront Resort (formerly The Fess Parker Santa Barbara Hotel – a DoubleTree Resort), which was completed in April 2018; and Washington, D.C. : RevPAR declined 13.0% due to weaker transient demand in 2018 due to the inauguration occurring in 2017, contributing to a decrease in both rate and occupancy.\nHurricanes Irma and Maria\nIn September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused damage and disruption at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Park’s two hotels in Key West, Florida. During 2018, Park incurred an additional $7 million of expenses, and based upon additional information obtained during the period, recognized an additional loss of $22 million for property and equipment damaged during the hurricanes. The amounts were offset by the recognition of an additional insurance receivable of $29 million. Park expects the Caribe Hilton to remain closed for almost all of 2018 and the results of operations of that property are presented as non-comparable. Full year 2017 EBITDA, prior to the hurricanes, was projected to be $8 million.\nPark expects that insurance proceeds, excluding any applicable insurance deductibles, will be sufficient to cover a significant portion of the property damage to the hotels and the near-term loss of business. Park has received $20 million of property and casualty insurance proceeds to date for both Key West hotels and the Caribe Hilton, including $18 million received in the first quarter. No business interruption insurance proceeds have been received to date.\nDispositions\nDuring 2018, Park completed the sale of the following 12 hotels in four separate transactions (the results of these hotels are presented as non-comparable):\nHotel Location Month Sold Room Count Gross Proceeds Hilton Rotterdam Rotterdam, Netherlands January 2018 254 $ 62.2 254 62.2 Embassy Suites Portfolio (1) Embassy Suites by Hilton Kansas City Overland Park\nOverland Park, Kansas\nFebruary 2018\n199\n25.0\nEmbassy Suites by Hilton San Rafael Marin County San Rafael, California February 2018 236 37.9 Embassy Suites by Hilton Atlanta Perimeter Center Atlanta, Georgia February 2018 241 32.9 676 95.8 UK Portfolio (1) Hilton Blackpool Blackpool, United Kingdom February 2018 278 N/A Hilton Belfast Belfast, United Kingdom February 2018 198 N/A Hilton London Angel Islington London, United Kingdom February 2018 188 N/A Hilton Edinburgh Grosvenor, United Kingdom February 2018 184 N/A Hilton Coylumbridge Aviemore, United Kingdom February 2018 175 N/A Hilton Bath City Bath, United Kingdom February 2018 173 N/A Hilton Milton Keynes Keynes, United Kingdom February 2018 138 N/A 1,334 188.5 Hilton Durban Durban, South Africa February 2018 328 32.5 328 32.5 Total 2,592 $ 379.0\n(1) Hotels were sold as a portfolio. In April 2018, Park and the other joint venture owners of the entities that own the Hilton Berlin entered into an agreement to sell the ownership interest in these entities for a gross sales price of approximately $367 million, or $610,000 per key, which is subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is currently expected to close in May 2018, subject to the completion of a local regulatory process. Park owns a 40% interest in the joint venture, which has no debt outstanding, and expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $140 million subject to the aforementioned adjustments. Subsequent to the closing of the sale, Park currently expects to declare a special dividend in the range of $80 million to $90 million, subject to approval by its Board of Directors.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nPark had the following debt outstanding as of March 31, 2018:\n(unaudited, dollars in millions)\nDebt Collateral Interest Rate Maturity Date As of\nMarch 31, 2018\nFixed Rate Debt Mortgage loan DoubleTree Hotel Spokane City Center 3.55% October 2020 $ 12 Commercial mortgage-backed securities loan\nHilton San Francisco Union Square, Parc 55 San Francisco - a Hilton Hotel 4.11% November 2023 725 Commercial mortgage-backed securities loan\nHilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort 4.20% November 2026 1,275 Mortgage loan Hilton Santa Barbara Beachfront Resort 4.17% December 2026 165 Total Fixed Rate Debt 4.16% (1) 2,177 Variable Rate Debt Revolving credit facility (2)\nUnsecured L + 1.50% December 2021 (3) — Term loan Unsecured L + 1.45% December 2021 750 Mortgage loan DoubleTree Hotel Ontario Airport L + 2.25% May 2022 (3) 30 Total Variable Rate Debt 3.36% (1) 780 Less: unamortized deferred financing costs and discount\n(11 ) Total Debt (4) 3.95% (1) $ 2,946\n(1) Calculated on a weighted average basis.
