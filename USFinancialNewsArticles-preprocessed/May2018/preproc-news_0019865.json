    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- LendingClub Corporation (NYSE: LC), America's largest online lending marketplace connecting borrowers and investors, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018.\nFinancial highlights for the first quarter include:\nDelivered revenue of $151.7 million, up 22% year-over-year Achieved 18% year-over-year growth in originations to over $2.3 billion Improved Contribution Margin to 49.1% from 42.7% in the same quarter last year Delivered Adjusted EBITDA of $15.3 million, or a 10.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA of $0.2 million, or a 0.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin, in the same quarter last year GAAP Consolidated Net Loss was ($31.2) million, including $17 million of expenses related to outstanding legacy issues disclosed by the Company in 2016, related to ongoing legal costs from government investigations, as well indemnification costs for the previous management\nOperational highlights for the first quarter include:\nIn the first quarter of 2018, LendingClub continued to execute on its mission to make credit more affordable and investing more rewarding, now having served over 2.4 million borrowers.\nFor Borrowers: LendingClub saw strong adoption of a new feature called Direct Payoff that allows borrowers to seamlessly pay off their credit card balances in exchange for a better rate - thereby improving their financial profile and lowering their monthly payments. For Investors: LendingClub's recently launched innovation, CLUB Certificates, attracted over $160 million in funding from several of the top names in asset management. The new CLUB Certificates give investors easy access to consumer credit and provide a single security that offers greater flexibility and liquidity.\nScott Sanborn, LendingClub CEO said, \"We feel good about how we've kicked off the year and the fundamentals of our business continue to be strong. Our strategic initiatives are working on both sides of our marketplace and we'll keep innovating to help more Americans on their journey to financial success.\"\nThree Months Ended\n($ in millions)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nOriginations\n$\n2,306.0\n$\n2,438.3\n$\n1,958.7\nNet Revenue\n$\n151.7\n$\n156.5\n$\n124.5\nGAAP Consolidated Net Loss\n$\n(31.2)\n$\n(92.1)\n$\n(29.8)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n15.3\n$\n19.0\n$\n0.2\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA excludes legal and regulatory expense related to outstanding legacy issues. Please see the discussion below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Measures\" and the reconciliation at the end of this release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nCommenting on financial results, Tom Casey, LendingClub CFO said, \"In the first quarter we delivered both strong growth and Adjusted EBITDA profitability as we continue to leverage the scale of our platform and execute against our targets.\"\nOriginations – Loan originations in the first quarter of 2018 were $2.31 billion, improving 18% compared to the same quarter last year and declining 5% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Revenue – Net Revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $151.7 million, improving 22% compared to the same quarter last year and declining 3% from the fourth quarter of 2017, driven primarily by a higher volume of loan originations in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter last year and a lower volume of loan originations in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP Consolidated Net Loss – GAAP Consolidated Net Loss was $31.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, declining $1.3 million compared to the same quarter last year and improving $60.9 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, driven primarily by costs associated with outstanding legacy issues of $17.0 million and class action settlement of $77.25 million during the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA (2) – Adjusted EBITDA was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, improving $15.2 million compared to the same quarter last year and declining $3.7 million from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEarnings Per Share (EPS) – Basic and diluted EPS attributable to LendingClub was $(0.07) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to basic and diluted EPS attributable to LendingClub of $(0.07) in the same quarter last year and $(0.22) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EPS (2) – Adjusted EPS was $0.01 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to adjusted EPS of $(0.02) in the same quarter last year and $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Securities Available for Sale – As of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaled $469.3 million, excluding $64.2 million in securities available for sale subject to regulatory risk retention requirements.\nLoans Held for Sale by the Company – As the Company continues to build its investor programs, it is using cash to accumulate loans for future transactions. Loans held for sale by the Company at the end of the first quarter of 2018 were $248.3 million, which were financed with $49.0 million of debt outstanding under the Company's warehouse credit facilities.\nOutlook\nBased on the information available as of May 8, 2018, LendingClub provides the following outlook for the second quarter and full year 2018:\nSecond Quarter 2018\nTotal Net Revenue in the range of $162 million to $172 million\nNet Income (Loss) (3) in the range of $(20) million to $(10) million\nAdjusted EBITDA (2)(3) in the range of $12 million to $22 million\nReconciling Items between GAAP Consolidated Net Loss and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA consisting of stock-based compensation of approximately $20 million, and depreciation, impairment, amortization and other net adjustments of approximately $12 million. Outstanding legacy issues are not forecasted in GAAP Net Income (Loss) or Adjusted EBITDA.\nFull Year 2018\nTotal Net Revenue in the range of $680 million to $705 million\nNet Income (Loss) (3) in the range of $(70) million to $(55) million\nAdjusted EBITDA (2)(3) in the range of $75 million to $90 million\nReconciling Items between GAAP Consolidated Net Loss and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA consisting of stock-based compensation of approximately $77 million, expenses related to outstanding legacy issues of $17 million that were recognized in the first quarter of 2018, and depreciation, impairment, amortization and other net adjustments of approximately $51 million.\n(2)\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see discussion below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Measures\" and the reconciliations at the end of this release.\n(3)\nForecasted GAAP Consolidated Net Loss excludes expenses associated with outstanding legacy issues, as those expenses are neither probable nor estimable as of the time of this earnings release. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS will also exclude expenses associated with outstanding legacy issues as more fully described in the discussion below under \"Non-GAAP Measures.\" We will update forecasted GAAP Consolidated Net Loss as expenses associated with outstanding legacy issues become available for the remainder of the year. For the first quarter, we recognized $17 million of expenses related to outstanding legacy issues, which are now reflected in our full year 2018 GAAP Consolidated Net Loss.\nAbout LendingClub\nLendingClub was founded to transform the banking system to make credit more affordable and investing more rewarding.

LendingClub has used, and intends to use, its investor relations website, Blog ( http://blog.lendingclub.com ), Twitter handle (@LendingClub) and Facebook page ( https://www.facebook.com/LendingClubTeam ) as a means of disclosing material non-public information and to comply with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: contribution, contribution margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted EPS. Our non-GAAP measures do have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under GAAP.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures provide management and investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.\nIn particular, we believe contribution and contribution margin are useful measures of direct product profitability because the measures illustrate the relationship between the costs most directly associated with revenue generating activities and the related revenue, and the effectiveness of the direct costs in obtaining revenue. Contribution is calculated as net revenue less \"sales and marketing\" and \"origination and servicing\" expenses on the Company's Statements of Operations, adjusted to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense within these captions and (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Contribution margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by dividing contribution by total net revenue. We believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are important measures of operating performance because it allows for the comparison of our core operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period to period by removing outstanding legacy issues that will result in elevated legal costs (including ongoing regulatory and government investigations, indemnification obligations and litigation), the impact of depreciation, impairment and amortization in our asset base, share-based compensation, income tax effects, and other non-operating expenses. We believe adjusted EPS is a useful measure used by investors and analysts in our sector because non-cash items like stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles can vary significantly due to many factors unrelated to the business, as well as certain other expenses that are unrelated to business performance, such as outstanding legacy issues discussed below.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the company included a new adjustment for outstanding legacy issues that result in elevated legal costs (including ongoing regulatory and government investigations, indemnification obligations and litigation), to calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We expect expenses in the future to include resolution of additional matters that arose from legacy management, including indemnification legal expenses paid by the Company for former employees, and settlements of regulatory investigations and examinations. Legacy legal expenses incurred in 2017 and prior were generally offset by insurance proceeds, resulting in no net material cumulative impact to earnings. As such, prior period amounts were not reclassified for the change in how we calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus their most comparable GAAP measure. In particular, many of the adjustments to derive the non-GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items, specifically stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, impairment and amortization in our asset base, outstanding legacy issues that will result in elevated legal costs (including ongoing regulatory and government investigations, indemnification obligations and litigation) and the related income tax effects of the aforementioned exclusions that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of such measures to the nearest GAAP measure, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\" tables at the end of this release.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nSome of the statements above, including statements regarding borrower and investor demand and anticipated future financial results are \" .\" The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"outlook,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"will,\" \"would\" and similar expressions may identify , although not all contain these identifying words.
