(tZERO) today announced that Bruce Fenton, distinguished blockchain pioneer, will join the tZERO Board of Directors. In addition, due to significant international interest in the offering as a result of an Asia roadshow, tZERO announced the extension of the Subsequent Sale Period for its tZERO Preferred Equity Token (tZERO Security Token) Offering (STO). Pursuant to the extension, the Subsequent Sale Period is now expected to run through, and including, June 29, 2018, which is the new “Expiration Date.”\nPatrick M. Byrne, Executive Chairman of tZERO, said: “Over the course of the tZERO Security Token Offering, late stage interest especially from overseas investors and trading platforms in the projects that tZERO is undertaking has grown significantly. In addition, we have not waited for the offering to be over to scale up the firm in a way to prepare it for its future. Today, we added cryptoroyalty Bruce Fenton to our Board of Directors. Along with the continuing service of SpeedRoute founder and director Joseph Cammarata, the tZERO board of directors combines the highest levels of blockchain expertise and capital markets expertise. Also, last week we announced the move of Saum Noursalehi to CEO with me staying just as committed as Executive Chairman. I gave extensive reasons then, but they amount to Saum being the most agile, entrepreneurial technologist that I have ever met. In its four year blockchain history, Medici Ventures has accumulated some outstanding senior blockchain engineer talent with which tZERO’s fine engineering staff is being beefed up. In short, the Mothership (Overstock and Medici) are scaling up this company ahead of the capital raise’s completion.”\nByrne continued, “However, between the recent arrival of interest from overseas trading platforms and other investors considering purchasing tZERO Security Tokens in our offering, and the significant evolution that has occurred within the firm (e.g., acquisitions and additions to management) since the inception of the STO, we believe that the best thing to do is to extend the Subsequent Sale Period to accommodate the administrative needs of late arrivals. We will also offer a brief period for withdrawals if existing investors so desire.”\ntZERO intends to release a new supplement to the Amended, Supplemented and Restated Private Placement Offering Memorandum dated March 1, 2018 (New Supplement). The New Supplement will contain important information for investors in the tZERO Security Token Offering, including the availability of a Withdrawal Period that will be made available to all investors. The Withdrawal Period will open upon release of the New Supplement and end at 5 pm EDT on the fifth business day thereafter. tZERO intends to hold an investor call shortly after the release of the New Supplement to provide information and to answer investor questions relating to the tZERO Security Token Offering.\nAs of May 12, 2018, tZERO has raised $110.6 million pursuant to Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs), with $96.3 million in funds received.\nDuring the Subsequent Sale Period, tZERO Security Tokens are being sold at a price of $10.00 per tZERO Security Token, subject to discretionary discounts. All rights to acquire tZERO Security Tokens are sold pursuant to SAFEs, which may be accessed electronically via RenGen Labs, formerly known as SaftLaunch.com or StartEngine.com .\ntZERO’s CEO, Saum Noursalehi, said, “We are excited about the reception we’ve received from the community during our Subsequent Sale Period. We would like to thank our partners StartEngine and SaftLaunch that are facilitating timely and efficient interactions with investors. To maximize the opportunity for investor participation, we have decided to extend the tZERO Security Token Offering until June 29, 2018.”\nPatrick Byrne added, “I want to thank our current and future tZERO SAFE holders, who have invested in the tZERO Security Token Offering. There are a lot of kinks that we have had to work out as we pioneer a new way securities offerings can be accomplished. We are changing an industry here: disruption takes time.”\n“I want to thank former tZERO board member Raj Karkara for his service and contribution to tZERO’s accomplishments,” concluded Byrne.\nThe Subsequent Sale Period and the Expiration Date may be further extended or shortened in the Company’s sole discretion.\nAbout Bruce Fenton:\nBruce Fenton is an experienced economic advisor and an active member of the blockchain industry.
