FILE PHOTO - The Facebook logo is shown at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, U.S. May 26, 2010. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo\nThey did not immediately give vote tallies at the annual meeting in Menlo Park, California, which was webcast.\nThat left unclear to what extent outside investors cast ballots in favor of the company and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who with other insiders controls about 60 percent of votes at the world’s largest social media network.\nFacebook has been under scrutiny from regulators and shareholders about its internal controls and oversight after it failed to protect the data of some 87 million users that was shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.\nZuckerberg at the meeting outlined changes it plans in response such as verifying the identity of advertising and increasing security spending.
