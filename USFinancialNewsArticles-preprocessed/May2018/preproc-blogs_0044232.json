The ropes burn irregularly like fuses when lit at either end. The first rope burns in e = 2.71828…hours and the second rope burns in √2 = 1.414213… hours.\nProduce a time interval as close as possible to 1 hour.\nNick’s Birthday\nA while back, Nick stated: “Sometime during last year, I was still 21; in two days I’ll be in my 25th year.”\nWhat day of the year is Nick’s birthday and on what day of the year is he speaking?\nSee answers to last week’s puzzles below.\nCome back next week for answers and more puzzles.\nNote: Comments may include spoilers.\nThe National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) is North America’s only museum devoted to mathematics. Learn more at momath.org .\n****\nAnswers\nIn Pondering Productivity , the hens in both farms are equally productive. Smith’s farm produces 245 eggs in 6 days; Jones’s farm produces 6,125 eggs in 24 days. In Cornfield Planning , cut out quarter circles on the corners with radius = 100/(2 + √π) = 26.5079… feet. This gives an area-to-perimeter ratio of 100/(2 + √π) = 26.5079…\nSee MoMath’s website for extended solutions.\nShare this: Previous Springing For Drinks (Thursday Crossword, May 17) Next Clued In (Crossword Contest, May 18)",
