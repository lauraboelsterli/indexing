    "text": "MEXICO CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FIBRA Macquarie México (FIBRA Macquarie) (BMV:FIBRAMQ) announced that Michael Brennan has been appointed as an independent member of the Technical Committee and the Ethics and Corporate Governance Committee. Mr. Brennan brings a wealth of knowledge to the Committee from his extensive US REIT industry experience. The Technical Committee is now comprised of 83% independent members.\n“We are excited to welcome Michael to the Technical Committee. Michael’s experience in founding and growing several successful real estate investment vehicles will be invaluable to FIBRA Macquarie. We look forward to benefitting from Michael’s significant expertise as we continuously develop and execute on our objectives to create long term value for investors,” stated Juan Monroy, chief executive officer of FIBRA Macquarie.\nMichael Brennan is a co-founder, chairman, and managing principal of Brennan Investment Group. Mr. Brennan has orchestrated more than US$14 billion in industrial real estate transactions in the course of his 33-year career.\nPrior to forming Brennan Investment Group, Mr. Brennan co-founded First Industrial Realty Trust (NYSE: FR) in 1994, and served as president, chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors until late 2008.\nBefore co-founding First Industrial Realty Trust, Mr. Brennan was a president and partner in The Shidler Group, a nationally prominent US real estate firm.
