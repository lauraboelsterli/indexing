It's like we're mentally in prison.\"\nshow chapters Trump's fight against 'fake news' has been a boon for media companies 11:50 AM ET Tue, 24 April 2018 | 01:49 More from USA Today:\nKanye West: I was 'drugged out' on opioids leading up to 2016 hospitalization\nTime's Up calls for boycott; Kelly denounces 'public lynching'\nRapper Lil Lonnie fatally shot in Mississippi\nAfter that comment, TMZ's Van Lathan interjected.\n\"I think what you're doing right now is actually the absence of thought,\" Lathan said. \"And while you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you've earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives. We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice.\"\nWest later took to Twitter to defend himself.\n\"Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will,\" he tweeted. \"My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved.\" He added: \"They cut our tongues so we couldn't communicate to each other. I will not allow my tongue to be cut ... they can no longer stop our voice.\"\nKanye West tweet 1\nKanye West tweet 2\nBut that wasn't before the rest of Twitter had something to say about West's words.\nJimmy Kimmel called his entire TMZ appearance \"wild.\"\nJimmy Kimmel tweet\nFeminist writer Roxane Gay tweeted, \"I don't have the energy for nonsense but Kanye â€¦ is a free moron who doesn't read.\"\nRoxane Gay tweet\n\"What in the Andy Kaufman is going on here?\" asked Questlove, invoking the late comedian with a reputation for being erratic.\nQuestlove tweet\n\"It all makes sense now,\" actor Jon Cryer joked, in response to West's slavery comments.\nJon Cryer tweet\nJournalist Phili Mwaniki tweeted in support of Lathan: \"Years from now,\" people will ask, \"Where were you when this dude shut Kanye up?\"\nPhili Mwaniki tweet\nWriter Oliver Willis joked his \"congratulations\" to new Fox News hire Kanye.\nOliver Willis tweet\nMat Johnson likened West to Samuel L.
