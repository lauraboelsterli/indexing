FILE PHOTO: French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech during the AMF congress, the annual meeting of French mayors, in Paris, France, November 23, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\nVatican spokesman Greg Burke said both sides were organizing a visit for late June but no further details were available.\nIn April, Macron called for stronger ties between the state and the Catholic Church, a move critics said blurred a line that has kept French government free of religious intervention for generations. [nL8N1RN50P]\nThe issue is particularly sensitive in historically Catholic France, where matters of faith and state were separated by law in 1905 and which is now home to Europe’s largest Muslim and Jewish communities.\nFrance’s guiding principles also hold that religious observance is a private matter, for all faiths.\nRaised in a non-religious family, Macron was baptized a Roman Catholic at his own request when he was 12.\nUnder a tradition that began in the 15th century when France was a monarchy, French leaders are automatically given the title of “First and Only Honorary Canon” of the Rome Basilica of St John’s in Lateran, which is also the pope’s cathedral in his capacity as bishop of Rome.\nMost French leaders visiting Rome usually attend a special service there.
