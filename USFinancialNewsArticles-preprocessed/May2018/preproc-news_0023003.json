    "text": "WHITTIER, Calif., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Friendly Hills Bank (the “bank”) (OTCBB:FHLB) reported results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFor the three month period ending March 31, 2018, the bank reported net income of $192,000 or $0.10 per diluted share of common stock. The bank reported net income of $162,000 or $0.08 per diluted share of common stock for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the bank reported total assets of $155.7 million, the same figure as of March 31, 2017. The bank’s loan portfolio, net of unearned income, decreased 2% from $83.0 million as of March 31, 2017, to $81.4 million as of March 31, 2018. The portfolio remains diversified with $28.3 million or 34% in Commercial & Industrial Loans to local businesses (including $17.2 million in Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate Loans), $21.8 million or 27% in Residential Real Estate Loans to investors and $26.0 million or 32% in Commercial Real Estate Loans to investors. The bank has an additional $24.3 million in unfunded loan commitments.\nThe bank’s overall deposit base has decreased 9% in the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, from $123.2 million as of March 31, 2017, to $112.2 million as of March 31, 2018. Non-interest bearing deposits remain a substantial part of the deposit base (38%), despite decreasing from $51.5 million as of March 31, 2017, to $42.6 million as of March 31, 2018. During the same time period interest-bearing deposits decreased from $71.7 million as of March 31, 2017, to $69.6 million on March 31, 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, shareholders’ equity was $16.1 million and the bank’s total risk-based capital ratio was 18%, significantly exceeding the “well-capitalized” level of 10% prescribed under regulatory requirements. The bank also continues to maintain substantial liquidity positions, retaining significant balances of liquidity as well as available collateralized borrowings and other potential sources of liquidity.\n“It is normal for the bank to experience volatility in its deposit base due to the high concentration of core deposits in our balance sheet,” commented Jeffrey K. Ball, Chief Executive Officer. “We did experience an unusually higher amount of volatility right at the end of the quarter which is not associated with any meaningful decrease in deposit relationships. The bank continues to maintain a strong balance sheet as reflected in asset quality, deposit strength and a sufficient capital base for continued long-term growth in shareholder value. Meanwhile, increased earnings are primarily associated with higher asset yields from rising interest rates and the benefits of the lower effective corporate income tax rate.”\nCompany Profile:\nFriendly Hills Bank is a community bank which was formed to primarily serve the Southern California communities of eastern Los Angeles County and northern Orange County. The bank was established in 2006 by prominent members of the local community who were seeking an alternative to the larger financial institutions in the area. The bank is headquartered in Whittier, California with an additional branch office in Santa Fe Springs, California.
