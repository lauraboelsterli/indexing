    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cara Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CARA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pruritus and pain by selectively targeting peripheral kappa opioid receptors, today announced that the Company will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET to report first quarter 2018 financial results and provide a corporate update.\nTo participate in the conference call, please dial 855-445-2816 (domestic) or 484-756-4300 (international) and refer to conference ID 1264618. A live webcast of the call can be accessed under “Events and Presentations” in the News & Investors section of the Company’s website at www.CaraTherapeutics.com .\nAn archived webcast recording will be available on the Cara website beginning approximately two hours after the call.\nAbout Cara Therapeutics\nCara Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pruritus and pain by selectively targeting peripheral kappa opioid receptors (KORs). Cara is developing a novel and proprietary class of product candidates, led by KORSUVA™ (CR845/difelikefalin), a first-in-class KOR agonist that targets the body's peripheral nervous system, as well as certain immune cells. In Phase 2 trials, KORSUVA injection has demonstrated statistically significant reductions in itch intensity and concomitant improvement in quality of life measures in hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) and is currently being investigated in Phase 3 trials in hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP. Additionally, CR845/difelikefalin has demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe pain, without inducing many of the undesirable side effects typically associated with currently available opioid pain therapeutics.\nThe FDA has conditionally accepted KORSUVA™ as the trade name for difelikefalin injection. CR845/difelikefalin is an investigational drug product, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\nINVESTOR CONTACT:\nMichael Schaffzin\nStern Investor Relations\n212-362-1200\nmichael@sternir.com\nMEDIA CONTACT:\nAnnie Starr\n6 Degrees\n973-415-8838\nastarr@6degreespr.com\nSource:Cara Therapeutics, Inc.",
