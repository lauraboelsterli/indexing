    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Thursday that imposing tariffs on imported vehicles “could hurt American jobs” and boost consumer costs.\nFILE PHOTO: Visitors look at car models on the Toyota stand during the 88th Geneva International Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland, March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he had directed the U.S. Commerce Department to open a probe into whether vehicle and auto parts imports pose national security risks.\nTrade associations representing major foreign automakers and auto parts suppliers have also criticized the planned investigation. Toyota noted in its statement on Twitter that it has 10 U.S. plants and 1,500 U.S. dealers.\nReporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ",
