    "text": "NATCHEZ, Miss., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Callon Petroleum Company (NYSE: CPE) (\"Callon\" or the \"Company\") today reported results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nPresentation slides accompanying this earnings release are available on the Company's website at www.callon.com located on the \"Presentations\" page within the Investors section of the site.\nFinancial and operational highlights for 2018 and other recent data points include:\nIncreased production to 26.6 MBoepd (77% oil), an increase of 30% year-over-year Reduced lease operating expense by 18% year-over-year to $5.45 per BOE Generated a first quarter operating margin of $44.31 per BOE, an increase of 30% year-over-year Successful early results from Wolfcamp A down-spacing test in Howard County with 10-well spacing exceeding the performance of offsetting eight-well spacing pads Initial production rates from the first two-well pad targeting the upper and lower Wolfcamp A intervals in Ward County have reached approximately 1,700 Boepd (85% oil) to date from each of the wells within the first 20 days of production Improved drilling efficiency in the Delaware Basin has resulted in a greater than 25% increase in footage per day through the first six operated wells\nJoe Gatto, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are pleased to deliver another solid quarter of execution while positioning ourselves for an increased level of baseline activity. During the first quarter, we added a fifth horizontal drilling rig and made substantial progress completing our Delaware Basin infrastructure initiatives to support the next phase of program development on our Permian footprint. Similar to our proactive past investments in the Midland Basin, our established facilities and takeaway investments in the Spur area will help preserve our leading cash margins for the long-term.\" He continued, \"The first quarter also produced drilling and completion efficiency gains that were ahead of expectations. Combined with strong well productivity across the portfolio and a low-cost operating structure, the stage is set for robust production growth and cash flow generation in the coming quarters.\"\nOperations Update\nAt March 31, 2018, we had 247 gross (184.5 net) horizontal wells producing from eight established flow units in the Permian Basin. Net daily production for the three months ended March 31, 2018 grew approximately 30% to 26.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (77% oil) as compared to the same period of 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, we drilled 16 gross (13.2 net) horizontal wells in the Spur, WildHorse, and Monarch areas. We placed a combined 15 gross (9.0 net) horizontal wells on production in the quarter.\nMidland Basin\nDuring the first quarter, nearly all wells placed on production were located in the Midland Basin, with the majority of this activity split between our Ranger area in Reagan County and our Monarch area in Midland County. Wells placed on production in Reagan County averaged approximately 7,300 feet of completed lateral. At Monarch, new wells averaged just under 6,000 feet. During the last week of the quarter, two wells were placed on production in Howard County.\nOur initial Wolfcamp A down-spacing test in the Fairway area of WildHorse has yielded encouraging results through the first 120 days of production. Compared to offset two-well pads completed with a similar design, the test wells, the Open A2 #1AH and Open A3 #3AH, have both eclipsed the cumulative oil production of each of the four offset wells. The Company will continue monitoring production from the test wells over the next few months prior to initiating any additional testing of reduced spacing at WildHorse.\nDelaware Basin\nOur first two-well pad in the Spur area targeting two flow units in the Wolfcamp A was completed and placed on production in April. Each of the wells, the Rendezvous A1 #01LA and A2 #09UA, has achieved a production rate of approximately 1,700 Boepd (85% oil) per well during the first 20 days of production and continue to be optimized.\nCallon continues to progress efficiency gains as our activity levels increase in the Delaware Basin. Through our first six operated wells, the Company has continued to improve drilling day cycle times, with our most recent well reflecting an improvement of greater than 25% in daily footage compared to our first well drilled in Spur. Additionally, we have been proactive in our infrastructure build-out to support long-term development efficiency and sustained cash margins, similar to our past efforts in the Midland Basin. We have recently progressed or completed a number of infrastructure projects including: multiple saltwater disposal upgrades, installation of water transfer lines, installation of recycling facilities, build-out of two separate one million barrel recycle pits and installation of numerous tank batteries to accommodate future drilling activity. Additionally, we expect to have new tank batteries tied into Medallion pipeline during the second quarter, increasing our longer-term take-away capacities and providing additional delivery point optionality under our current gathering agreement.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, we incurred $105.3 million in cash operational capital expenditures (including other items) compared to $128.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Total capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized expenses, are detailed below on an accrual and cash basis (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nOperational\nCapitalized\nCapitalized\nTotal Capital\nCapital (a)\nInterest\nG&A\nExpenditures\nCash basis (b)\n$\n105,330\n$\n813\n$\n5,187\n$\n111,330\nTiming adjustments (c)\n11,472\n9,255\n—\n20,727\nNon-cash items\n—\n—\n1,110\n1,110\nAccrual (GAAP) basis\n$\n116,802\n$\n10,068\n$\n6,297\n$\n133,167\n(a)\nIncludes seismic, land and other items.\n(b)\nCash basis is a non-GAAP measure that we believe helps users of the financial information reconcile amounts to the cash flow statement and to account for timing related operational changes such as our development pace and rig count.\n(c)\nIncludes timing adjustments related to cash disbursements in the current period for capital expenditures incurred in the prior period.\nOperating and Financial Results\nThe following table presents summary information for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet production\nOil (MBbls)\n1,851\n1,936\n1,434\nNatural gas (MMcf)\n3,240\n3,018\n2,422\nTotal (MBOE)\n2,391\n2,439\n1,838\nAverage daily production (BOE/d)\n26,567\n26,511\n20,422\n% oil (BOE basis)\n77%\n79%\n78%\nOil and natural gas revenues (in thousands)\nOil revenue\n$\n115,286\n$\n104,132\n$\n72,008\nNatural gas revenue (a)\n12,154\n14,081\n9,355\nTotal revenue\n127,440\n118,213\n81,363\nImpact of cash-settled derivatives\n(8,459)\n(4,501)\n(2,491)\nAdjusted Total Revenue (i)\n$\n118,981\n$\n113,712\n$\n78,872\nAverage realized sales price\n(excluding impact of cash settled derivatives)\nOil (Bbl)\n$\n62.28\n$\n53.79\n$\n50.21\nNatural gas (Mcf)\n3.75\n4.67\n3.86\nTotal (BOE)\n53.30\n48.47\n44.27\nAverage realized sales price\n(including impact of cash settled derivatives)\nOil (Bbl)\n$\n57.47\n$\n51.28\n$\n48.45\nNatural gas (Mcf)\n3.89\n4.78\n3.88\nTotal (BOE)\n49.76\n46.62\n42.91\nAdditional per BOE data\nSales price (b)\n$\n53.30\n$\n48.47\n$\n44.27\nLease operating expense (c)\n5.45\n4.84\n6.61\nGathering and treating expense (a)\n—\n0.57\n0.43\nProduction taxes\n3.54\n2.55\n3.21\nOperating margin\n$\n44.31\n$\n40.51\n$\n34.02\nDepletion, depreciation and amortization\n$\n14.81\n$\n14.98\n$\n13.29\nAdjusted G&A (d)\nCash component (e)\n$\n2.74\n$\n2.46\n$\n2.43\nNon-cash component\n0.51\n0.54\n0.57\n(a)\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the revenue recognition accounting standard.

See the reconciliation provided within this press release for a reconciliation of G&A expense on a GAAP basis to Adjusted G&A expense.\n(e)\nExcludes the amortization of equity-settled share-based incentive awards and corporate depreciation and amortization.\nTotal Revenue. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Callon reported total revenue of $127.4 million and total revenue including cash-settled derivatives (\"Adjusted Total Revenue,\" a non-GAAP financial measure (i) ) of $118.9 million, including the impact of an $8.5 million loss from the settlement of derivative contracts. The table above reconciles Adjusted Total Revenue to the related GAAP measure of the Company's revenue. Average daily production for the quarter was 26.6 MBOE/d compared to average daily production of 26.5 MBOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2017. Average realized prices, including and excluding the effects of hedging, are detailed above.\nHedging impacts. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Callon recognized the following hedging-related items (in thousands, except per unit data):\nIn Thousands\nPer Unit\nOil derivatives\nNet loss on settlements\n$\n(8,916)\n$\n(4.81)\nNet gain on fair value adjustments\n4,067\nTotal loss on oil derivatives\n$\n(4,849)\nNatural gas derivatives\nNet gain on settlements\n$\n457\n$\n0.14\nNet loss on fair value adjustments\n(89)\nTotal gain on natural gas derivatives\n$\n368\nTotal oil & natural gas derivatives\nNet loss on settlements\n$\n(8,459)\n$\n(3.54)\nNet gain on fair value adjustments\n3,978\nTotal loss on total oil & natural gas derivatives\n$\n(4,481)\nLease Operating Expenses, including workover (\"LOE\"). LOE per BOE for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $5.45 per BOE, compared to LOE of $4.84 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in this metric was primarily related to interim water hauling in Reagan County and certain equipment rental expenses.\nProduction Taxes, including ad valorem taxes. Production taxes were $3.54 per BOE for the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing approximately 6.6% of total revenue before the impact of derivative settlements.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\"). DD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $14.81 per BOE compared to $14.98 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease is attributable to our increased estimated proved reserves relative to our depreciable base and assumed future development costs related to undeveloped proved reserves as a result of additions made through our horizontal drilling efforts and acquisitions.\nGeneral and Administrative (\"G&A\"). G&A, excluding certain non-cash incentive share-based compensation valuation adjustments, (\"Adjusted G&A\", a non-GAAP measure (i) ) was $7.8 million, or $3.25 per BOE, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $7.3 million, or $3.00 per BOE, for the fourth quarter of 2017. The cash component of Adjusted G&A was $6.5 million, or $2.74 per BOE, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $6.0 million, or $2.46 per BOE, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, G&A and Adjusted G&A, which excludes the amortization of equity-settled, share-based incentive awards and corporate depreciation and amortization, are calculated as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nTotal G&A expense\n$\n8,769\nLess: Change in the fair value of liability share-based awards (non-cash)\n(991)\nAdjusted G&A – total\n7,778\nLess: Restricted stock share-based compensation (non-cash)\n(1,105)\nLess: Corporate depreciation & amortization (non-cash)\n(124)\nAdjusted G&A – cash component\n$\n6,549\nIncome tax expense. Callon provides for income taxes at a statutory rate of 21% adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized, which primarily relate to non-deductible executive compensation expenses, restricted stock windfalls and shortfalls, and state income taxes. We recorded an income tax expense of $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 which relates to deferred State of Texas gross margin tax. At March 31, 2018 we had a valuation allowance of $49.2 million. Adjusted Income per fully diluted common share, a non-GAAP financial measure (i) , adjusts our income (loss) available to common stockholders to reflect our theoretical tax provision of $11.8 million (or $0.06 per diluted share) for the quarter as if the valuation allowance did not exist.\n2018 Guidance Update\nThe Company adopted the Revenue from Contracts with Customers accounting standard on January 1, 2018. Starting with 2018, certain natural gas gathering and treating expenses were accounted for as a reduction to revenue.\nFirst Quarter\nFull Year\n2018 Actual\n2018 Guidance\nTotal production (MBOE/d)\n26.6\n29.5 - 32.0\n% oil\n77%\n77%\nIncome statement expenses (per BOE)\nLOE, including workovers\n$5.45\n$5.25 - $6.25\nProduction taxes, including ad valorem (% unhedged revenue)\n7%\n6%\nAdjusted G&A: cash component (a)\n$2.74\n$1.75 - $2.50\nAdjusted G&A: non-cash component (b)\n$0.51\n$0.50 - $1.00\nInterest expense (c)\n$0.00\n$0.00\nEffective income tax rate\n22%\n22%\nCapital expenditures ($MM, accrual basis)\nOperational (d)\n$117\n$500 - $540\nCapitalized expenses\n$16\n$60 - $70\nNet operated horizontal wells placed on production\n9\n43 - 46\n(a)\nExcludes stock-based compensation and corporate depreciation and amortization.\n(b)\nExcludes certain non-recurring expenses and non-cash valuation adjustments.\n(c)\nAll interest expense anticipated to be capitalized.\n(d)\nIncludes seismic, land and other items.

The Company also has included this information because changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which the company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Discretionary cash flow is calculated using net income (loss) adjusted for certain items including depreciation, depletion and amortization, the impact of financial derivatives (including the mark-to-market effects, net of cash settlements and premiums paid or received related to our financial derivatives), accretion expense, restructuring and other non-recurring costs, deferred income taxes and other non-cash income items. Callon believes that the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted G&A is useful to investors because it provides readers with a meaningful measure of our recurring G&A expense and provides for greater comparability period-over-period. The table above details all adjustments to G&A on a GAAP basis to arrive at Adjusted G&A. We believe that the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income available to common shareholders (\"Adjusted Income\") and Adjusted Income per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. These measures exclude the net of tax effects of certain non-recurring items and non-cash valuation adjustments, which are detailed in the reconciliation provided above. Prior to being tax-effected and excluded, the amounts reflected in the determination of Adjusted Income and Adjusted Income per diluted share above were computed in accordance with GAAP. We calculate Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") as Adjusted Income plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flow provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to our performance or ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the Adjusted EBITDA we present may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Total Revenue is useful to investors because it provides readers with a revenue value more comparable to other companies who account for derivative contracts and hedges and include their effects in revenue. We believe Adjusted Total Revenue is also useful to investors as a measure of the actual cash inflows generated during the period.\nEarnings Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018, to discuss first quarter 2018 financial and operating results.\nPlease join Callon Petroleum Company via the Internet for a webcast of the conference call:\nDate/Time:\nThursday, May 3, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Central Time (9:00 a.m. Eastern Time)\nWebcast:\nSelect \"IR Calendar\" under the \"Investors\" section of the website: www.callon.com .\nPresentation Slides:\nSelect \"Presentations\" under the \"Investors\" section of the website: www.callon.com .\nAlternatively, you may join by telephone using the following numbers:\nToll Free:\n1-888-317-6003\nCanada Toll Free:\n1-866-284-3684\nInternational:\n1-412-317-6061\nAccess code:\n4895442\nAn archive of the conference call webcast will be available at www.callon.com under the \"Investors\" section of the website.\nAbout Callon Petroleum\nCallon Petroleum Company is an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration, and operation of oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin in West Texas.\nThis news release is posted on the Company's website at www.callon.com and will be archived there for subsequent review under the \"News\" link on the top of the homepage.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include all statements regarding wells anticipated to be drilled and placed on production; future levels of drilling activity and associated production and cash flow expectations; the Company's 2018 guidance and capital expenditure forecast; estimated reserve quantities and the present value thereof; and the implementation of the Company's business plans and strategy, as well as statements including the words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"plans\" and words of similar meaning.
