Hope it's the right one!\nJay Miller subscriber 5pts\nNot a typical Marie Kelly puzzle--way too easy.\nJack Sullivan user 5pts\nI'm on the beach, he said, with trepidation.\nArnold Brockman subscriber 5pts\nI Am On Shore...Pretty Sure !\nPhilip Egan subscriber 5pts\nI'm ashore after a relatively easy swim. So easy that I am nervous to some extent. But, my answer is a \"most excellent\" fit\nDave Darrah subscriber 5pts\nThink I've got it. The 'aha' moment for this one is nowhere near the magnitude of others. And Robert, or whoever is handling the stats this week: You can call me Al, uh, no, wait, you can call me OGuyDave!\nMIKE MILLER staff 5pts\nAn update to my post below: I am now hearing that the comments on this and other WSJ blogs may not be ready Monday morning. We will get them back up ASAP. Let's make this plan: As soon as they're up, we'll continue the contest conversation on the comments for whatever is the most recent daily crossword.\nThe workings of the contest are unaffected. Same ways to submit an answer. We'll still notify a winner on Monday.\nThanks for bearing with us--apologies again for the disruption of this delightful forum! Robert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ MIKE MILLER Good luck. Software changes are always a challenge MIKE MILLER staff 5pts\n@ Robert Stevens @ MIKE MILLER Thanks! And thanks for being such a great captain of this crew.\nBarbara Koehler subscriber 5pts\n@ MIKE MILLER Nice that you arranged to have an easy puzzle the week of the software change so people won't be desperate for explanations after midnight Sunday.\nArnold Brockman subscriber 5pts\nRobert-\nAre You Going On A Danube River Cruise???-If So- Best Vacation We Ever Had\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Arnold Brockman We are gong by land with Overseas Adventure Travel. We talked about the pros and cons of a land vs river cruise and went for land. I am sure either would be a great choice.\nJuliet Cole user 5pts\nIn spite of rumors that there's pageantry involved, I'm confident that the meta is clearly revealed, and confirmed by the title. I'm confident enough to head for shore where I will be enjoying the sun, sand, waves, and refreshing beverages. Until midnight Sunday!\nMIKE MILLER staff 5pts\nAll--an important announcement about some work underway on the WSJ.com commenting tools that will affect this discussion.\nThe site is switching to a new commenting platform that we think/hope is even better than this one.\nThe comments on this site will be disabled at midnight Sunday night (Sunday into Monday). You'll still be able to read the comments but not add new ones.\nWe will continue this conversation in the comments for the Monday puzzle, right here at wsj.com/puzzles. That should be ready for comments on the new platform at 7am eastern time Monday. (As I understand it, there will be a period from midnight to 7am eastern time when neither puzzle will take comments.)\nApologies for the disruption! Consider it another puzzle for us all to solve.\nMany thanks and good luck with the contest,\nMike\nDiana Breithaupt user 5pts\n@ MIKE MILLER\nIs this because of my last song? \"No more stupid songs! We are changing the format.\" I knew I shouldn't have posted that.\nBarbara Koehler subscriber 5pts\n@ Diana Breithaupt @ MIKE MILLER More likely because your songs are such an important part of the board they're changing it to make it more music-friendly!\nTom Shea subscriber 5pts\nOn shore and starting a new winning streak (I hope). I hope Isaac didn't get used to my heavy tipping (and tippling) during the month of April.\nThere is a second level to the most obvious answer by my reckoning.\nCongratulations to Robert. Enjoy the vacation, and again many thanks for being the cruise director for this community.\nFRIDA CHEN user 5pts\n@ Tom Shea You're the first to mention this. Now you've gotten a lot of people worried.\nTom Shea subscriber 5pts\n@ FRIDA CHEN\nDon't worry. In fact, be re-assured. I still think it is the answer most people have come to. Not really a second level (apologies for creating worry), just a second arrow to the answer.\nBarbara Koehler subscriber 5pts\n@ Tom Shea I do not see another level, but the approach that worked was the second one I tried. The first did not lead to a four letter verb.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\nThe shuttles from the ship to the shore have been steady since 4:15 yesterday. At present we have 52 on the shore and overflowing into the shire.\nIf there is a second level, unlike Pageant, no one has indicated it - yet FRIDA CHEN user 5pts\n@ Robert Stevens 1st mention was just made by Tom\nDoug Morack user 5pts\nOn shore. Now back to the MMMM while I wait for the MGWCC.\nI took a look at what I wrote above and realized I sounded like an addict. Is there a Meta Anonymous group that meets regularly? I even got my Dad involved in this weeks' MMMM. AAAH! Now I'm a dealer!\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Doug Morack this is certainly a meta support group - whether we should worry about addiction and/or being a dealer is another question\nFRIDA CHEN user 5pts\n@ Doug Morack I'm a dealer, too. I've gotten one fully addicted. Some others are much younger and aren't even crossword puzzle addicts but they love the concept of the \"hidden\" meta and ask me to share the ones I think they could get....after I've filled in the grid for them and already know the solution..\nMATTHEW BASTIAN subscriber 5pts\nAshore! (And after being briefly distracted by a second, very defensible answer...we might have another PAGEANT week on our hands, folks.)\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ MATTHEW BASTIAN If you are correct, there will be a lot of us on the wrong shore. But with pageant, muggles started commenting that there was a deeper answer. that has not happened - yet\nAan Moser subscriber 5pts\nLike many others, I think I'm on shore, but not 100% certain.The solution fits with the meta topic and the clues. So, I'm claiming beach time and, come Monday, hope I don't find out I was only on a sandbar.\nHarry Reis user 5pts\nI suppose this is nit picking but technically the grid answer to 10D is wrong. The airport is not located in that city but rather nearby, and is officially (and deliberately) located between it and another well-known city.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Harry Reis Harry - that is probably true for most airports but for the sake of crossword puzzlers, the answer is always what is given in 10D Diana Breithaupt user 5pts\n@ Robert Stevens @ Harry Reis This reminds of the time I posted SFO wasn't the correct airport for the Niners touchdown clue, and someone argued with me. It could have been you Robert. That was long, long time ago. I couldn't say anything about why it was not correct because we aren't allowed to give spoilers to the meta grid. But it still festered in my mind until after the meta was revealed and then I actually bothered to come back and say how the Niners are based in Santa Clara and San Jose was closer than San Francisco, blah, blah, blah. I was so ridiculous to care. But Harry's post brings back fond memories. I'm laughing to myself how mad I got about that.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Diana Breithaupt @ Robert Stevens @ Harry Reis Diana - I remember that well but it was not moi. I did not know where the 49'ers flew out of.\nThe Patriots fly out of Providence. Closer to the stadium and probably cheaper to keep the plane. JOSEPH MICHAEL subscriber 5pts\nI wonder if it ever happens that there is a \"correct\" answer that wasn't intended by the puzzle designer? yet fits all the clues?\nCynthia Weatherman subscriber 5pts\n@ JOSEPH MICHAEL Of course there is but it is still wrong. See Pageant! LOL!\nRichard L Johnson subscriber 5pts\n(Cynthia) Solved. I think.\nJOSEPH MICHAEL subscriber 5pts\nAh, if I am sharp enough, I think I have it.\nNice example of how a met works, if I am correct.\nBarbara Koehler subscriber 5pts\nI finally got this week's MMMM. I'd had all the pieces right in front of me for over a day before a whack from a two by four helped me take the final step.\nAnd if I may brag a little, I've joined Al and Beth as early solvers of the mega meta.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Barbara Koehler You are in elite company\nEric Conrad user 5pts\nI was staring at the MMMM mega-meta (I think I am on the trail, but have lost two points to bad guesses), and forgot about the WSJ yesterday. I just solved the WSJ, and am on shore.\nI loved the clue for 63A.\nDan Coombes user 5pts\nWe discussed it, then slept on it. We woke up to the sound of waves crashing onto the shore. Gonna be a great weekend!\nPETER LEE subscriber 5pts\nOne of the few metas that helped me solve the grid. Ashore.\nGeorge Findling subscriber 5pts\nOn shore. Been travelling recently, so I'm a bit absent from the weekly roster.\nM Lembo user 5pts\nDone and done. Looking for that 'perfect position' with a little shade, a cool breeze and the tiki hut in sight!\nTo all, a great weekend!\nMary Flaminio user 5pts\non shore! Yippee!\nCynthia Weatherman subscriber 5pts\nAlas, another week with no mug and since I don't have an email from MGWCC, I assume another month with no pens. We may soon need a spreadsheet and support group for Muggles with the most solves and no wins from WSJ or MGWCC.\nBut, I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the prizes for my Fireball win. A ball cap and SEVEN autographed Peter Gordon puzzle books! I am enjoying my lunch more than ever as I eat and solve. If you are not a subscriber, now is the time. Next week is a meta!\nFor those of you looking for the click on MMMM, I suspect you are right on the edge of a solution.\nRobert, we will miss you while you are traveling. You will still solve the puzzle, correct? If you need tips on ways to secure a copy while traveling, several of us would be glad to give you pointers. Hotel front desks, boarding pass printers - any of those will do.\nI would volunteer but this is my busiest month of the year at work. I hope someone will volunteer to be your stand-in.\nDoug Morack user 5pts\n@ Cynthia Weatherman I'm having trouble closing the deal on the MMMM. I believe I have six of the seven \"answers\" and those pieces can be arranged into the name of a band in the RRHoF, but I'd sure like to confirm that last one before I submit my answer. By the way, I really liked the puzzle construction.\nCynthia Weatherman subscriber 5pts\n@ Doug Morack @ Cynthia Weatherman H take a closer look before you submit. Do you know someone who could confirm or deny your answer?\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Cynthia Weatherman Cynthia - do you know how to say \"print me the WSJ crossword contest\" in Czech, Slovakian and Hungarian? Cynthia Weatherman subscriber 5pts\n@ Robert Stevens @ Cynthia Weatherman Google translate!\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Cynthia Weatherman @ Robert Stevens Unfortunately, bring language handicapped, I have two problems 1) with some of those languages the pronunciation is a challenge and 2) my ability to remember a foreign language longer than 1/10 sec is non existent.\nShow More Archives ADVERTISEMENT Close Perfect Position (Crossword Contest, May 4)\nFrom [USER_EMAIL] To Message SEND An error has occurred, please try again later.\nThank you\nThis article has been sent to",
