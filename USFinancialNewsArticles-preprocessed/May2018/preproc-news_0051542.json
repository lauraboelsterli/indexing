Greg Johnson, senior vice president of marketing, will succeed Wernikoff as general manager of the Consumer Group.\n“I couldn’t be more confident in the state of the business and in Greg’s ability to lead us into the next chapter of our growth,” Smith said. “At the same time, I couldn’t be more proud of the foundation Dan has built. When he took this role in 2016, we agreed this would be a two or three-year assignment. In those two years, under Dan’s leadership, we’ve extended our lead in the do-it-yourself tax prep category, advanced our efforts to disrupt the assisted tax prep category and expanded our business beyond tax.”\nJohnson, a 20-year veteran in consumer-based businesses, has spent the last five years as an integral member of the senior leadership team, leading Intuit’s go-to-market initiatives, commercial innovation, analytics and marketing capabilities that have accelerated the growth of Intuit’s Tax business.\n“Greg is a seasoned executive who has been a driving force in the reinvention of our consumer business model. He spearheaded the introduction of Absolute Zero, helped bring TurboTax Self Employed and QuickBooks Self Employed together in the One Intuit Ecosystem and was a key member of the team that brought TurboTax Live and Turbo to market.\n“As we pass the baton to Greg, I want to thank Dan for an outstanding 2017 tax season and for positioning the business for continued growth for years to come,” said Smith.\nConference Call Details\nIntuit executives will discuss the financial results on a conference call at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time on May 22.

The effective date of the tax rate change was January 1, 2018. With our fiscal year ending July 31, the change will result in a blended lower U.S. statutory federal rate of 26.9% for fiscal year 2018. As a result, we adjusted our annual effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, as well as adjusted our U.S. net deferred tax asset balance at the lower rates.\nAs of April 30, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act; however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. We recorded a provisional charge of $39 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax balances. During the three months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded an additional provisional charge of $5 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax balances, resulting in a total tax expense of $44 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018.\nCurrent quarter and year to date income tax and effective tax rates\nFor the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $8 million and $41 million in our provision for income taxes. For the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $12 million and $38 million in our provision for income taxes.\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 was approximately 26% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 26.9%.\nOur effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017 were approximately 33% and 31%. Excluding discrete tax items primarily related to share-based compensation tax benefits, our effective tax rate for both periods was 34% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35%.\nTABLE B1 INTUIT INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nFiscal 2018 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Year to Date GAAP operating income (loss) $ (57 ) $ 20 $ 1,615 $ — $ 1,578 Amortization of acquired technology 2 3 5 — 10 Amortization of other acquired intangible assets 1 1 2 — 4 Professional fees for business combinations — 2 — — 2 Share-based compensation expense 97 94 92 — 283 Non-GAAP operating income (loss) $ 43 $ 120 $ 1,714 $ — $ 1,877 GAAP net income (loss) $ (17 ) $ (21 ) $ 1,200 $ — $ 1,162 Amortization of acquired technology 2 3 5 — 10 Amortization of other acquired intangible assets 1 1 2 — 4 Professional fees for business combinations — 2 — — 2 Share-based compensation expense 97 94 92 — 283 Net (gain) loss on debt securities and other investments 2 2 — — 4 Other income from divested businesses [A] — — (8 ) — (8 ) Tax Act [B] — 39 5 — 44 Other income tax effects and adjustments [B] (56 ) (29 ) (36 ) — (121 ) Non-GAAP net income (loss) $ 29 $ 91 $ 1,260 $ — $ 1,380 GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share $ (0.07 ) $ (0.08 ) $ 4.59 $ — $ 4.47 Amortization of acquired technology 0.01 0.01 0.02 — 0.04 Amortization of other acquired intangible assets — — 0.01 — 0.01 Professional fees for business combinations — 0.01 — — 0.01 Share-based compensation expense 0.38 0.36 0.35 — 1.09 Net (gain) loss on debt securities and other investments 0.01 0.01 — — 0.02 Other income from divested businesses [A] — — (0.03 ) — (0.03 ) Tax Act [B] — 0.15 0.02 — 0.17 Other income tax effects and adjustments [B] (0.22 ) (0.11 ) (0.14 ) — (0.48 ) Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share $ 0.11 $ 0.35 $ 4.82 $ — $ 5.30 Shares used in GAAP diluted per share calculation 256 256 262 — 260 Shares used in non-GAAP diluted per share calculation 259 260 262 — 260 [A] During the three months ended April 30, 2018, we received payments from contingent earn out provisions related to businesses we previously divested.

[C] As discussed in “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Income Tax Effects and Adjustments” following Table E, our non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items. Other income tax adjustments consist primarily of tax adjustments for the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments and the excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.

These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.\nWe compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:\nShare-based compensation expense Amortization of acquired technology Amortization of other acquired intangible assets Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges Gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets Professional fees for business combinations\nWe also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:\nGains and losses on debt and equity securities and other investments Income tax effects and adjustments Discontinued operations\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit’s operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments, or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.\nThe following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.\nShare-based compensation expenses. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.\nAmortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete, and trade names.\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying value of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.\nGains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets because they are unrelated to our ongoing business operating results.\nProfessional fees for business combinations. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal, and accounting fees.\nGains and losses on debt and equity securities and other investments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt and equity securities and other investments.\nIncome tax effects and adjustments. In our fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of our fiscal 2018 we used a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating results and for planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate excluded the income tax effects of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our long-term projections at that time we used a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 33%. This rate was consistent with the average of our normalized fiscal year tax rate over a four year period that included the past three fiscal years plus the current fiscal year forecast.\nIn the second quarter of our fiscal 2018, we revised our estimated annual effective non-GAAP tax rate to reflect a change in the U.S. federal statutory rate, as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The federal statutory rate change, to 21%, is effective January 1, 2018, and therefore, the change will result in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 26.9% for our fiscal year 2018. Effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adjusted our effective non-GAAP tax rate from 27% to 26.3%, based on continued analysis of the impacts from the Tax Act, as well as updates to the estimated full year impacts of our tax rate drivers such as the research and experimentation credit and the domestic production activities deduction. We have applied this tax rate to year to date pre-tax income, after the elimination of the effects of the non-GAAP adjustments to our operating results described above. Because of the transitional impact of the Tax Act provisions, the fiscal 2018 non-GAAP tax rate is based on our current year forecast only, without reference to long-term forecasts. This non-GAAP tax rate excludes the income tax effects of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items.\nWe will fully benefit from the U.S. federal statutory rate change in our fiscal year 2019. We expect to use the long-term non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2019, once the Tax Act’s provisions are in full effect and consistent for the periods included in the long-term forecast.\nWe evaluate the non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis and whenever any significant events occur which may materially affect this rate. This non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for various reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOperating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments, and disposals of businesses and long-lived assets.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180522006273/en/\nIntuit Inc.\nInvestors\nKim Watkins, 650-944-3324\nkim_watkins@intuit.com\nMedia\nDiane Carlini , 650-944-6251\ndiane_carlini@intuit.com\nSource: Intuit Inc.",
