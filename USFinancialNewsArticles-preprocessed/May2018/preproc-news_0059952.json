Hansen, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We are pleased to report record sales and strong earnings performance this quarter. Our 13.1% reported sales increase was driven by organic growth of 7.6%, the impact from acquisitions of 4.0%, and a favorable impact from foreign currency of 1.5%. We continue to perform well internationally where sales were up 25.6% overall, and our US business had a strong quarter with 9.1% growth.\"\nFinancial Highlights:\nEndoscopy sales grew 18.0%, with organic growth of 8.1%, showing continued performance across our core product lines.

These non-GAAP financial measures are indicators of the Company's performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. They are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to financial information used by us in our financial analysis and operational decision-making. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors, stockholders and other readers of our consolidated financial statements in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from, or as an alternative to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTo measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing, may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that are excluded: (i) amortization of purchased intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items; (iii) business optimization and restructuring-related charges; (iv) net tax benefits associated with the estimated impact of the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities as a result of U.S. tax reform; (v) excess tax benefits applicable to stock compensation and (vi) other significant items management deems irregular or non-operating in nature.\nAmortization expense of purchased intangible assets is a non-cash expense related to intangibles that were primarily the result of business acquisitions. Our history of acquiring businesses has resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduce the Company's net income. The removal of amortization from our overall operating performance helps in assessing our cash generated from operations including our return on invested capital, which we believe is an important analysis for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our continued growth.\nAcquisition-related items consist of (i) fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities resulting from acquisitions, (ii) due diligence, integration, legal fees and other transaction costs associated with our acquisition program and (iii) acquisition accounting charges for the amortization of the initial fair value adjustments of acquired inventory and deferred revenue. The adjustments of contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities are periodic adjustments to record such amounts at fair value at each balance sheet date. Given the subjective nature of the assumptions used in the determination of fair value calculations, fair value adjustments may potentially cause significant earnings volatility that are not representative of our operating results. Similarly, due diligence, integration, legal and other acquisition costs associated with our acquisition program, including acquisition accounting charges relating to recording acquired inventory and deferred revenue at fair market value, can be significant and also adversely impact our effective tax rate as certain costs are often not tax-deductible. Since these acquisition-related items are irregular and often mask underlying operating performance, we exclude these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\") significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, (a) lowering the applicable U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, (b) creating a partial territorial tax system that includes imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, (c) creating provisions regarding the (1) Global Intangible Low Tax Income, (2) the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, and (3) the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax and (d) eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions, such as interest expense, executive compensation expenses and certain employee expenses. During the second quarter ended January 31, 2018, we recorded a net benefit as a provisional estimate of the net accounting impact of the 2017 Tax Act in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. The net benefit is comprised of the following: (i) an unfavorable impact related to the mandatory transition tax for deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and (ii) a favorable benefit related to a revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities. During the third quarter ended April 30, 2018, we recorded an adjustment to the mandatory transition tax. Since these net favorable tax benefits are largely unrelated to our results and unrepresentative of our normal effective tax rate, we excluded their impact on net income and diluted EPS to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\nExcess tax benefits resulting from stock compensation are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense. The magnitude of the impact of excess tax benefits generated in the future, which may be favorable or unfavorable, are dependent upon our future grants of equity awards, our future share price on the date awards vest in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and the exercise behavior of our stock award holders. Since these tax benefits are largely unrelated to our results and unrepresentative of our normal effective tax rate, we excluded their impact on net income and diluted EPS to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures. For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we revised our estimated annual effective rate to reflect the change in the U.S. federal statutory rate applicable to stock compensation. The reduction in the federal rate applicable to the gains and corollary deferred tax asset resulted in a decrease in the excess tax benefit reported for the three months ended October 31, 2017.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we settled a patent infringement matter and also recorded an adjustment to another litigation matter in our consolidated financial statements. In fiscal 2016, we announced the retirement plans of our former Chief Executive Officer and recorded the majority of the costs associated with his retirement in our consolidated financial statements. Since these costs are irregular and mask our underlying operating performance, we made an adjustment to our net income and diluted EPS to exclude such costs to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\nThree Months Ended April 30, 2018\nWe made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense of purchased intangible assets, (ii) acquisition-related items, (iii) other business optimization and restructuring-related charges, (iv) litigation matters and (v) the reduction of a repatriation tax related to the 2017 Tax Act to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nThree Months Ended April 30, 2017\nWe made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense of purchased intangible assets, (ii) acquisition-related items and (iii) other business optimization and restructuring-related charges to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nThe reconciliations of net income and diluted EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS were calculated as follows:\nThree Months Ended April 30,\n(Unaudited)\n2018\n2017\nNet income/Diluted EPS, as reported\n$\n18,736\n$\n0.45\n$\n17,511\n$\n0.42\nIntangible amortization, net of tax (1)\n3,468\n0.08\n2,852\n0.07\nAcquisition-related items, net of tax (2)\n651\n0.02\n465\n0.01\nRestructuring-related charges, net of tax (3)\n991\n0.02\n549\n0.01\nLitigation matters (1)\n1,637\n0.04\n—\n—\nTax legislative changes (4)\n(554)\n(0.01)\n—\n—\nNon-GAAP net income/Non-GAAP diluted EPS\n$\n24,929\n$\n0.60\n$\n21,377\n$\n0.51\n(1)\nAmounts were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(2)\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2018, pre-tax acquisition-related items of $953 were recorded in general and administrative expenses. For the three months ended April 30, 2017, pre-tax acquisition-related items of $330 were recorded in cost of sales and $390 were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(3)\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2018, pre-tax restructuring-related items of $17 were recorded in cost of sales and $1,466 were recorded in general and administrative expenses. For the three months ended April 30, 2017, pre-tax restructuring-related items of $879 were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(4)\nAmounts were recorded in income taxes.\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified)\nNine Months Ended April 30, 2018\nWe made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense of purchased intangible assets, (ii) acquisition-related items, (iii) other business optimization and restructuring-related charges, (iv) excess tax benefits applicable to stock compensation, (v) net tax benefits associated with the estimated impact of the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, (vi) litigation matters and (vii) the resolution of a contingent liability associated with a previous acquisition to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nNine Months Ended April 30, 2017\nWe made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense of purchased intangible assets, (ii) acquisition-related items, (iii) other business optimization and restructuring-related charges, (iv) excess tax benefits applicable to stock compensation and (v) costs associated with the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nThe reconciliations of net income and diluted EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS were calculated as follows:\nNine Months Ended April 30,\n(Unaudited)\n2018\n2017\nNet income/Diluted EPS, as reported\n$\n74,153\n$\n1.77\n$\n54,381\n$\n1.30\nIntangible amortization, net of tax (1)\n9,844\n0.24\n8,438\n0.20\nAcquisition-related items, net of tax (2)\n2,307\n0.06\n1,233\n0.03\nRestructuring-related charges, net of tax (3)\n2,844\n0.07\n1,191\n0.03\nExcess tax benefit (4)\n(2,012)\n(0.05)\n(2,241)\n(0.05)\nTax legislative changes (4)\n(8,952)\n(0.22)\n—\n—\nLitigation matters (1)\n1,637\n0.04\n—\n—\nResolution of contingent liability (5)\n(1,138)\n(0.03)\n—\n—\nCEO retirement costs, net of tax (1)\n—\n—\n1,249\n0.03\nNon-GAAP net income/Non-GAAP diluted EPS\n$\n78,683\n$\n1.88\n$\n64,251\n$\n1.54\n(1)\nAmounts were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(2)\nFor the nine months ended April 30, 2018, pre-tax acquisition-related items of $893 were recorded in cost of sales and $2,409 were recorded in general and administrative expenses. For the nine months ended April 30, 2017, pre-tax acquisition-related items of $500 were recorded in cost of sales and $1,295 were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(3)\nFor the nine months ended April 30, 2018, pre-tax restructuring-related items of $1,164 were recorded in cost of sales and $2,656 were recorded in general and administrative expenses. For the nine months ended April 30, 2017, pre-tax restructuring-related items of $1,735 were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(4)\nAmounts were recorded in income taxes.\n(5)\nAmounts were recorded in other income.\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified)\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS\nWe believe EBITDAS is an important valuation measurement for management and investors given the increasing effect that non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, amortization related to acquisitions and depreciation of capital equipment have on net income. In particular, acquisitions have historically resulted in significant increases in amortization of purchased intangible assets that reduce net income. Additionally, we regard EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance and cash flow before the effect of interest expense and is a complement to operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures.\nWe define adjusted EBITDAS as EBITDAS excluding the same non-GAAP adjustments to net income discussed above. We use adjusted EBITDAS when evaluating operating performance because we believe the exclusion of such adjustments, of which a significant portion are non-cash items, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of on-going core operating results and to evaluate comparative results period over period.\nThe reconciliations of net income to EBITDAS and adjusted EBITDAS were calculated as follows:\nThree Months Ended April 30,\nNine Months Ended April 30,\n(Unaudited)\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet income, as reported\n$\n18,736\n$\n17,511\n$\n74,153\n$\n54,381\nInterest expense, net\n1,498\n1,084\n3,822\n3,303\nIncome taxes\n6,833\n8,849\n14,346\n25,436\nDepreciation\n4,626\n3,774\n12,816\n10,922\nAmortization\n4,480\n3,964\n12,892\n11,930\nLoss on disposal of fixed assets\n187\n87\n521\n489\nStock-based compensation expense\n2,443\n1,945\n7,033\n6,983\nEBITDAS\n38,803\n37,214\n125,583\n113,444\nAcquisition-related items\n953\n720\n3,302\n1,795\nRestructuring-related charges (1)\n1,468\n879\n3,721\n1,735\nLitigation matters\n2,345\n—\n2,345\n—\nResolution of contingent liability\n—\n—\n(1,138)\n—\nCEO retirement costs (2)\n—\n—\n—\n1,413\nAdjusted EBITDAS\n$\n43,569\n$\n38,813\n$\n133,813\n$\n118,387\n(1)\nExcludes stock-based compensation expense.\n(2)\nFor comparative purposes, we have revised the amounts associated with CEO retirement costs for the nine months ended April 30, 2017 to exclude stock-based compensation expense which was reported in \"Stock-based compensation expense\" above.\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified)\nNet Debt\nWe define net debt as long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. Each of the components of net debt appears on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the presentation of net debt provides useful information to investors because we review net debt as part of our management of our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage.\n(Unaudited)\nApril 30, 2018\nJuly 31, 2017\nLong-term debt\n$\n169,000\n$\n126,000\nLess cash and cash equivalents\n(51,916)\n(36,584)\nNet debt\n$\n117,084\n$\n89,416\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified)\nReconciliation of Net Sales Growth to Organic Sales Growth\nWe define organic sales as net sales less (i) the impact of foreign currency translation, (ii) net sales related to acquired businesses during the first twelve months of ownership and (iii) divestitures during the periods being compared. We believe that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior periods. We exclude the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size, and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of financial performance difficult.\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2018, the reconciliation of net sales growth to organic sales growth for total net sales and net sales of our four reportable segments were calculated as follows:\n(Unaudited)\nNet Sales\nEndoscopy\nNet Sales\nWater\nPurification\nand\nFiltration\nNet Sales\nHealthcare\nDisposables\nNet Sales\nDialysis\nNet Sales\nNet sales growth\n13.1\n%\n18.0\n%\n9.2\n%\n6.5\n%\n4.9\n%\nImpact due to foreign currency translation\n(1.5)\n%\n(2.7)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\n0.0\n%\n(1.0)\n%\nSales related to acquisitions\n(4.0)\n%\n(7.2)\n%\n0.0\n%\n(1.2)\n%\n0.0\n%\nOrganic sales growth\n7.6\n%\n8.1\n%\n8.9\n%\n5.3\n%\n3.9\n%\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified)\nFor the nine months ended April 30, 2018, the reconciliation of net sales growth to organic sales growth for total net sales and net sales of our four reportable segments were calculated as follows:\n(Unaudited)\nNet Sales\nEndoscopy\nNet Sales\nWater\nPurification\nand\nFiltration\nNet Sales\nHealthcare\nDisposables\nNet Sales\nDialysis\nNet Sales\nNet sales growth\n13.9\n%\n20.4\n%\n8.0\n%\n6.1\n%\n5.6\n%\nImpact due to foreign currency translation\n(1.0)\n%\n(1.7)\n%\n(0.4)\n%\n(0.1)\n%\n(0.8)\n%\nSales related to acquisitions\n(4.1)\n%\n(7.9)\n%\n0.0\n%\n(0.6)\n%\n0.0\n%\nOrganic sales growth\n8.8\n%\n10.8\n%\n7.6\n%\n5.4\n%\n4.8\n%\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified)\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cantel-medical-reports-financial-results-for-its-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2018-300657026.html\nSOURCE Cantel Medical Corp.",
