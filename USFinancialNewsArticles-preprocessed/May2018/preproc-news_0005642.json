    "text": "HOUSTON, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nReports Strong Operating Results ­Achieves Record Returns on First Quarter Capital Investments U.S. Oil Production Near High End of Target Range ­U.S. Realized Crude Oil Price Exceeds WTI NYMEX Average ­Per-Unit Transportation and DD&A Expenses Below Targets Maintains Full-Year $5.4-$5.8 Billion Exploration and Development Expenditure Target ­On Track to Reduce Well Costs 5 Percent in 2018 Reiterates Full-Year 2018 Oil Production Growth Target of 16-20 Percent Targets $3 Billion Debt Reduction and Higher Dividend Growth Rate\nEOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EOG) ( EOG ) today reported first quarter 2018 net income of $638.6 million, or $1.10 per share. This compares to first quarter 2017 net income of $28.5 million, or $0.05 per share.\nAdjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter 2018 was $689.5 million, or $1.19 per share, compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income of $89.4 million, or $0.15 per share, for the same prior year period. Higher commodity prices, increased production volumes and overall per-unit cost reductions resulted in increases to adjusted non-GAAP net income, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX during the first quarter 2018 compared to the first quarter 2017. Adjusted non-GAAP net income is calculated by matching hedge realizations to settlement months and making certain other adjustments in order to exclude one-time items. Please refer to the attached tables for the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures.\nOperational Highlights\nEOG achieved record returns on new capital investments in the first quarter 2018. The company increased first quarter 2018 crude oil production by 15 percent compared to the first quarter 2017. EOG maintained its forecast for 16 to 20 percent crude oil growth for full year 2018. Strong production growth reflects the company's premium drilling strategy and technical advances across its diverse inventory of high-return plays. EOG defines premium drilling as prospective well locations that will earn a minimum 30 percent direct after-tax rate of return at $40 crude oil and $2.50 natural gas prices. EOG's prolific Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford and Powder River Basin assets all contributed to growth this quarter. The company realized an average price for U.S. crude oil sales in the first quarter 2018 of $64.24 per barrel. This is $1.35 per barrel above the average WTI NYMEX price during the same period.\nOverall per-unit operating expenses decreased during the first quarter 2018. This performance was led by a 21 percent reduction in per-unit depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses compared to the same prior year period. Per-unit transportation and general and administrative costs also declined during the first quarter 2018.\nEOG maintained its forecast for 2018 capital expenditures of $5.4 to $5.8 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash transactions. The company remains on track to reduce average well costs by five percent in 2018.\n\"EOG delivered another sterling performance in the first quarter despite a challenging operating environment,\" said William R. \"Bill\" Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"New capital investments produced record-level rates of return. Our innovative employees executed our game plan with high efficiency to deliver results that met or exceeded expectations while remaining on track to lower costs. EOG is well positioned to accomplish its full-year plan and generate high-return, disciplined growth in 2018.\"\nCapital Structure and Financial Strategy\nAt March 31, 2018, EOG's total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion for a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 28 percent. Considering cash on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter, EOG's net debt was $5.6 billion for a net debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 25 percent. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.\nEOG intends to repay bonds as they mature over the next four years, with a goal to reduce total debt outstanding by $3 billion. In addition, the company is targeting an increase in its historical rate of dividend growth. Sustainable dividend growth is a distinguishing attribute of EOG. The company increased its dividend at a 19 percent compound annual rate from 1999 to 2017 without any reductions. The shift to premium drilling and the recovery in oil prices have increased EOG's after-tax rate of return on new investments to record levels. With an improving financial condition, EOG now aims to grow its dividend at a higher rate than its historical average.\n\"EOG is uniquely positioned to generate strong organic growth, increase return on capital employed, further strengthen the balance sheet and step up cash returns to shareholders,\" noted Thomas. \"Our objectives to reduce debt outstanding and increase the dividend growth rate reflect the strength of our business model. The company is capable of withstanding price volatility and well positioned to create significant shareholder value through commodity cycles.\"\nDelaware Basin\nIn the first quarter 2018, EOG shifted to larger-scale development activity in the Delaware Basin utilizing 19 rigs compared to 13 rigs in 2017. Seventy new wells began production across multiple targets, although only 14 of these were brought on-line in January. Activity was focused on further delineating additional targets and testing development patterns in different areas of the basin.\nIn the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, EOG completed several notable wells, including the State Magellan 7 22H-28H. This seven-well package, drilled on 500-foot spacing, was completed with an average treated lateral length of 4,700 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boed), or 1,455 barrels of oil per day (Bopd), 310 barrels per day (Bpd) of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and 2.6 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of natural gas.\nIn the Delaware Basin First Bone Spring, EOG completed the Beowulf 33 State Com 301H in Lea County, NM with a treated lateral length of 6,900 feet and a 30-day initial production rate of 1,735 Boed, or 1,275 Bopd, 200 Bpd of NGLs and 1.6 MMcfd of natural gas.\nIn the Delaware Basin Leonard, EOG completed the Gem 36 State Com 05H and 06H with an average treated lateral length per well of 4,200 feet and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 2,555 Boed, or 1,605 Bopd, 395 Bpd of NGLs and 3.3 MMcfd of natural gas.\nSouth Texas Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk\nEOG's South Texas Eagle Ford continued to generate strong results across the entire extent of its 520,000 net acre position in the crude oil window of the play. EOG continues to optimize its wells with staggered patterns and enhanced targeting, which is producing premium-level returns even in heavily developed parts of the field. Wells completed in the first quarter were drilled with an average distance between wells of approximately 300 feet per well. Lateral lengths are also being extended, primarily in the western half of the field, where lateral lengths averaged 9,200 feet per well in the first quarter.\nNotable wells in the first quarter included the Presley Unit 12H-14H, a three-well package in Karnes County, TX with an average treated lateral length of 6,800 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 3,360 Boed, or 2,670 Bopd, 350 Bpd of NGLs and 2.0 MMcfd of natural gas. On the western side of the Eagle Ford in Atascosa County, TX, EOG completed the Watermelon Unit 2H and 3H with an average treated lateral length of 12,400 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 1,680 Boed, or 1,490 Bopd, 100 Bpd of NGLs and 0.6 MMcfd of natural gas.\nDevelopment continued in the Austin Chalk, with the first quarter drilling program highlighted by the Elbrus 101H and 102H, with an average treated lateral length of 4,600 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 4,305 Boed, or 2,980 Bopd, 670 Bpd of NGLs and 3.9 MMcfd of natural gas.\nRockies and the Bakken\nDuring the first quarter, EOG continued to develop its premium Powder River Basin and DJ Basin positions and began its 2018 drilling program in the Bakken. The company continued to lower well costs in its Rockies plays by improving drilling and completion times along with other efficiency improvements.\nEOG brought 12 wells on line in the Powder River Basin during the first quarter 2018, including nine targeting the Turner formation. Notably, the Flatbow 16-36H–18-36H, a three-well package in the Powder River Turner, was completed with an average treated lateral length of 3,900 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 1,325 Boed, or 775 Bopd, 190 Bpd of NGLs and 2.2 MMcfd of natural gas. These short-lateral wells had an average cost of $2.9 million per well.\nIn the DJ Basin, EOG began production in the first quarter from 12 wells. In particular, a four-well package of DJ Basin Codell wells, the Big Sandy 529, 552, 553 and 554-1423H, was completed with an average treated lateral length of 9,500 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 1,340 Boed, or 1,120 Bopd, 135 Bpd of NGLs and 0.5 MMcfd of natural gas. These wells were drilled in an average of 4.2 days per well with an average cost of $3.5 million per well.\nIn the North Dakota Bakken, EOG drilled 4 wells in the first quarter and deferred completions until later in 2018.\nWoodford Oil Window\nEOG continued development of its new oil play in the Woodford formation of the Eastern Anadarko Basin. In the first quarter, EOG increased drilling operations to three rigs and added a fourth rig in April. Production began from one well during the quarter. The Terri 1621 #1H was completed with a treated lateral length of 10,200 feet and a 30-day initial production rate of 1,395 Boed, or 1,140 Bopd, 165 Bpd of NGLs and 0.5 MMcfd of natural gas.\nHedging Activity\nDuring the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, EOG entered into crude oil financial price swap contracts. A comprehensive summary of crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts is provided in the attached tables.\nConference Call May 4, 2018\nEOG's first quarter 2018 results conference call will be available via live audio webcast at 9 a.m. Central time (10 a.m. Eastern time) on Friday, May 4, 2018.
