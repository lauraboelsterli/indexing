    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Entasis Therapeutics Holdings Inc. , a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel antibacterial products, today announced the appointment of David C. Hastings to the company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Hastings brings to Entasis more than 18 years of finance, accounting and operations experience in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, including serving as Chief Financial Officer of three publicly traded companies.\n“We are excited to welcome David to the Board of Directors,” said Manos Perros, CEO of Entasis. “His deep and extensive financial and pharmaceutical company experience will be invaluable to Entasis as we continue to develop our product candidates toward regulatory approval and commercialization, and pursue our goal of becoming a leading anti-infective products company.”\nMr. Hastings previously served as the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Incyte Corporation from 2003 until 2014. During this time, Mr. Hastings oversaw all financial aspects as Incyte transitioned from research and development to commercialization following the launch of Jakafi ® (ruxolitinib). Mr. Hastings also previously served as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of ArQule Inc. During his tenure at ArQule, he played an important role in ArQule's transition into a drug discovery and development organization, and in two strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of Cyclis Pharmaceuticals Inc. Prior to that, Mr. Hastings was with Genzyme Corporation as its Vice President and Corporate Controller, and with Sepracor, Inc. where he was Director of Finance. Mr. Hastings is currently an independent director of both Scynexis, Inc. and Vascular Biogenics Ltd., operating as VBL Therapeutics. Most recently, Mr. Hastings served as the Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Unilife Corporation from 2015 to 2017 and as its Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer from 2016 to 2017.\n“Antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat around the world, and the unique pathogen-targeted approach Entasis is developing is an important advancement in the anti-infectives arena,” said Mr. Hastings. “I look forward to working with the other Board members at Entasis and lending my expertise to help move the company forward with their short- and long-term goals.”\nAbout Entasis Therapeutics Inc.\nEntasis is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel antibacterial products to treat serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
