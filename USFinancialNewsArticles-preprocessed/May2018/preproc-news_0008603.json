(NASDAQ:HTLF) today reported net income available to common stockholders of $23.3 million, or $0.76 per diluted common share, for the quarter , compared to $18.0 million, or $0.68 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2017. Return on average common equity was 9.32% and return on average assets was 0.97% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 9.71% and 0.89%, respectively, for the same quarter in 2017.\nCommenting on Heartland’s first quarter results, Lynn B. Fuller, Heartland’s chairman and chief executive officer said, \"Heartland reported another solid quarter with net income available to common stockholders of $23.3 million, a nearly thirty percent increase over the same quarter last year. For the first time in company history, our total assets exceeded $10 billion, and total stockholders' equity exceeded $1 billion.\"\nOn February 23, 2018, Heartland completed the acquisition of Signature Bancshares, Inc., parent company of Signature Bank, based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. Based on Heartland's closing common stock price of $53.55 per share as of February 23, 2018, the aggregate consideration was $61.4 million, with approximately 10% of the consideration paid in cash and 90% paid by delivery of Heartland common stock. Simultaneous with the closing of the transaction, Signature Bank merged into Heartland's Minnesota Bank & Trust subsidiary. As of the close date, Signature Bank had, at fair value, total assets of $426.5 million, total loans of $324.5 million and total deposits of $357.3 million. The systems conversion for this transaction occurred on April 20, 2018.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Heartland recorded $2.6 million of restructuring expenses related to its mortgage lending operation. The restructuring projects are primarily related to outsourcing the loan application processing, underwriting and loan closing functions. These changes will improve the customer experience, streamline operations and reduce the volatility and cost of originating mortgage loans. The restructuring is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2018 and will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 100 employees and the discontinued use of several current systems.\nFully Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Margin Increases from First Quarter of 2017\nNet interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.19% (4.26% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.14% (4.30% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.95% (4.16% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during the first quarter of 2017.\nFuller said, “We were pleased to see net interest margin remained solid at 4.26 percent on a fully tax-equivalent basis, which is an increase of 10 basis points from the first quarter of 2017. The strong margin reflects improved yields on earning assets.\"\nInterest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $101.2 million compared to $80.6 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The taxable equivalent adjustment for income taxes saved on the interest earned on nontaxable securities and loans was $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 and $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. With these adjustments, interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $102.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $18.3 million or 22%, compared to $84.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Average earning assets acquired in the Signature Bancshares, Inc. transaction totaled $148.9 million. Exclusive of this transaction, average earning assets increased $1.21 billion or 16% from the first quarter of 2017. The average rate on earning assets increased 14 basis points to 4.70% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.56% for the same quarter in 2017. The increase in interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was primarily due to recent increases in market interest rates and the increase in average earning assets.\nInterest expense on deposits and borrowings for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.6 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 28% from $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Average interest bearing deposits increased $595.3 million or 13% to $5.27 billion for the quarter , from $4.67 billion in the same quarter in 2017. Average interest bearing deposits acquired with the Signature Bancshares Inc. transaction totaled $100.7 million. Exclusive of this transaction, average interest bearing deposits increased $494.6 million or 11%. The average interest rate paid on Heartland's interest bearing deposits increased 12 basis points to 0.44% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.32% for the same quarter in 2017. Average borrowings declined $91.9 million or 18% to $427.9 million during the first quarter of 2018 from $519.8 million during the same quarter in 2017. The average interest rate paid on Heartland's borrowings was 3.66% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2.96% in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the average interest rate paid on Heartland's interest bearing liabilities is primarily due to recent increases in market interest rates.\nNet interest income was $91.6 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $73.0 million during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $18.6 million or 25%. After the tax-equivalent adjustment discussed above, net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis totaled $93.1 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $76.9 million during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $16.2 million or 21%.\nNoninterest Income Decreases and Noninterest Expenses Increase from First Quarter of 2017\nNoninterest income totaled $24.7 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $25.9 million during the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $1.2 million or 5%. Trust fees, which are based on the market value of managed assets, increased $1.0 million or 29% to $4.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.6 million recorded in the same quarter of 2017. Securities gains, net, decreased $1.0 million or 42% to $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net gains on sale of loans held for sale totaled $4.1 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $2.1 million or 34%, primarily due to lower residential mortgage loan activity.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, noninterest expenses totaled $83.6 million compared to $71.7 million during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $11.9 million or 17%. Salaries and employee benefits increased $6.9 million or 17% to $48.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $41.8 million for the same quarter in 2017, which is primarily due to the increase in full time equivalent employees. Heartland had 2,022 full time equivalent employees at March 31, 2018, compared to 1,896 full time equivalent employees at March 31, 2017. As previously discussed, Heartland recorded $2.6 million of restructuring expenses related to its mortgage lending operation during the first quarter of 2018.\nHeartland's effective tax rate was 18.04% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 23.49% for the first quarter of 2017. Federal low-income housing tax credits included in the determination of Heartland's income taxes totaled $307,000 during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $304,000 for the first quarter of 2017. Heartland's effective tax rate was also affected by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, which reduced the federal income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% beginning January 1, 2018. The level of tax-exempt interest income as a percentage of pre-tax income was 20.46% during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 30.46% during the first quarter of 2017.\nLoans and Deposits Increase Since December 31, 2017\nTotal assets were $10.06 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $245.1 million or 2% from $9.81 billion at year-end 2017. Excluding $427.1 million of assets acquired at fair value in the Signature Bancshares Inc. transaction, total assets decreased $181.9 million or 2% since December 31, 2017. The decrease in assets was primarily due to a reduction in the securities portfolio, which represented 23% and 25% of total assets at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nTotal loans held to maturity were $6.75 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $6.39 billion at year-end 2017, an increase of $354.6 million or 6%. This change includes $324.5 million of total loans held to maturity acquired at fair value in the Signature Bancshares, Inc. transaction. Exclusive of this transaction, total loans held to maturity increased $30.1 million or less than 1% since December 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits were $8.54 billion as of March 31, 2018, compared to $8.15 billion at year-end 2017, an increase of $394.6 million or 5%. This increase included $357.3 million of deposits, at fair value, acquired in the Signature Bancshares, Inc. transaction. Exclusive of this transaction, total deposits increased $37.3 million or less than 1% since December 31, 2017. Demand deposits increased $111.3 million or 4% to $3.09 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $2.98 billion at December 31, 2017. Excluding $105.5 million of demand deposits attributable to the Signature Bancshares, Inc. transaction, demand deposits increased $5.8 million or less than 1% since year-end 2017. Savings deposits increased $295.8 million or 7% to $4.54 billion at March 31, 2018, from $4.24 billion at December 31, 2017. Excluding savings deposits of $195.2 million acquired in the Signature Bancshares, Inc. transaction, savings deposits increased $100.6 million or 2% since year-end 2017.\nBruce K. Lee, Heartland's president, said, \"We are pleased to see organic loan growth for the third consecutive quarter, which was fueled by growth in the commercial and agricultural loan portfolios. Organic non-time deposit growth was over $106 million during the first quarter of 2018, and demand deposits now represent 36 percent of our total deposit mix.\"\nNonperforming Assets Increase Since December 31, 2017\nNonperforming assets were $77.1 million or 0.77% of total assets at March 31, 2018, compared to $74.6 million or 0.76% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Excluding $2.5 million of nonperforming assets acquired in the Signature Bancshares, Inc. transaction, nonperforming assets totaled $74.6 million at March 31, 2018, which is unchanged from year-end 2017. Nonperforming loans were $64.8 million or 0.96% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $63.4 million or 0.99% of total loans at December 31, 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2018, was 0.87% of loans and 90.48% of nonperforming loans, compared to 0.87% of loans and 87.82% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017. The provision for loan losses increased $622,000 or 17% to $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.6 million for the same quarter in 2017. Given the size of Heartland's loan portfolio, the level of organic loan growth, acquired loans that move out of the purchase accounting pool, changes in credit quality and the variability that can occur in the factors considered when determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses, Heartland's quarterly provision expense will vary from quarter to quarter.\nConference Call Details\nHeartland will host a conference call for investors at 5:00 p.m. EDT today.
