    "text": "TORONTO, May 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YAMANA GOLD INC. (TSX:YRI) (NYSE:AUY) (“Yamana” or the “Company”) today announced that it has filed an early warning report under National Instrument 62-103 in connection with the closing of the previously announced acquisition (the “Transaction”) by Leagold Mining Corporation (“Leagold”) of Brio Gold Inc. (“Brio Gold”).\nUpon completion of the Transaction, Yamana received an aggregate of 58,115,953 common shares of Leagold (“Leagold Shares”) and 25,212,995 common share purchase Warrants of Leagold (“Warrants”) in exchange for its Brio Gold shares, representing approximately 20.65% of the issued and outstanding Leagold Shares on a non-diluted basis and approximately 27.17% of the issued and outstanding Leagold Shares on a partially-diluted basis, assuming the exercise of the Warrants held by Yamana. Prior to the Arrangement, Yamana did not hold any Leagold Shares or convertible securities of Leagold. Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Leagold Share at a price of $3.70 for a period of two years following completion of the Arrangement.\nIn connection with the Transaction, Yamana has agreed to hold the Leagold Shares and any Leagold Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants it received pursuant to the Transaction for a minimum period of 12 months, subject to certain customary exceptions. While Yamana currently has no plans or intentions with respect to the Leagold securities, subject to the terms of the Support Agreement, depending on market conditions, general economic and industry conditions, trading prices of Leagold’s securities, Leagold’s business, financial condition and prospects and/or other relevant factors, Yamana may develop such plans or intentions in the future and, at such time, may from time to time acquire additional securities, dispose of some or all of the existing or additional securities or may continue to hold the Leagold Shares, Warrants or other securities of Leagold.\nA copy of the early warning report filed by Yamana will be available under Leagold’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or by contacting Sofia Tsakos, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary at 416-815-0220. Yamana’s head office is located at Royal Bank Plaza, North Tower, 200 Bay Street, Suite 2200, Toronto, ON, M5J 2J3 and Leagold’s head office is located at 595 Burrard Street, Suite 3042, PO Box 49152, Three Bentall, Vancouver, BC, V7X 1J1.\nAbout Yamana\nYamana is a Canadian-based gold producer with significant gold production, gold development stage properties, exploration properties, and land positions throughout the Americas including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Canada. Yamana plans to continue to build on this base through existing operating mine expansions, throughput increases, development of new mines, the advancement of its exploration properties and, at times, by targeting other gold consolidation opportunities with a primary focus in the Americas.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:\nInvestor Relations\n416-815-0220\n1-888-809-0925\nEmail: investor@yamana.com\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This news release contains or incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” and “forward-looking information” under applicable Canadian securities legislation within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
