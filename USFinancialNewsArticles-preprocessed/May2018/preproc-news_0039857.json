Average new home delivery price increased 72% to $0.7 million from 8 home deliveries, as compared to $0.4 million, on 25 home deliveries. Homebuilding backlog represents forward revenue of $22.0 million on 31 home sales as compared to $24 million on 44 units,\nHighlights of Comstock’s recently announced plan to transform its business strategy and focus:\nOn April 2, 2018, the Company announced it was transitioning its business strategy and operating platform from for-sale homebuilding to commercial development, asset management and real estate services. Anchoring the transition is a long-term asset management agreement entered into by CDS Asset Management, LC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CHCI, and privately held entities that own multiple mixed-use developments and stabilized assets in the Washington DC area. The assets under management (\"AUM\") represent an estimated AUM value of $2.5 Billion to $3.0 Billion upon build out.\nOwnership of the portfolio of assets covered by the initial asset management agreement includes the Company's Chairman/CEO and largest individual shareholder, Christopher Clemente, a prominent high net worth family office, and Daito Trust Construction, Ltd., one of the largest publicly traded Japanese developers and managers of multi-family assets.\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, the asset management segment generated $0.3 million of income for the Company.\n\"I am pleased to report that the recently announced transformation of our operating platform is going well,\" said Christopher Clemente, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CHCI. \"Having completed the integration of previously separate operating platforms, and added additional strategic management talent, Comstock is making progress on all elements of our new strategy. Our wholly owned subsidiary, CDS Asset Management, LC has assumed operational control of multiple completed and stabilized assets, commenced development of two new transit-oriented, mixed-use projects under the initial long-term asset management agreement, and identified additional asset management opportunities. Additionally, Comstock Real Estate Services, LC has made strategic operational enhancements designed to provide opportunity for additional growth while continuing to advance revenue enhancing initiatives. As we complete the majority of our for-sale homebuilding projects during the next three quarters, we will be focusing our resources on advancing various strategic initiatives designed to expand revenue generated through development and management of assets under management (AUM) while also seeking to expand our fee-for-service based businesses.\"\nThe Company's latest investor relations presentation describing the strategic vision of the Company can be found at www.ComstockCompanies.com .\nAbout Comstock Holding Companies, Inc.\nCHCI is a multi-faceted real estate development, asset management and real estate related services company that, since 1985, has designed, developed, constructed and managed several thousand residential units and millions of square feet of residential and mixed-use projects throughout the Washington, DC metropolitan market and in other key markets in the southeastern United States. In early 2018, CHCI transitioned its operating platform from being primarily focused on developing on-balance sheet, for-sale, homebuilding projects to being focused on commercial real estate development, asset management and real estate related services. As a result, CHCI began operating through two real estate focused platforms, CDS Asset Management (\"CAM\") and Comstock Real Estate Services (\"CRES\"). CAM provides real estate development, asset management, and property management services, while CRES provides development supply chain services, including capital markets, real estate brokerage, environmental consulting and design services in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Anchoring the transition of CHCI is a long-term asset management agreement covering two of the largest transit-oriented, mixed-use developments in the Washington, DC area; Reston Station, a 3 million square foot transit-oriented, mixed-use development located in Reston, VA, and Loudoun Station, a 2.5 million square foot transit-oriented, mixed-use development in Ashburn, VA, as well as other additional development assets. Comstock's substantial experience in entitling, designing, developing, and managing a diverse range of properties including apartments, single-family homes, townhomes, mid-rise condominiums, high-rise condominiums and mixed-use (residential and commercial) properties, as well as large scale commercial parking garages and infrastructure projects, has positioned the Comstock organization as a premier developer and real estate related service provider in the mid-Atlantic Region. The Company is a publicly traded company, trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHCI.

Located at the terminus of Phase I of Metro's Silver Line, Reston Station is already home to more than 1,000 residents, numerous businesses, multiple retail establishments, and several restaurants. With more than 1 million square feet of completed and stabilized buildings, more than 2 million square feet of additional development in various stages of entitlement, development and construction, and a 3,500-space underground parking garage and transit facility adjacent to the Wiehle Reston-East Metro Station, the Reston Station neighborhood is taking shape and quickly becoming Fairfax County's urban focal point in the Dulles Corridor. For more information about Reston Station, please visit; www.RestonStation.com .\nAbout Loudoun Station\nLocated at the terminus station on Metro's Silver Line, minutes from Dulles International Airport, Loudoun Station represents Loudoun County's first (and currently its only) Metro-connected development. Loudoun Station has approximately 700,000 square feet of mixed-use development completed, including hundreds of rental apartments, approximately 150,000 square feet of retail, restaurants, and entertainment venues, 50,000 square feet of Class-A office, and a 1,500-space commuter parking garage. More than 2 million square feet of additional development is slated for Loudoun Station. Located adjacent to Metro's Ashburn Station, the Loudoun Station neighborhood represents Loudoun County's beginning transformation into a transit connected community with direct connectivity to Dulles International Airport, Reston, Tysons Corner and downtown Washington, DC. As Loudoun County's only transit connected neighborhood, Loudoun Station has become the new downtown of Loudoun County in the Dulles Corridor. For more information about Loudoun Station, please visit; www.LoudounStation.com .\nComstock New Home Communities Currently Open\nComstock, having significantly reduced its focus on on-balance sheet development of new home communities is working through its remaining inventory of building lots to maximize revenue from all sources as it transitions away from the capital intensive for-sale homebuilding business toward commercial development, asset management and real estate services. Currently the Company has 6 remaining communities open for sale in Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., including townhomes and single-family homes priced from the high $370s to the $900s.
