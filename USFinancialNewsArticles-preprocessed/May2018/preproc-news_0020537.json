    "text": "AMITYVILLE, N.Y., NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc. (NasdaqGS: NSSC), one of the world's leading solutions providers and manufacturers of high tech electronic intrusion security, Internet of Things (IoT) connected home, video and fire systems, as well as enterprise-class access control and door locking products, today announced financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights:\nNet sales for the quarter increased 7% to a record $22.2 million as compared to $20.8 million for the same quarter last year. Net sales for the nine months were $64.5 million, a 5% increase, as compared to $61.7 million for the same period last year. Recurring service revenue for the quarter increased 49% and now has a prospective annual run rate of $12.9 million based on March 2018 recurring service revenue.** Net income for the quarter increased 92% to $1,829,000 from $952,000 a year ago. Net income for the nine months increased 66% to $3,952,000 from $2,377,000 a year ago. Earnings per share (diluted) for the quarter was $0.10, as compared to $0.05 for the same period a year ago. Earnings per share (diluted) for the nine months was $0.21, as compared to $0.13 for the same period a year ago. The Company repurchased 122,795 shares of its common stock during the quarter, at a weighted average purchase price of $9.29 per share, under its share repurchase program originally announced in September 2014. As of March 31, 2018 the Company may repurchase up to 231,390 more shares under this program.\nRichard Soloway, Chairman and President commented, \"Our recent Q3 performance reflects that our focus on expanding our stable of RMR (recurring monthly service revenue) generating product entries is working well. Also, the investments we have made and continue to make, in launching new products targeted at the school security, wireless access control locking, wireless alarm communicator and burgeoning IoT markets, have positioned us well for sustainable future sales growth.\nWith regard to school security, NAPCO continues to be a leader in keeping our schools safe. Our Company, along with our integrator, dealer and distributor channel partners have conducted thousands of SAVI (School Access-control Vulnerability Index) audits in the field. The SAVI system holistically measures the security level of an educational facility and provides a quantitative grade, in the form of an index. The outcome of the SAVI audit then leads to an action plan on improving the school's preparedness level. As recent events continue to remind us, much more needs to be done to improve school security going forward and we will continue our diligent efforts in this area.\nAs an innovator in wireless access-control locking products, our integrated solutions protecting public venues continue to experience increases in sales. Both the Networx速 and ArchiTech速 wireless access control locking systems integrate with a host of enterprise-class access-control lines and provide integrators and end-user facilities with a cost-effective, advanced, total facility protective solution.\"\nMr. Soloway continued, \"Driving considerable increases in RMR income, our StarLink速 Intrusion, Fire and IoT wireless communicators continue to be strong product offerings. Given the millions of intrusion and fire alarm panels across the country, which currently communicate alarms via hard-wired landlines, facing obsolescence and needing a wireless upgrade to continue to operate, we should see considerable future growth in this product area. We have continued to introduce state-of-the-art additions to the StarLink line, including our Dual-Path Fire and IoT Communicators, making our line the most advanced and extensive in the industry. This coming Q4 will see our introduction of a complete line of StarLink Verizon LTE wireless communicators, keeping us at the forefront of cellular technology.\nCapitalizing on the promising and explosive IoT category, our award-winning StarLink Connect速 IoT cellular communicator has been a great addition to our RMR-generating StarLink product line, as it can be installed on virtually any of the existing, millions of alarm panels already in the field, to add on connected home or connected business services. This product enables our dealers to upgrade current security-only consumers, to a variety of app-driven, remote device operated services (security system, lighting, lock, thermostats, garage door and video camera control), providing them, as well as NAPCO, with considerable, incremental RMR income streams.\"\nMr. Soloway summarized, \"NAPCO's strategic plans for growth, both near-term and long-term, are developing well. We will continue to position our Company for continued vibrant growth, with our investment in attractive growth markets and look forward to completing a very successful Fiscal 2018.\"**\nFinancial Results\nNet sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased to a record third quarter revenue of $22.2 million, as compared to $20.8 million for the same period one year ago.
