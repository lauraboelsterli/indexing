A new fissure spraying lava fountains as high as about 230 feet (70 m), according to United States Geological Survey, is shown from Luana Street in Leilani Estates subdivision on Kilauea Volcano's lower East Rift Zone in Hawaii, U.S., May 5, 2018.

Slideshow (6 Images)\nAlthough no significant lava flows have yet formed, additional outbreaks of lava, which can reach temperatures of about 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit (1,150 Celsius), were expected, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said.\nPetra Wiesenbauer, owner of Hale Moana Hawaii Bed and Breakfast, evacuated Friday evening with her two teenage children and pets.\n“Now we are just trying to make plans for the future,” she said. “There is no telling when or if we’ll ever be able to go back in.”\nKilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes and one of five on the island, has been in constant eruption for 35 years.\nU.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a Democrat, called on federal officials to quickly respond to needs such as short- and long-term housing and infrastructure repairs.\nGabbard said more than 1,800 residents in Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens had been ordered to leave their homes since Thursday.
