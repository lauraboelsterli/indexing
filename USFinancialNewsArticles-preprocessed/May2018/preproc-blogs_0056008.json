    "text": "A superyacht anchors in the Hudson Adam Jeffery | CNBC Adam Jeffery | @ajefferyphoto 44 Mins Ago\nSitting in the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, a rather large yacht is anchored. We decided to try and get a closer look to see what this boat was all about. Here is what we found. Aviva\nThe yacht is named Aviva and was built by Abeking & Rasmussen of Germany in 2017. It is not just big, it's massive, stretching more than 320 feet. The boat ranks as No. 47 on the list of the largest yachts in the world. It weighs 4,600 metric tons, has a cruising speed of 14 knots and a top speed of 20 knots. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Home away from home\nThe Aviva is owned by reclusive British billionaire Joe Lewis, who owns Tavistock Group. Lewis uses the yacht as his home away from home when he is not in New Providence, Bahamas. He has a net worth of $5 billion, according to Forbes. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Amenities\nThe yacht can sleep 12 with six cabins and has amenities such as a Jacuzzi (on deck), elevator, swimming platform, air conditioning, underwater lights, bathing platform, gym and piano. It also has its own speedboat. But if that was not enough, there is even a custom built indoor paddle tennis court in the hull of the ship to satisfy the owner's passion for the sport. Adam Jeffery | CNBC This is a big boat\nThe yacht is currently anchored by the Ross Dock picnic area near the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge. Adam Jeffery | CNBC",
