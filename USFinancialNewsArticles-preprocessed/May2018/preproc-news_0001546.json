    "text": "April 30 (Reuters) - British retailer Carpetright said on Monday it expects to post a pretax loss of 7 million pounds ($9.61 million) to 9 million pounds, hurt by continued weakness in consumer confidence in its home market.\nThe company said its shareholders approved its proposed restructuring plan at a meeting, following approval from creditors and landlords on Thursday.\nThe floor coverings retailer said this month it would seek creditor approval for a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), a plan that involves the closure of 92 stores and rent reductions at 113 others.\n$1 = 0.7281 pounds Reporting by Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
