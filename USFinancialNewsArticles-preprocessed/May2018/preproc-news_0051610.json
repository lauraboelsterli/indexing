    "text": "LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Kingfisher, Europe’s second largest home improvement retailer, said on Thursday sales in its latest quarter were dented by unusually adverse weather conditions in March which impacted shopper footfall.\nThe firm said in Britain like-for-like sales at its B&Q business slumped 9 percent in the three months to April 30, while growth at the Screwfix chain slipped to 3.6 percent.\nAnalysts had forecast a decline of about 8 percent and a rise of 5 percent respectively.\nKingfisher said in France, where it trades as Castorama and Brico Depot, like-for-like sales were down 3.9 percent, broadly in line with analysts’ expectations.\nOverall group like-for-like sales fell 4.0 percent, with 3.0 percent of that decline attributed to the weather.\nKingfisher said market conditions “continue to be mixed.” (Reporting by James Davey; editing by Kate Holton)\n ",
