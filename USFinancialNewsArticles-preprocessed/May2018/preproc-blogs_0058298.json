    "text": "Cities These Subtle Psychological Hacks Keep Japan's Trains Running Smoothly Passengers board a train on the Toyoko line operated by Tokyu Corp. at Shibuya Station in Tokyo, Japan, on Tuesday, July 18, 2017. July 24 marks the first dry run of a 'Telework Day' encouraging people to work from home as the city gears up to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Authorities are seeking ways to make room for 920,000 spectators expected to visit Tokyo each day during the games.

Morris May 27, 2018\nJapan’s trains, including local commuter systems and longer-distance routes that span most of the country, are frequent objects of admiration for their speed, efficiency, and almost excessive timeliness . The system’s overall effectiveness depends in large part on Japan’s unique geography and some very smart alignment between transportation and real estate planning. But on a day-to-day (or minute-to-minute) basis, some fascinating psychological tricks also help keep things running smoothly.\nAccording to CityLab , Japan’s trains rely heavily on so-called “nudge theory,” or small signals that almost unconsciously influence riders’ behavior, keeping foot traffic moving smoothly through crowded stations. These go well beyond the basics of clear boarding indicators , well-designed maps, and fully audible announcements—which too many U.S. transit systems already have trouble executing.\nFor example, Japanese train systems use calming melodies to signal departures instead of harsh buzzers, which studies have shown prevent injuries by keeping passengers from rushing. Slightly more Machiavellian is the use of ultrasonic sound, inaudible to older passengers, to disperse crowds of potentially disruptive teenagers.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nThe use of subtle nudges also extends to train operators, who are expected to gesture with their hands and state any intended action out loud. That increases mental engagement and decreases operating errors.\nMuch more serious is the use of calming blue lights on certain parts of platforms, which have been shown to reduce suicide attempts by people jumping in front of trains. Suicide in general is a major social problem in Japan, and suicides by train also cause frequent, serious disruptions to the otherwise smoothly operating system.\nPreventing small or large disruptions is crucial to the efficient functioning of mass transit—just ask any New Yorker who has ever boiled with rage when new passengers cram into a subway car without letting exiting riders off first. But for American supporters of mass transit, such refinements may take a back seat to the chronic underinvestment that has left systems including the New York subway and Amtrak an increasingly unsafe and inefficient mess.
