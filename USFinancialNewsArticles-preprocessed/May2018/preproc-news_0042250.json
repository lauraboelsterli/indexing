    "text": "May 20, 2018 / 5:30 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago Exclusive - GE nears deal to merge transportation unit with Wabtec: sources Harry Brumpton , Greg Roumeliotis 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) is nearing a deal to merge its transportation business, which manufactures train engines, with Wabtec Corp ( WAB.N ), a U.S. maker of equipment for the rail industry, two people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. General Electric is seen at its plant in Baden, Switzerland November 15, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\nA deal that could value the combined company at more than $20 billion (14.85 billion pounds) could be announced as early as this week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.\nThere is always a possibility that the deal talks, which centre on using a tax-efficient structure called a Reverse Morris Trust, could collapse at the last minute, the sources cautioned.\nGE and Wabtec did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
