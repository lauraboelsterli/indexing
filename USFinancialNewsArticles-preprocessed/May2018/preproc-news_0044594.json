In a letter to AmTrust's board , Icahn laid out his opposition to a plan to take the company private.\nNordstrom shares fell 7 percent in after-hours trading. While the retailer posted better-than-expected earnings, Nordstrom reported same-store sales growth that missed analyst expectations. The company said comparable sales rose 0.6 percent during the first quarter. Wall Street had projected growth of 1.1 percent.\nShares of Applied Materials fell more than 4 percent in the extended session. While the semiconductor supplier beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, its sales projections fell short.\nFor the third quarter, Applied said it expects revenue between $4.33 billion and $4.53 billion. Analysts had forecast third-quarter revenue of about $4.53 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate.",
