(NASDAQ:MHLD) (“Maiden” or “the Company”) today reported first quarter 2018 net income attributable to Maiden common shareholders of $13.7 million or $0.16 per diluted common share compared to net income attributable to Maiden common shareholders of $20.5 million or $0.23 per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating earnings (11) were $16.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share compared with a non-GAAP operating earnings of $22.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2017.\nCommenting on the Company’s results, President and Chief Executive Officer, Art Raschbaum said, “We are pleased to start the year with a profitable first quarter. Underwriting results primarily reflect the impact of higher initial current year loss ratios, a modest level of adverse development and higher G&A expenses. Revenue in the quarter was influenced by a continued moderation of premium from our largest client, AmTrust, and in the Diversified segment from several accounts terminated over the last 12 months. Business development in the quarter was strong across the Diversified segment which should favorably impact future quarters. We remain committed to maintaining disciplined underwriting and enhancing profitability. As previously announced, our Board of Directors has retained BoA Merrill Lynch to assist the Company in evaluating strategic alternatives to enhance value and the Company continues to be actively engaged in this process but has no further update at this time.”\nConsolidated Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nIn the first quarter of 2018, gross premiums written decreased to $852.6 million from $923.4 million primarily due to non-renewals and re-underwriting of certain Diversified contracts conducted in both 2017 and in early 2018. Net premiums written totaled $849.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 5.7% compared to $900.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net premiums earned were $685.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $709.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing a decrease of 3.4%.\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses of $473.3 million compared to $480.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The loss ratio (6) in the first quarter of 2018 was 68.6% compared to 67.4% reported in the first quarter of 2017.\nCommission and other acquisition expenses decreased 6.0% to $208.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $222.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 reducing the commission and other acquisition expense ratio to 30.3% from 31.1%, respectively. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $20.0 million compared with $17.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher audit, legal and other professional fees and technology-related expenses. The general and administrative expense ratio (8) in the first quarter of 2018 increased to 2.9% compared to 2.4% in the first quarter of 2017, while the expense ratio (9) was 33.2% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 33.5% in the same quarter last year.\nThe combined ratio (10) for the first quarter of 2018 totaled 101.8% compared with 100.9% in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet investment income was $42.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $42.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the average yield on the fixed income portfolio was 3.18% while the average duration of investable assets was 4.7 years.\nDiversified Reinsurance Segment\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, ($ in thousands) 2018 2017 Change in (%) Gross premiums written $ 278,712 $ 332,045 (16.1 )% Net premiums written $ 274,953 $ 327,496 (16.0 )% Net premiums earned $ 194,134 $ 201,842 (3.8 )% Underwriting Ratios % Point Change Net loss and LAE ratio (6) 68.6 % 67.5 % 1.1 Commission and other acquisition expense ratio (7) 25.9 % 28.2 % (2.3 ) General and administrative expense ratio (8) 5.1 % 4.2 % 0.9 Expense ratio (9) 31.0 % 32.4 % (1.4 ) Combined ratio (10) 99.6 % 99.9 % (0.3 ) Gross premiums written and net premiums written decreased by 16.1% and 16.0%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of non-renewals and re-underwriting of certain contracts in 2017 and during the first quarter of 2018, with one large terminated account having returned premium of $17.5 million. Net premiums earned decreased by 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018 due to non-renewals and other underwriting actions taken as mentioned above. The segment’s combined ratio was 99.6% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 99.9% in the same period last year due to lower adverse prior year loss development. The combined ratio also reflects higher initial current year loss ratios for premiums earned during the period.\nAmTrust Reinsurance Segment\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, ($ in thousands) 2018 2017 Change in (%) Gross premiums written $ 573,928 $ 591,382 (3.0 )% Net premiums written $ 574,380 $ 573,052 0.2 % Net premiums earned $ 491,298 $ 507,642 (3.2 )% Underwriting Ratios % Point Change Net loss and LAE ratio (6) 68.7 % 67.3 % 1.4 Commission and other acquisition expense ratio (7) 32.0 % 32.3 % (0.3 ) General and administrative expense ratio (8) 0.2 % 0.2 % — Expense ratio (9) 32.2 % 32.5 % (0.3 ) Combined ratio (10) 100.9 % 99.8 % 1.1 Gross premiums written decreased 3.0% during the first quarter of 2018 and reflects reductions in the Small Commercial and Program businesses. Net premiums written increased by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2018 largely due to a reduction in the utilization of retrocessional capacity in 2018 compared to 2017. Net premiums earned in the segment decreased by 3.2% compared to the same period in 2017 mainly due to the decline in net premiums written in the AmTrust quota share. The segment experienced adverse prior year development of $8.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 largely from General Liability, with a smaller contribution from Commercial Auto Liability, primarily driven by accident years 2015 and 2016. The segment combined ratio was 100.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 99.8% in the same period in 2017 primarily due to higher initial current year loss ratios for premiums earned during the period slightly offset by a comparatively smaller amount of adverse prior period loss development.\nOther Financial Matters\nTotal assets increased to $6.8 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $6.6 billion at year-end 2017. Shareholders' equity was $1.16 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $1.23 billion at year end 2017. Book value per common share (1) was $8.34 at March 31, 2018 compared to $9.25 at December 31, 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recognized unrealized losses in its fixed income investment portfolio of $68.3 million which represents a decrease of $0.82 in book value per common share. During the first quarter of 2018, the Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.15 per common share, $0.515625 per Series A preference shares, $0.445313 per Series C preference shares and $0.418750 per Series D preference shares.\n(1)(11) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table for additional information on these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation of these measures to GAAP measures.\n(6)(7)(8)(9)(10) Loss ratio, commission and other acquisition expense ratio, general and administrative expense ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio are non-GAAP operating metrics.

(2) Non-GAAP income from operations is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by the Company as net income attributable to Maiden excluding foreign exchange and other gains and losses, amortization of intangible assets, interest and amortization expenses, income tax expense and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest and should not be considered as an alternative to net income. The Company’s management believes that non-GAAP income from operations is a useful measure of the Company’s underlying earnings fundamentals based on its underwriting and investment income before financing costs. This income from operations enables readers of this information to more clearly understand the essential operating results of the Company. The Company’s measure of non-GAAP income from operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. (3) Dividends on preference shares consist of $3,094 paid to Preference shares - Series A for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, $2,939 paid to Preference shares - Series C for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and $2,512 and $0 paid to Preference shares - Series D for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (4) Underwriting related general and administrative expenses is a non-GAAP measure and includes expenses which are segregated for analytical purposes as a component of underwriting income. (5) Underwriting (loss) income is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated as net premiums earned plus other insurance revenue less net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses directly related to underwriting activities. Management believes that this measure is important in evaluating the underwriting performance of the Company and its segments. This measure is also a useful tool to measure the profitability of the Company separately from the investment results and is also a widely used performance indicator in the insurance industry. (6) Calculated by dividing net loss and LAE by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. (7) Calculated by dividing commission and other acquisition expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. (8) Calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. (9) Calculated by adding together the commission and other acquisition expense ratio and general and administrative expense ratio. (10) Calculated by adding together the net loss and LAE ratio and the expense ratio. (11) Non-GAAP operating earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by the Company as net income attributable to Maiden common shareholders excluding realized and unrealized investment gains and losses, foreign exchange and other gains and losses, amortization of intangible assets, divested E&S business and NGHC run-off and non-cash deferred tax expense and should not be considered as an alternative to net income. The Company's management believes that non-GAAP operating earnings is a useful indicator of trends in the Company's underlying operations. The Company's measure of non-GAAP operating earnings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. (12) Non-GAAP operating return on average common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses non-GAAP operating return on average common shareholders' equity as a measure of profitability that focuses on the return to Maiden common shareholders. It is calculated using non-GAAP operating earnings attributable to Maiden common shareholders divided by average Maiden common shareholders' equity. (13) Investable assets is the total of the Company's investments, cash and cash equivalents and loan to a related party. (14) Total capital resources is the sum of the Company's principal amount of debt and Maiden shareholders' equity.\nSource: Maiden Holdings, Ltd.",
