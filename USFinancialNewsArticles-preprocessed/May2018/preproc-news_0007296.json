These financial measures are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In evaluating the Company’s performance, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial statements prepared under GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Further, management and the Board of Directors utilize these non-GAAP financial measures to gain a better understanding of the Company’s comparative operating performance from period-to-period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial statements, are useful to investors because they provide a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operating results, including results of operations against investor and analyst financial models, which helps identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and provides a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business.\nMITEK SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Unaudited)\n(amounts in thousands except share data)\nMarch 31, 2018 September 30, 2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 25,238 $ 12,289 Short-term investments 19,146 30,279 Accounts receivable, net 7,797 7,099 Other current assets 3,359 1,209 55,540 50,876 Long-term investments 939 3,780 Property and equipment, net 2,278 613 Goodwill and intangible assets 18,245 5,311 Deferred income taxes 14,903 11,065 Other non-current assets 430 74 Total assets $ 92,335 $ 71,719 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 2,304 $ 1,918 Accrued payroll and related taxes 3,411 3,709 Deferred revenue, current portion 3,953 3,305 Other current liabilities 4,659 602 14,327 9,534 Deferred revenue, non-current portion 609 85 Other non-current liabilities 3,678 692 Total liabilities 18,614 10,311 Stockholders’ equity: Preferred stock, $0.001 par value, 1,000,000 shares authorized, none issued and outstanding — — Common stock, $0.001 par value, 60,000,000 shares authorized, 35,058,864 and 33,724,392 issued and outstanding, as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively 35 34 Additional paid-in capital 89,109 78,677 Accumulated other comprehensive income 668 147 Accumulated deficit (16,091 ) (17,450 ) Total stockholders’ equity 73,721 61,408 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 92,335 $ 71,719 MITEK SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\n(amounts in thousands except per share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Revenue Software and hardware $ 8,773 $ 7,797 $ 15,979 $ 13,780 SaaS, maintenance, and consulting 5,504 3,622 10,434 6,908 Total revenue 14,277 11,419 26,413 20,688 Operating costs and expenses Cost of revenue—software and hardware 485 154 1,204 368 Cost of revenue—SaaS, maintenance, and consulting 1,232 676 2,130 1,353 Selling and marketing 5,348 3,704 10,123 7,542 Research and development 3,501 2,401 6,781 4,852 General and administrative 3,773 2,742 7,290 4,985 Acquisition-related costs and expenses 1,203 518 2,462 1,036 Total operating costs and expenses 15,542 10,195 29,990 20,136 Operating income (loss) (1,265 ) 1,224 (3,577 ) 552 Other income, net 204 67 394 132 Income (loss) before income taxes (1,061 ) 1,291 (3,183 ) 684 Income tax provision (99 ) (74 ) (3,713 ) (74 ) Net income (loss) $ (1,160 ) $ 1,217 $ (6,896 ) $ 610 Net income (loss) per share—basic $ (0.03 ) $ 0.04 $ (0.20 ) $ 0.02 Net income (loss) per share—diluted $ (0.03 ) $ 0.03 $ (0.20 ) $ 0.02 Shares used in calculating net income (loss) per share—basic 34,976 32,786 34,587 32,582 Shares used in calculating net income (loss) per share—diluted 34,976 34,815 34,587 34,818 MITEK SYSTEMS, INC.\nNON-GAAP NET INCOME RECONCILIATION\n(Unaudited)\n(amounts in thousands except per share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (1,160 ) $ 1,217 $ (6,896 ) $ 610 Non-GAAP adjustments: Acquisition-related costs and expenses 1,203 518 2,462 1,036 Litigation costs — — 50 — Stock compensation expense 2,058 1,223 3,947 2,308 Income tax effect of pre-tax adjustments (978 ) — (1,938 ) — Impact of tax reform on deferred taxes — — 4,417 — Cash tax difference (1) 1,024 — 1,136 — Non-GAAP net income 2,147 2,958 3,178 3,954 Non-GAAP income per share—basic $ 0.06 $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.12 Non-GAAP income per share—diluted $ 0.06 $ 0.08 $ 0.09 $ 0.11 Shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income per share—basic 34,976 32,786 34,587 32,582 Shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income per share—diluted 36,667 34,815 36,526 34,818 (1) The Company’s non-GAAP net income per share is calculated using the cash tax rate of 3%. The estimated cash tax rate is the estimated tax payable on the Company’s tax returns as a percentage of estimated annual non-GAAP pre-tax net income. The Company uses an estimated cash tax rate to adjust for the historical variation in the effective book tax rate associated with the reversal of valuation allowances, the utilization of research and development tax credits, and the utilization of loss carryforwards which currently have an overall effect of reducing taxes payable. The Company believes that the cash tax rate provides a more transparent view of the Company’s operating results. The Company’s effective tax rate used for the purposes of calculating GAAP net loss for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 was negative 9% and negative 117%, respectively.",
