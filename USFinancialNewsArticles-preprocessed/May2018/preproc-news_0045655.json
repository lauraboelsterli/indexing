FILE PHOTO: Workers adjust and clean the logo of the European Commission at the entrance of the Berlaymont building, the EC headquarters, in Brussels September 12, 2013. REUTERS/Yves Herman\nThe plan is meant to spur green investment and to curb “greenwashing”, a practice whereby companies and other organizations claim to be more environmentally friendly than they really are.\n“We want to establish an EU-wide classification system for sustainable activities, to provide common definitions for what is green and what is not. This is a ground breaking step,” the EU commission’s vice-president Valid Dombrovskis said. Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; editing by Philip Blenkinsop",
