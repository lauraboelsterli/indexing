I’m confident that she will provide strong leadership of the finance function as we focus on our growth strategy, shareholder returns and customer satisfaction.”\nMr. Perry also congratulated Peter Alteen on his appointment as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of Newfoundland Power effective June 1, 2018.\nAbout Fortis\nFortis is a leader in the North American regulated electric and gas utility industry with 2017 revenue of C$8.3 billion and total assets of approximately C$48 billion.
