    "text": "Manny Machado, Mark Trumbo and Adam Jones hit home runs Monday night and left fielder Trey Mancini helped protect a narrow lead by throwing out two baserunners in the same inning, lifting the Baltimore Orioles to a 3-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox in the opener of a four-game series in Chicago.\nRight-hander Andrew Cashner (2-5) combined with three relievers to help the Orioles win for just the second time in their last six games.\nMachado hit his 15th home run of the season in the fourth inning and Trumbo added his second in the fifth, staking Baltimore to a 2-0 lead.\nThe White Sox threatened to erase the deficit, and perhaps even go ahead, in the bottom of the fifth, only to be denied by Mancini.\nAdam Engel hit a one-out single, but was gunned down trying to stretch it into a double by Mancini.\nYoan Moncada then walked and Yolmer Sanchez singled before Jose Abreu doubled to left field to get the White Sox within 2-1.\nBut Sanchez also tried to score on the play and was thrown out by Mancini, allowing the Orioles to retain the lead.\nThe two outfield assists raised Mancini’s season total to six, tops among all left fielders in the majors.\nJones homered in the sixth, his eighth of the season, to make it 3-1, before the White Sox rallied again in the bottom of the inning.\nThis time, a pair of ground-rule doubles by Daniel Palka and Leury Garcia sandwiched a single by Matt Davidson, scoring a run and putting runners at second and third with no outs.\nWith the lead having been trimmed to 3-2, the Orioles summoned Mychal Givens from the bullpen. He prevented further scoring by getting a popout and two strikeouts.\nGivens also pitched a hitless seventh and Richard Bleier a scoreless eighth, setting the stage for closer Brad Brach, who worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the ninth, striking out Trayce Thompson to end the game and register his seventh save.\nThe Baltimore bullpen pitched four shutout innings, allowing two hits and striking out five.\nCashner allowed two runs and eight hits in his five-plus innings. He walked three and struck out four.\nWhite Sox starter Hector Santiago (0-2) allowed just five hits in six innings, but three were home runs that produced all the Baltimore scoring. He walked two and struck out seven.\nAbreu had two doubles while Davidson and Garcia added two hits apiece for the White Sox, who lost for just the second time in five games to begin an eight-game homestand.\nThe White Sox out-hit the Orioles 10-5 in defeat.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
