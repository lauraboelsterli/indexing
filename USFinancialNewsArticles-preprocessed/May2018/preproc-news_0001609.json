    "text": "TORONTO, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dalradian Resources Inc. (TSX:DNA) (AIM:DALR) (“Dalradian” or the “Company”) announces results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, including closing cash and cash equivalents of $126.9 million 1 .\nPatrick F.N. Anderson, Dalradian's President and CEO, commented:\n“Now that our resource drilling is complete, we expect to issue an updated resource shortly that will feed into an updated feasibility study in Q3. Exploration in 2018 will continue to test extensions of Curraghinalt as well as several regional targets.\nSince February, our planning application has been progressing through review and consultation by the authorities. We have increased our outreach to a broad range of stakeholders to build understanding about our proposed mine and the many opportunities it brings to Northern Ireland. I am proud to report that we have had 1,000 visitors to our public site tours and 1,400 employment inquiries.”\n﻿\n1 All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted\nOperational highlights as of May 1, 2018\nCommencement of public and statutory consultation processes for the permitting application to build a mine at the Curraghinalt deposit (the “Planning Application”). Continued community relations activities, including welcoming our 1,000 th local visitor on a tunnel tour and site visit. Receipt of approximately 1,400 submissions of interest in careers at the proposed mine, with approximately one-third of applicants coming from the local area. Completion of a technical work program in preparation for updates to the 2016 NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate (“Mineral Resource”), including completion of 6,324 metres of infill drilling in 22 holes to close off the infill drilling program totalling 29,026 metres in 76 holes. This drilling has extended the strike length of the system and has identified a number of new veins. Completion of 5,275 metres of drilling in 12 holes in peripheral areas of Curraghinalt to test continuity of the deposit. Continued progression of the technical work program for an update of the feasibility study (“FS”), including advancement of the geotechnical model and further work on ore-sorting technology. The Company has an active program in place to meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) that becomes effective in Northern Ireland on May 25, 2018. GDPR will supersede the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and expands the rights of individuals to control how their personal information is collected and processed. GDPR places a range of new obligations on the Company to be more accountable for data protection.\nCorporate and financial highlights of Q1 2018\nCash and cash equivalents were $126.9 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $138.0 million at December 31, 2017. Net loss of $1.4 million ($0.00 per share) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with a net loss of $1.3 million ($0.01 per share) for the comparable period of 2017. Expenditures on mineral property under development for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $6.1 million compared with $2.5 million, net of expected receipt from processing of mineralized material, during the comparable period in 2017. During Q1 2018, permitting and drilling were the largest spending categories as work focused on supporting the Planning Application and infill and step-out drilling. As of May 1, 2018, Dalradian had 355,493,448 common shares issued and outstanding and 367,579,114 common shares outstanding on a fully diluted shares basis.\nOutlook\nTaking Curraghinalt to production is the Company’s primary goal and will be advanced in 2018 through further drilling, engineering and geological studies, and environmental and permitting activities. The Company expects to release a mineral resource update during Q2 2018, followed by an updated FS during Q3 2018. In addition, Dalradian will also continue to explore its large land package to delineate targets for drilling. Permitting activities will include preparation and submission of applications for ancillary permits and consents and expanded stakeholder relations activities to support the Planning Application.\nThe overall budget for 2018 is approximately $49 million for operational activities in Northern Ireland and Canada, including general and administrative costs. The two major items that represent approximately 50% of the operational budget are exploration and permitting, with planned expenditures roughly similar for the two areas. Mine planning and engineering work to produce an updated FS is the third-largest component at approximately 10% of the overall budget. During Q1 2018, operational spending totalled approximately $9 million.\nWorking capital at March 31, 2018 was $124 million compared to $132 million at December 31, 2017. This financial strength supports 2018 plans to continue exploration and other work to increase the value of the Northern Ireland Properties, while simultaneously moving Curraghinalt through the permitting process.\nWritten submissions to the Company’s consultation events held in November 2016 demonstrated majority support for the project. However, as with most regionally significant planning applications, there are a number of people who are currently opposed to the project. The planning system in Northern Ireland allows and encourages all interested parties to make their views known and to submit the specific reasons for their support or opposition. The Company respects the planning process in Northern Ireland and is confident the project will succeed because it is a responsible development that will bring sustainable economic and social benefits to the local area and Northern Ireland as a whole for years to come.\nIt is common, with respect to regionally significant planning applications in Northern Ireland, to have multiple legal challenges, including judicial reviews. A judicial review (“JR”) is a type of court proceeding in which a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision or action made by a public body; they are a challenge to the way in which a decision has been made, rather than the conclusion reached. Two JRs have been brought against government departments in Northern Ireland relating to decisions taken by these departments (on planning and environmental grounds) and Dalradian is a notice party. The first JR concerns the decision by the Department for Infrastructure to accept the Company’s Planning Application and has a hearing date in mid-June. The second JR concerns the decision by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to grant a revised water discharge consent for the Company’s exploration site. In June, the date for the hearing of the second JR will be set and it is expected to take place in the second half of the year. Both departments are robustly defending the proceedings and the decisions made. Dalradian, as a notice party, will also be submitting evidence in defence of the decision-making process. The timing and process for review of the Planning Application is not affected by the JR process and the application has continued to move through review and consultation steps. The Company will provide updates on any material developments regarding the JRs.\nSupporting Documents\nThe Q1 2018 year-end Financial Statements (not including notes) can be found below.
