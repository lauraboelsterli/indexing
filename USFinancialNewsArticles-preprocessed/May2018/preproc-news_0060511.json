    "text": "(Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) said on Wednesday that its joint venture with a unit of Mitsubishi Corp ( 8058.T ) would sell a coal mine in Queensland in Australia to Japan’s Sojitz Corp ( 2768.T ) for A$100 million ($74.89 million).\nFILE PHOTO: A sign adorns the building where mining company BHP Billiton has their office in Perth, Western Australia, November 19, 2015. REUTERS/David Gray/File photo/File Photo The Gregory Crinum hard coking coal mine had ceased production by the end of 2015. BHP said its annual capacity was 6 million tonnes prior to that.\n“(The BHP-Mitsubishi alliance) made the decision to sell the mine after a detailed review that concluded there is potential for another party to realize greater value (there),” BHP said in a statement.\nBHP’s Australia-listed shares were 0.8 percent lower on Wednesday, in line with the broader market.\nReporting by Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Editing by Joseph Radford\n ",
