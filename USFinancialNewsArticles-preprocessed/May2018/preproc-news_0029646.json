    "text": "May 9 (Reuters) - Italian luxury group Tod’s like-for-like sales should improve in the second quarter of the year and turn positive starting from the second half, its Chief Financial Officer Emilio Macellari said on Wednesday.\nThe CFO told analysts in a conference call after first-quarter sales that he was not worried by first-quarter like-for-like sales, which saw a decline of 4.4 percent year on year.\nMacellari said he was hoping that like-for-like sales would turn positive already in the second quarter.\nHe also said in a company’s statement on Wednesday that first quarter sales were in line with the company’s expectations as the impact of the new business model was not visible yet.\nThe CFO said earlier in January that results from the company’s new management team would be visible starting from the second part of the year.\n“If the new strategic plan implementation continues according to our expectations, we can achieve excellent results in a reasonable timeframe” added the CFO in the statement.\nHe reiterated that the company was focused on generating growth in the mid-term.\nFirst quarter sales fell by 5.2 percent to 226.1 million euros ($268.13 million) at reported rates, a decrease of 1.8 percent at constant rates.\nWeather and merchandising mix were among the drags, as less-profitable small bags are currently the ones which sell the most, according to Macellari, and shoes from Tod’s, which is known for its Gommino loafers, are more suited for the summer.\nRegarding the company’s plans to offer multiple collections throughout the year, the CFO added that the company will probably launch new products every two months.\nThe new strategy, dubbed “Factory”, will aim at launching several collections throughout the year to better engage with its customers, with a focus on the company’s more classic items.\nThe move, announced in February, follows the footsteps of Italian outerwear maker Moncler, which bid farewell to the catwalk in February to focus on monthly launches of new products.
