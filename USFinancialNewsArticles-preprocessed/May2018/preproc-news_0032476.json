Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports Kyle Freeland pitched into the seventh inning, and relievers Bryan Shaw, Mike Dunn, Adam Ottavino and Wade Davis limited the Brewers to one hit over the final 2 2/3 innings, helping the Rockies snap a three-game losing streak.\nStory provided the Rockies’ pitchers with all the support they would need when he followed Nolan Arenado’s two-out triple with a two-run homer in the bottom of the first inning.\nThe same duo combined for a third run in the third, this time with Arenado smacking a two-out double and Story following with a double of his own.\nStory then made it a two-homer game for the sixth time in his career when he connected again off Brewers starter Brent Suter with two outs and none aboard in the fifth, completing the game’s scoring.\nMay 12, 2018; Denver, CO, USA; Colorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story (27) celebrates with second baseman DJ LeMahieu (9) after a win against the Milwaukee Brewers at Coors Field. Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports Story’s two-homer game was his first since last August. He now has 10 homers this season.\nSuter started in place of Chase Anderson, who was a late scratch with a stomach illness that will send him to the 10-day disabled list.\nFreeland (3-4) allowed four hits and four walks in 6 1/3 innings, leaving after issuing one-out walks to Jett Bandy and Jonathan Villar in the seventh.\nMay 12, 2018; Denver, CO, USA; Colorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story (27) tosses his bat after a solo home run in the fifth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers at Coors Field. Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports Shaw came on to get Lorenzo Cain to ground out, and Dunn then induced Christian Yelich into a flyout to end the threat.\nFreeland struck out six in the fourth combined shutout of his career.\nThe shutout was the fifth of the season for the Colorado pitching staff. The Rockies had allowed 24 runs in their previous three games.\nSuter (2-3) was pulled after five innings, having allowed four runs and seven hits. He walked one and struck out two.\nChris Iannetta had a double and a single for the Rockies, who had suffered 5-2 and 11-10 losses to the Brewers the previous two nights.\nIannetta, Story (three) and Arenado (two) combined for seven of Colorado’s nine hits.\nSuter had the only extra-base hit, a double, for the Brewers, who were shut out for the eighth time this season.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
