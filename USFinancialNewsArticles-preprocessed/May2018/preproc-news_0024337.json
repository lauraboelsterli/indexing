    "text": "PRAGUE, May 9 (Reuters) - The Czech competition watchdog cancelled on Wednesday a 10.7 billion crown ($496.24 million) government tender for a new operator of a highway toll system.\nThe UOHS office said the tender lacked transparency due to errors in handing over tender documentation to bidders, and due to an unclear definition of the size of the road network that the fixed-price offer should cover.\nThe tender had been won by a consortium of CzechToll, controlled by richest Czech businessman Petr Kellnerâ€™s PPF group and SkyToll, which operates the highway toll system in neighbouring Slovakia.\nThe Czech-Slovak consortium beat a bid by current toll operator Kapsch of Austria.\nThe decision can be appealed. The government is running out of time to find a toll operator from January 2020 when the current contract ends.\n$1 = 21.5620 Czech crowns Reporting by Jan Lopatka\n ",
