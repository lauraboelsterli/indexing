    "text": "BARCELONA (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton summed up his feelings in a few words after leading team mate Valtteri Bottas to the first Mercedes qualifying one-two of the season on Saturday.\nFormula One F1 - Spanish Grand Prix - Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain - May 12, 2018 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates pole position with an award after qualifying REUTERS/Albert Gea “I needed this pole,” said the four-times Formula One world champion, whose performance was watched by Daimler chairman and Mercedes-Benz boss Dieter Zetsche, in the post-qualifying interviews at the Spanish Grand Prix.\nSo too did his team, winners of both crowns for the past four years but whose dominance is now under a more sustained attack than ever from closest rivals Ferrari and a resurgent Red Bull.\nSunday’s race will also be the first this year without a Ferrari on the front row.\nFerrari’s Sebastian Vettel had taken the previous three poles before Saturday and, while Hamilton regained the championship lead in Azerbaijan two weekends ago, Ferrari are ahead in the constructors’ standings.\nLast season, Hamilton took 11 poles in 20 races and won nine but this year Ferrari have had the better one-lap pace.\nSaturday pressed a reset button of sorts, the Briton celebrating his third successive pole at the Circuit de Catalunya and fourth in five years.\nThe pace was real, too, with the champion’s fastest lap of one minute 16.173 seconds a track record.\n“For the team it’s been a struggle,” said Hamilton.\n“I’m sure there have been a lot of people with nerves over the past few races, just not really understanding, constantly learning but feeling that we’re not learning quick enough,” added the Briton.\n“So to come here and get the one-two in qualifying is a true show of all the hard work that everyone is doing.”\nHamilton won in Azerbaijan for his first victory of the season, ending a winless run of six races — three from last year.\nThe man with more pole positions than any other driver in the history of Formula One, his tally now standing at 74, had been going through a drought since Australia in March.\nHamilton said the Pirelli tires were partly responsible.\n“They appear to be a lot harder than last year,” he said.\n“I know they went softer but...the working range is far narrower than it was last year. And so you give it everything on an out-lap and you still don’t have your tires in the (performance) window.\n“This year they’re just too hard. That’s why everyone struggles. I don’t understand why they worked in Australia and haven’t worked ever since and today we have them working.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
