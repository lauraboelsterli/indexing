REUTERS/Ginnette Riquelme/File Photo\n“We have today filed our appeal at Brighton Magistrates’ Court,” an Uber spokesman said. “We want to continue providing more choice and competition for both private hire drivers and passengers in the city.”\nThe Silicon Valley firm is also battling to keep its cars on the streets of London after losing its licence in the British capital, its most important European market.\nUber drivers licensed in Brighton can continue to operate in the city until the appeals process is exhausted.
