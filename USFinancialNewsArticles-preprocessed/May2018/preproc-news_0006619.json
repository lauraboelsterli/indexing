COMMENTARY: -- A government spokesman indicated that retail sales sustained a double-digit year-on-year increase in March, buttressed by the upbeat local consumer sentiment under generally favourable economic conditions and the continued appreciable increase in visitor arrivals. -- The outlook for retail sales should stay sanguine in the near term, given positive employment and earnings prospects and buoyant inbound tourism, the spokesman added.
