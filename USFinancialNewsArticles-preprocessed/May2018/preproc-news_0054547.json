    "text": "Dr. Yan Liu will manage medical affairs, supporting the company’s clinical trials operations and business development activities in Europe\nSOPHIA ANTIPOLIS, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nMedian Technologies (Paris:ALMDT), the industry-leading Imaging Phenomics Company®, announced today the appointment of Dr. Yan Liu as Medical Director, Europe. Yan Liu, MD, MS, PhD, Medical Director, will be responsible for managing Medical Affairs throughout Europe, supporting Median’s clinical trials operations and business development activities.\nDr. Yan Liu is an imaging expert with more than 15 years of clinical and academic research experience. For the past 6 years, Dr. Liu has been dedicated to the integration of imaging in multicenter oncology trials and the validation of imaging biomarkers.\nPreviously, Dr. Liu served as the head of translational research, radiotherapy and imaging department of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).\nDr. Liu completed her medical studies at the Shanghai Jiaotong University College of Medicine, China, where she received her Master of Medicine in Image Diagnosis as well. Dr. Liu also studied brain functional imaging at the Erasmus Hospital in Brussels, where she earned her PhD in medical science (neuroradiology) from Université Libre de Bruxelles.\nDr. Liu has published book chapters and more than 25 peer-reviewed papers in high impact journals such as Lancet Oncology and Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology.\nBefore joining Median, Dr. Liu was a member of the RECIST core working group, the scientific leader of two European imaging projects, and the chair for the EORTC imaging group (2016-2017).\n“It is my privilege to join Median Technologies, one of the most innovative imaging phenomics companies. We have the common goal to improve patient care through high quality image analysis and management in clinical trials”, said Dr. Liu. “Cancer patient survival and quality of life can be enhanced only through medical research. As the knowledge of cancer biology is constantly increasing, treatment options are focusing more and more on precision medicine and new strategies such as immuno-oncology. Image analysis and management, which are key for new treatment evaluation in clinical trials, today require a high level of image expertise, which is the core of Median’s activities. I am very happy to contribute to further strengthening the company's expertise”, Dr. Liu added.\n“We are thrilled to have Yan join our company. As a recognized imaging expert and researcher, she is bringing with her a very significant and unique expertise on imaging for oncology clinical trials. We are entering a new era for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, where Artificial Intelligence will not only play a central role in medical imaging for daily practice, but also for the discovery of non-invasive imaging biomarkers.
