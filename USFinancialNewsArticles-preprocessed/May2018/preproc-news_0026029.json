    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 11:40 AM / in 7 minutes Lilly to buy Armo Biosciences for $1.6 billion to bolster cancer pipeline Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co ( LLY.N ) said on Thursday it would buy Armo BioSciences Inc ( ARMO.O ) for about $1.6 billion (1.2 billion pounds) to bolster its portfolio of cancer drugs, merely four months after the smaller drug developer went public. The logo of Lilly is seen on a wall of the Lilly France company unit, part of the Eli Lilly and Co drugmaker group, in Fegersheim near Strasbourg, France, February 1, 2018. Picture taken February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Vincent Kessler\nLilly’s offer of $50 per share in cash represents a premium of 68 percent to Armo’s Wednesday close. Armo’s shares were trading at $50.10 before the opening bell.\nThe deal gives Lilly access to Armo’s lead candidate, pegilodecakin, which is being studied in a late-stage clinical trial in pancreatic cancer, as well as earlier stage trials in other forms of cancer.\nLilly already has a large portfolio of cancer treatments. Its lung cancer drug, Alimta, helped it comfortably beat analysts’ profit expectations for the first quarter.\nThe transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
