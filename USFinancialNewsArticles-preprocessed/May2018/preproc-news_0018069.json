Blueback Global recently launched its dedicated UK website: www.bluebackglobal.co.uk , to further enhance its thought leadership in the market.\nFurther recognition of this was made as the company was recently honored by the British American Business Council and its title sponsor, Barclays, in its annual Transatlantic Growth Awards ceremony. Blueback Global secured a category win for its demonstration of quality, client satisfaction and service in driving SME growth and transatlantic business.\nAdvancing APAC Team\nIn addition, the company has promoted Isabella Cheung to Head of Global Compliance and Payroll and Regina Lam to Head of Global Accounting Services. Based in Hong Kong, Ms. Cheung has managed payroll and international compliance practices relating to tax law, labor protections, work permits and visas and general business regulations.

We pride ourselves on always being a single point of contact, being extremely responsive, and combining a personal touch with unparalleled global perspective and value to meet these challenges.\"\nAbout Blueback Global\nBlueback Global supports the international growth ambitions of companies across the world.
