    "text": "Beverage industry veteran José Carvalho\njoins company as Chief Financial Officer, USA\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Stoli Group ® announced the promotion of Rudy Costello to President & Chief Executive Officer of Stoli Group ® USA, LLC, effective immediately. Previously, Costello had served as Chief Operating Officer for the U.S. importer and marketer of alcoholic beverages, headquartered in New York City. In addition to the USA business, Costello will continue to oversee Canada and will report into Hugues Pietrini, Stoli Group’s Global President & CEO. The organization has also named José “Joe” Carvalho as Chief Financial Officer for Stoli Group USA, reporting into Costello and into Olesya Milyutina, Stoli Global Chief Financial Officer.\nCostello joined the company at the start of 2018 and has shepherded Stoli Group USA’s realignment of its control state and national accounts divisions, the recruitment of top talent into the organization and Stoli ® Vodka’s expansions, including Stoli ® Cucumber, the range’s first flavor addition in six years, and Stoli ® Crushed Mango, which brings the brand’s “vodka with real fruit juice” offerings to three varieties. Carvalho comes to Stoli Group USA from Vita Coco, where he stewarded the company’s spectacular financial growth as it entered more than 30 countries. Prior to his post with the leading coconut water brand, Carvalho held the position of Vice President, Finance at The Coca Cola Company.\n“While Rudy’s tenure at our company is in its infancy, we have already seen that he is skilled at motivating our passionate and creative team and that he holds strong relationships with key partners,” offered Pietrini. “Joe has a consistent track record of working with dynamic, entrepreneurial, global organizations from the frontlines to implement results-driven financial cultures. I am looking forward to working more closely with both as we take Stoli USA to the next level.”\nCostello added, “Hugues has created an empowered, flexible company without walls that breaks convention and is truly energizing. As we continue to build our brands, drive growth across categories and improve route-to-market strategies, we will maintain our fast, fearless, collaborative approach. I am committed to working with our passionate, young team and our partners day in and day out to ensure success across the board.”\nAbout Stoli Group USA\nStoli Group USA, LLC is a U.S. importer and marketer of alcoholic beverages, headquartered in New York City.
