    "text": "JERUSALEM, May 30 (Reuters) -\n* Shufersal, Israel’s largest supermarket chain, said on Wednesday net profit rose slightly in the first quarter, as it integrated a newly purchased drugstore chain and expanded its private label products.\n* The company posted net profit of 67 million shekels ($19 million) versus 66 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 9.1 percent to 3.2 billion shekels, with same store sales up 2.8 percent.\n* Shufersal is controlled by holding company Discount Investment Corp.\n* Shufesal last year agreed to buy New-Pharm Drugstores, which operates dozens of branches in Israel, for 130 million shekels.\n* Shuferal said its private label products now account for 23.8 percent of its sales, and that 13.6 percent of the chain’s sales were handled online.\n* ($1 = 3.5841 shekels) (Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch Editing by Steven Scheer)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
