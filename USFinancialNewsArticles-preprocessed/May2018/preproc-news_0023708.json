    "text": "TORONTO, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spectral Medical Inc., (TSX:EDT), a Phase III company developing the first treatment for patients with septic shock guided by a companion diagnostic, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Review\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1,163,000 compared to $910,000 for the same three-month period last year. First quarter revenues were consistent with prior year levels.\nOperating costs for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $1,877,000 compared to $1,903,000 for the same period in 2017. Most of the Company’s expenses are incurred in its Phase III clinical trial and regulatory program and will vary depending on the timing and determination of the regulatory path forward. Apart from clinical trial and regulatory activities, the Company continues to maintain a low cost operating structure for its base business operations.\nLoss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $714,000 ($0.003 per share) compared to $993,000 ($0.005 per share) for the same quarter last year.\nThe Company concluded the first quarter of 2018 with cash on hand of $982,000 compared to $1,449,000 as of December 31, 2017. After closing of its private placement financing subsequent to the quarter end, the Company had $5,842,000 of cash to pursue its regulatory approval for the PMX cartridge, working capital, and general corporate purposes.\nThe total number of shares outstanding for the Company was 207,796,522 as at March 31, 2018.\nAbout Spectral\nSpectral is a Phase III company seeking U.S. FDA approval for its unique product for the treatment of patients with septic shock, Toraymyxin™ (“PMX”). PMX is a therapeutic hemoperfusion device that removes endotoxin, which can cause sepsis, from the bloodstream and is guided by the Company's Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA™), the only FDA cleared diagnostic for the risk of developing sepsis.\nPMX has been approved for therapeutic use in Japan and Europe, and has been used safely and effectively on more than 150,000 patients to date. In March 2009, Spectral obtained the exclusive development and commercial rights in the U.S. for PMX, and in November 2010, signed an exclusive distribution agreement for this product in Canada. Approximately 350,000 patients are diagnosed with severe sepsis and septic shock in North America each year. Spectral is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol EDT.

Implicit in this information, particularly in respect of the future outlook of Spectral and anticipated events or results, are assumptions based on beliefs of Spectral's senior management as well as information currently available to it. While these assumptions were considered reasonable by Spectral at the time of preparation, they may prove to be incorrect. Readers are cautioned that actual results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the availability of funds and resources to pursue R&D projects, the successful and timely completion of clinical studies, the ability of Spectral to take advantage of business opportunities in the biomedical industry, the granting of necessary approvals by regulatory authorities as well as general economic, market and business conditions, and could differ materially from what is currently expected.\nThe TSX has not reviewed and does not accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this statement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nPaul Walker\nPresident and CEO\nSpectral Medical Inc.\n416-626-3233 ext. 2100\npwalker@spectraldx.com Ali Mahdavi\nCapital Markets & Investor Relations\n416-962-3300\nam@spinnakercmi.com\nSpectral Medical Inc.\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\n(Unaudited) (in thousands of Canadian dollars) March 31 2018 December 31 2017 January 01 2017 Restated (Note 7) Restated (Note 7) $ $ $ Assets Current assets Cash 982 1,449 5,080 Trade and other receivables 857 881 642 Inventories 298 191 244 Prepayments and other assets 249 73 166 Contract asset 126 -
