In addition, as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure optimal learning experiences for all students across our entire network, we continued to upgrade our flagship products while integrating new programs to improve the effectiveness of our course offerings. Our student retention rate increased to 71% in the first quarter of 2018 from 70% in the same period last year, which is a testament to our commitment to product R&D and our unwavering focus on improving students’ learning experience. We are confident that our innovation capabilities, geographic presence, and global partnerships will position us at the forefront of the rapidly growing junior ELT market in China.”\nMs. Chelsea Wang, Chief Financial Officer of RISE, stated, “We are pleased to report another solid quarter with impressive financial results. Despite some unfavorable seasonal impacts, our total revenues increased by 28.4% year-over-year, driven by a 26.6% year-over-year increase in our revenues from educational programs. Furthermore, during the quarter, our non-GAAP net income attributable to RISE increased by 37.5% year-over-year to RMB38.9 million and non-GAAP net margin attributable to RISE expanded to 14.4%. Deferred revenue and customer advances as of March 31, 2018increased to RMB1.07 billion, representing a 31.7% increase compared with the year-end balance of 2017.”\nMs. Wang, added, “The seasonality impact on this quarter’s enrollment is more pronounced when compared to an exceptionally high base in the first quarter of 2017, which accounted for 39% of last year’s total enrollments. As a result, our enrollment in self-owned learning centers grew 13.7% from 19,397 students to 22,045 students. With approximately 13-15 new self-owned centers expected to open by the end of 2018, we expect our enrollment growth to accelerate and we anticipate that this quarter’s enrollment will account for approximately 30% of 2018’s full year enrollments. We firmly believe that with our robust revenue growth and enhanced operating efficiency, we are on track to achieve our previously forecasted year-over-year revenue growth of around 30% in the full year of 2018.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by RMB59.8 million, or 28.4%, to RMB270.1 million (US$43.1 million) from RMB210.3 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of RMB47.5 million in revenues from educational programs.\nRevenues from educational programs for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 26.6% to RMB226.2 million (US$36.1 million), which was primarily due to an increase in the number of student enrollments at self-owned learning centers and online courses in the first quarter. The increase in the Company’s student enrollments was attributable to (i) a higher student retention rate of 71% in this quarter, which we believe was partially driven by the Company’s established brand and growing offerings of reputable products; and (ii) an increase in the number of self-owned learning centers from 54 as of March 31, 2017 to 64 as of March 31, 2018.\nFranchise revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 14.7% to RMB28.2 million (US$4.5 million), primarily due to (i) an increase in recurring franchise fees during the same period and (ii) a 30.4% increase in the number of franchised learning centers from 168 as of March 31, 2017 to 220 as of March 31, 2018. Franchise revenues have fully reflected the impact of the new revenue standard under ASC 606 which became effective on January 1, 2018.\nOther revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB15.7 million (US$2.5 million) compared with RMB7.0 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the revenue contribution from business assets acquired from The Edge Learning Centers Limited, or The Edge, in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a 56.2% year-over-year increase in revenues from Rise Overseas Study Tour.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by RMB29.2 million, or 30.3%, to RMB125.5 million (US$20.0 million), primarily due to increases in rental costs and personnel costs. Rental costs increased as the Company expanded its operations. The increase in personnel costs was primarily attributable to an increase of total teaching hours at the Company’s self-owned learning centers. Non-GAAP cost of revenues for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB125.0 million (US$19.9 million).\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased by RMB30.7 million, or 26.9%, to RMB144.7 million (US$23.1 million).

The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher principal of the Company’s loan from CTBC Bank Co. Ltd.(“CTBC”), which was expanded in September 2017.\nOther Income\nOther income for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB10.9 million (US$1.7 million), compared with RMB0.2 million in the same period of the prior year. The Company’s ADR depositary reimbursed the Company a total of RMB10.0 million in consideration.\nNet Income Attributable to RISE\nNet income attributable to RISE for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 26.7% to RMB35.8 million (US$5.7 million).

Basic and diluted non-GAAP net income attributable to RISE per ADS was RMB0.69 (US$0.11) and RMB0.67 (US$0.11), respectively, for the first quarter of 2018.\nFor details on the calculation of and reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures for each of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA, see “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB198.4 million (US$31.6 million), compared with RMB256.8 million in the same period of the prior year.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had combined cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment of RMB1,054.6 million (US$168.1 million), compared with RMB1,084.9 million as of December 31, 2017.The decrease of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash was mainly a result of i) loan repayment of RMB75.9 million (US$12.0 million) to CTBC in the first quarter of 2018, ii) entrustment loan of RMB150 million (US$23.9 million) granted to Lionbridge, iii) final payment of termination fee to Bain Advisors of RMB 20.0 million (US$3.2 million), and iv) final payment of RMB16.6 million (US$2.6 million)for the acquisition of The Edge.\nCurrent and non-current deferred revenue and customer advances was RMB1,070.1 million (US$170.6 million) as of March 31, 2018, representing an increase of 31.7% from RMB812.8 million as of December31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-paid tuition and fees from growing student enrollment, which was partially offset by recognized revenue as courses were delivered. Deferred revenue and customer advances mainly consisted of upfront tuition fee payments from students and initial franchise fees from the Company’s franchise partners.\nB usiness Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects its total revenues to be in the range of RMB292.5 million to RMB297.1 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 29% to 31%.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are set forth in table at the end of this earnings release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results,” which provides more details on the non-GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP cost of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses, including non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the share-based compensation that does not reflect the ordinary operating expenses of our operations.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP net income provide us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain transaction-related expenses that do not reflect the ordinary EBITDA and net income of our operations.\nWe use non-GAAP operating expenses, including non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS attributable to RISE to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because our management believes these provide a more comparable measure of our continuing business as it adjusts for transaction-related expenses that are not reflective of the normal earnings of our business.
