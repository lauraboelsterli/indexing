    "text": "FRISCO, Texas, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Addus HomeCare Corporation (NASDAQ: ADUS), a provider of comprehensive home care services, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet service revenues were $109.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, up 7.7% from $101.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income increased 14.1% to $4.9 million for the latest quarter from $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, while net income per diluted share increased 13.5% to $0.42 from $0.37. Adjusted net income per diluted share grew 23.5% to $0.42 for the first quarter of 2018 from $0.34 for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 excludes prompt payment interest income of $0.16 from the state of Illinois; M&A expenses of $0.07; restructuring charges of $0.02; severance and other costs of $0.01; and stock-based compensation expense of $0.06. For the first quarter of 2017, adjusted net income per diluted share excludes a gain on the sale of adult day service centers of $0.11; M&A expenses of $0.01; severance and other costs of $0.05; and stock-based compensation expense of $0.02. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.6% to $8.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $8.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 8.0% from 7.8%. (See page 7 for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures in this news release.)\nDirk Allison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Addus, commented, \"I am proud of our solid financial results for the first quarter of 2018. First-quarter revenues reflected continuing organic growth, with an increase in same-store revenue of 4.6%, within our target range of 3% to 5%. As a result of tax reform, we also benefited from a reduction in our income tax rate for the first quarter of 2018. Also, clearly evident in the first quarter was the acceleration of the impact of our acquisition strategy. Our financial results for the quarter included the impact of the Options Home Care acquisition in August last year. As we previously announced, we purchased the Arcadia Home Care & Staffing business on April 1 st and subsequently closed the Ambercare acquisition – announced February 28 th – on May 1 st . Ambercare and Arcadia produced combined 2017 revenue of over $100 million and are expected to be immediately accretive to earnings. Our first-quarter financial results and acquisition pipeline position Addus for continued growth during 2018.\"\nAs discussed in the Company's fourth-quarter conference call, Addus's adoption of ASU 2014-09, Accounting for Contracts with Customers, at the start of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach reduced the year over year comparability of net service revenue and expense items as a percentage of net service revenues, while not affecting net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share. The adoption of this revenue recognition standard resulted in a decrease of $2.0 million in our net services revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company's revenue growth was driven by relatively balanced increases of 4.0% in billable hours per business day and 3.6% in revenue per billable hour, compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash of $63.4 million and bank debt of $43.9 million, while availability under its revolving credit facility was $111.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $14.3 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nMr. Allison concluded, \"As our first-quarter results indicate, we are executing on our organic growth and acquisition strategies, and as a leading personal care company, we believe we are positioned to gain further market share in the future. The personal care industry remains strong given the growing recognition in healthcare of the value we provide by helping consumers with essential daily tasks that enable them to stay in their homes. We are confident we have the experience and resources to drive long-term growth in earnings and shareholder value.\"\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe information provided in this release includes adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net service revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company defines adjusted net income per diluted share as net income per diluted share, adjusted for interest income from the State of Illinois, M&A expenses, stock-based compensation expense, restructure charges, severance and other costs, and gain on sale of ADS. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, interest income, other non-operating income, taxes, depreciation, amortization, interest income from the State of Illinois, M&A expenses, stock-based compensation expense, restructure charges, severance and other costs, and gain on sale of ADS. The Company defines adjusted net service revenues as net service revenues adjusted for the closure of certain sites. The Company has provided, in the financial statement tables included in this press release, a reconciliation of adjusted net income per diluted share to net income per diluted share, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income and a reconciliation of adjusted net service revenues to net service revenues, in each case, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net service revenues are useful to investors, management and others in evaluating the Company's operating performance, to provide investors with insight and consistency in the Company's financial reporting and to present a basis for comparison of the Company's business operations among periods, and to facilitate comparison with the results of the Company's peers.\nConference Call\nAddus will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018, beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.
