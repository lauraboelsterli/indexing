FILE PHOTO: League party leader Matteo Salvini speaks to the media during the second day of consultations with Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy, April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo\nSpeaking to reporters in parliament, Salvini said the policy agenda the two parties have been working on for a week was “almost finished,” and he and 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio would meet with President Sergio Mattarella “even before Monday”.\nThe two pre-election adversaries began negotiating a coalition deal last week, more than two months after an inconclusive March 4 election produced a hung parliament.
