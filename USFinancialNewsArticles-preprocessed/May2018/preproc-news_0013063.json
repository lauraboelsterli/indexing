(NASDAQ: TXMD), an innovative women’s healthcare company, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter and Recent Developments\nEntered into a definitive loan agreement with MidCap Financial, managed by Apollo Capital Management, L.P., for $200 million in non-dilutive term loan financing. The term loan will be available to the company in three tranches following specific milestones through December 31, 2019: $75 million will be available upon the approval of TX-004HR, $75 million will be available upon the approval and launch of TX-001HR, and $50 million will be available upon certain sales milestones in calendar year 2019, in each case subject to certain terms and conditions. The term loan will accrue interest at 1-month LIBOR plus 7.75%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.50%. Interest on amounts borrowed under the term loan will be payable monthly in arrears; principal on each tranche borrowed under the term loan will be payable in 36 equal monthly installments beginning May 1, 2020, subject to the company’s ability to extend the interest-only period by an additional 12 months if the company generates certain revenues with respect to TX-004HR and TX-001HR. The maturity date is May 1, 2023. Entered into negotiations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the proposed label for TX-004HR, the company’s investigational applicator-free estradiol vaginal softgel capsule for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vaginal pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) due to menopause, in April 2018. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of the NDA is May 29, 2018. Submitted the NDA for TX-001HR, the company’s investigational bio-identical hormone therapy combination of estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause, on December 28, 2017. The FDA in its 74-day letter stated that the application was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and that, at such time, the FDA had not identified any potential review issues. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of the NDA is October 28, 2018. Net revenue for the company’s prescription prenatal vitamin business was approximately $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with approximately $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was approximately $24.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with approximately $21.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Ended the quarter with approximately $107.3 million in cash and no debt. Grew the company’s intellectual property portfolio to a current total of 216 patent filings, including 126 international filings, with one allowed and 19 issued U.S. patents.\n“Our company has tremendous opportunity in the coming year,” said TherapeuticsMD CEO Robert G. Finizio. “We have the potential for approvals of both of our late-stage product candidates in 2018, representing major inflection points for our company.”\nSummary of First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet revenue from the company’s prescription prenatal vitamin business was approximately $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with net revenue of approximately $4.0 million for the prior year’s quarter. These changes were primarily due to a decrease in the average net sales price of the company’s products, partially offset by an increase in the number of units sold.\nCost of goods sold was approximately $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with approximately $0.7 million for the prior year’s quarter.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 included research and development (R&D) expenses and sales, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A). R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were approximately $7.0 million compared with approximately $7.7 million for the prior year’s quarter. The decrease in R&D was a direct result of the completion of the Replenish Trial for TX-001HR. SG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were approximately $20.8 million compared with approximately $16.8 million for the prior year’s quarter, primarily due to higher sales, marketing, and personnel costs to support future commercialization.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $24.4 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, compared with approximately $21.2 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, cash on hand was approximately $107.3 million, compared with approximately $127.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nAdditional information regarding the company’s loan agreement with MidCap Financial is available in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Commission today. Cowen acted as lead arranger and financial advisor to TherapeuticsMD with respect to the MidCap Financial transaction and Oppenheimer & Co. acted as co-financial advisor in the transaction.\nConference Call Today\nAs previously announced, TherapeuticsMD will host a conference call today to discuss these financial results and provide a business update.
