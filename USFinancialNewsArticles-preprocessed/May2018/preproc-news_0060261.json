    "text": "Michael Kors forecast yearly earnings largely below Wall Street estimates, taking the shine off stronger-than-expected quarterly results and driving the handbag maker's shares down 7 percent on Wednesday.\nThe company known for its Mercer and Hamilton handbags expects earnings of between $4.65 and $4.75 per share in fiscal year 2019, pointing to a lower figure than analysts' average expectation of $4.74, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nKors, which bought luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo last July, also said on Wednesday it would explore more acquisitions to boost its luxury offerings.\nNet income attributable to Kors was $44.1 million or 29 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $26.8 million or 17 cents per share a year earlier.\nRevenue rose to $1.18 billion from $1.06 billion, exceeding analysts' average estimate of $1.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned 63 cents per share, topping analysts' estimates of 60 cents.\nShares of New York-based Michael Kors slid 6.8 percent to $63.60 in premarket trading.",
