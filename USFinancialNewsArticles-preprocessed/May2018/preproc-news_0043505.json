    "text": "18 COMMENTS New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio wants police to issue summonses instead of arresting people for smoking marijuana in public, a move the head of the police department’s sergeants union said would put officers “in positions of conflict.”\nMr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has expressed concerns about legalizing marijuana, but said he believes it is “likely to occur in our state in the near future.” The mayor said last week that the city would relax enforcement of marijuana offenses in order to end racial disparities in arrests .\nThe New York Daily News previously reported Mr. de Blasio’s new directive.\nOn Monday, Sgt. Ed Mullins of the Sergeants Benevolent Association said the mayor’s new approach would put police in a tough spot because marijuana is still illegal and officers receive complaints from the public about it.\n“You can’t just circumvent the law,” Mr. Mullins said. “If you want to not have enforcement of arrests, then you need to change the law.”\nThe New York City Police Department hasn’t opposed the mayor’s request, but some top police officials have previously said responding to marijuana complaints can sometimes lead to the arrests of violent criminals.\nNYPD Commissioner James O’Neill has formed a 30-day working group to review marijuana-enforcement policies and procedures. The mayor’s directive to issue summonses instead of making arrests for smoking in public is part of that review, a department spokesman said Monday.\nMr. de Blasio has said he is worried about a “corporatization” of the marijuana industry, where profit-driven companies aggressively market to young people. He is convening a task force charged with helping the city prepare for policing, zoning, public health and education issues related to legalized marijuana.\n“My focus now will be helping to craft the critical regulatory framework that must come before legalization is realized,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.\nThis isn’t the first time the mayor has sought to reduce racial disparities in marijuana enforcement. In 2014, Mr. de Blasio directed the police to avoid making arrests for marijuana possession in favor of issuing summonses, which result in a $100 fine and require the person to attend summons court.\nMarijuana-related arrests have fallen 32% over the past four years, but the department has still been criticized by city council members and others after data showed that 87% of those arrested for smoking in public last year were black or hispanic.\nMomentum has been growing for marijuana legalization in New York, with a Quinnipiac University poll released earlier this month showing state voters support the measure by a margin of 63% to 32%. Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, has called for legalizing marijuana as has New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, who is running for state attorney general .\nMr. Cuomo’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday.\nWrite to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com",
