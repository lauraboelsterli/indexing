    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CDTX), a biotechnology company developing novel anti-infectives including immunotherapies, today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on its corporate activities and product pipeline.\n“The first quarter of 2018 marked a significant step forward for Cidara. We reported positive topline results from our STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial, and continued outreach to the medical and scientific communities with important rezafungin data,” said Jeffrey Stein, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Cidara. “These data position us to advance rezafungin into Phase 3 pivotal trials in the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis and prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Subsequent Highlights\nReported positive topline results from STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial of rezafungin: In March 2018, the company reported positive topline results from the global, randomized Phase 2 STRIVE clinical trial of its lead antifungal candidate rezafungin acetate. STRIVE met all of its primary objectives, as once-weekly intravenous dosing of rezafungin was observed to be generally well tolerated and safe in patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis. The data also showed evidence of the efficacy of rezafungin, which was defined in the trial by clearance of Candida from the blood or other normally sterile sites, resolution of signs related to the infection, investigator assessment of clinical response and overall survival.\nNIH grant for Cloudbreak development: In May 2018, the company announced that it and Rutgers University had been awarded a $5.5 million partnership grant from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The grant will fund the continued research and development of Cidara’s innovative Cloudbreak™ antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) platform to identify novel immunotherapy agents for the treatment and prevention of serious and life-threatening multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections in high-risk patient populations.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $67.0 million as of March 31, 2018, compared with $75.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of April 30, 2018, Cidara had 21,391,057 common shares outstanding.\nResearch and development expenses were $13.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to clinical development activities for rezafungin.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related costs to support the growth of operating activities.\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $16.7 million, compared to a net loss of $13.4 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAbout Cidara Therapeutics\nCidara is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing new anti-infectives that have the potential to transform the standard of care and save or improve patients’ lives. The company is currently advancing its novel echinocandin antifungal, rezafungin acetate, formerly known as CD101 IV, through clinical trials. Rezafungin has improved pharmacokinetics compared to existing echinocandins and the potential for expanded utility across patient settings. It is the only once-weekly product candidate in development for the treatment and prevention of life-threatening invasive fungal infections. The company’s Phase 2 STRIVE clinical trial of rezafungin met its primary safety and efficacy objectives, and Cidara plans to initiate Phase 3 pivotal trials in the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis and the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Cidara also is leveraging its novel Cloudbreak™ platform to develop antibody-drug conjugates for the treatment of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. Cloudbreak is the first immunotherapy discovery platform designed specifically to create compounds that directly kill pathogens and also direct a patient’s immune cells to attack and eliminate bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens. Cidara is headquartered in San Diego, California.
