A predator could have tracked your childs cell phone to know when they were alone.\"\nResearcher Robert Xiao at Carnegie Mellon said a flaw in a demo tool from LocationSmart could have been used to track anyone.\nLocationSmart spokeswoman Brenda Schafer said Friday the vulnerability \"has been resolved and the demo has been disabled.\"\nPrior to Xiao's efforts that included locating up to two dozen users, Schafer said the company believes no one else exploited the vulnerability. The company is committed to \"continuous improvement of its information privacy and security measures,\" she said.\nLast week, the New York Times reported that the former sheriff of Mississippi County, Missouri used Securus Technologies to track mobile phones, including those of other officers, without court orders, citing charges filed against him. Several published reports suggested Securus is getting its data through an intermediary of LocationSmart.\nVerizon spokesman Rich Young said Friday the company has \"taken steps to ensure that Securus can no longer access location information about Verizon Wireless customers.\" He added the company has \"initiated a review of this entire issue.\"\nAT&T spokesman Mike Balmoris said the company does not \"permit sharing of location information without customer consent or a demand from law enforcement. If we learn that a vendor does not adhere to our policy we will take appropriate action.\"\nSprint, Securus and T-Mobile did not immediately comment.\nWyden said last week that Securus, a major provider of correctional-facility telephone services, is purchasing real-time location information from carriers and providing information \"via a self-service web portal for nothing more than the legal equivalent of a pinky promise.\"\nWyden wrote all four major mobile carriers, saying the practice \"exposes millions of Americans to potential abuse and unchecked surveillance by the government.\"\n(Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",
