That’s because it can take up to 15 years to develop a drug, much longer than to develop software.\nLife sciences funding comprises 32 percent of grants by the IIA, which has a budget of 1.7 billion shekels ($473 million).\nTel Aviv will host the international MIXiii Biomed conference next week.\n$1 = 3.5909 shekels Reporting by Steven Scheer; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
