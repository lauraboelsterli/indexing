The company remains the same legal entity, with no change in ownership or control.\n“Brand recognition is important, and by rebranding to Securian Asset Management, we expect to gain greater market awareness for our institutional asset management capabilities,” said David Kuplic, Securian Asset Management’s president.\n“Additionally, the timing of this change just makes sense. We are working more closely with Securian Financial than perhaps ever before, leveraging our collective expertise to build new, mutually beneficial capabilities in emerging growth opportunities like pension risk transfer. These new capabilities, along with our established areas of expertise, will serve as the base of our reinvigorated focus on external asset growth moving forward,” added Kuplic.\nA history of finding investment value\nAs of the end of March 2018, Securian Asset Management manages over $37 billion for institutional clients, including corporations, endowments and foundations, government entities and pension plan managers. It specializes in fixed income, managed volatility, real estate securities, alternative investments, dividend-paying investments and private credit—including privately placed bonds and commercial mortgage loans.\nSecurian Asset Management also manages mutual funds, retirement investments and variable insurance fund investments.\nABOUT SECURIAN FINANCIAL GROUP\nSince 1880, Securian Financial Group and its affiliates have provided financial security for individuals and businesses in the form of insurance, investments and retirement plans. Now one of the nation’s largest financial services providers, Securian is the holding company parent of a group of companies that offer a broad range of financial services.\nDOFU 05-2018\n481646\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501005339/en/\nSecurian Financial Group\nJeff Bakken, 651-665-7558\nMedia Relations\njeff.bakken@securian.com\nSource: Securian Financial Group, Inc.",
