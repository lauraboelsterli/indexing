(Reuters) - After finishing equal 11th at the Players Championship on Sunday, Tiger Woods declared himself ready to win another title.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\nFor the second day running, Woods plundered the first 12 holes at TPC Sawgrass, this time picking up six birdies.\nHe was unable to finish quite so strongly, finding water at the island-green 17th for a double-bogey.\nHe blamed a gust of wind, rather than a bad shot for that stumble, however.

Mandatory Credit: Adam Hagy-USA TODAY Sports\nHe also had good distance control with his irons and bounced back on the greens after putting woefully in Charlotte.\n“I didn’t play particularly well the first couple of days but I turned it around this weekend. Unfortunately just didn’t cash in,” he said after finishing seven strokes behind winner Webb Simpson.\n“If I would have had the game I had this weekend at the beginning of the week I would have given Webb a little bit of a run.”\nWoods will have only one more start, at the Memorial tournament in two weeks, to hone his game before the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills.\nHe has been in contention in the final round in four of his eight starts this year.\n“I’m not that far off from winning,” he said. “There’s no way at the beginning of the year that I would have predicted I would have been at this point.” Reporting by Andrew Both; editing by Ian Ransom",
