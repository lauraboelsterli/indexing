HT&E had offered to engage with oOh!media to more appropriately value Adshel, but this was declined.\n“Adshel’s Street Furniture business would provide an attractive complement to APO’s existing Out-of-Home product offering,” APN said in a statement.\nAPN on Monday confirmed media speculation regarding its bid to acquire Adshel, but had not disclosed details of the offer.\nAPN said it hasn’t reached an agreement for the proposed acquisition.\nShares of APN were down as much as 1.9 percent, while HT&E shares jumped 7 percent.
