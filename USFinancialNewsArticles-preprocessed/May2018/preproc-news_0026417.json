    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed in a telephone call on Thursday that the United States had been wrong to withdraw from a big-power nuclear deal with Iran, a Turkish presidential source said.\nThey also discussed escalating tensions in Syria, the source said.\nTrump said on Tuesday that the 2015 deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for measures restricting its nuclear program, did not go far enough in removing the threat posed by Iran to the United States and its allies in the Middle East.\nWriting by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ",
