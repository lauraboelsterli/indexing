(NYSE American: MYO) (“Myomo” or the “Company”), a wearable medical robotics company that offers increased functionality for those suffering from neurological disorders and upper limb paralysis, today reports its financial results for the first quarter\nRecent Highlights and Accomplishments:\nTotal revenue in the first quarter 2018 was $313,000, an increase of 45%, versus the comparable period of 2017. Product revenue of $309,000, increased 56% versus the comparable period of 2017. Increased field sales team by over 100%, and also increased marketing efforts, resulting in a growing number of patient cases in reimbursement claims processing. Continued to expand the number of MyoPro Centers of Excellence at Orthotics & Prosthetics (O&P) organizations. Myomo currently has 46 U.S. locations offering the MyoPro line of powered orthosis following 13 new locations added during the first quarter of 2018. Working with Ottobock, we have now fit the first patients in Germany and Canada. Received $3.6 million from the exercise of approximately 1.2 million warrants at an exercise price of $2.95 per share. Cash on hand increased during the quarter to $14.1 million.\nPaul R. Gudonis, Chairman & CEO of Myomo, stated: “Early in the year, with the growth capital raised in December 2017, we added resources to scale up operations, including new hires, establishing additional O&P partnerships and launching new marketing campaigns. With a growing number of patients and O&P providers interested in the product, we project to deliver MyoPro to an increasing number of users and continue to expect 2018 revenue growth to exceed reported year ago levels.”\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nThree months ended Period-to-period March 31, change 2018 2017 $ % Revenue $ 313,179 $ 216,231 $ 96,948 45 % Cost of revenue 108,080 78,569 29,511 38 % Gross margin $ 205,099 $ 137,662 $ 67,437 49 % Gross margin% 65 % 64 % 1 % First Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal revenue was $313,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018; an increase of $97,000, or 45%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.

The increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs.\nSelling, general and administrative costs of $2,236,000 increased $1,091,000, or 95%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period on 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs of $595,000, which includes $310,000 for additional sales and administrative staff; and $285,000 in share-based compensation expense. Other administrative cost increases include professional fees, rent, insurance, and office expenses of $268,000.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated interest income of $42,000, as compared to interest expense of $141,000 in the same period of 2017. We did not incur interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2018 due the payoff of our outstanding debt and our convertible promissory notes being converted into common stock upon the closing of our IPO on June 9, 2017.\nThe Company’s net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $2,345,000, compared with a net loss of $1,556,000 for the corresponding 2017 period due to the factors described above. Net loss available to common stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $2,345,000 or ($0.20) per share, compared with a net loss available to common stockholders of $1,745,000, or ($1.55) per share, for the corresponding year ago period.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was a loss of $2,052,000, compared with a loss of $1,341,000 for the corresponding 2017 period. A reconciliation of GAAP to this non-GAAP financial measure has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of this measure is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nCash on hand at March 31, 2018 was $14,116,000, compared to $12,959,000 at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash was primarily due to $3,550,000 of proceeds received for the exercise of warrants during the quarter. This was partially offset by cash used in operating and investing activities of $2,265,000 and $65,000, respectively.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nMyomo will hold a conference call today, May 9, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. EDT.
