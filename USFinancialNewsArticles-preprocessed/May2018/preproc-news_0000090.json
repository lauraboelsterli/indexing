    "text": "SEATTLE, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jones Soda Co. (the “Company”) (OTCQB:JSDA), a leader in the craft soda category and known for its innovative brand marketing, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary vs. Year-Ago Quarter\nRevenue was $2.8 million compared to $3.5 million, reflecting the de-listing of cans from a major retailer in 2017 and the relaunch of 7-Select in early 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.7% compared to 24.1%, driven by higher freight costs which the Company mitigated at the end of Q1 2018. Net loss was $469,000 or ($0.01) per share, compared to a net loss of $197,000 or ($0.00) per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $(0.4) million compared to $(0.1) million.\nManagement Commentary\n“As expected, first quarter sales were impacted by the final full quarter comparison to last year’s de-listing of our 12-ounce cans by a major retailer, as well as strong pipeline fill following our late 2016 glass bottles launch at 7-Eleven USA,” said Jennifer Cue, the Company’s president and CEO. “Masked in our consolidated sales results was continued strong performance in our important Fountain and Lemoncocco initiatives, which grew 123% and 15%, respectively, in the first quarter.\n“In fact, the continued success of these initiatives was an important driver of our recent financing, as they have broad demographic appeal and a higher margin structure. Turning our attention to 2018, we have already made great strides to bolster our New York City and New Jersey sales and distribution network under our head of sales, Steve Gress. As of April 2018, our Fountain account base doubled to 2,000 and we have added key new accounts for Lemoncocco in the second quarter. Given a product portfolio that is showing significant promise along with our new capital to fund growth, we expect 2018 to be a significant step forward for our company.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.8 million compared to $3.5 million in the same quarter a year ago. The decrease was primarily attributable to the de-listing of Jones cans by a major retailer in mid-2017, the difficult comparisons created by the significant load-in of Jones 7 Select glass bottles at 7-Eleven USA after launching in late 2016 into early 2017, and the timing of international orders in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.7% compared to 24.1% in the first quarter of 2017. The decline was driven by higher freight costs. However, Jones worked to mitigate some of the cost inflation at the end of the first quarter.\nNet loss was $469,000 or ($0.01) per share, compared to a net loss of $197,000 or ($0.00) per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $(0.4) million compared to $(0.1) million in the year-ago quarter. This decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned decline in revenue and gross margin.\nAt March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.0 million compared to $0.4 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting the $2.8 million financing the Company completed in March. Our line of credit balance at the end of the first quarter totaled $0.8 million compared to $0.9 million at December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nJones Soda will hold a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.\nDate: Thursday, May 3, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-800-289-0438\nInternational dial-in number: 1-323-794-2423\nConference ID: 4449032\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

The difference between Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) and Net Loss (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) is the exclusion of interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss in our Non-GAAP Reconciliation in this press release. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors about the Company's results attributable to operations, in particular by eliminating the impact of non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation, amortization and depreciation that is consistent with the manner in which we evaluate the Company's performance. These adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are made with the intent of providing a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results and provide supplemental information regarding our current ability to generate cash flow. This non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a replacement for, or superior to net loss as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or cash flow, as a measure of its liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with Net Loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Jones Soda Co.\nHeadquartered in Seattle, Washington, Jones Soda Co.® (OTCQB: JSDA) markets and distributes premium beverages under the Jones® Soda and Lemoncocco ® brands.
