    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tellurian Inc. (Tellurian) (NASDAQ: TELL) continued to build its global natural gas business during the first quarter of 2018. Notable Tellurian achievements:\nInitiated a process to raise $24 billion for Driftwood Holdings, which will own the Driftwood liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility, one or more pipelines, and natural gas production assets; engaged Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (Goldman Sachs) and SG Americas Securities, LLC (Société Générale) to serve as financial advisors. Conducted non-binding open seasons through its subsidiaries to secure prospective shippers on two newly proposed pipelines - Haynesville Global Access Pipeline (HGAP) and Permian Global Access Pipeline (PGAP). The pipelines are part of Tellurian’s previously announced proposed pipeline network, the development of which is expected to represent an approximately $7 billion investment in U.S. infrastructure and to create approximately 15,000 jobs in Texas and Louisiana. Generated approximately $6 million in revenue from LNG marketing, and approximately $1 million from natural gas sales. Received a $50 million investment from an affiliate of Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc.\nPresident and CEO Meg Gentle said, “There are more than 20 companies conducting detailed analysis in our data room for Driftwood Holdings and we expect to be able to identify our partners soon. We intend to begin construction of the Driftwood LNG terminal in 2019 and produce first LNG in 2023.”\nEstimated Driftwood project timeline Catalyst Estimated timeline Draft Environmental Impact Statement 1H 2018 Final Environmental Impact Statement 12 October 2018 FERC order and Federal Authorization Decision Deadline 10 January 2019 Driftwood final investment decision 1H 2019 Begin construction 1H 2019 Begin operations 2023 Financial results\nTellurian ended its first quarter of 2018 with approximately $112.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and remains debt free.
