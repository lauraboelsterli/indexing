This compares to investment income for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, which was $33.7 million and $65.6 million, respectively, and was attributable to $15.2 million and $28.3 million from first lien secured debt, $13.0 million and $25.6 million from second lien secured debt and $5.5 million and $11.7 million from subordinated debt, preferred and common equity, respectively. The decrease in investment income compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to a reduction of our portfolio at cost.\nExpenses\nNet expenses for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $13.8 million and $28.3 million, respectively. Base management fee for the same periods totaled $3.9 million and $8.7 million (after a base management fee waiver of $0.9 million), incentive fee totaled $2.8 million and $5.5 million (after an incentive fee waiver of $0.5 million), debt related interest and expenses totaled $5.9 million and $11.8 million and general and administrative expenses totaled $1.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively. This compares to net expenses for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, which totaled $17.5 million and $34.4 million, respectively. Base management fee for the same periods totaled $5.3 million (after a base management fee waiver of $1.0 million) and $10.6 million (after a base management fee waiver of $2.0 million), incentive fee totaled $3.1 million (after an incentive fee waiver of $0.6 million) and $5.9 million (after an incentive fee waiver of $1.1 million), debt related interest and expenses totaled $7.2 million and $13.9 million, general and administrative expenses totaled $1.5 million and $3.1 million and provision for taxes totaled $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The decrease in expenses compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to a reduction of our portfolio at cost, a decrease in debt related interest and expenses and base management fees.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income totaled $13.4 million and $27.6 million, or $0.19 and $0.39 per share, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively. Net investment income totaled $16.2 million and $31.2 million, or $0.23 and $0.44 per share, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease in net investment income per share compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to a reduction of our portfolio at cost.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nSales and repayments of investments for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $246.4 million and $438.7 million, respectively, and net realized gains totaled $21.8 million and $25.5 million, respectively. Sales and repayments of investments for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $202.0 million and $266.2 million, respectively, and net realized losses totaled $18.7 million and $40.9 million, respectively. The change in realized gains/losses was primarily due to changes in the market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized.\nUnrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments, Credit Facility and Notes\nFor the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, we reported net change in unrealized depreciation on investments of $29.5 million and $36.3 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, we reported net change in unrealized appreciation on investments of $20.2 million and $45.5 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, our net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $92.7 million and $56.4 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized depreciation on our investments was driven primarily by changes in the capital market conditions, the financial performance of certain portfolio companies and the reversal of unrealized appreciation/depreciation of investments that were realized.\nFor the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, our multi-currency, senior secured revolving credit facility, as amended and restated, or the Credit Facility and our 4.50% notes due 2019, or 2019 Notes had a net change in unrealized depreciation of $0.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, our Credit Facility, the 2019 Notes and our 6.25% notes due 2025 had a net change in unrealized appreciation of $6.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, our net unrealized appreciation on the Credit Facility and the 2019 Notes totaled $0.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized depreciation compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets.\nNet Change in Net Assets Resulting From Operations\nNet change in net assets resulting from operations totaled $6.0 million and $18.3 million, or $0.08 and $0.26 per share, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively. This compares to a net change in net assets resulting from operations of $11.5 million and $35.5 million, or $0.16 and $0.50 per share, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease in the net change in net assets from operations compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to a reduction of our portfolio and depreciation of our investments.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.\nThe annualized weighted average cost of debt for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment and amendment costs on the Credit Facility, amortized upfront fees on Small Business Administration, or SBA, debentures and debt issuance costs, was 4.58% and 4.38%, respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had $41.5 million and $79.4 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 2.88% and 2.42%, respectively, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments of 0.375%, as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had $403.5 million and $365.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, respectively, subject to the regulatory restrictions.\nAs of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes outstanding, with a fixed interest rate of 4.50% per year. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had $200.0 million and $199.0 million in SBA debentures outstanding, respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $170.2 million and $38.2 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $196.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, and our financing activities used cash of $64.2 million for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash from sales and repayments on our investments and our financing activities used cash primarily to pay distributions to stockholders and for net repayments under the Credit Facility.\nOur operating activities used cash of $18.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017, and our financing activities provided cash of $9.5 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily for net borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nSubsequent to quarter-end, we announced a share repurchase plan which allows us to repurchase up to $30.0 million of our outstanding common stock in the open market at prices below our net asset value as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The program will expire on May 8, 2019.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, we repaid $15.0 million of SBA debentures.\nDISTRIBUTIONS\nDuring the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, we declared distributions of $0.18 and $0.36 per share, respectively, for total distributions of $12.8 million and $25.6 million, respectively. For the same periods in the prior year, we declared distributions of $0.18 and $0.46 per share, respectively, for total distributions of $12.8 million and $32.7 million, respectively. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for taxation purposes may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of each calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe Company makes available on its website its report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and stockholders may find the report
