    "text": "NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Interest rates on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recorded seven-year highs even as Treasury yields have retreated from their multi-year peaks due to worries about U.S.-China trade tension and concerns about Italy and Turkey, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.\nThirty-year mortgage rates averaged 4.66 percent in the week ended May 24, which was the highest level since the week of May 5, 2011. A week earlier, 30-year rates averaged 4.61 percent, the U.S. mortgage finance agency said. (Reporting by Richard Leong)\n ",
