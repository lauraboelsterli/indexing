David Ige mobilized the state’s U.S. National Guard and declared a state of emergency.\nThe roughly 1,700 residents of the Leilani Estates subdivision, located on the East side of the island of Hawaii, were placed under mandatory evacuation as lava flowed onto the subdivision’s streets, threatening about 770 buildings, Ige said on Twitter. Gov. Ige signs emergency proclamation for Hawaii County https://t.co/mBfDRkHmo6 #HNN — Hawaii News Now (@HawaiiNewsNow) May 4, 2018\n“The danger is of such magnitude that it warrants pre-emptive and protective action in order to provide for the safety, health and welfare of the residents of Leilani Estates and surrounding areas,” Ige said.\nAnother subdivision, Lanipuna Gardens, was also placed under mandatory evacuation orders, according to Hawaii County.
