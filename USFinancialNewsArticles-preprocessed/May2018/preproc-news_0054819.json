    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder rights law firm Johnson Fistel, LLP has launched an investigation into whether the board members of LaSalle Hotel Properties (\"LaSalle\") (NYSE: LHO) breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed sale of the Company to Blackstone Group LP (\"Blackstone\").\nOn May 21, 2018, LaSalle announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement with Blackstone. Under terms of the deal, Blackstone will pay $33.50 in cash for each LaSalle share outstanding.\nThe investigation concerns whether the LaSalle board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the board obtained the best price possible for LaSalle shares of common stock.\nIf you are a shareholder of LaSalle and believe the proposed buyout price is too low or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471 .
