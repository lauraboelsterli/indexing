    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in major French companies with business ties to Iran, including carmaker PSA ( PEUP.PA ) and plane manufacturer Airbus ( AIR.PA ), fell on Wednesday after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a nuclear deal with Iran.\nFILE PHOTO: Logo of Airbus is pictured at the Airbus A380 final assembly line at Airbus headquarters in Blagnac, near Toulouse, France, March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau PSA shares were down 1.5 percent in early session trading, while rival carmaker Renault ( RENA.PA ), which also has business in Iran, declined by 0.3 percent.\nAirbus fell 1.1 percent, although shares in oil group Total ( TOTF.PA ) - which also does business in Iran - rose 0.7 percent as oil prices rose following Trumpâ€™s announcement.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Bate Felix\n ",
