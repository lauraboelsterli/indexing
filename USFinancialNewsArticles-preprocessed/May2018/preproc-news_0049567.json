    "text": "COLOMBO, May 23 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares slipped to a more than one-week closing low on Wednesday, dragged by industrials such as market heavyweight John Keells Holdings .\nTurnover slumped to a more than one-month low with investors staying on the sidelines as they waited for some cues about the real impacts of floods, while worries over a weaker rupee, political uncertainty and recent fuel price hike also weighed on sentiment.\nThe Colombo stock index ended 0.1 percent weaker at 6,465.48, its lowest close since May 15.\nTurnover was 250 million rupees ($1.58 million), the lowest since April 18, and around a quarter of this year’s daily average of 983.1 million rupees.\n“It was a dull market as local investors are still trying to digest the impact of fuel price hike,” said Hussain Gani, deputy CEO at Softlogic Stockbrokers.\n“We expect the market to bounce back next week when investors see some directions.”\nHeavy monsoon rains have killed ten people, prompting authorities to warn against landslides and floods in low-lying areas after spill gates had to be opened across the Indian Ocean island.\nForeign investors net sold 23.5 million rupees worth shares, extending the year-to-date foreign outflow to 597 million rupees.\nTop conglomerate John Keells Holdings fell 0.63 percent, while large cap Nestle Lanka Plc declined 2.8 percent.\nStock brokers said investors were waiting for more clarity on the political and economic front amid recent fuel price hike, while the depreciation in rupee also weighed on sentiment.\nThe rupee hit a fresh low of 158.50 per dollar on Wednesday on importer demand for the U.S. currency.\nAnalysts said concerns over political instability following President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to suspend the parliament last month after 16 legislators from his ruling coalition defected, dented market sentiment.\nOn May 8, Sirisena urged his own coalition government and the opposition to end a power struggle to achieve ambitious goals including anti-corruption measures.
