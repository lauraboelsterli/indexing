FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Sevilla vs Real Madrid - Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, Seville, Spain - May 9, 2018 Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos scores their second goal from the penalty spot REUTERS/Jon Nazca\nRamos, 32, announced debut rap composition ‘SR4’ little more than a week ahead of Real’s Champions League final against Liverpool in Kiev.\nRevealing the news on his Instagram page, Ramos indicated that there would be more to come from Sergio the singer: “My house, some friends, plenty of magic and this is the result. My life in a song... and lots of verses still to write.”\nFootballers have a long history of trying their hand on the music scene. Former Barcelona star Ronaldinho, American international Clint Dempsey, Brazil international Neymar and former Real midfielder Royston Drenthe all attempted a foray into music and released singles over the past few years.\nThe England national football team have previously had chart success with ‘Back Home’ reaching number one in 1970 and ‘World in Motion’ also topping the charts ahead of the 1990 World Cup.\nIn Spain success has been more mixed, with Paris St Germain forward Jese Rodriguez, who spent last season on loan at Stoke City, part of a Reggaeton music group called Big Flow.\nIt remains to be seen whether or not Ramos will hit the right notes.
