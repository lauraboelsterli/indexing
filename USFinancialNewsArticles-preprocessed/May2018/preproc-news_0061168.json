    "text": "Trump: 'I wish I did' pick someone other than Jeff Sessions to be attorney general 3 Hours Ago President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that he wishes he had picked someone other than Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Once friendly with the attorney general, Trump has targeted much of his wrath over the Russia probe at the former Alabama senator after Sessions recused himself last year.
