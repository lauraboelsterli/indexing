    "text": "May 23 (Reuters) - A court in Aruba on Wednesday lifted the seizures of two oil cargoes that ConocoPhillips sought as part of a move to satisfy a $2 billion arbitration award over the nationalization of its projects in Venezuela, according to a source familiar with the decision.\nAruba’s Court of the First Instance said the owner of a crude cargo and a fuel cargo off Aruba was not Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA but its U.S. subsidiary Citgo Petroleum.
