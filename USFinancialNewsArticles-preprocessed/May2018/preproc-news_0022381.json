    "text": "OSLO, May 8 (Reuters) - Budget carrier Norwegian Air remains confident of its business model, its CEO told shareholders on Tuesday, less than a week after the company said it had rejected two takeover proposals from British Airways-owner IAG.\nLondon-listed IAG last month took a 4.6-percent stake in the airline, which in turn triggered interest from other suitors, according to earlier statements from Norwegian’s board.\n“Acquisition interest from several parties confirms the sustainability of the business model,” Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos told the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting.
