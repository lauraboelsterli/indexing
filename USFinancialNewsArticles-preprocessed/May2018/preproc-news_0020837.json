    "text": "Production at High End of Guidance\nStrong Performance from 6 Well Pad in Fasken\nAccelerates Value with AWP Olmos Divestiture and Recent Rig Addition\nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SilverBow Resources, Inc. (NYSE: SBOW) (“SilverBow” or the “Company”) today announced operating and financial results for the first quarter 2018. Highlights include:\nNet production averaged approximately 161 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day (“Mmcfe/d”), coming in at the high end of guidance Oil and gas revenues of $52.8 million Lease operating expenses of $0.34/Mcfe which includes two months of higher cost AWP Olmos wells that have since been divested Cash general and administrative expenses of $4.2 million (a non-GAAP measure calculated as $5.6 million in net general and administrative costs less $1.4 million of share based compensation), or $0.29/Mcfe, which is better than guidance Net Income of $8.5 million or $0.72 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) of $36.1 million Completed six well pad in Fasken (three Lower Eagle Ford and three Upper Eagle Ford) during the first quarter, the largest pad developed by the Company to date. This six well pad averaged nearly 65 Mmcfe/d for first 30 days of production with an all-in development cost of approximately $30 million Borrowing base reaffirmed at $330 million following the Company’s semi-annual Spring 2018 redetermination. The interest margin on the facility was reduced 50 basis points Maintained strong balance sheet with $274 million of liquidity Asset retirement obligations reduced to $4.7 million, a decrease of 57% compared to year-end 2017 levels Currently drilling second six well pad in Fasken with new high specification rig which commenced operations March 1, 2018 Reiterating full year 2018 capital expenditure guidance of $245 to $265 million and full year 2018 production guidance of 175 to 195 Mmcfe/d\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTS\nSean Woolverton, SilverBow’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The first quarter was a strong start to the year for the Company. Our operational and financial performance continues to demonstrate our ability to consistently execute, control our costs, and capitalize on opportunities that strengthen our competitive position. We are advancing the development of our Eagle Ford assets as we enhance well productivity and increase the scale of our operations with the addition of a second rig. Additionally, we continue to complement our development program with active portfolio management. Our recent non-core divestitures reduced operational complexity from the portfolio and provide improved cost efficiencies.”\nWoolverton commented further, “Our 2018 plan is to drive value creation throughout our portfolio, with an acute focus on continued strategic delineation and appraisal in our Southern Eagle Ford gas assets. As we look out further into the year, we are expecting to see a production ramp that corresponds to our back-end loaded capital budget. We believe we are well-positioned to navigate this dynamic operating environment and generate margin expansion through a capital program focused on full cycle returns and a leading cost structure. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well-funded to execute our capital investment plan for 2018.”\nOPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company spud ten gross (eight net) wells while completing six gross (four net) wells. The Company completed a six well pad in Fasken in the quarter which included three Upper Eagle Ford wells and three Lower Eagle Ford wells. The Company drilled a two well pad in Oro Grande in the first quarter, with both wells being brought online in late April 2018. While it is early in the life for both wells, performance thus far is in line with expectations. For the full year, the Company remains on track to drill 32 and complete 26 net wells with the majority of the completions occurring in the second half of the year given the nature of pad drilling and the ramp up time associated with the second rig. The Company plans on drilling in all areas of its portfolio again in 2018 with a continued focus on demonstrating the commercial viability of the Company’s extensive drilling inventory.\nThe Company plans on operating two rigs for the remainder of the year with a focus on incorporating larger pad development concepts into the capital program and driving steady improvement in well productivity and costs. Specifically, the Company is currently drilling another six well pad in Fasken using the recently added high specification rig with the expectation that these wells will be brought to sales in the third quarter. This rig will continue to focus on the shallower areas of the portfolio in Fasken and Artesia while the other rig focuses on the Southern Eagle Ford gas assets in LaSalle, McMullen and Live Oak Counties. The Company maintains considerable flexibility to modify the drilling program based on well results, commodity prices, or other strategic opportunities.\nThe Company continues to evaluate completion designs across its asset base assessing stage lengths, clusters per stage, fluid volumes and proppant concentrations. The Company is integrating new concepts to improve asset performance, increase capital efficiency, and reduce operating costs. Further, the addition of the second rig provided for more flexible time slot dedications with frac providers which will greatly enhance the Company’s ability to control the quality and timing of completion operations.\nPRODUCTION VOLUMES, OPERATING COSTS, AND REALIZED PRICES\nSilverBow’s total net production for the first quarter averaged approximately 161 Mmcfe/d which was at the high end of guidance. After giving effect to the AWP Olmos sale, production for the quarter was 154 Mmcfe/d. Production mix for the quarter consisted of approximately 82% natural gas, 11% NGLs, and 7% oil.\nLease operating expenses during the first quarter of $0.34/Mcfe came in better than the Company’s guidance range primarily driven by continued cost reduction initiatives. Lease operating expenses for the quarter included two months of higher cost AWP Olmos wells which the Company sold on March 1, 2018 for $27.0 million in cash. For the second quarter, the Company is guiding for lease operating expenses of $0.30 to $0.32/Mcfe.\nGeneral and administrative costs of $0.39/Mcfe were lower than the $0.45/Mcfe reported in the fourth quarter. After deducting $1.4 million of non-cash compensation expense, cash general and administrative costs were $4.2 million which compared favorably to guidance due to ongoing efforts to streamline the workforce and reduce associated administrative costs.\nTransportation and processing expenses came in at $0.35/Mcfe while production and ad valorem taxes were 5.7% of oil and gas revenues for the quarter. Production and ad valorem taxes were higher compared to fourth quarter levels primarily due to an increase in the Company’s estimates for 2018 ad valorem taxes. The Company’s ad valorem taxes are based on the value of developed reserves, which increased significantly during 2017.\nThe Company’s average realized natural gas price, excluding the effect of hedging, was $3.00/Mcf compared to $2.88/Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2017. The average realized crude oil selling price, excluding the effect of hedging, was $64.59/Bbl in the quarter, up from $57.64/Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2017. The average realized NGL selling price in the quarter was $22.39/Bbl versus $24.37/Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe Company reported total oil and gas revenues of $52.8 million for the first quarter 2018. On a GAAP basis, the Company reported net income of $8.5 million for the quarter, which includes a loss on the value of the Company's hedge portfolio of $6.4 million.\nThe Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see the tables included with today's news release for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nCapital expenditures incurred during the quarter totaled approximately $45 million.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nThe Company reiterated its 2018 capital expenditure budget of $245 to $265 million, which provides for average full year production of 175 to 195 Mmcfe/d. For the second quarter 2018, the Company is guiding for 158 to 164 Mmcfe/d. The Company spent less than 18% of its full year capital budget in the first quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to increase in the second quarter to reflect a full quarter of drilling activity associated with two rigs and increased completions. However, several completions in the quarter will not turn to sales until the third quarter given the timing and nature of pad-drilling. As such, production growth is expected to be back-end weighted. Additional detail concerning the Company's second quarter 2018 and full year financial and operational guidance can be found in the table included with today’s news release and the Corporate Presentation uploaded to the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website before the conference call.\nHEDGING UPDATE\nHedging continues to be an important element of SilverBow’s strategy. The Company maintains an active hedging program to provide predictable cash flows while still allowing for flexibility in capturing increases in prices. SilverBow has approximately 65% of total production volumes hedged for full year 2018 using the mid-point of production guidance. The Company continues to layer on additional hedges when prices are favorable. Please see the Company’s Form 10-Q filing, which the Company expects to be filed on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, for a detailed summary of derivative contracts.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY\nThe Company had liquidity of $274 million as of March 31, 2018, primarily consisting of availability on the Company’s $330 million bank credit facility. The Company recently completed its semi-annual Spring 2018 redetermination and the borrowing base under the facility was reaffirmed at $330 million. Additionally, the interest rate on the facility was reduced 50 basis points.\nAs of May 1, 2018, the Company had 11.7 million total common shares outstanding.\nCONFERENCE CALL & UPDATED INVESTOR PRESENTATION\nSilverBow will host a conference call for investors on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).
