We were also able to add nine aircraft to our industry leading fleet and eight planes for future delivery. Global passenger growth remains strong, as do our financial metrics and forward lease placements,” said John L. Plueger, Chief Executive Officer and President.\n“The airline industry continues to perform well, with IATA forecasting another year of global industry profits in excess of $30 billion. Supply chain delays and engine technical issues continue to have a short term impact on new aircraft deliveries. As such, we continue to source aircraft opportunistically,” said Steven F. Udvar-Házy, Executive Chairman of the Board.\nThe following table summarizes the results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change Revenues $ 381,209 $ 360,187 $ 21,022 5.8 % Income before taxes $ 141,319 $ 133,878 $ 7,441 5.6 % Net income $ 110,651 $ 84,937 $ 25,714 30.3 % Adjusted net income before income taxes (1) $ 152,773 $ 146,643 $ 6,130 4.2 % Diluted EPS $ 1.00 $ 0.78 $ 0.22 28.2 % Adjusted diluted EPS before income taxes (1) $ 1.38 $ 1.33 $ 0.05 3.8 % (1) Adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes have been adjusted to exclude the effects of certain non-cash items, one-time or non-recurring items, that are not expected to continue in the future and certain other items.

Adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted margin before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax return on equity and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes, are presented as supplemental disclosure because management believes they provide useful information on our earnings from ongoing operations.\nManagement and our board of directors use adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted margin before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax return on equity and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance. Management believes these measures are helpful in evaluating the operating performance of our ongoing operations and identifying trends in our performance, because they remove the effects of certain non-cash items, one-time or non-recurring items that are not expected to continue in the future and certain other items from our operating results. Adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted margin before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax return on equity and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes, however, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results or cash flows as reported under GAAP. Adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted margin before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax return on equity and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes do not reflect our cash expenditures or changes in our cash requirements for our working capital needs. In addition, our calculation of adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted margin before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax return on equity and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes may differ from the adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted margin before income taxes, adjusted pre-tax return on equity and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes or analogous calculations of other companies in our industry, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThe following tables show the reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income before
