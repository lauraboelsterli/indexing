    "text": "May 21, 2018 / 2:45 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Rejuvenated Spain ready to thrill the world again Richard Martin 3 Min Read\nMADRID (Reuters) - With a potent mix of hungry youngsters and seasoned veterans who have already triumphed at international tournaments, Spain boast all the ingredients to re-establish themselves as the best team in the world in Russia and reclaim the crown they won in 2010. FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Spain Training - Wanda Metropolitano, Madrid, Spain - March 26, 2018 Spain coach Julen Lopetegui during training REUTERS/Juan Medina\nSpain were seemingly invincible for four years with three successive tournament wins playing mouth-watering football, but since winning Euro 2012 they have flopped in their last two tournaments under coach Vicente del Bosque.\nHis successor Julen Lopetegui, a stalwart of the national teams youth programme, has helped to re-ignite their attacking verve and restored the belief they can conquer the world again.\nSpain tore their way through their World Cup qualifying group, winning nine out of 10 games while scoring 36 times and outclassing nearest challengers Italy 3-0.\nIn their last friendly outing, they blew away 2014 World Cup finalists Argentina with a stunning 6-1 win.\nWeaknesses are hard to find in Spain’s squad, which is packed with players from La Liga heavyweights Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid and outstanding Premier League performers such as Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea and Manchester City playmaker David Silva.

European champions Portugal are first up in Group B — a match which is likely to decide who will finish top. They also face Iran and Morocco.\nIf Lopetegui’s side win the group they are likely to face either Uruguay or Egypt in the last 16, with a possible mouthwatering quarter-final against Argentina, Croatia or France coming next.
