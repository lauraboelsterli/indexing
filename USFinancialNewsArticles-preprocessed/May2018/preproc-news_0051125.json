    "text": "By Ellen McGirt Updated: May 24, 2018 3:24 PM ET\nYesterday, the NFL issued a new policy requiring all players on the field to stand during the national anthem or risk league-issued fines.\nFor supporters of the protests, the optics are tough. It’s a rule made by a mostly-white management to police the expression of a mostly-black workforce, on issues of vital importance to many of the player’s fans and communities.\nIt also politicizes the national anthem over a spectacle that has little to do with patriotic values.\nAnd it looks like capitulation to a petulant President who is using his bully pulpit to harangue private citizens and jeopardize their livelihoods, while distracting his viewers from the bigger issues facing the country and his administration.\nSports and entertainment are two of the only areas where black talent has consistently earned a platform big enough to raise social issues, so the silencing feels familiar. “Taking a knee” clearly had legs.\nAnd by talking about the anthem, we’re not talking about other things like criminal justice reform, underinvestment in communities of color, or how pro-football is a gig that comes with a 100% injury rate and the potential of devastating permanent harm, like CTE. What if the NFL were regulated by OSHA? asks Deadspin .\nOh, and Colin Kaepernick still doesn’t have a job.\nAllies will emerge, like Jets chairman Christopher Johnson who plans to absorb any fines incurred for anthem-related player protests. And I expect that the athletes themselves will find creative ways to make their feelings known about the policy and the larger issues the protests hoped to highlight.\nAt times of great division and disappointment, people like to invoke Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and his belief in the long arc of a moral universe that bends toward justice.\nBut along the way, it also bends toward power.\nConsider Rose Robinson, a black high-jumper from Chicago, who is believed to be the first athlete to refuse to stand for the U.S. national anthem, at the Pan Am Games in 1959.\nThe one-time Olympic hopeful also refused to go on State Department-sponsored goodwill trips – which she called their “propaganda machine” – and turned to the black press to share her grievances about life in a segregated country.\nI stumbled on Robinson’s story in an interview with Amira Rose Davis , an assistant professor of history at Penn State and co-host of the feminist sports podcast, Burn it All Down . She joined The Nation’s Dave Zirin in a fascinating conversation about her research and her forthcoming book, Can’t Eat A Medal: The Lives and Labors of Black Women Athletes in the Age of Jim Crow .\nLike Kaepernick, Robinson was shut out of her sport. Her advocacy for civil rights landed her in jail, on a trumped-up charge of tax evasion involving $380. It led to a very public hunger strike that turned her into a minor cause celebre among a small number of supporters.\nAnd then she was forgotten.\nBut I cautiously predict that Kaepernick and the other players won’t be. The arc of the sports universe has always bent toward power – now, no longer just derived from traditional authority, but from social movements , consumers , and celebrity “brands” who can survive the sanctions of the day to stay in the spotlight.\nI wonder what the Rose Robinsons of history could have done with a social media megaphone, and how different the world would be now if they’d been able to get traction. Best we can do is remember her name and have faith that the long arc of a new power gets us somewhere near justice for all, sooner rather than later. On Point TheSkimm closes a $12 million Series C with Shonda Rhimes and Tyra Banks in the mix The women-led media company and e-mail newsletter powerhouse confirmed its Series C investment round which included previous investors, Google Ventures and Spanx founder Sara Blakely, along with some important new names. Among them: Shonda Rhimes; Tyra Banks; Willow Bay, a former journalist and now dean at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism; Jesse Draper, founding partner of Halogen Ventures; Linnea Roberts, founder and CEO of GingerBread Capital; and Hope Taitz, CEO of ELY Capital. “We wanted to use this moment in time to curate a really impressive group of female investors, to make sure we had a larger female presence on TheSkimm’s investor syndicate,” said co-founder Danielle Weisberg. The round brings their total financing to $29 million. TechCrunch The Most Reverend Curry is having a moment, y’all I don’t get to gloat much on this beat but I will say this: I told you this would happen. Rev. Curry became the breakout star of the recent royal wedding, when he invited the world to view the world through a black preacher’s eyes. He even went long and off script, on cue. But as this breezy recap from Vanity Fair makes clear, he’s parlaying the moment into a “tidy media tour,” sharing his message of love and reconciliation. He was even parodied on SNL, a sure sign that he’s arrived. You can follow him on Instagram , too. Vanity Fair Native American student-athletes have been expelled from their lacrosse league for reporting racial epithets and abuse It’s a complicated story, made more so by the ugly fact that the sport has been played by indigenous people long before Europeans showed up; and uglier still, since it took the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1973 to reverse a provision that banned young athletes from playing their own sport. But three majority-Native youth teams, with players aged 11-18, have been booted from the only league in the Dakotas for no discernable reason other than they reported serious racial abuse directed at them from other players, their parents, and referees. At first blush, this sounds like a straightforward story, but a local investigation, now amplified by Deadspin, reveals an ugly pattern of unchecked racism embedded in the culture. “You’re going to experience racism, you’re going to get called prairie nigger,” explains one coach. Deadspin Boots Riley is here to make your summer more bonkers “It’s an absurdist dark comedy with magical realism and science fiction, inspired by the world of telemarketing. It’s called ‘Sorry to Bother You.’ ” This is the “level one” pitch that community organizer, activist and anti-capitalist hip-hop artist Boots Riley used to get people interested in his film project. I’ll cut to the chase: After many levels and many pitches, the film goes out to wide release in July. Along the way, luminaries like Patton Oswalt, Dave Eggers, Jordan Peele, Donald Glover, Kathryn Bigelow and Lakeith Stanfield all responded, in some form, to some aspect of his pitch. Either way, Boots Riley is poised to become a name to finally remember – his film was a hit at this year’s Sundance Film Festival – Vice called it the “most bonkers movie,” Vanity Fair called it “a bonkers social satire”; Slate called it a “feverish, bonkers satire.” So, bonkers.",
