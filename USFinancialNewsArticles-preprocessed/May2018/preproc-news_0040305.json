    "text": "NEW DELHI, May 15 (Reuters) - Indiaâ€™s trade deficit slightly widened to $13.72 billion in April from $13.25 billion a year ago, government data showed on Tuesday.\nMerchandise exports for April rose 5.2 percent from a year ago to $25.9 billion.\nGoods imports last month were $39.6 billion, a gain of 4.6 percent from a year ago, data from the commerce and industry ministry showed.\nThe trade deficit for 2017/18 fiscal year ending in March grew to $156.8 billion from $105.72 billion in the previous year, mainly driven by a rising oil import bill - a growing concern for the central bank.
