    "text": "Net Sales Increase Driven by Growth in Food Distribution and Military Segments of 3.7% and 3.2%, Respectively\nReported First Quarter EPS from Continuing Operations of $0.34 per Diluted Share; Adjusted First Quarter EPS from Continuing Operations of $0.55 per Diluted Share\nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SpartanNash Company (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SPTN) today reported financial results for the 16-week first quarter ended April 21, 2018.\nConsolidated net sales for the first quarter increased $31.4 million, or 1.3%, to $2.39 billion from $2.35 billion in the prior year quarter (1) . The increase in net sales was driven by continued sales growth in the food distribution and military segments of 3.7% and 3.2%, respectively, partially offset by lower sales at retail.\n“We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter and continued resilience in a challenging and evolving landscape,” said David Staples, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Once again, we delivered on our financial and strategic objectives and remain on track to achieve our guidance for the year. Sales were driven by strong growth in the food distribution and military segments as we benefited from our key initiatives to drive sales with both new and existing customers. At retail, we also continue to implement a number of innovative concepts, which contributed to a sequential improvement in comparable store sales this quarter. Early in the first quarter, we cycled the acquisition of Caito (Caito Foods Service) and BRT (Blue Ribbon Transport), and are pleased to report that with the management team and systems now in place at Caito, we are experiencing improved trends in both productivity and profitability.”\nGross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $343.2 million, or 14.4% of net sales, compared to $357.4 million, or 15.2% of net sales, in the prior year quarter. The lower gross profit was due a change in the timing of certain supplier programs, a shift in sales mix to the food distribution and military segments, and margin investments within certain retail segment categories.\nReported operating expenses for the first quarter were $317.5 million, or 13.3% of net sales, compared to $327.8 million, or 13.9% of net sales, in the prior year quarter. The decrease in expenses as a rate to sales compared to the prior year quarter was primarily attributable to the mix of business operations, lower healthcare and incentive compensation costs, and reduced merger/acquisition and integration expenses. The decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by higher restructuring costs associated with the Company’s retail store rationalization plans and increased transportation costs within the food distribution and military segments, characteristic of the industry as a whole. First quarter operating expenses would have been $308.8 million, or 12.9% of net sales, compared to $318.9 million, or 13.5% of net sales, in the prior year quarter, if adjustments primarily related to restructuring, merger/acquisition and integration, and Caito Fresh Kitchen start-up costs were excluded from both periods. The Caito Fresh Kitchen operations were no longer treated as start-up after the second period of fiscal 2018.\nThe Company reported operating earnings of $25.7 million compared to $29.6 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to restructuring and asset impairment charges, the margin impacts noted previously, as well as higher transportation costs compared to the prior year, partially offset by the lower operating expenses outlined above. Non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings (2) were $35.8 million compared to $38.5 million in the prior year quarter due to the factors mentioned previously. Please see the financial tables at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA (3) was $67.2 million compared to $70.2 million in the prior year quarter due to the factors mentioned above.\nThe Company reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $12.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $15.1 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. The decrease reflects the previously mentioned factors as well as higher interest expense associated with the Company’s borrowings, partially offset by lower income tax expense resulting from significant changes to U.S. federal tax law. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations (4) for the first quarter were $20.0 million compared to $20.7 million in the prior year quarter, representing $0.55 per diluted share in both periods. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations exclude net after-tax charges of $0.21 per diluted share in the current year and $0.15 per diluted share in the prior year quarter primarily related to restructuring, merger/acquisition and integration, and Caito Fresh Kitchen start-up costs in both periods and a retirement stock compensation award in the prior year quarter.\nFood Distribution Segment\nNet sales for the food distribution segment increased $41.1 million, or 3.7%, to $1.16 billion from $1.11 billion in the prior year quarter, primarily due to sales growth from existing customers.\nReported operating earnings for the food distribution segment were $24.5 million compared to $25.3 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in reported operating earnings was primarily attributable to the shift in timing of supplier programs and higher transportation costs, partially offset by lower merger/acquisition and integration expenses, improvement in Caito operations and lower incentive compensation. First quarter adjusted operating earnings (5) were $29.5 million compared to $33.1 million in the prior year quarter and decreased for the factors noted previously. First quarter adjusted operating earnings in the current year exclude $5.0 million of pre-tax charges primarily related to merger/acquisition and integration, Fresh Kitchen start-up activities and an asset impairment charge related to certain discontinued warehouse equipment in connection with ongoing efficiency initiatives. Adjusted operating earnings in the prior year quarter exclude $7.8 million of pre-tax charges primarily related to similar activities.\nMilitary Segment\nNet sales for the military segment increased $20.3 million, or 3.2%, to $663.6 million from $643.3 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to new commissary business in the Southwest and incremental volume from the private brand program, partially offset by lower comparable sales at Defense Commissary Agency (“DeCA”) operated locations.\nReported operating earnings for the military segment increased to $1.5 million from $0.9 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to margin improvements and lower healthcare costs, partially offset by higher transportation expenses. First quarter adjusted operating earnings (5) increased to $1.6 million from $1.0 million in the prior year quarter.\nRetail Segment\nNet sales for the retail segment were $566.2 million in the first quarter compared to $596.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to $21.3 million in lower sales resulting from the closure and sale of retail stores, as well as a 2.2% decrease in comparable store sales, which exclude fuel. These decreases were partially offset by higher fuel prices compared to the prior year quarter.\nThe Company reported an operating loss of $0.3 million for the retail segment compared to reported operating earnings of $3.4 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in reported operating earnings was primarily attributable to lower comparable store sales, investments in margin and higher restructuring charges in connection with store closures compared to the prior year quarter. These amounts were partially offset by lower healthcare costs and the closure of underperforming stores. Adjusted operating earnings (5) increased to $4.7 million from $4.4 million in the prior year quarter due to the factors mentioned previously. First quarter adjusted operating earnings (5) in the current and prior year exclude $5.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of pre-tax charges primarily associated with restructuring activities.\nDuring the first quarter, as part of its retail store rationalization plan, the Company closed three retail stores, ending the quarter with 142 corporate owned retail stores compared to 153 stores in the prior year quarter.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nCash flow provided by operating activities for the first quarter was $60.4 million, compared to $10.3 million used in operating activities in the prior year quarter. The change was primarily due to the timing of working capital requirements, particularly changes in accounts receivable and inventory, compared to the prior year quarter.\nAs previously announced, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the regular quarterly dividend of 9.1 percent, to $0.18 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2018.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company also repurchased 952,108 shares of its common stock for approximately $20.0 million. As of April 21, 2018, the Company had $45.0 million available for future repurchases.\nOutlook\nMr. Staples continued, “We continue to be pleased with our ability to grow sales volumes, specifically in the food distribution and military segments, as we enhance and develop new and innovative solutions for our customers. This innovative spirit and our team’s ability to attract new customers, as well as help existing accounts grow, has us excited about our prospects for 2018 and beyond. In our food distribution segment, we are making investments to optimize our network and better serve our customers, and as a result, we anticipate incremental sales with our high-growth food distribution customers. We are also excited about the progress made to date with our food processing operations and look forward to realizing additional sales volume over the remainder of the year. In our military segment, new commissary business in the Southwest will benefit sales comparisons for the first half of 2018 and the ongoing expansion of the DeCA private brand program will also drive sales growth. We continue to expect that our retail stores’ comparable sales trends will improve to slightly negative to flat by the end of the year as our stores benefit from several of our innovative concepts and initiatives. While higher transportation costs are expected to remain a headwind, we are working to mitigate the impact across all segments. We believe that our strategic initiatives combined with the strength and stability of our extensive distribution network will enable continued growth.”\nThe Company is updating its guidance for the first half of fiscal 2018 and reaffirming its guidance for the full year fiscal 2018. For the first half, the Company expects adjusted earnings per share to be below the prior year adjusted earnings per share of $1.15. The Company anticipates that results will be $0.02 to $0.06 below the prior year due to the shift in timing of certain supplier programs, a delay in the launch of a significant new customer program and a challenging retail environment, partially offset by the Company’s sustained sales growth, the benefits of tax reform and sequential improvements in Caito operations.\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company anticipates adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations (6) of approximately $2.20 to $2.32, excluding merger/acquisition and integration expenses, restructuring charges and other adjusted items of $8.0 million to $10.0 million, compared to $2.10 in the prior year. The Company anticipates that reported earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of approximately $1.98 to $2.10 per diluted share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $(1.41) per diluted share in the prior year. The adjusted and reported guidance reflects an effective tax rate of 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent for fiscal 2018.\nThe Company continues to expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be in the range of $60.0 million to $70.0 million, with depreciation and amortization of approximately $80.0 million to $88.0 million, and total interest expense is now expected to be approximately $26.0 million to $28.0 million.\nConference Call\nA telephone conference call to discuss the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2018 financial results is scheduled for Wednesday, May 30, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET.

As the new accounting standard was adopted on a full retrospective basis, the aforementioned amounts refer to the prior period’s results as if the new revenue recognition standard was in effect in both periods. The decreases to net sales and cost of sales were $48.8 million for the period ended April 22, 2017.\n(2) A reconciliation of operating earnings to adjusted operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is provided below.\n(3) A reconciliation of net earnings to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is provided below.\n(4) A reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations to adjusted earnings from continuing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is provided below.\n(5) A reconciliation of operating (loss) earnings to adjusted operating earnings by segment, a non-GAAP financial measure, is provided below.\n(6) A reconciliation of projected earnings per share from continuing operations to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, is provided below.\nSPARTANNASH COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS (Unaudited)\n16 Weeks Ended April 21, April 22, (In thousands, except per share amounts)\n2018 2017 Net sales $ 2,385,073 $ 2,353,702 Cost of sales 2,041,859 1,996,326 Gross profit 343,214 357,376 Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative 309,058 322,779 Merger/acquisition and integration 2,206 4,017 Restructuring charges and asset impairment 6,202 1,021 Total operating expenses 317,466 327,817 Operating earnings 25,748 29,559 Other expenses and (income) Interest expense 8,778 7,315 Other, net (225 ) (190 ) Total other expenses, net 8,553 7,125 Earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations 17,195 22,434 Income tax expense 4,760 7,369 Earnings from continuing operations 12,435 15,065 Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes (92 ) (40 ) Net earnings $ 12,343 $ 15,025 Basic earnings per share: Earnings from continuing operations $ 0.34 $ 0.40 Loss from discontinued operations — — Net earnings $ 0.34 $ 0.40 Diluted earnings per share: Earnings from continuing operations $ 0.34 $ 0.40 Loss from discontinued operations — — Net earnings $ 0.34 $ 0.40 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 36,186 37,692 Diluted 36,197 37,756 SPARTANNASH COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited)\nApril 21, April 22, (In thousands)\n2018 2017 Assets\nCurrent assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 17,167 $ 19,516 Accounts and notes receivable, net 330,254 342,364 Inventories, net 577,508 539,908 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 47,144 42,878 Property and equipment held for sale 13,093 — Total current assets 985,166 944,666 Property and equipment, net 582,434 628,047 Goodwill 178,648 367,497 Intangible assets, net 132,565 131,376 Other assets, net 138,124 109,029 Total assets $ 2,016,937 $ 2,180,615 Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities Accounts payable $ 356,534 $ 370,682 Accrued payroll and benefits 57,317 60,449 Other accrued expenses 43,034 40,967 Current maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations 7,628 17,404 Total current liabilities 464,513 489,502 Long-term liabilities Deferred income taxes 49,372 132,374 Postretirement benefits 15,944 16,433 Other long-term liabilities 41,697 42,592 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations 733,367 658,261 Total long-term liabilities 840,380 849,660 Commitments and contingencies Shareholders’ equity Common stock, voting, no par value;

Adjusted EBITDA is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered “non-operating” or “non-core” in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment are performance measures that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in adjusted EBITDA format.\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company’s definitions of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTable 3: Reconciliation of Operating (Loss) Earnings to Adjusted Operating Earnings (A Non-GAAP Financial Measure) (Unaudited)\n16 Weeks Ended (In thousands)\nApril 21, 2018 April 22, 2017 Operating earnings $ 25,748 $ 29,559 Adjustments: Merger/acquisition and integration 2,206 4,017 Restructuring charges and asset impairment 6,202 1,021 Fresh Kitchen start-up costs (1) 1,366 2,748 Stock compensation associated with executive retirement — 1,172 Severance associated with cost reduction initiatives 274 3 Adjusted operating earnings $ 35,796 $ 38,520 Reconciliation of operating earnings to adjusted operating earnings by segment: Food Distribution: Operating earnings $ 24,521 $ 25,272 Adjustments: Merger/acquisition and integration 2,195 3,847 Restructuring charges and asset impairment 1,260 599 Fresh Kitchen start-up costs (1) 1,366 2,748 Stock compensation associated with executive retirement — 591 Severance associated with cost reduction initiatives 193 1 Adjusted operating earnings $ 29,535 $ 33,058 Military: Operating earnings $ 1,513 $ 880 Adjustments: Merger/acquisition and integration 4 — Stock compensation associated with executive retirement — 147 Severance associated with cost reduction initiatives 52 1 Adjusted operating earnings $ 1,569 $ 1,028 Retail: Operating (loss) earnings $ (286 ) $ 3,407 Adjustments: Merger/acquisition and integration 7 170 Restructuring charges and asset impairment 4,942 422 Stock compensation associated with executive retirement — 434 Severance associated with cost reduction initiatives 29 1 Adjusted operating earnings $ 4,692 $ 4,434 (1) Fresh Kitchen operations were no longer treated as start-up beginning in period three of fiscal 2018.

The Company believes both management and its investors find the information useful because it reflects the amount of long-term debt obligations that are not covered by available cash and temporary investments. Total net debt is not a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may differ from similarly titled measures of other companies.\nTable 6: Reconciliation of Projected Earnings per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations to Projected Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations (A Non-GAAP Financial Measure) (Unaudited)\n52 Weeks Ending December 29, 2018\nLow High Earnings from continuing operations $ 1.98 $ 2.10 Adjustments, net of taxes: Merger/acquisition and integration expenses 0.07 0.07 Restructuring and asset impairment 0.11 0.11 Fresh Kitchen start-up costs 0.03 0.03 Severance associated with cost reduction initiatives 0.01 0.01 Adjusted earnings from continuing operations $ 2.20 $ 2.32\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180529006235/en/\nSpartanNash Company\nInvestor Contacts:\nMark Shamber\nChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\n(616) 878-8023\nor\nKatie Turner\nPartner, ICR\n(646) 277-1228\nor\nMedia Contact:\nMeredith Gremel\nVice President Corporate Affairs and Communications\n(616) 878-2830\nSource: SpartanNash Company",
