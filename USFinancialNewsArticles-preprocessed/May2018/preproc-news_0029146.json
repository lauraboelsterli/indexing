    "text": "Luke Maile hit his first two home runs of the season, including a two-run walkoff shot in the 12th inning, as the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the visiting Boston Red Sox 5-3 on Friday night.\nMaile also had an RBI single in addition to his first career multi-homer game in the opener of a three-game series.\nHis game-winner came against left-hander Brian Johnson (1-2) after Curtis Granderson led off the 12th with a walk.\nSam Gaviglio (1-0), just recalled from Triple-A Buffalo, allowed one hit over three scoreless relief innings to earn the win.\nXander Bogaerts homered for Boston.\nBoston starter Chris Sale matched his career best with 15 strikeouts in nine innings, allowing three runs, six hits and no walks.\nToronto starter Aaron Sanchez allowed three runs (two earned), five hits and three walks while striking out four in five innings.\nEach team scored once in the first.\nBoston scored when Mookie Betts walked, took third on a single by Andrew Benintendi and came around on a groundout to first by J.D. Martinez.\nToronto tied it when Teoscar Hernandez doubled and scored on a single by Josh Donaldson.\nThe Blue Jays led 2-1 in the second after Kendrys Morales ended a career-long 0-for-28 hitless drought with a double, took third on Anthony Alford’s flyout and scored on Maile’s single.\nBogaerts led off the fourth with his fourth homer of the season. The Red Sox added an unearned run in the inning to go ahead 3-2. Brock Holt scored from first when Sandy Leon struck out and went to third on a passed ball and throwing error by catcher Maile.\nSale struck out his next six batters on the way to retiring 11 in a row before Maile hit his first homer with two out in the seventh.\nToronto’s John Axford pitched around a walk in the sixth and Seunghwan Oh pitched a perfect seventh.\nRyan Tepera pitched a perfect eighth for Toronto, and Tyler Clippard did the same in the ninth.\nBoston reliever Matt Barnes survived two walks in the bottom of the 10th.\nCarson Smith worked around a single and a stolen base by Kevin Pillar in the bottom of the 11th.\nBefore the game, the Blue Jays put right-hander Marcus Stroman on the disabled list with shoulder fatigue and optioned left-hander Tim Mayza to Triple-A Buffalo. Right-handers Joe Biagini and Gaviglio were recalled from Buffalo.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
