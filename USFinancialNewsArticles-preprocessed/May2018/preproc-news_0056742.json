    "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish voters are set to vote in favour of ending its ban on abortion by 69 percent to 31 percent, a second exit poll showed following a referendum on Friday, an almost identical margin to the earlier survey.\nA woman casts her vote with her daughter in a polling station on the day of the Abortion Referendum on liberalising abortion laws in Dublin, Ireland May 25, 2018. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Voters in the once deeply Catholic nation were asked if they wish to scrap a prohibition that was enshrined in the constitution by referendum 35 years ago, and partly lifted in 2013 only for cases where the motherâ€™s life is in danger.\nThe RTE/Behaviour & Attitudes exit poll followed an earlier exit poll carried out by the Irish Times newspaper and polling group Ipsos MRBI that suggested the margin would be 68 percent to 32 percent.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin\n ",
