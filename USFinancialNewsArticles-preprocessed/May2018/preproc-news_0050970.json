The law was passed two years earlier and made it a crime to take a woman across state lines for immoral purposes.\nJohnson died in 1946.\nIn signing the pardon, the president cited “tremendous racial tension” during the time Johnson was champion. “He really represented something that was both very beautiful and very terrible at the same time,” Trump said.

In April, Trump tweeted that he was considering the pardon after talking to Stallone.\nEarlier on Thursday, Stallone posted a photo of himself at the White House on Instagram with the caption “Waiting for the moment to go into the oval office for the pardon...”\nIn the Oval Office, Trump said of Stallone: “I love his movies.” With Sylvester Stallone (2nd R) and Lennox Lewis (R) behind him, U.S. President Donald Trump holds up the pardon he signed for the late Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight boxing champion, at the White House, May 24, 2018.
