LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading at 10,718.50, down 0.3 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee is expected to open little changed after the U.S. Federal Reserve expressed more confidence in inflation moving higher, but continued to signal a measured pace of interest rate increases. • Indian government bonds are likely to ease in early trade after the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady late yesterday but expressed confidence that a recent rise in inflation to near target would be sustained, hinting at a rate hike in June.The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.71 percent -7.76 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as potential U.S. restrictions on Chinese telecom companies reinforced investor concerns about worsening trade relations between the United States and China. • Asian shares were subdued ahead of anxiously-awaited Sino-U.S. trade talks, while the U.S. dollar consolidated recent bumper gains after the Federal Reserve reaffirmed the outlook for more rate hikes this year. • The dollar traded near a four-month high against a basket of currencies, having recovered from a brief dip after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady and said inflation had \"moved close\" to its target. • U.S. Treasury yields for most maturities fell on Wednesday as a quarterly refunding program that aims to finance the country's massive fiscal deficit came in short of expectations, reducing the pressure on prices caused by the increase in debt supply. • Oil prices dipped, weighed down by swelling U.S. crude inventories and record weekly U.S. production which is countering efforts by producer cartel OPEC to cut supplies and prop up prices. • Gold prices edged higher for a second session ahead of much awaited U.S.- China trade talks, where a breakthrough deal is viewed as highly unlikely.
