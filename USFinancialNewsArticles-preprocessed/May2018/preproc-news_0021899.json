    "text": "NEW PRAGUE, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Electromed, Inc. (“Electromed” or the “Company”) (NYSE American:ELMD), a leader in innovative airway clearance technologies, today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (“Q3 FY 2018”).\nQ3 FY 2018 Highlights\nNet revenue increased 6.3% to $7.1 million from $6.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 (“Q3 FY 2017”). Gross profit rose 5.4% to $5.6 million from $5.3 million in Q3 FY 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20.9% to $5.1 million, from $4.2 million in Q3 FY 2017, primarily reflecting the hiring of new employees to support revenue growth initiatives. Operating income totaled $485,000, compared to $1.0 million in Q3 FY 2017. Net income equaled $313,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to $648,000, or $0.08 per diluted share, in Q3 FY 2017. Cash flow from operations totaled $342,000, compared to $767,000 in Q3 FY 2017. Field sales employees grew to 48 at the end of Q3 FY 2018 from 35 at the end of Q3 FY 2017.\nKathleen Skarvan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Electromed, commented, “While homecare growth moderated this quarter due to lower sales productivity, we took decisive action and achieved a meaningful uptick in sales productivity and referrals in March, which continued into April. In our institutional business, we resumed positive sales growth in Q3 FY 2018, reflecting new sales leadership and a strategic plan that positions the segment for continued growth heading into fiscal 2019. We remain as enthusiastic as ever about the underpenetrated, growing bronchiectasis market and expect improved homecare growth in fiscal 2019 as our expanded sales force matures and becomes more productive.”\nMs. Skarvan continued, “In March 2018, we published a longitudinal outcomes-based study in Respiratory Therapy magazine that builds on previously published evidence and demonstrates that improved outcomes for bronchiectasis patients can be sustained 2.5 years after starting SmartVest® treatment. We believe our evidence-based sales approach resonates well with pulmonologists and other key decision makers, distinguishing us in the marketplace. SmartVest’s patient therapy monitoring features, ease-of-use and comfort, as well as our dedication to customer service, underpin our confidence as we strive to improve quality of life and outcomes for patients with compromised pulmonary function.”\nQ3 FY 2018 Review\nNet revenue increased 6.3% to $7.1 million in Q3 FY 2018 from $6.7 million in Q3 FY 2017, driven by higher home care and institutional revenue. Home care revenue rose 6.4% to $6.5 million in Q3 FY 2018 from $6.1 million in Q3 FY 2017. This increase was primarily due to a higher average selling price per device, which was partially offset by a lower level of referrals and approvals as compared to Q3 FY 2017.\nGross profit increased 5.4% to $5.6 million, or 79.0% of net revenue, in Q3 FY 2018 from $5.3 million, or 79.7% of net revenue, in Q3 FY 2017. The increase in gross profit resulted primarily from an increase in home care revenue.\nOperating expenses, which include selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as well as research and development (“R&D”) expenses, totaled $5.1 million, or 72.1% of net revenue, in Q3 FY 2018 compared with $4.3 million, or 64.1% of net revenue, in the same period of the prior year. SG&A expenses increased 20.9% to $5.1 million in Q3 FY 2018 from $4.2 million in Q3 FY 2017, primarily due to additional employees in sales, annual salary increases, higher share-based equity compensation expense, additional sales incentives on higher revenue accruals, and increased professional fees. R&D expenses totaled $43,000 in Q3 FY 2018 compared to $81,000 in Q3 FY 2017.\nOperating income decreased to $485,000 in Q3 FY 2018 from $1.0 million in Q3 FY 2017, primarily reflecting higher SG&A expense.\nNet income before income tax expense totaled $486,000 in Q3 FY 2018, compared to $1.0 million in Q3 FY 2017.\nNet income equaled $313,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, in Q3 FY 2018, compared to $648,000, or $0.08 per diluted share, in Q3 FY 2017. In Q3 FY 2018, income tax expense totaled $173,000, compared to $380,000 in the same period of the prior year. Income tax expense during Q3 FY 2018 benefitted from a reduced statutory corporate federal tax rate of 21%, compared to 34% in the prior year period, due to the Tax Act that was enacted by the U.S. Government on December 22, 2017, which became effective on January 1, 2018.\nYear-to-Date FY 2018 Summary\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, revenue grew 10.1% to $20.5 million from $18.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2017, driven by a 13.4% increase in home care revenue. Gross margins were 78.8%, compared to 78.4% in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, while net income was approximately $783,000, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to approximately $1.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period\nFinancial Condition\nElectromed’s balance sheet at March 31, 2018 included cash of $7.1 million, current maturities of long-term debt of $1.1 million, working capital of $16.2 million, and shareholders’ equity of $20.5 million.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on May 9, 2018 at 8:00 am CT (9:00 am ET) to discuss Q3 FY 2018 financial results and other matters.\nInterested parties may participate in the call by dialing:\n(877) 407-9753 (Domestic) (201) 493-6739 (International)\nThe conference call will also be accessible via the following link:\nhttp://www.investorcalendar.com/event/28489 .\nFor those who cannot listen to the live broadcast, an online webcast replay will be available in the Investor Relations section of Electromed’s web site at: http://investors.smartvest.com/ .\nAbout Electromed, Inc.\nElectromed, Inc. manufactures, markets, and sells products that provide airway clearance therapy, including the SmartVest ® Airway Clearance System, to patients with compromised pulmonary function.
