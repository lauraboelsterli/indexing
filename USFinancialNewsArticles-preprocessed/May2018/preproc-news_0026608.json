    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Loma Negra, (NYSE: LOMA) (BYMA: LOMA), (“Loma Negra” or the “Company”), the leading cement producer in Argentina, today announced results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.\n1Q18 Key Highlights\nCement, masonry & lime sales volume in Argentina up 9.5% YoY reflecting continued market growth Net revenue up 41.6% YoY to Ps.4,534 million (US$230 million) driven by volume and favourable price environment. Adjusted EBITDA up 40.6% YoY to Ps.1,166 million (US$59 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.7%, remaining almost flat. The Cement, Masonry, and Lime segment in Argentina posted a 52.1% YoY increase in Adjusted EBITDA with Adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 207 basis points to 28.7% Net Debt /LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.53x from 1.48x in 1Q17 and 0.30x in 4Q17\nCommenting on the financial and operating performance for the first quarter of 2018, Sergio Faifman, Loma Negra’s Chief Executive Officer, noted: \"We reported solid results in the first quarter, with volume and revenue growth principally driven by continued momentum in public infrastructure and private construction in Argentina reflecting ongoing economic growth.\n“Loma Negra’s cement, masonry and lime segment in Argentina, our core business, posted a 9.5% year-on-year increase in volumes during 1Q18. Volume growth, along with positive price environment resulted in Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increasing 52% during the period achieving a margin expansion of 207 basis points. On a consolidated basis, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin remains almost unchanged.\n“For the remainder of the year, we are confident that we will continue to see healthy dynamics in our markets with increasing demand for cement and concrete, although at slower rates following the significant recovery experienced in the prior year, supporting our expansion plans. We are also making headway in the expansion of our L’Amali plant that will add to capacity as well as drive profitability gains.”\nTable 1: Financial Highlights (amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Three-months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 % Chg.

Sales volumes in Paraguay fell 5.2% in the period to 0.14 million tons compared with an 8% decline for the industry, due to a slow start to the year. As a result, consolidated total sales volumes of cement, masonry and lime for the quarter increased 8.1% YoY to 1.72 million tons.\nConcrete volumes in Argentina, increased 44.8% YoY to 0.25 million m 3 driven by continued robust growth in public infrastructure in the Company’s markets - the city of Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires and the city of Rosario, province of Santa Fe.\nAggregate volumes were up 22.9% YoY to 0.29 million tons, benefiting from strong demand. The new crusher is already mounted and began operations in April which contributed to alleviate capacity constraints and is anticipated to double production capacity of aggregates once it’s fully operational. By contrast, sales volumes at Loma Negra’s railroad subsidiary, Ferrosur, declined 4.9% to 1.17 million tons mostly due to lower transported volumes of third-party aggregates.\nReview of Financial Results\nTable 3: Condensed Interim Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss (amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Three-months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 % Change Net revenue 4,534 3,202 41.6% Cost of sales (3,233) (2,259) 43.1% Gross Profit 1,301 943 38.0% Selling and administrative expenses (327) (269) 21.7% Other gains and losses 4 0 1,233.1% Tax on debits and credits to bank accounts (65) (40) 62.1% Finance costs, net Exchange rate differences (109) 87 n/a Financial income 108 4 2,795.3% Financial expenses (150) (142) 5.5% Profit before tax 762 583 30.6% Income tax expense Current (199) (182) 9.6% Deferred (13) (2) 607.4% Net profit 549 399 37.4% Net Profit attributable to owners of the Company 526 354 48.6% Net Revenues\nNet revenue increased 41.6% to Ps.4,534 million in 1Q18, from Ps.3,202 million in the year-ago quarter, principally reflecting strong growth in Argentina – mainly in the Cement, masonry and lime segment and the Concrete segment.\nCement, masonry and lime revenues in Argentina were up 41.1% YoY, to Ps.3,400 million driven by both higher volumes and price increases. Revenues in Paraguay rose 23.1%, reaching Ps.346 million in the quarter as the 5.2% YoY decline in volume was more than compensated by the depreciation of the Argentine peso.\nConcrete revenues in Argentina, rose 96.5% YoY to Ps.707 million reflecting volume growth and increased prices. In addition, Railroad revenues increased 22.9% to Ps.441 million despite lower volumes, while Aggregate revenues were up 31.3% reaching Ps.68 million during the period.\nCost of sales rose 43.1% YoY to Ps.3,233 million in 1Q18, as a result of cost inflation, greater sales volume, and a higher share of Concrete sales. Cost of sales in the quarter was also impacted by a temporary increase in supply costs.\nAs a result, Gross profit increased 38.0% YoY reaching Ps.1,301 million in 1Q18 from Ps.943 million in 1Q17, with gross margin contracting 74 basis points YoY to 28.7%. While Gross profit margin in the Cement, masonry and lime segment in Argentina increased 221 basis points in the period, this improvement was more than offset mostly by robust growth in the lower-margin Concrete segment and lower transported volumes in the Railroad segment.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses (SG&A) in the first quarter of 2018 rose 21.7% YoY in absolute values to Ps.327 million, from Ps.269 million in 1Q17. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A declined 118 basis points to 7.2% in 1Q18 from 8.4% in the year-ago period mainly driven by higher cost dilution along with a reduction in the effective sales tax rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA & Margin\nTable 4: Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation & Margin (amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Three-months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 % Change Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation: Net profit 549 399 37.4% (+) Financial interest, net 15 114 -86.8% (+) Income tax expense 213 184 15.7% (+) Depreciation and amortization 189 155 21.5% (+) Exchange rate differences 109 (87) n/a (+) Other financial expenses, net 26 24 11.9% (+) Tax on debits and credits to bank accounts 65 40 62.1% Adjusted EBITDA 1,166 829 40.6% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 25.7% 25.9% -18 bps Adjusted EBITDA increased 40.6% year-over-year in 1Q18 to Ps.1,166 million, driven principally by continued growth in volumes and prices.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin, in turn, showed a slight decline of 18 basis points to 25.7%, from 25.9% in 1Q17, reflecting the strong growth of Concrete revenues during the period.\nThe Cement segment in Argentina, which represented 84% of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA in 1Q18, reported a 52.1% YoY increase in Adjusted EBITDA reaching Ps.975 million with Adjusted EBITDA margin expanding by 207 basis points during the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Cement segment in Paraguay was up 22.9% YoY, to Ps.150 million, with Adjusted EBITDA margin relatively flat at 43.4%. In addition, while the Concrete segment posted 19.3% increase in Adjusted EBITDA reaching Ps.15 million, the margin contracted 138 basis points mostly as a result of a temporary increase in the supply cost of raw materials.\nBy contrast, Adjusted EBITDA for the Railroad segment declined 46.4% to Ps.22 million in 1Q18, with Adjusted EBITDA margin contracting to 4.9% from 11.3% in the year-ago quarter reflecting lower dilution of fixed costs given a decline in transported volumes of aggregates.\nFinance Costs, Net\nDuring 1Q18, total finance costs, net increased by 197.7% YoY, or Ps.100 million, reaching a net cost of Ps.151 million, mainly due to foreign exchange differences.\nThe Company reported a foreign exchange loss of Ps.109 million in 1Q18, as a result of the 7.3% peso depreciation as compared to an Ps.87 million gain in 1Q17 when the peso appreciated 3.0%.\nFinancial income, in turn increased by Ps.104 million reflecting a higher cash balance, while financial expenses rose by Ps.8 million.\nTable 5: Finance Costs, net (amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Three-months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 % Change Exchange rate differences (109) 87 -225.5% Financial income 108 4 2,795.3% Financial expenses (150) (142) 5.5% Total Finance Costs, Net (151) (51) 197.7% Net Profit and Net Profit Attributable to Owners of the Company\nFor 1Q18, Loma Negra reported Net Profit of Ps.549 million, up 37.4% from Ps.399 million in the year-ago period. The effective tax rate declined to 28% in 1Q18 from 32% in 1Q17, as a result of the adjustment in deferred taxes in Argentina from the recent Tax Reform which reduced the income tax rate from 35% to 30% in 2018 and 2019, and to 25% thereafter.\nNet Profit Attributable to Owners of the Company for the quarter increased 48.6% YoY, or Ps.172 million, to Ps.526 million. During 1Q18, the Company reported earnings per common share of Ps.0.88 and earnings per ADR of Ps.4.41, compared with earnings per share of Ps.0.63 and earnings per ADR of Ps.3.13 in 1Q17.\nCapitalization\nTable 6: Capitalization and Debt Ratio (amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) As of March 31, As of December 31, 2018 2017 2017 Total Debt 4,559 4,220 4,364 - Short-Term Debt 1,941 2,508 1,760 - Long-Term Debt 2,618 1,712 2,604 Cash and Cash Equivalents 2,294 265 3,180 Total Net Debt 2,265 3,954 1,184 Shareholders' Equity 5,048 1,099 4,416 Capitalization 9,607 5,318 8,780 Adjusted EBITDA 1,166 829 3,942 Net Debt /LTM Adjusted EBITDA 0.53x 1.48x 0.30x As of March 31, 2018, total cash and cash equivalents were Ps.2,294 million. Total debt at the close of the quarter was Ps.4,559 million, composed by Ps.1,941 million in short-term borrowings, including the current portion of long-term borrowings (or 43% of total borrowings), and Ps.2,618 million in long-term borrowings (or 57% of total borrowings). This compares with a 27.8% QoQ reduction in cash and cash equivalents from Ps.3,180 million as of December 31, 2017, while total debt increased by 8.0% sequentially from Ps.4,364 million during the same period, as a result of seasonally higher working capital needs, along with increased capex investments.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 43.4%, or Ps.1,979 million, Loma Negra’s total debt was denominated in U.S. dollars, 33.7% (or Ps.1,537 million) in Guaraníes, and 22.9% (or Ps.1,043 million) in Argentine pesos, with an average duration of 0.8 years.\nAt the close of 1Q18, Ps.2,643 million, or 58.0%, of the Company’s total consolidated borrowings bore interest at floating rates, including Ps.296 million of Peso-denominated borrowings that bore interest at rates based on the Buenos Aires Deposits of Large Amount Rate, or BADLAR, Ps.1,916 million of foreign currency-denominated borrowings that bore interest at rates based on Libor, and Ps.431 million of borrowings with other floating interest rate.\nThe Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (LTM) ratio declined to 0.53x in 1Q18 from 1.48x as of March 31, 2017 reflecting the proceeds for the recent IPO, but increased from 0.30x at the close of FY17.\nCash Flows\nTable 7: Condensed Interim Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (Unaudited) (amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Quarter ended March 31, 2018 2017 CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net profit for the year 549 399 Adjustments to reconcile net profit to net cash provided by operating activities 617 388 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: (1,080) (703) Net cash generated by operating activities\n86 84 CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Property, plant and equipment, Intangible Assets, net (854) (469) Others (9) 27 Net cash used in investing activities (862) (441) CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Proceeds from / Repayments off borrowings, Interest paid (156) (185) Dividends paid - - Proceeds from initial public offering, net of issuance costs - Net cash generated by (used in) financing activities (156) (185) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (932) (542) Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year 3,180 803 Effects of the exchange rate differences on cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency 46 4 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 2,294 265 During 1Q18, the Company made capital expenditures for Ps.854 million, 32% of which were related to maintenance of existing capacity and 68% directed to the modernization and expansion of production capacity of L´Amalí plant. Cash flow from operations increased to Ps.86 million in 1Q18 from Ps.84 million in the year ago quarter reflecting the strong operating performance which was partially offset by the increase in working capital.\nExpansion of L’Amalí Plant\nLoma Negra is moving ahead with increasing installed capacity at its L’Amalí plant by 2.7 million tons annually. This expansion involves a capital expenditure of approximately US$350 million, and is expected to be completed early 2020.\nThe Company hired Sinoma International Engineering Co. Ltd. (“Sinoma”) for the construction of a new cement plant with a capacity of 5,800 tons per day of clinker. The agreement includes the engineering, provision and shipment of all the equipment for the plant and its construction.\nBasic engineering of the new plant and study of soil in situ was completed in 4Q17. In 1Q18, the Company started detailed engineering, selected the civil works subcontractor. On-site civil works have been initiated and main equipment is being ordered. On-site activities are progressing according to schedule. Additions to Property, Plant and Equipment related to this project during 1Q18 were Ps.155 million.\nRecent Events\nLoma Negra Holds General Annual Shareholders’ Meeting\nOn April 25, 2018 Loma Negra held its General Annual Shareholders Meeting.
