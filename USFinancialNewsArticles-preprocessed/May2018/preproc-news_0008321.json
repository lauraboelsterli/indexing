I look forward to continuing to assist him in his efforts. The Board and I believe strongly that Kevin will do an outstanding job as CEO. I am pleased that he and I can continue to work together to execute our consistent strategy and create long term intrinsic value for our shareholders.\"\nMr. Stein said, \"I am excited for the opportunity to lead TransDigm going forward as its next President and Chief Executive Officer.

TransDigm has an outstanding team around the globe and I am honored to be part of such a focused and successful aerospace company.
