    "text": "PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Radian Group Inc. announced today that its stockholders re-elected ten directors, who serve one-year terms and are re-elected annually. The company’s stockholders approved all proposals recommended by the Board of Directors and presented for vote at Radian’s 2018 Annual Meeting, including an advisory proposal to approve the compensation of Radian’s named executive officers, a proposal to approve the amended and restated Radian Group Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the company’s independent auditors for 2018.\nRadian also announced:\nThe completion of its previously announced $50 million share repurchase program in advance of its July 31, 2018 expiration date, purchasing approximately 3.0 million shares of Radian common stock at an average price of $16.56 per share, including commissions. This represents approximately 1.4 percent of the company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding during 2017. Approval by the company’s Board of Directors for a regular quarterly dividend on its common stock in the amount of $0.0025 per share, payable on June 4, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 21, 2018.\nChief Executive Officer Rick Thornberry addressed the attendees of Radian’s Annual Meeting by stating, “For more than 40 years, Radian has helped nearly seven million families achieve and preserve their dream of homeownership.

Looking ahead, I believe that we are well positioned for the future with the right strategic focus; a highly valuable insurance portfolio; a diversified set of products; and the financial flexibility and capital strength to compete, grow and diversify our revenue sources, serve our customers and create even greater value for stockholders.”\nABOUT RADIAN\nRadian Group Inc.
