(NASDAQ:PLUS), a leading provider of technology solutions, today announced financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nManagement Comment\n“Fourth quarter results demonstrate that our strategy of increasing the consultative and annuity services we provide to customers in our focused solution areas of Cloud, Security and Digital Infrastructure is working, driving a 6.9% increase in gross profit and a 170 basis point expansion in gross margin to 24.7%. This growth was achieved on stable revenue comparisons, which included the impact of a large customer project that benefited sales in last year’s fourth quarter,” said Mark Marron, Chief Executive Officer and President. “For the year, revenues increased 6.1%, and gross margin was 22.9%, up 40 basis points from the prior year.”\n“We are focusing on the solution areas in high demand by our customers, and expanding the business organically through digital demand generation activities, offering new products and services, and through acquisitions. We continued to see strong demand for our security solutions, with sales of security products and services increasing 47.9% for the quarter. For the fiscal year, security related sales increased 23.8%, and accounted for 18.9% of adjusted gross billings, an increase of 280 basis points from the prior year. In fiscal 2018, we completed the acquisition of IDS and OneCloud, both of which have increased our cloud offerings and capabilities to help our customers move to and from the cloud, more securely, particularly around backup-as-a-service, storage, DevOps, and OpenStack.”\nMr. Marron concluded, “While optimizing costs as we migrate to a services-led approach to customer engagements, we continue to make the necessary investments in customer facing personnel to provide the consultative and advisory services our customers need in the Cloud, Security and Digital infrastructure space, and also to capture opportunities in emerging technologies such as analytics, network modernization, edge compute and artificial intelligence.”\nPrior Period Reclassifications due to Stock Split\nReclassifications of prior period amounts related to numbers of shares and per share amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation due to the March 31, 2017 stock split.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nFor the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year ended March 31, 2017:\nConsolidated net sales decreased 0.7% to $330.4 million, from $332.8 million.\nTechnology segment net sales decreased 0.8% to $320.0 million, from $322.5 million.\nAdjusted gross billings of products and services decreased 3.7% to $441.7 million, from $458.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, partly due to the completion of a project for one of our large corporate customers in the third quarter of the current year. Adjusted gross billings are sales of product and services adjusted to exclude the costs incurred of applicable third-party software assurance, maintenance, and services.\nFinancing segment net sales increased 0.8% to $10.4 million, from $10.3 million due to increases in post contract earnings.\nConsolidated gross profit rose 6.9% to $81.6 million, from $76.4 million. Consolidated gross margin was 24.7%, compared with 23.0% in the prior year. Gross margin on sales of product and services was 22.3%, compared with 20.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in margins was due to higher product margin combined with higher sales of services.\nOperating expenses rose 9.5% to $63.1 million, from $57.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits due to an increase of 87 personnel, or 7.4%, to 1,260 from 1,173, primarily related to the acquisitions completed in the year, an increase in variable compensation as a result of higher gross profit and an increase in depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions.\nConsolidated operating income decreased 1.2% to $18.5 million, from $18.7 million.\nOur effective tax rate for the current quarter was 51.0%, compared with 44.0% in the prior year quarter. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to an adjustment of $1.8 million to the estimate we recorded in the third quarter related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new U.S. federal income tax rate.\nNet earnings decreased 15.2% to $8.9 million, from $10.5 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 5.6% to $23.3 million, from $22.1 million.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.65, compared with $0.75 in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.96, compared with $0.91 last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is based on net earnings calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude other income (expense), share based compensation, and acquisition and integration expenses, and the related tax effects, the tax (benefit) expense due to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new U.S. tax rates, and an adjustment to our tax expense in the prior year assuming a 31.5% effective annual income tax rate for U.S. operations.\nFiscal Year 2018 Results\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017:\nConsolidated net sales rose 6.1% to $1,411.0 million, from $1,329.4 million.\nTechnology segment net sales rose 5.8% to $1,369.5 million, from $1,294.9 million.\nAdjusted gross billings grew 6.5% to $1,891.1 million, from $1,775.7 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales and adjusted gross billings of products and services was a result of an increase in demand for products and services from our large corporate and healthcare customers, and contributions from acquisitions. Adjusted gross billings are sales of product and services adjusted to exclude the costs incurred of applicable third-party software assurance, maintenance, and services.\nFinancing segment net sales increased 20.4% to $41.5 million, from $34.5 million, as a result of higher post-contract earnings due to early terminations of several large leases, as well as revenues earned from consumption based financing arrangements.\nConsolidated gross profit rose 7.9% to $323.5 million, from $299.8 million. Consolidated gross margin was 22.9%, compared with 22.5% in the prior year. Gross margin on sales of product and services was 20.7%, compared with 20.5% in fiscal 2017, due to higher service revenues, offset by lower product margins related to a large competitively bid project, most of which was delivered in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018.\nOperating expenses rose 11.8% to $239.2 million, from $214.0 million in fiscal 2017, mainly attributable to an increase in variable compensation and an increase of 87, or 7.4%, in personnel as well as higher healthcare costs and an increases in depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions.\nConsolidated operating income decreased 1.7% to $84.2 million, from $85.7 million.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 34.3%, compared with 41.3% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the change in the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% resulting from legislation that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nNet earnings rose 9.0% to $55.1 million, from $50.6 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA rose 3.5% to $102.8 million, from $99.3 million.\nDiluted earnings per share was $3.95, compared with $3.60 in fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.40, compared with $4.23 last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is based on net earnings calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude other income (expense), share based compensation, and acquisition and integration expenses, and the related tax effects, the tax (benefit) expense due to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new U.S. tax rates, and an adjustment to our tax expense in the prior year using a 31.5% effective annual income tax rate for U.S. operations.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAs of March 31, 2018, ePlus had cash and cash equivalents of $118.2 million, compared with $109.8 million as of March 31, 2017. Inventory decreased 57.4% to $39.9 million and current deferred revenue decreased 40.5% to $38.9 million primarily due to the shipment of large projects within the first nine months of the fiscal year. Total stockholders' equity was $372.6 million and total shares outstanding were 13.8 million, compared with $345.9 million and shares outstanding of 14.2 million on March 31, 2017.

Market dynamics appear to be positive, particularly in our areas of strategic focus, namely cloud, security and digital infrastructure.

In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate similar non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Billings, Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP Net Earnings and non-GAAP Net Earnings per Common Share - Diluted or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.\nThree Months Ended March 31, Year Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands) Sales of product and services $ 318,353 $ 321,429 $ 1,364,145 $ 1,290,228 Costs incurred related to sales of third party software assurance, maintenance and services 123,341 137,091 526,920 485,480 Adjusted gross billings of product and services $ 441,694 $ 458,520 $ 1,891,065 $ 1,775,708\nThree Months Ended March 31, Year Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands) Consolidated Net earnings $ 8,897 $ 10,490 $ 55,122 $ 50,556 Provision for income taxes 9,270 8,246 28,769 35,556 Depreciation and amortization [1] 2,835 1,844 9,921 7,252 Share based compensation 1,608 1,505 6,464 6,025 Acquisition and integration expenses [2] 388 20 2,150 278 Other (income) expense [4] 347 - 348 (380 ) Adjusted EBITDA $\n23,345\n$ 22,105 $ 102,774 $ 99,287 Three Months Ended March 31, Year Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017\n(in thousands) Technology Segment Operating income $ 13,685 $ 12,909 $ 62,389 68,912 Depreciation and amortization [1] 2,834 1,843 9,918 7,243 Share based compensation 1,515 1,423 6,098 5,684 Acquisition and integration expenses [2] 388 20 2,150 278 Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 18,422 $ 16,195 $ 80,555 82,117 Financing Segment Operating income $ 4,829 $ 5,827 $ 21,850 16,820 Depreciation and amortization [1] 1 1 3 9 Share based compensation 93 82 366 341 Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,923 $ 5,910 $ 22,219 17,170\nThree Months Ended March 31, Year Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands, except per share data) GAAP: Earnings before provision for income taxes $ 18,167 $ 18,736 $ 83,891 $ 86,112 Share based compensation 1,608 1,505 6,464 6,025 Acquisition and integration expenses [2] 388 20 2,150 278 Acquisition related amortization expense [3] 1,800 902 5,978 4,000 Other (income) expense [4] 347 - 348 (380 ) Non-GAAP: Earnings before provision for income taxes 22,310 21,163 98,831 96,035 GAAP: Provision for income taxes 9,270 8,246 28,769 35,556 Share based compensation [7] 611 571 3,900 2,798 Acquisition and integration expenses [2] 147 7 815 105 Acquisition related amortization expense [3] 682 301 2,103 1,255 Other (income) expense [4] 132 - 132 (144 ) Re-measurement of deferred taxes [5] (1,753 ) - 1,654 - Adjustment to FY17 U.S. federal tax rate to 31.5% [6] - (661 ) - (2,913 ) Non-GAAP: Provision for income taxes 9,089 8,464 37,373 36,657 Non-GAAP: Net earnings $ 13,221 $ 12,699 $ 61,458 $ 59,378 GAAP: Net earnings per common share – diluted $ 0.65 $ 0.75 $ 3.95 $ 3.60 Non-GAAP: Net earnings per common share – diluted $ 0.96 $ 0.91 $ 4.40 $ 4.23\n[1] Amount consists of depreciation and amortization for assets used internally.
