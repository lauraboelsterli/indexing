(NASDAQ: TTEK) today announced results for the second quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nSecond Quarter Results\nFor the second quarter, Tetra Tech’s results exceeded net revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) guidance. Revenue in the second quarter totaled $700 million. For ongoing 1 operations, revenue totaled $699 million, and revenue, net of subcontractor costs 2 (net revenue), was $533 million. Operating income for the second quarter was $43 million, and on an ongoing basis totaled $45 million. EPS was $0.51, and on an ongoing basis totaled $0.54, up 13% year-over-year. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion.\nQuarterly Dividend and Share Repurchase Program\nOn April 30, 2018, Tetra Tech’s Board of Directors declared a 20% increase in the quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.12 per share payable on June 1, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 16, 2018. Additionally, the Company has $50 million remaining under the previously approved $200 million share repurchase program.\nComments on Results\nTetra Tech’s Chairman and CEO, Dan Batrack, commented, “Tetra Tech had a very strong second quarter and record first half of the year results, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for both net revenue and earnings. Our broad-based growth has been led by work for U.S. state and local clients, which has increased organically at a double-digit rate for seven consecutive quarters, including 30% growth in the second quarter. With the recent 2018 U.S. Federal spending bill in place, we have more visibility for the remainder of 2018. Given the strength of our results and outlook, we are increasing our guidance for both EPS and net revenue for fiscal 2018.”\nSix-Month Results\nRevenue for the six-month period was $1.5 billion and net revenue was $1.1 billion, up 10% and 8%, respectively, compared to the same period in fiscal 2017. Operating income for the six-month period was $91 million and EPS was $1.32, up 10% and 43%, respectively, compared to the same period in fiscal 2017. On an ongoing basis, EPS totaled $1.18, up 22% year-over-year.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following statements are based on current expectations.

However, non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP measures. In addition, other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently which limits the ability of investors to compare non-GAAP measures of Tetra Tech to those used by our peer companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in this release.",
