    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 6:03 PM / Updated 33 minutes ago China disinvited from major U.S. military exercise - Pentagon Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has disinvited China from a major U.S.-hosted naval drill this year as an “initial” response to what it sees as Beijing’s militarization of islands in the South China Sea, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.\n“As an initial response to China’s continued militarization of the South China Sea we have disinvited the PLA Navy from the 2018 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) Exercise,” Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.\nThe Pentagon said there was “strong evidence” that China had deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands.\nOver the weekend China’s air force landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region.\nThe move comes on the same day China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington.\nThe Rim of the Pacific exercise, known as RIMPAC, is billed as the world’s largest international maritime exercise, held every two years in Hawaii in June and July, and China has attended previously.\nEarlier this month the United States said it had raised concerns with China about its latest militarization of the South China Sea and that there would be near-term and long-term consequences.\nPentagon officials have long complained that China has not been candid enough about its rapid military build-up, whereas Chinese officials have accused Washington of viewing their country in suspicious, “Cold War” terms.\nThe United States has dispatched warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China’s extensive sovereignty claims in the territory, which is subject to various claims by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia.\n“We have called on China to remove the military systems immediately and to reverse course on the militarization of disputed South China Sea features,” Logan said.
