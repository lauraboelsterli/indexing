    "text": "HONG KONG, May 3 (Reuters) - Fashion group Esprit Holdings Ltd said on Thursday it plans to shut its loss-making operations in Australia and New Zealand, concentrating resources in developing Asian markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.\nThe Europe-focused apparel retailer said it will close 67 directly managed retail stores in the two countries that contributed HK$297 million ($37.8 million) of revenue in the fiscal year to end-June 2017, less than two percent of its total revenue. It gave no further details.\nEsprit, which has a market capitalisation of $659 million, said the divestment would result in up to HK$200 million in one-off costs from provisions for store closures and the impairment of store assets, and would have a “negative impact” on its results for the year to June 2018.\nThe retailer on Wednesday posted an 11 percent drop in 9-month revenue.\n$1 = 7.8491 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Donny Kwok; editing by Richard Pullin\n ",
