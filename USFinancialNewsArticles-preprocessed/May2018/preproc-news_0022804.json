Since joining Horizon, Terry's impact has been significant as he has rapidly built a world-class commercial team, recruiting talent from across the industry. His actions have aligned Horizon's commercial teams and allowed them to sell the full Horizon portfolio to all customers across different geographies as well as form teams focused on adding value to key customer accounts.\nPrior to joining Horizon, Terry worked for Pacific Biosciences, first as Vice President Europe, and later as Head of Global Sales. Previous leadership roles include Director Global Commercial Operations at Genetix prior to its acquisition by Danaher; and Senior Vice President Global Commercial Operations at Swedish Biotechnology firm Biacore, where he was part of the team that reignited the company's commercial success, culminating in its acquisition by GE Life Sciences in 2006. Terry started his career at Applied Biosystems in 1988 in a sales role and rose through the ranks to Vice President Europe in 2003. Terry graduated with a degree in Physiology & Biochemistry from the University of Reading.\nDr. Ian Gilham, Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, Horizon Discovery, said: \"I am delighted to announce the appointment of Terry as Horizon's new CEO, following a rigorous process that assessed both internal and external candidates. As the process evolved it became clear that Terry was the stand out candidate to deliver on the strategy and growth of the Group. Since joining Horizon, Terry has been instrumental in building a world-class commercial team, and his outstanding leadership and highly valuable commercial experience will help lead the Company through its next phase of growth and development as we transition from building scale through acquisitions towards becoming a sustainably profitable business driven by demand for our market-leading products and services in both gene editing and gene modulation. With Horizon's strong technology and commercial platforms and a highly experienced commercially-focused management team in place, Horizon is ideally positioned to execute on its growth plan and create value for shareholders.\n\"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Richard for his dedicated work as interim Chief Executive Officer, ensuring the smooth day-to-day running of the business. He will resume his role as Chief Financial Officer with the Company following an orderly transition to Terry.\"\nTerry Pizzie, Chief Executive Officer, Horizon Discovery, said: \"Horizon has built a highly successful global business which has a world leading position in gene editing and gene modulation. We are now an established market leader across the high value and high margin RNAi and CRISPR end-markets which are estimated to be worth Â£2.2 billion and growing at approximately 20% per year. The Company is also a technology leader in the broader field of cell engineering as evidenced by the commercial success with important customers in this field. I am honoured to have been appointed to lead the Group at such an important stage in the Company's development. With the strong product and commercial platforms in place and our presence in high-growth markets I look forward to working with the Board and executive management team to deliver on our vision and strategy to build value for our customers, patients and shareholders.\"\nThe following additional information is provided in accordance with Rule 17 and paragraph (g) of Schedule Two of the AIM Rules for Companies.\nTerence William Pizzie, aged 57, owns a total of 67,997 ordinary shares of 1.0p each in the Company.
