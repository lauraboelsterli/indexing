    "text": "CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AptarGroup, Inc. (NYSE: ATR) today announced that as of May 1, 2018, it has acquired Reboul from Vacheron Industries SAS. Reboul is a French leader in the design and industrial production of high-quality metal components, metal-plastic sub-assemblies, next generation lipstick mechanisms, and complete color cosmetic packaging solutions.\nThis strategic acquisition brings to Aptar complementary and distinctive capabilities including deep metal drawing, high speed metal stamping, as well as differentiated lipstick mechanism design and manufacturing. The transaction positions Aptar well to capitalize on growth in the color cosmetics market, while further strengthening its ability to serve customers in the skincare and fragrance markets.\nUnder the terms of the purchase agreement, Aptar will acquire Reboul for an enterprise value of €14 million (approximately $17 million) in cash, less the amount of net debt assumed at the closing date. The agreement also provides an earn-out provision based on the 2018 financial results, which could increase the enterprise value to a maximum of €23 million (approximately $28 million). The purchase will be funded with available cash on hand.\nSince 1921, Reboul has been creating packaging for some of the world’s most prestigious color cosmetics brands. In 2017, Reboul became a member of Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (EPV), a recognition by the French government that rewards French firms for excellence in their field and industrial know-how. Reboul operates in a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility built according to RT2012 standards to provide optimized energy management. Located near an existing Aptar facility in Annecy, France, Reboul offers close proximity to leaders in the global prestige beauty industry.\nCommenting on the transaction, Stephan Tanda, Aptar President and CEO said, “We are excited to announce this strategic acquisition which better positions us to further participate in the attractive growth of the color cosmetics market. This opportunity follows our disciplined approach of acquiring leading, recognized players with innovative technologies and know-how where we can also leverage the breadth of our commercial and manufacturing networks. The combination of Aptar’s scale and Reboul’s distinctive capabilities is compelling, and it will enable us to further expand our distinctive solutions to customers worldwide. We welcome Reboul’s excellent and experienced team to Aptar and look forward to building upon their success together to create a global leader in color cosmetics packaging solutions.”\nAptar is a leading global supplier of a broad range of innovative dispensing solutions for the beauty, personal care, home care, prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, food, and beverage markets.
