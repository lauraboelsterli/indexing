    "text": "0 COMMENTS Leading lights of the hedge fund world have gathered in Hong Kong to float their big bets on stocks at the annual Sohn conference. One of their biggest challenges: The local market’s setup.\nShort sellers see plenty of opportunity to point out underhand behavior in Chinese companies that they argue should cause their shares to fall. At last year’s conference, U.S.-based Muddy Waters suggested shorting furniture-maker Man Wah , while Dan David —CIO of FG Alpha Management—recommended a similar strategy with Dali Foods . Both investors claimed evidence of accounting irregularities—accusations both Hong Kong-listed companies denied.\nA part of Hong Kong’s skyline as seen through the sails of traditional junk-style boats, April 13. Photo: David G. Mcintyre/Zuma Press The companies’ pushback seems to have worked. Man Wah’s share price is roughly the same as a year ago, while Dali Foods has risen about 30%.\nWhatever the merits of each case, Hong Kong’s market structure has made life difficult for the short sellers. The presence of large controlling shareholders in many listed Chinese firms makes it is easier for friendly parties to defend them against short sellers’ attacks. Dali Foods, for example, has only a 15% public float.\nAnother difficulty is the growing influence of money flooding into Hong Kong from mainland China to defend beleaguered stocks. The ultimate investors behind these funds, which enter via the Stock Connect trading links between Hong Kong and mainland markets, are hard to trace. Collectively, though, mainland investors have quadrupled their shareholdings in Man Wah since Muddy Waters’ Carson Block recommended shorting the stock. Together, mainland investors now own 16% of the company.\nSympathy for short sellers may be in, well, short supply. But investors of all stripes should be worried about threats to the Hong Kong market’s integrity. In another concerning episode, shares in Hong Kong-listed Alibaba Health have surged by more than 50% in the past two weeks, fueled by heavy buying from mainland investors. The loss-making company did announce improved full-year results on May 16. But the timing of the run-up looks suspicious, given much of it came before an announcement by company parent Alibaba on May 29 that it would inject $1.4 billion worth of assets into Alibaba Health.\nRelated\nRonaldo Finally Hits the Target for Samsonite (May 25, 2018) Going Short Is a Quick Route to Pain in Hong Kong (June 15, 2017) Another $10 Billion Hong Kong Stock-Market Mystery (Sept. 26, 2016) Some short sellers are changing tack. Soren Aandahl, head of newly formed Blue Orca Capital, made waves recently after targeting Hong Kong-listed suitcase maker Samsonite —a widely held company that isn’t Chinese and isn’t eligible for Stock Connect. Last year, Mr. Aandahl—who was then director of research at Glaucus Research—argued for shorting Chinese property developer Fullshare . The stock initially dipped before mainland investors piled in, doubling their collective shareholding in Fullshare. It is now up 35% since Mr. Aandahl’s short recommendation.\nShort sellers looking for an easy life are learning not to pick on well-defended Chinese stocks. Whether that is a good sign for the broader Hong Kong market is highly debatable.\nWrite to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com",
