    "text": "We already let you in on signs you're on track to becoming a millionaire . Are you on your way to striking it rich? Or does your behavior shoot up red flags?\nTo help you figure it out, we've rounded up some warning signs to watch out for. Everyone's situation is different but, if you're routinely making these mistakes, it may be time to make some changes when it comes to managing your money.\n1. You emphasize saving over earning While rich people value the importance of saving and investing, they also recognize that the key to getting rich is to focus on earning .\n\"The masses are so focused on clipping coupons and living frugally they miss major opportunities,\" Siebold writes in \" How Rich People Think .\" \"Even in the midst of a cash flow crisis, the rich reject the nickel-and-dime thinking of the masses. They are the masters of focusing their mental energy where it belongs: on the big money.\"\nYou shouldn't disregard smart saving strategies . But if you want to reach seven figures, \"stop worrying about running out of money and focus on how to make more,\" Siebold says.\nAs author Thomas C. Corley found in his five-year study of self-made millionaires, the rich \"do not rely on one singular source of income,\" he writes in \" Change Your Habits, Change Your Life .\" The majority, 65 percent, \"had at least three streams of income that they created prior to making their first million dollars.\"\nshow chapters Use this trick to get rich, says self-made millionaire 2:19 PM ET Thu, 20 July 2017 | 00:47 2. You don't have money goals \"The number one reason most people don't get what they want is that they don't know what they want,\" writes self-made millionaire T. Harv Eker in his book, \" Secrets of the Millionaire Mind .\"\nIf you want to build wealth, you have to have a clear goal, as well as a specific plan and hard deadlines. And when you're setting goals, don't be afraid to think big. The rich want a lot and are up for a challenge, Siebold says: \"No one would ever strike it rich and live their dreams without huge expectations.\"\nshow chapters Simple steps to get rich from a self-made millionaire 8:25 AM ET Thu, 23 March 2017 | 00:54 3. You use phrases like \"I want\" and \"I wish\" Just like your thoughts and habits can mean the difference between living a wealthy life and an average life, so can your choice of words. As Jen Sincero writes in her book, \" You Are a Badass at Making Money ,\" \"if you're broke or not where you want to be financially, you can be sure that your language could use an upgrade.\"\nCertain common phrases are particularly limiting , says Sincero, such as \"I want\" and \"I need,\" which are different ways of saying \"I lack.\" And \"I wish,\" she says, is another way of saying \"I'm not in control.\"\nInstead, start saying things like, \"I have,\" \"I create\" and \"I choose.\"\nshow chapters Rich people use these 6 mental tricks to make more money 12:09 PM ET Fri, 2 June 2017 | 01:10 4. You haven't started investing Investing is one of the simplest, most effective ways to build wealth and the sooner you start, the easier it will be to reach seven figures .\n\"On average, millionaires invest 20 percent of their household income each year. Their wealth isn't measured by the amount they make each year, but by how they've saved and invested over time,\" writes personal finance expert Ramit Sethi in his bestseller \" I Will Teach You to Be Rich .\"\nThe good news is, it's easier than ever to put your money to work. Thanks to micro-investing apps such as Acorns or Stash , you can start by simply investing your \"spare change.\" And automated investing services known as robo-advisors can work for you no matter how much you have in the bank.\nshow chapters This boss gives each new employee $500 to invest 1:59 PM ET Tue, 20 Dec 2016 | 00:49 5. You mostly stay in your comfort zone The average person wants to be comfortable. Rich people, on the other hand, are stimulated by uncertainty.\n\"Physical, psychological and emotional comfort is the primary goal of the middle-class mindset,\" Siebold writes. \"World class thinkers learn early on that becoming a millionaire isn't easy and the need for comfort can be devastating. They learn to be comfortable while operating in a state of ongoing uncertainty.\"\nshow chapters Self-made millionaire: You should work through the holidays 10:55 AM ET Thu, 9 March 2017 | 01:05 6. You think being rich is only for a lucky few If you think getting rich is out of your reach, you're probably not going to make millions. The average earner remains average because they expect to, says Siebold: \"The masses think they aren't worthy of great wealth. Who am I, they ask themselves, to become a millionaire?\"\n\"The truth is, in a capitalist country, you have every right to be rich if you're willing to create massive value for others,\" he continues.\nStart asking yourself, \"Why not me?\" After all, that's what the millionaires and billionaires do.\nThis is an update of a previously published story.\nLike this story?
