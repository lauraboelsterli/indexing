In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\nSchedules E and F of this press release provide the reconciliation of the Company’s historical non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures.\nManagement uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company’s core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company’s earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s core business. Management also believes that the non-GAAP liquidity measure free cash flow is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities.\nThe following item is included in our non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:\nAcquisition-Related Deferred Revenues: Deferred revenue related to shipments of Linear Technology products by distributors to end customers that were received by the distributors prior to the Company’s acquisition of Linear Technology. Business combination accounting principles require the write down of deferred revenue in conjunction with the acquisition. We included these revenues in our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are reflective of our ongoing financial performance.\nThe following items are excluded from our non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:\nAcquisition-Related Expenses: Expenses incurred as a result of current and prior period acquisitions and primarily include expenses associated with the fair value adjustments to inventory, property, plant and equipment and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology and customer relationships. Expenses also include severance payments, equity award accelerations and the fair value adjustment associated with the replacement of share-based awards related to the Linear Technology acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to specific transactions and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.\nAcquisition-Related Transaction Costs: Costs directly related to the Linear Technology acquisition, including legal, accounting and other professional fees, as well as integration-related costs. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.\nThe following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:\nRestructuring-Related Expense: These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, severance, and other cost reduction efforts. We excluded these expenses from our non-GAAP measures because apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.\nThe following items are excluded from our non-GAAP provision for income taxes and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:\nTax-Related Items: Tax adjustments associated with the non-GAAP items discussed above. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018 the Company recorded a $3.8 million tax benefit related to the release of a tax reserve for an expired tax year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, in relation to the provisional impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional discrete tax charge of $687 million related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings and recorded a provisional discrete tax benefit of $640 million from remeasuring its US tax liabilities at the lower 21% statutory tax rate. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company also recorded a $16.5 million discrete tax item related to the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance resulting from the Company’s acquisition of Linear Technology. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.\nThese non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Company’s use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.\nAbout Analog Devices\nAnalog Devices (Nasdaq: ADI) is the leading global high-performance analog technology company dedicated to solving the toughest engineering challenges.
