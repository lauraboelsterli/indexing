(NYSE: CXP) announced today that it has completed the sale of 222 East 41 st Street in Midtown Manhattan to Commerz Real, real assets investment manager of German Commerzbank, for a gross sales price of $332.5 million.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180529006221/en/\nColumbia Property Trust has completed the sale of Manhattan office tower 222 East 41st Street, which is fully leased to NYU Langone for 30 years, to Commerz Real for $332.5 million. (Photo: Frank Zimmerman)\nThe 390,000-square-foot Midtown East tower had been essentially fully occupied by one tenant since 2007, in a lease that was set to expire in 2016. Upon learning that the tenant would be vacating, Columbia launched a proactive and wide-ranging marketing campaign, which culminated in an innovative, 30-year lease to NYU Langone Medical Center for the entire building, with almost no downtime in occupancy.\nOriginally constructed in 2001, the 25-story office tower has been converted by NYU Langone over the past two years into a multispecialty ambulatory care facility that began accepting patients last month.\n“We were very pleased to secure an esteemed tenant on a long-term lease, which significantly increased the value of the property,” said Nelson Mills, president and chief executive officer of Columbia. “Proceeds will further strengthen our balance sheet in the near term and will eventually be recycled into higher growth investment opportunities.”\nCBRE’s Capital Markets team, including Darcy Stacom and Bill Shanahan, represented Columbia in the marketing effort and transaction.\nAbout Columbia Property Trust\nColumbia Property Trust (NYSE: CXP) owns and operates Class-A office buildings concentrated in New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. Its portfolio includes 19 properties with approximately nine million square feet. Columbia carries an investment-grade rating from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.

We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in those acts. Such statements include, in particular, statements about our share repurchase program and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” or other similar words. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. We make no representations or warranties (express or implied) about the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements contained in this press release, and we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nAny such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors and are based on a number of assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, and market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately. To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual conditions, our ability to accurately anticipate results expressed in such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, make distributions to stockholders, and maintain the value of our real estate properties, may be significantly hindered. See Item 1A in the Company's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risk factors described in our Annual Report are not the only ones we face, but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180529006221/en/\nColumbia Property Trust\nMedia:\nBud Perrone, 212-843-8068\nbperrone@rubenstein.com\nor\nInvestor Relations:\nMatt Stover, 404-465-2227\nIR@columbia.reit\nSource: Columbia Property Trust",
