    "text": "(Reuters) - Factbox on the joint North American bid by the United States, Mexico and Canada to host the 2026 World Cup, which will be decided at the FIFA Congress in Moscow on June 13.\nFILE PHOTO: Peter Montopoli, Secretary-General of the Football Association of Canada, Carlos Cordeiro, President of the United States Football Association and Decio de Maria, President of the Football Association of Mexico, attend a news conference after a meeting with the Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Faroese and Icelandic Soccer Unions to present their bid to host the Soccer World Cup 2026, in Copenhagen, Denmark, May 3, 2018. Ritzau Scanpix/Anders Kjaerbye/via REUTERS Main points of bid\n* United Bid looking to become the first World Cup to be hosted in three countries and the first since 2002 (South Korea and Japan) to be held in multiple nations.\n* The three countries would share the responsibility of hosting by staging 60 matches in the United States and 10 each in Canada and Mexico.\nThe numbers\n* World Cup in North America is projected to generate more than $5 billion in short-term economic activity, including the creation of 40,000 jobs and more than $1 billion in incremental worker earnings for the candidate host cities and countries.\n* The United Bid projects more than 5.8 million tickets will be sold, generating more than $2 billion in ticketing revenue.\nVenues proposed\n* The United Bidâ€™s prospective stadiums are situated across 23 candidate cities, from which 16 will be selected.\n* The 17 U.S. candidate cities are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington.\n* Canada (Edmonton, Montreal and Toronto) and Mexico (Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey) each have three candidate cities.\nPrevious bids\n1970 - Mexico was chosen ahead of the only other submitted bid from Argentina. The tournament was the first World Cup hosted in North America.\n1986 - Mexico became the first nation to stage the tournament twice after they replaced Colombia as the host country when the latter dropped out for financial reasons. The replacement host beat bids from Canada and the United States.\n1994 - The United States beat out Brazil and Morocco for hosting duties after one round of voting. The attendance of nearly 3.6 million remains the highest in World Cup history.\n2022 - The United States reached the fourth and final round of voting but lost to Qatar in a 14-8 vote.\nProspects\n* Canada, Mexico, and the United States require no new stadium construction to stage the 2026 World Cup.\n* Each of the stadiums included in the proposal are already built and have an average capacity of more than 68,000.\n* Each country has the full support of its respective national and local government leaders, as well as business, civic, and sports champions.\n* All candidate host cities have existing transportation, accommodation, medical, technology, and other infrastructure that meet or exceed the requirements outlined by FIFA.\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ",
