    "text": "Andrelton Simmons capped a four-run ninth inning with a two-run, go-ahead single and the visiting Los Angeles Angels came back to defeat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 Wednesday night.\nToronto reliever Tyler Clippard (4-2) loaded the bases with three walks after retiring the first batter in the ninth. Shohei Ohtani followed with a two-run single before Simmons did likewise.\nThe Blue Jays came back with a run in the bottom of the ninth against Blake Parker, who picked up his third save of the season.\nPinch hitter Dwight Smith Jr. led off with bottom of the ninth with a single and took third on a double by Curtis Granderson.\nPinch hitter Kendrys Morales hit an RBI single deep to right-center and Granderson stopped at third. Granderson was out trying to score on Teoscar Hernandez’s fly out to right.\nJosh Donaldson was intentionally walked, and Justin Smoak struck out to end the game.\nJustin Anderson (1-1) pitched around a walk in the bottom of the eighth to pick up the win.\nThe teams have split the first two games of the three-game\nseries.\nDevon Travis and Yangervis Solarte homered for Toronto.\nToronto starter Aaron Sanchez allowed no runs, two hits and five walks and had two strikeouts in five innings.\nAngels starter Tyler Skaggs allowed three runs, six hits and two hit batsmen while striking out six in five innings.\nTravis, recalled from Triple-A Buffalo on Tuesday, hit his second homer of the season with two out in the third inning.\nSolarte gave Toronto a 2-0 lead with one out in the bottom of the fourth on his 11th homer of the season.\nThe Blue Jays scored once in the fifth. With two outs, Donaldson doubled, Smoak was hit by a pitch and Solarte hit an RBI single.\nJohn Axford allowed sixth-inning singles by Simmons, Zack Cozart and Martin Maldonado, cutting the lead to 3-1.\nSeunghwan Oh replaced Axford. Cozart was thrown out trying for third after left fielder Curtis Granderson missed the catch on Kole Calhoun’s drive. Granderson recovered to make the throw to third.\nIan Kinsler struck out and Mike Trout singled to left, but Calhoun was thrown out at third for the third out before Maldonado crossed the plate.\nAngels reliever Jim Johnson was perfect in the sixth and seventh innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
