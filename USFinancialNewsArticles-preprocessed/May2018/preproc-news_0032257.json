    "text": "ATLANTA, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DLH Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: DLHC) (\"DLH\" or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of innovative healthcare services and solutions to federal agencies, today announced financial results for its fiscal second quarter and the six months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nSecond quarter revenue of $34.4 million, up 15.0% over the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Income from operations of $2.2 million for the quarter versus $1.8 million in 2017 Diluted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter versus $0.08 per share in the prior-year period Generated operating cash flow of $4.4 million for the quarter Reduced senior debt to $14.9 million at quarter end\nManagement Discussion\n\"We're pleased to announce that the second quarter delivered significantly improved financial results,\" stated DLH President and Chief Executive Officer Zach Parker. \"Revenue for the period was up 15% year-over-year, as we executed at peak activity levels on key programs – driving sales to over $34 million for the first time since our corporate transformation. Income from operations rose 20%, and operating cash flow of $4.4 million demonstrated the strong underlying performance of our business, leveraging legacy net operating losses to offset the majority of the Company's tax expense.\n\"Recent budget decisions in Washington underscore the government's commitment to key agencies that oversee healthcare, our veterans, and military personnel, including the programs where we participate as well as areas targeted for growth. We believe these budget priorities support our strategies for both organic and acquisitive expansion across the important segments we serve. We continue to broaden and strengthen our capabilities, and we believe that our dedication to excellence in service delivery – combined with our enduring, long-term customer relationships – will allow us to achieve our growth goals.\"\nResults for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $34.4 million, up $4.5 million, or 15.0%, over the prior-year second quarter, reflecting the expansion of services on existing contract vehicles and contribution from new contract awards.\nGross profit was $7.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $1.0 million, or 16.4%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017. As a percent of revenue, the Company's gross margin was 21.7% versus 21.4% in the prior-year period. General and Administrative (\"G&A\") expenses were $4.7 million for the quarter versus $4.0 million in fiscal 2017. As a percent of revenue, G&A expenses were 13.6% in the current fiscal first quarter versus 13.4% last year. Depreciation and amortization was $0.6 million in both fiscal year second quarters.\nIncome from operations was $2.2 million for the quarter versus $1.8 million in the prior-year period. This increase reflects gross profit improvement of $1.0 million, partially offset by the higher G&A expenses noted above. Income before taxes was $1.9 million for the quarter, up approximately $0.4 million over the prior-year period.\nFor both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, DLH recorded a $0.6 million provision for tax expense. The effective tax rates were 31.6% and 38.2% for the fiscal second quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, reflecting the prorated impact of the tax rate reduction from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.\nThe Company reported net income for the second quarter of approximately $1.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, versus $1.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. On a non-GAAP basis, Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $2.8 million versus $2.4 million in the prior-year period. Growth was attributable to increased revenue and gross profit, partially offset by additional G&A expenses as described above.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nCash as of March 31, 2018 was $3.6 million, and the Company's senior debt was $14.9 million, versus cash of $4.9 million and senior debt of $19.7 million as of September 30, 2017. Regarding cash flow, for the fiscal second quarter DLH generated approximately $4.4 million in cash from operations, based primarily on effective collections of accounts receivable.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") as a supplemental non-GAAP measure of our performance. DLH defines EBITDA as net income excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) provision for or benefit from income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization.\nBeginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company commenced reporting EBITDA, rather than adjusted EBITDA, as a key non-GAAP financial measure of our business. The Company believes that due to the growth and maturation of its business, this change will improve the transparency of its business performance and increase the comparability of its results with peers. Non-GAAP measures for prior periods have been recast to conform to this change in the Company's reporting. It is important to note that GAAP results and the presentation of GAAP metrics do not change, and the reporting of EBITDA has no effect on the Company's business nor how the business is managed.\nThese non-GAAP measures of performance are used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods presented. Management and the Company's Board utilize these non-GAAP measures to make decisions about the use of the Company's resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. DLH believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the Company's historical performance. By providing this non-GAAP measure as a supplement to GAAP information, DLH believes this enhances investors' understanding of its business and results of operations.\nReconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure:\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\n2018\n2017\nChange\nNet income (loss)\n$\n1,316\n$\n979\n$\n337\n$\n(1,535)\n$\n1,303\n$\n(2,838)\n(i) Interest expense\n261\n255\n6\n539\n619\n(80)\n(ii) Provision for taxes\n627\n605\n22\n4,346\n806\n3,540\n(iii) Depreciation and amortization\n560\n554\n6\n1,066\n755\n311\nEBITDA\n$\n2,764\n$\n2,393\n$\n371\n$\n4,416\n$\n3,483\n$\n933\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nDLH management will discuss second quarter results during a conference call beginning at 11:00 AM Eastern Time tomorrow, May 16, 2018.
