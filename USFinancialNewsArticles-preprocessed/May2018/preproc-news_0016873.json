Best of all, we are now in the position to offer more software choices, tools, and resources to support our new customers in the Midwest.”\nCimtronics Midwest President, Jim Lemke agrees, “The way we work with our clients is very similar to the Hawk Ridge Systems approach.

That means we will be able to offer more solutions to help solve our clients’ critical business challenges. To be a part of the Hawk Ridge Systems family is a win for our clients, our team, and our partners.”\nThe combined company serves 18,500 customers from 20 offices and has 210 employees.
