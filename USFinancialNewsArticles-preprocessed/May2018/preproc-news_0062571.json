Susan Mullane-USA TODAY Sports 1700 DEL POTRO ADVANCES\nFifth seed Juan Martin del Potro struck 44 winners on his way to a 6-4 6-3 6-2 victory over French veteran Julien Benneteau, who made his final appearance at his home Grand Slam.\n“It wasn’t easy for me to play a guy like Julien in Paris,” Del Potro said. “I’m so proud of him, he made a fantastic career. I should stop speaking, it’s Julien’s time.” 1645 SCHWARTZMAN SAILS THROUGH\nBig-hitting Argentine Diego Schwartzman, seeded 11th, continued his steady progress with a 6-1 6-3 6-1 win over Czech Adam Pavlasek in the second round. 1555 RAFA BREEZES PAST PELLA\nTop seed Rafa Nadal, chasing his 11th title at Roland Garros, marched into the third round with a 6-2 6-1 6-1 win over Argentine Guido Pella.\nNadal will next face Frenchman Richard Gasquet who the Spaniard has beaten in all their previous 15 meetings.\n“Richard is a good friend, I’ve known him since we were 11, 12 years old,” the Spaniard said. “It’s the most important court (Philippe Chatrier) of my career without a doubt, and for him a special place too.” 1515 HALEP RACES INTO ROUND THREE\nWorld number one Simona Halep was not playing her best tennis but still found a way past American Taylor Townsend 6-3 6-1.\nThe Romanian, twice runner-up at Roland Garros, will meet Andrea Petkovic of Germany in the third round.\n1505 POUILLE READY FOR “SPECIAL” KHACHANOV CLASH\nHome favourite Lucas Pouille held off a spirited comeback from Briton Cameron Norrie to beat him 6-2 6-4 5-7 7-6(3).\nPouille will next face Russian Karen Khachanov, who teamed up with the French number one for doubles action in Madrid and Rotterdam this season.\n“It’s quite special. But we’re used to it, because we know each other,” Pouille told reporters.\n“So I don’t think it’s going to be very different from the other matches. And it’s true that we train a lot together. We played doubles together in Marseille and Dubai practically back to back with four days in between.\n“It’s going to be a difficult match. He’s a very good player. He’s in full progression and very confident.”\nKhachanov edged Pouille over three sets during their last meeting in the final at Marseille in February. 1445 SHARAPOVA OVERCOMES TRICKY VEKIC TEST\nTwo-time champion Maria Sharapova needed five match points to see off Croatia’s Donna Vekic 7-5 6-4 in the second round.\nThe Russian will next face sixth seed Karolina Pliskova, who beat fellow Czech Lucie Safarova 3-6 6-4 6-1. 1330 EDMUND ADVANCES\nKyle Edmund, the last Briton standing in the singles, recovered from a mid-match blip to beat Hungarian Marton Fucsovics 6-0 1-6 6-2 6-3.\n“(The second set) is something to learn from but I’m happy to come through,” Edmund said.\n“When I’m playing at my best it’s very good but I can’t play like that the whole time. When I’m not playing my best, I have to find a way to win. This year I’ve done that a lot better.”\nEdmund will face 18th seed Italian Fabio Fognini in the third round. 1300 SHAPOVALOV DISAPPOINTED BUT NOT DISHEARTENED\nCanadian teenager Denis Shapovalov was disappointed after his French Open debut ended in the second round but he remains pleased with the progress made this season.\n“Not every week is going to be the same,” he said after a 5-7 7-6(4) 7-5 6-4 defeat to Germany’s Maximilian Marterer.\n“You run into guys that are playing well, playing hot. You know, in Madrid it was me; today it was Max.\n“Obviously I’m disappointed with the loss, but like I said, I’m only 19, so not every week is going to be a semifinals of, you know, of a big tournament.” 1240 CILIC BOOKS THIRD ROUND SPOT\nThird seed Marin Cilic experienced a difficult test after wasting a match point in the third set against qualifier Hubert Hurkacz, but did enough to win 6-2 6-2,6-7(3) 7-5.\nThe Croat will next face American Steve Johnson, who also needed four sets to beat Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff. 1040 MERTENS DOWNS WATSON\nBelgium’s 16th seed Elise Mertens cruised past Britain’s Heather Watson 6-3 6-4 to match her best Roland Garros performance by reaching the third round for the second year in a row. 1035 MUGURUZA EASES PAST FERRO\nFormer champion Garbine Muguruza, seeded third, looked in fine form as she eased past French wildcard Fiona Ferro 6-4 6-3.\n“The French Open is ‘that’ tournament for me, it’s special, I’m so motivated and I’m so happy,” Muguruza, the 2016 winner, said after the match.\nShe moves into the third round for the fifth consecutive year, where she will face 2010 runner-up Samantha Stosur of Australia.
