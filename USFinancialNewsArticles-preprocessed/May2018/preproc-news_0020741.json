    "text": "Evans recognized for her contributions to community anchor institutions and formal and informal education\nWASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Internet2 today announced that Sherilyn Shiotsu Evans , senior vice president and chief operating officer at CENIC , is this year’s winner of the Richard Rose Award . The award honors educators or technologists who have made demonstrable impacts on the formal and informal education community by extending advanced networking, content, and services to community anchors nationwide.\nIn her current role, Evans oversees CENIC's internal operations, both technical and non-technical, and represents the organization externally to the global advanced networking community. She joined CENIC in 2000, initially providing leadership to the Digital California Project, which extended broadband connectivity to K-12 schools in California. Prior to joining CENIC, Evans enjoyed a successful 20-year career at the University of California, serving on the IT management team at the UC Office of the President.\nCENIC President and CEO Louis Fox recalls first working with Evans on the Pacific Lighthouse project in the late 1990s. “Sherilyn's idea was to take advantage of cultural repositories, often stored at universities, of video and audio recordings, photographs, and other media that could be digitized, organized, and shared with a broad education audience,” said Fox. “The appetite for this information among our institutions was remarkable. Several teachers were engaged to create curriculum materials for social studies classes at middle and high schools. We then extended this model into science and technology with similar organizations like the Exploratorium and the Pacific Science Center.”\nEvan’s lifetime of leadership and accomplishment in support of community anchor institutions is unprecedented in its breadth and depth. Her outreach work extends beyond K-20 institutions to rural communities in California, Washington, Montana, and British Columbia.\nThe Rose Award is named in honor of Richard Rose, who was an early leader in the national Internet2 K-20 Initiative, now the Internet2 Community Anchor Program. It is given annually based on criteria such as commitment to the mission and vision of the Internet2 Community Anchor Program, recognized innovation in the community, and leadership and mentoring qualities.\nAbout Internet2\nInternet2’s core infrastructure components include the nation’s largest and fastest research and education network that was built to deliver advanced, customized services that are accessed and secured by the community-developed trust and identity framework.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508005590/en/\nInternet2\nSara Aly\nsaly@internet2.edu\nSource: Internet2",
