    "text": "Kevin Lamarque | Reuters Donald Trump\nPresident Donald Trump said on Sunday he would demand an investigation into whether the FBI had placed surveillance on his 2016 campaign — and whether such activity was ordered by his members of the Obama administration.\nRamping up a public war of words between the Oval Office and the law enforcement agency, the president said that he would formally request the Department of Justice probe the FBI's role in investigating his campaign. His remarks come amid reports that the agency had placed a confidential informant somewhere in the Trump campaign's orbit, while he was a still candidate. Trump tweet\nTrump's assertions of a mole, either inside or outside his campaign, have yet to be confirmed. On Saturday, The New York Times reported that FBI agents sent an informant to talk to two Trump campaign advisers, after receiving evidence that they had made contacts linked to Russia during the campaign that were deemed suspicious.\nOn separate occasions, the unnamed operative met with George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, The Times noted. Trump has attempted to cast the source as a spy.\nTrump's implication of Barack Obama , also renews a fight the president picked early in his tenure with his predecessor. In March of 2017, Trump boldly asserted that Obama of ordering surveillance of Trump's residence during the 2016 campaign — an accusation which the former president flatly denied. The FBI, then led by James Comey, said there was no information to support the claim.\nLast week, Trump reacted to the suggestion of potential FBI spying as being \"bigger than Watergate.\" Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported this week that allies close to the president were working to expose the source . Trump big deal\nTrump and the FBI have been locked in an unprecedented public battle. The president and his allies have long complained about a \"deep state\" agenda of government officials actively working to undermine his presidency.\nIn an interview with The Post last week, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani — Trump's personal lawyer — accused law enforcement officials of \"covering\" for actions committed by the Obama administration.\nMeanwhile, Giuliani told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published Sunday that the president shouldn't consent to an interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the probe into alleged ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, unless the role of a suspected FBI informant was made clear.",
