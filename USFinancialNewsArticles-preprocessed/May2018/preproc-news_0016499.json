    "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Turning Point Brands, Inc. (NYSE:TPB), a leading provider of Other Tobacco Products (“OTP”), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results at a Glance\n(Comparisons vs. same period year-ago)\nNet sales increased 10.7% to $73.9 million Gross profit increased 15.0% to $31.8 million Net income was $3.0 million Adjusted EBITDA was $13.7 million (see Schedule A for a reconciliation to net income) Diluted EPS of $0.15 and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.35 as compared to $0.10 and $0.26, respectively (see Schedule D for a reconciliation to diluted EPS) Other highlights from the first quarter: Stoker’s increased retail market share in both Moist Snuff Tobacco (“MST”) and chewing tobacco 1 New Zig-Zag Hemp cigarette papers were launched in the U.S. VaporBeast posted its strongest quarterly net sales to date on continued executional improvements, driving record NewGen net sales and gross profit\n1 Based on data from Management Science Associates, Inc. (“MSAi”), which administers a proprietary information system that captures sales from approximately 1,000 wholesalers to over 250,000 retailers.\nRecent Events\nOn April 30, 2018, TPB announced the acquisition of the Vapor Supply LLC assets and its related subsidiaries for total consideration of $4.8 million. For the latest twelve months ending December 31, 2017, Vapor Supply had net sales and gross profit of approximately $33 million and $6 million, respectively. After rationalization of inventory, TPB expects an annual sales rate of approximately $25-$28 million. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and is immediately earnings accretive.\nOn May 8, 2018, the TPB board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share which will be paid on July 13, 2018, to shareholders of record on the close of business on June 22, 2018.\nManagement Observations on the First Quarter 2018\n“Our performance in 2018 is off to a strong start, demonstrating the efficacy of our strategic plan and our continued focus on augmenting organic growth with thoughtful acquisitions,” said Wexler. “We are excited to supplement our focus brands, Stoker’s in Smokeless, Zig-Zag in Smoking, and VaporBeast in NewGen, with the additional firepower inherent in the Vapor Supply acquisition.”\nSmokeless Products Segment (28% of total net sales in the quarter)\nFor the first quarter, Smokeless products net sales increased 2.5% to $20.7 million on the continuing growth of Stoker’s MST. In the quarter, total Smokeless segment volume increased 0.4% and price/mix increased 2.1%.\nYear-over-year industry volumes for chewing tobacco declined by approximately 7% in the quarter, while industry MST 2 volumes were soft by approximately 1% to year-ago, according to MSAi. Stoker’s outpaced the smokeless industry in the quarter, growing its MSAi share in both chewing tobacco and MST. Stoker’s MST cases shipped in the quarter rose by greater than 10%.\nFor the quarter, gross profit for the Smokeless segment increased 18.7% to $11.0 million. Segment gross margin expanded 730 basis points to 53.0% due to product mix, price increases and LIFO expense. Absent LIFO expense in both quarters, gross profit increased by 5.4% and gross margin expanded by 140 basis points to 52.7%.\n2 TPB measures industry MST volumes excluding pouch and snus products.\nSmoking Products Segment (37% of total net sales in the quarter)\nFor the first quarter, net sales of Smoking products decreased $0.2 million to $27.0 million. Cigarette paper sales in the quarter were up $1.0 million, offset by a $1.2 million decrease related to our decision to deemphasize the low margin cigar products business and our previously announced line rationalization of MYO tobacco. In the quarter, Smoking products volume decreased 0.3%, while price/mix decreased 0.4%.\nIn the quarter, Zig-Zag retained its share leadership position in both premium cigarette papers and MYO cigar wraps, while also expanding new paper products in the dynamic and developing Canadian marketplace. New Zig-Zag Hemp cigarette papers were launched in the U.S. late in the first quarter.\nAccording to MSAi, first quarter industry volumes for U.S. cigarette papers decreased by low-single-digits, while industry MYO cigar wraps continued to produce double-digit category expansion.\nSmoking products gross profit for the quarter was down $0.5 million to $13.2 million due largely to an adverse year-over-year euro exchange rate impact of $0.8 million. Gross margin decreased to 48.8% compared with 50.4% for the year-ago quarter due principally to adverse exchange rates.\nNewGen (New Generation) Products Segment (35% of total net sales in the quarter)\nFor the first quarter, NewGen segment net sales grew 35.3% to a record $26.2 million on continued VaporBeast momentum.\nGross profit for the NewGen segment increased by $2.9 million over the year-ago quarter to a record $7.7 million. Gross margin for the quarter expanded by 490 basis points to 29.2%, compared to the year-ago quarter.\nFor the quarter, VaporBeast’s key sales performance metrics indicate continued progress against our goal to grow sales in the existing store base, as evidenced by increases in both order sizes and order frequency. Additionally, operational improvements at Vapor Shark have strengthened sales performance in both the company and franchise branded stores. The Vapor Shark e-liquid manufacturing integration into our Louisville facility remains on-track for completion by the end of the second quarter.\n“As we move into the second and third quarters, we will focus on properly integrating the Vapor Supply enterprise, with an eye toward identifying and releasing improved operational effectiveness and financial synergies,” said Wexler. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to onboard new acquisitions and to plug them into our established platform serving both the NewGen and tobacco markets.”\nOther Performance Measures\nFirst quarter 2018 gross profit included:\nNew product launch costs of $0.6 million compared to $0.1 million in the first quarter a year-ago; and Line rationalization expenses of $0.4 million\nFirst quarter 2018 consolidated SG&A expenses were $22.1 million compared to $16.8 million in 2017 due primarily to the inclusion of the Vapor Shark SG&A, higher legal and litigation expenses associated with the previously announced anti-counterfeiting initiative, line rationalization costs, non-recurring departmental reorganization expenses and a meaningful increase in VaporBeast net sales, which drives certain variable SG&A expenses.\nCertain components of 2018 first quarter SG&A were as follows:\nLine rationalization expenses of $0.6 million; Non-recurring expenses associated with the finance department reorganization were $0.6 million; Strategic expenses were $0.6 million compared to $0.3 million in the year-ago period; and Launch cost expenses in SG&A were $0.1 million compared to $0.5 million a year-ago\nAbsent the immediately aforementioned charges, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 27.2%.\nInterest expense for the quarter dropped to $3.7 million, which is $1.3 million, or 25.9%, lower than the year-ago period. The reduction is principally attributable to lower interest rates as a result of first quarter 2017 and 2018 refinancings in conjunction with lower debt levels as compared to 2017. As previously announced, on March 7, 2018, we refinanced our credit facility. The amended $250 million facility consists of a $160 million first lien term loan, a $40 million second lien term loan and a $50 million cash flow revolver. The existing $40 million accordion feature was retained.\nThe amendment reduces our blended interest rate and is expected to reduce annual interest expense by approximately $2.0 million on an interest rate risk adjusted basis. As part of the refinancing, we executed various interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $70 million, reducing our exposure to floating interest rates. Management will continue to evaluate attractive opportunities to reduce interest expense and manage risk.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt associated with our March 2018 refinancing was $2.4 million compared to $6.1 million in the prior year.\nFor the quarter, fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 19.8 million.\nFirst quarter 2018 diluted EPS was $0.15 while Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.35 (see Schedule D for reconciliation). We have initiated reporting Adjusted diluted EPS to align with our historical Adjusted EBITDA reporting. Please see schedule D for a historical reconciliation of Adjusted diluted EPS.\nFirst quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $13.7 million was up 0.5% to the year-ago period (See Schedule A for a reconciliation).\nCapital expenditures in the first quarter 2018 totaled $0.4 million.\nTotal debt at March 31, 2018 was $198.2 million. Net debt at March 31, 2018 was $194.4 million, compared to $199.4 million as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $5.0 million. Net debt at March 31, 2018 to Adjusted EBITDA was 3.2x (see Schedule C for a reconciliation).\n2018 Outlook Update\nAs previously announced, and based upon the current understanding of the 2018 FDA schedule, the company has identified products for 2018 rationalization and estimates that SKU discontinuations will unfavorably impact year-over-year net sales by approximately $3.5 million. Total line rationalization expenses in the first quarter were $1 million. We continue to evaluate our portfolio for potential additional SKU eliminations. Recognizing the Vapor Supply transaction and absent any other acquisitions and net of the above-mentioned SKU rationalizations, the company now anticipates 2018 net sales growth of 12% to 16%.\nExcluding any acquisition related expenses, SG&A as a percent of net sales for the full year is expected to be in the 25% to 27% range. Interest expense is currently expected to be $14 million, which includes $1 million non-cash deferred financing charges.\nNew product launch costs, including the $0.7 million recorded in the first quarter, are estimated to be approximately $1.9 million for the year.\nThe company expects a 2018 effective income tax rate to be 24%, down from the previously announced 26% to 27%. Net operating losses, or NOLs, available to offset federal income taxes amounted to approximately $14.4 million at March 31, 2018. We expect to fully utilize these NOLs during 2018 when we will begin paying cash federal income taxes.\nCapital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be on the lower end of the previously announced $2 to $3 million, due to capacity synergies from the Vapor Supply acquisition. These expenditures include one-time investments associated with logistics efficiency and integration activities.\nEarnings Conference Call\nAs previously disclosed, a conference call with the investment community to review TPB’s financial results has been scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday, May 9, 2018. Investment community participants should dial in ten minutes ahead of time using the toll free number 844-889-4324 (International participants should call 412-317-9262). A live listen-only webcast of the call is available from the Events and Presentations section of the investor relations portion of the company website ( www.turningpointbrands.com ). A replay of the webcast will be available on the site one hour following the call.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, Net Debt and Gross Profit excluding LIFO. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures accompanies this release.\nAbout Turning Point Brands, Inc.\nLouisville, Kentucky-based Turning Point Brands, Inc.

Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to:\ndeclining sales of tobacco products, and expected continuing decline of sales, in the tobacco industry overall; our dependence on a small number of third-party suppliers and producers; the possibility that we will be unable to identify or contract with new suppliers or producers in the event of a supply or product disruption; the possibility that our licenses to use certain brands or trademarks will be terminated, challenged or restricted; failure to maintain consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our customers; substantial and increasing U.S. regulation; regulation of our products by the FDA, which has broad regulatory powers; uncertainty related to the regulation and taxation of our NewGen products; possible significant increases in federal, state and local municipal tobacco-related taxes; possible increasing international control and regulation; our reliance on relationships with several large retailers and national chains for distribution of our products; our amount of indebtedness; the terms of our credit facilities, which may restrict our current and future operations; intense competition and our ability to compete effectively; uncertainty and continued evolution of markets containing our NewGen products; significant product liability litigation; the scientific community’s lack of information regarding the long-term health effects of electronic cigarettes, vaporizer and e-liquid use; requirement to maintain compliance with master settlement agreement escrow account; competition from illicit sources; our reliance on information technology; security and privacy breaches; contamination of our tobacco supply or products; infringement on our intellectual property; third-party claims that we infringe on their intellectual property; failure to manage our growth; failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions or otherwise be unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions; fluctuations in our results; exchange rate fluctuations; adverse U.S. and global economic conditions; sensitivity of end-customers to increased sales taxes and economic conditions; failure to comply with certain regulations; departure of key management personnel or our inability to attract and retain talent; imposition of significant tariffs on imports into the U.S.; reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors, potentially decreasing our stock price; failure to maintain our status as an emerging growth company before the five-year maximum time period a company may retain such status; our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders and may take certain actions to prevent takeovers; our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law and certain regulations, could discourage or prohibit acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock; our certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of our common stock by individuals and entities that are Restricted Investors. These restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in Restricted Investors being required to sell or redeem their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution rights; future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us; we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock; and our status as a “controlled company” could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nFinancial statements follow:\nTurning Point Brands, Inc.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, Net Debt and Gross Profit excluding LIFO are used by management to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes and is presented to our board of directors. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS and Gross Profit excluding LIFO are appropriate measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance.\nWe define “EBITDA” as net income before interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income before interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items and other items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define “Adjusted diluted EPS” as diluted earnings per share excluding items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define “Net Debt” as total debt less cash. We define “Gross Profit excluding LIFO” as gross profit less LIFO charges.\nNon-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted diluted EPS exclude significant expenses that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate this non-U.S. GAAP measure differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nIn accordance with SEC rules, we have provided, in the supplemental information attached, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the next directly comparable GAAP measures.\nSchedule A Turning Point Brands, Inc.
