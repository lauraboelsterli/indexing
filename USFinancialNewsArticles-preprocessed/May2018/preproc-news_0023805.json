Net Income Per Share increased 32%, Operating Adjusted Net Income Per Share increased 32% and Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% over the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nCARMEL, Ind., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KAR Auction Services, Inc. (NYSE:KAR), today reported its first quarter financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018. For the first quarter of 2018, the company reported revenue of $950.5 million as compared with revenue of $866.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 10%. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 increased 30% to $90.0 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, as compared with net income of $69.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 9% to $229.4 million, as compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $210.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Operating adjusted net income per diluted share increased 32% to $0.82 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared with operating adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.62 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\n“We are pleased with our solid first quarter performance and consolidated results,” said Jim Hallett, chairman and CEO of KAR Auction Services, Inc. “We remain focused on growing our core business, advancing our strategic priorities, and evolving our business to meet the ongoing changes in our industry.”\n2018 Outlook\nKAR Auction Services' previously stated outlook remains unchanged.\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Annual\nGuidance Net income $329.0 - $349.7 Income tax expense $115.6 - $122.9 Interest expense, net of interest income $191 Depreciation and amortization $268 EBITDA $903.6 - $931.6 Addbacks, net ($8.6) - ($6.6) Adjusted EBITDA $895 - $925 Capital expenditures $185 Cash taxes $125 Cash interest on corporate debt $130 Free cash flow $455 - $485 Effective tax rate 26% Net income per share $2.40 - $2.55 Operating adjusted net income per share $2.89 - $3.04 Weighted average diluted shares 137 Earnings guidance does not contemplate future items such as business development activities, strategic developments (such as restructurings, spin-offs or dispositions of assets or investments), gains/losses associated with step acquisitions, significant expenses related to litigation and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting and tax matters). The timing and amounts of these items are highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a potential size that could have a substantial impact on the company’s reported results for any given period. Prospective quantification of these items is generally not practicable. Forward-looking non-GAAP guidance excludes amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, as well as one-time charges, net of taxes. See reconciliations of the company's guidance on pages 8 and 9.\nDividend Announcement\nThe company announced a cash dividend today of $0.35 per share on the company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on July 5, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 21, 2018.\nPotential Spin-off\nOn February 27, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a plan to pursue the separation of its salvage auction business through a spin-off, creating a new independent, publicly traded company. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to shareholders and should be completed within 12 months from the announcement date, subject to customary regulatory approvals, the execution of intercompany agreements between the Company and the new salvage auction company, final approval of the board of directors and other customary matters.\nEarnings Conference Call Information\nKAR Auction Services, Inc. will be hosting an earnings conference call and webcast on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 a.m. CDT).

They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these measures provide investors additional meaningful methods to evaluate certain aspects of the company’s results period over period and for the other reasons set forth below.\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense net of interest income, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings as described in our senior secured credit agreement covenant calculations. Free cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense on corporate debt (Credit Facility), capital expenditures and cash taxes related to the calendar year. Management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors. In addition, management uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to evaluate our performance.\nDepreciation expense for property and equipment and amortization expense of capitalized internally developed software costs relate to ongoing capital expenditures; however, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, such as customer relationships, software, tradenames and noncompete agreements are not representative of ongoing capital expenditures, but have a continuing effect on our reported results. Non-GAAP financial measures of operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share, in the opinion of the company, provide comparability of the company's performance to other companies that may not have incurred these types of non-cash expenses or that report a similar measure. In addition, operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share may include adjustments for certain other charges.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under GAAP. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, ( in millions ), ( unaudited ) 2018 2017 Net income $ 90.0 $ 69.2 Add back: Income taxes 26.4 34.1 Interest expense, net of interest income 41.3 40.2 Depreciation and amortization 70.3 64.5 EBITDA 228.0 208.0 Non-cash stock-based compensation 6.7 6.0 Acquisition related costs 2.2 2.1 Securitization interest (11.4 ) (8.1 ) Minority interest — 1.7 Severance 1.5 0.7 Other 2.4 0.2 Total addbacks 1.4 2.6 Adjusted EBITDA $ 229.4 $ 210.6 The following table reconciles operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share to net income and net income per share for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, ( in millions, except per share amounts ), ( unaudited) 2018 2017 Net income $ 90.0 $ 69.2 Acquired amortization expense 26.9 25.2 Income taxes (1) (6.1 ) (8.3 ) Operating adjusted net income $ 110.8 $ 86.1 Net income per share – diluted $ 0.66 $ 0.50 Acquired amortization expense 0.20 0.18 Income taxes (0.04 ) (0.06 ) Operating adjusted net income per share – diluted $ 0.82 $ 0.62 Weighted average diluted shares 135.8 138.3 (1) The effective tax rate at the end of each period presented was used to determine the amount of income tax on the adjustments to net income.\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to net income for the 2018 guidance presented:\n2018 Outlook ( in millions ), ( unaudited ) Low High Net income $ 329.0 $ 349.7 Add back: Income tax expense 115.6 122.9 Interest expense, net of interest income 191.0 191.0 Depreciation and amortization 268.0 268.0 EBITDA 903.6 931.6 Total addbacks, net (8.6 ) (6.6 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 895.0 $ 925.0 Cash interest expense on corporate debt (130.0 ) (130.0 ) Capital expenditures (185.0 ) (185.0 ) Cash taxes related to calendar year (125.0 ) (125.0 ) Free cash flow $ 455.0 $ 485.0 The following table reconciles operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share to net income and net income per share for the 2018 guidance presented:\n2018 Outlook ( in millions, except per share amounts ), ( unaudited) Low High Net income $ 329.0 $ 349.7 Acquired amortization expense 90.0 90.0 Income taxes (23.4 ) (23.4 ) Operating adjusted net income $ 395.6 $ 416.3 Net income per share – diluted $ 2.40 $ 2.55 Acquired amortization expense 0.66 0.66 Income taxes (0.17 ) (0.17 ) Operating adjusted net income per share – diluted $ 2.89 $ 3.04 Weighted average diluted shares 137 137\nAnalyst Inquiries: Media Inquiries: Mike Eliason Gene Rodriguez (317) 249-4559 (317) 343-5243 mike.eliason@karauctionservices.com gene.rodriguez@karauctionservices.com\nSource:KAR Auction Services, Inc.",
