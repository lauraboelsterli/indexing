    "text": "NEW YORK, Staffing 360 Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq:STAF), (“STAF 360” or “the Company”), a staffing solutions company executing an international buy-and-build strategy in the U.S. and the U.K., today announced its financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 (Q1 2018):\nQ1 2018 Highlights:\nRevenue grew by 37% to $55.8 million Gross profit grew by 58% to $11.6 million Gross margin strengthened to 20.8% Net loss decreased to $1.3 million Adjusted EBITDA grew by 57% to $1.6 million\nBrendan Flood, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, “Q1 2018 was another record revenue quarter for STAF 360. During the quarter, not only did we significantly increase our revenue, we also improved efficiency, removed duplicative overhead costs across businesses, expanded our higher margin (temporary-hire) business segment sales team by 15 professionals, and improved cross-segment / cross-border cooperation between business segments, which resulted in 58% gross profits improvement and a substantial decrease in our net loss. This was achieved despite the first quarter historically being the weakest quarter of the year, due to seasonality and weather issues. Additionally, following the refinancing of our borrowing we improved our financial position and cash flow.”\nMr. Flood added, “As we continue to execute on our business plan, we expect to see similar growth in the second quarter and we are confident that 2018, will be a year of profitable enterprise-wide growth .\nResults for Q1 2018 are as follows:\nQ1 2018 revenue of $55.8 million, an increase of 37% from the $40.7 million reported for the three months ended April 1, 2017 (“Q1 2017”). Included in the Q1 2018 revenue is $17.9 million from acquisitions completed in September 2017, $0.8 million from favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by the impact of low margin business that we exited in Fiscal 2017. In addition, in Q1 2018 we were impacted by weather-related stoppages primarily for our Northeast clients. Q1 2018 gross profit of $11.6 million, a 58% increase from the $7.3 million reported for Q1 2017. Q1 2018 gross margin improved to 20.8% from 18.0% for Q1 2017. The gross margin improvement, reflects our continued strategy to exit low margin business, the acquisition of two higher margin businesses, the strengthening of our permanent placement business, and the continued improvements in our workers compensation insurance costs. Q1 2018 net loss of $1.3 million, a substantial improvement as compared to a net loss of $3.1 million reported for Q1 2017. Q1 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million, an increase of 57% as compared to $1.0 million for Q1 2017. Pro Forma trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 million; this includes adjusted EBITDA of the two acquired companies prior to September 2017.\nIn addition, Brendan Flood, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David Faiman, Chief Financial Officer, of STAF 360, will host a conference call focusing on financial results, recent business developments and growth initiatives, today at 9:00am Eastern Time.
