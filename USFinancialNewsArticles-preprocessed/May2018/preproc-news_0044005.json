    "text": "By Michael Connor NEW YORK, May 22 (Reuters) - The buoyant U.S. dollar is not as robust as it should be and looks vulnerable to a sharp drop in value against other major currencies, veteran currency strategist Steven Englander said on Tuesday during an interview in the Reuters Global Markets Forum. Englander, an economist at Rafiki Capital Investment Management in New York, also said the US Federal Reserve would like to see the U.S. corporations that are announcing massive share buybacks switch their focus to capital investment. Buybacks are now running at record highs, topping $6 billion each quarter. The following are edited excerpts: Question: The dollar is riding up since mid-April and testing highs in foreign exchange markets. What are your expectations for the U.S. dollar? Answer: On the dollar, given the stimulus and the positioning and the bad news on Europe, it is a bad sign that it has responded so little. Everything's going right for the dollar, and JPY (the Japanese yen) is barely at 110, EUR (Euro) $1.18. If European growth picks up, and if U.S. data moderates, it will probably fall quickly. Q: Won't the large positive differences between high U.S. rates and others encourage demand for the dollar? A: It looks like real rate differentials matter more than normal, and those differentials are not widening as much. But more broadly, sluggish response to rates suggests that a lot is priced in already; there is a \"show me\" attitude among many investors. Q: Some of the demand for U.S. dollars in recent months comes from U.S. corporations bringing overseas profits back to America under the president's tax plan, but much of that money is going to dividend increases and share buybacks, instead of spending on infrastructure and new factories. Is that a negative, as far as Federal Reserve policymakers go? A: The Fed would be happy to see buybacks stagnate. Buybacks help the economy through a wealth effect, and that has not been very powerful. They are hoping that capital investment replaces buybacks. So far, investment is very good but not booming. I doubt they will get involved, except to praise investment. (Reporting by Michael Connor; editing by Daniel Bases) )\n ",
