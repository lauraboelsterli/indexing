Dowd, chief executive officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International. “She serves as a valuable mentor to men and women in our organization, as well as to clients in need of expert investment advice and guidance. We congratulate Paulina on this recognition from Money Management Executive .”\nMs. Mejia, who joined Fiduciary Trust last year, is responsible for overseeing and growing the firm’s private wealth business in the Greater New York region.
