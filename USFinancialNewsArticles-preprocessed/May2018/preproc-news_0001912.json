    "text": "If Trump answers Mueller's questions, it will 'end his presidency' Andrew Stoltmann, attorney â€¢ May 1, 2018 Dozens of questions Special Counsel Robert Mueller wants to ask President Trump were leaked to the New York Times and published on Monday. Trump has expressed a desire to be interviewed by Mueller in hopes that it will end the investigation. It would be extraordinarily unwise for President Donald Trump to speak with Special Counsel Robert Mueller III about his Russian ties and whether he obstructed justice. ",
