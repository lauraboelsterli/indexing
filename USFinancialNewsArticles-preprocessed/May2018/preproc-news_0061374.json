    "text": "MELBOURNE, May 29 (Reuters) - Global energy trader Vitol and its partners plan to float their Australian Viva Energy business, potentially worth around A$5 billion ($3.8 billion), in July, people familiar with the transaction said on Tuesday.\nThe owners want to sell up to 60 percent of the refinery, fuel supply and petrol stations business, in what would be Australia’s biggest initial public offering since the government’s float of Medibank Private in 2014.\nReporting by Sonali Paul; editing by Richard Pullin\n ",
