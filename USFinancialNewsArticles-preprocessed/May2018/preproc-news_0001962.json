    "text": "Validation of CERENIS’ strategic expansion in targeted HDL Drug Delivery through promising proprietary platform Delivery by HDL particles allows to target specific tumors using Immunotherapy and/or Chemotherapeutics\nTOULOUSE, France & LAKELAND, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nCERENIS Therapeutics (Paris:CEREN) (FR0012616852 – CEREN – PEA-PME eligible) , an international biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of HDL-based innovative therapies for treating cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, as well as new HDL-based vectors for targeted drug delivery in the field of oncology, announces the creation of its Scientific Advisory Board in Oncology (SAB-Oncology) with five key appointments: Briggs Morrison, MD , who will serve as the Chairman of the SAB, Mark Frohlich , MD, Aurélien Marabelle MD, PhD, Robert Schneider , PhD and Robert J. Spiegel , MD, FACP.\nJean-Louis Dasseux, founder and CEO of Cerenis, commented: “Cerenis is fully committed to implement its strategy in targeted HDL drug delivery. Creating this SAB in Oncology represents another important step forward for the company following the asset acquisition of Lypro Biosciences. More steps will follow as the company is leveraging its leading expertise in HDL, its intellectual property, its unique large-scale recombinant human apoA-I and HDL manufacturing and its clinical experience in HDL development to create a unique HDL drug delivery platform. Cerenis intends to develop products based on HDL drug delivery to allow for selective targeting to effectively kill cancer cells while protecting normal tissues. We are very happy to have such prestigious leading experts bringing not only a wealth of experience across research and clinical development, but also a hands-on experience in pharmaceutical and drug development strategies. This is essential to guide us in prioritizing and driving forward our drug delivery platform and clinical programs in Immuno-oncology and Chemotherapy.”\nBriggs Morrison, MD, SAB Chairman, commented : “I am very enthusiastic about joining Cerenis' Oncology Scientific Advisory Board to help the company develop promising new products for Immuno-oncology and Chemotherapy, and to help the Cerenis management understand this exciting but complex field. Targeted drug delivery has always been a 'holy grail' in Oncology and Cerenis may be at the point where such a challenge can be overcome with novel HDL technology developed by the company. For the first time we have pharmaceutical grade HDL, that may act as a universal carrier for diverse payloads including antigens, nucleic acids, and chemotherapeutic agents with a high specificity toward the targeted cells.”\nMark Frohlich, MD, SAB member , commented: “The concept of targeted delivery to cancer using nanoparticles is highly attractive. However, historical nanoparticle platforms, such as liposomal formulations, have failed to deliver on their promise. Challenges have included difficulties in manufacturing a consistent product, poor in vivo stability, and highly inefficient tumor targeting. The Cerenis HDL platform holds great potential to overcome these challenges and deliver on the promise of targeted nanoparticle delivery.”\nThe SAB-Oncology will work closely with Cerenis’ management team as it develops its targeted HDL drug delivery platform in immuno-oncology and chemotherapy and it is actively preparing to bring a lead product candidate into clinical studies. The Company believes its targeted HDL drug delivery platform has the potential to transform the treatment paradigm in immuno-oncology and chemotherapy, a market representing more than $30 billion. Cerenis is positioned to leverage its considerable IP positions and manufacturing expertise to make unique contributions in this important therapeutic space.\nBriggs Morrison, MD: Chairman of Cerenis’ SAB Oncology – Former Head of Global Medicines Development and Chief Medical Officer at AstraZeneca\nBriggs W. Morrison received his B.S. in biology from Georgetown University, his M.D. from the University of Connecticut Medical School, completed residency training in Internal Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and completed a fellowship in Medical Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

HDL is the primary mediator of the reverse lipid transport, or RLT, the only natural pathway by which excess lipids is removed from arteries and is transported to the liver for elimination from the body.\nCERENIS is developing a portfolio of lipid metabolism therapies, including HDL mimetics for patients with genetic HDL deficiency, as well as drugs which increase HDL for patients with a low number of HDL particles to treat atherosclerosis and associated metabolic diseases including Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis (NASH). Capitalizing on its expertise, Cerenis is developing the first HDL-based targeting drug delivery platform dedicated to the oncology field (immuno-oncology and chemotherapy).\nCERENIS is well positioned to become one of the leaders in the HDL therapeutic market, with a broad portfolio of programs in development.\nAbout Targeted HDL Drug Delivery\nHDL particles, loaded with an active agent, hold the promise to target and selectively kill malignant cells while sparing healthy ones. A wide variety of drugs can be embedded in these particles targeting markers specific to cancer cells and bring these potent drugs to their intended site of action, with lowered systemic toxicity. Cerenis intends to develop the first HDL-based targeting drug delivery platform dedicated to the oncology market, including immuno-oncology and chemotherapy.\nFinancial Agenda:\nAnnual Shareholder Meeting: June 25 th , 2018\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006168/en/\nCerenis\nJean-Louis Dasseux, +33 (0)5 62 24 09 49\nCEO\ninfo@cerenis.com\nor\nNewCap\nInvestors relations\nEmmanuel Huynh / Louis-Victor Delouvrier, +33 (0)1 44 71 98 53\ncerenis@newcap.eu\nor\nNewCap\nMedia relations\nNicolas Merigeau, +33 (0)1 44 71 94 98\ncerenis@newcap.eu\nSource: CERENIS Therapeutics",
