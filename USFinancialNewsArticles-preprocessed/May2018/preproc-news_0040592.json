    "text": " says U.S. trial of bank executive was political - spokesman The U.S. court that sentenced a Turkish banker to 32 months in prison over his part in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions violated the law and the trial was political, Turkish government spokesman Bekir Bozdag said on Thursday.\nAfter the U.S. judgeâ€™s ruling on Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla late on Wednesday, Bozdag wrote on Twitter that no country had the right to judge Turkish institutions or impose punishments on Turkey.
