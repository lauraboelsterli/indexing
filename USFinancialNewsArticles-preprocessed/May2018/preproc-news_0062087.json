    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said second-quarter markets revenue from sales and trading will likely be flat compared with a year earlier, depending on what happens in June.\nBrian T. Moynihan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of America Corporation, attends the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Speaking at an investor conference on Wednesday, Moynihan also said the bank will continue to benefit from using share buybacks to dispose of excess capital because its stock “is still cheap.”\nReporting by David Henry and Imani Moise in New York; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
