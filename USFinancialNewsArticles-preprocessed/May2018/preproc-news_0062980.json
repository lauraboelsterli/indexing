    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 9:42 AM / Updated 3 hours ago UK names academic Haskel as new Bank of England rate-setter William Schomberg 4 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Academic Jonathan Haskel was named as a new Bank of England interest-rate setter on Thursday, bringing his expertise in productivity to the central bank as it tries to work out the underlying growth potential of Britain’s economy.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\nHaskel’s academic work has highlighted the growing use of intangibles, such as a design and branding, that cannot be measured accurately in the production process and which could help the economy to expand more quickly than widely thought.\n“Everything being equal, this would suggest that labour productivity is stronger than official estimates suggest and like Ian McCafferty, (Haskel) will vote for a rate rise when he joins the MPC,” David Owen, an economist at brokerage Jefferies, said.\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney welcomed Haskel’s appointment and said “the depth of his knowledge on productivity and innovation will be hugely valuable”.\nSince February 2016, Haskel has been a non-executive director of the UK Statistics Authority. He sat on a panel for Britain’s competition watchdog between 2001 and 2010.\nThe Treasury said it had interviewed five candidates for the position, four of them women. The MPC has only one female member despite efforts by BoE Governor Mark Carney to promote more women to senior roles.\nEarlier this month, Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent’s comment that Britain’s economy was going through a “menopausal” phase revived concerns about gender diversity at the bank. He later apologised for his poor choice of language.\n“It is truly staggering that the Treasury has failed to appoint a women to this role,” said Rachel Reeves, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party who chairs parliament’s Business Committee.\n“The fact that four women were shortlisted shows that there are plenty of capable and well qualified women but yet again the top jobs seem to be reserved for men.” Writing by William Schomberg; Editing by Alistair Smout and Catherine Evans",
