(Nasdaq: BCOV), the leading provider of cloud services for video, today announced the appointment of Robert Noreck as EVP & Chief Financial Officer.

Mr. Noreck currently serves as Senior Vice President of Finance and Sales Operations and has more than six years of experience with the company.\n“On behalf of Brightcove and its Board of Directors, we are pleased to have Rob assuming the position of CFO. I am confident that Rob’s deep experience with the company, obsession with customer success, and strong understanding of our finances, operations and strategic direction make him the natural choice for CFO,” said Jeff Ray, Brightcove’s Chief Executive Officer. “We would also like to thank Kevin for his hard work and leadership over the last four years.
