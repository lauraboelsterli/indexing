REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\nThe French beauty firm’s luxury products division already makes fragrances and cosmetics for Armani and Saint Laurent as well as its own labels such as Lancome.\nIt is competing with U.S. cosmetics group Coty ( COTY.N ) which became the world’s leading perfume producer by buying Procter & Gamble’s beauty division in 2015, and also has licences for brands like Gucci, Hugo Boss or Dolce & Gabbana.\n“L’Oreal aims to become the world leader in perfumes. This licence should allow us to reach that goal,” a spokeswoman said.\nL’Oreal did not disclose the terms of the agreement, which will become effective from 2019, after regulatory approvals. The contract with Puig was due to expire at the end of 2018. Reporting by Pascale Denis, Writing by Sarah White, Editing by Alexander Smith",
