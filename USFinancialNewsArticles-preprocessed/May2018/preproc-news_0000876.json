    "text": "CAMPBELL, Calif., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VIVUS, Inc. (Nasdaq:VVUS) (the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all product rights for PANCREAZE® (pancrelipase) Delayed-Release Capsules in the United States and Canada held by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., subject to certain closing conditions, including Hart-Scott-Rodino review. This is the first of what the Company expects will be a series of product acquisitions designed to generate revenue and strengthen its financial position.\n“We are very pleased to announce the acquisition of the PANCREAZE product rights for the U.S. and Canadian territories. The acquisition, coupled with today’s announcement to restructure a portion of our convertible debt with Athyrium Capital Management, are demonstrations of our plan to create a stronger and more financially capable VIVUS,” said John Amos, new Chief Executive Officer at VIVUS. “We hope that the combination of a new product for us to promote along with the strengthening of our balance sheet will serve as initial stepping stones in our value creating strategic vision. The VIVUS senior management team plans to leverage the Company’s existing operating infrastructure in the promotion of PANCREAZE. We intend to drive revenue in the future through innovative sales and marketing of our current product portfolio, disciplined product acquisition, strong product life cycle management and focused expense management.”\nKenneth Suh, President and Chief Executive Officer of Willow Biopharma Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of VIVUS, stated: “PANCREAZE serves as our initial product acquisition, one that will allow us to participate and be a meaningful product company in the global gastrointestinal marketplace predicted to hit $48 billion in 2022, according to GBI Research. Through our disciplined product evaluation process, we are hopeful to acquire additional products and through product life cycle management, leverage the PANCREAZE platform for further growth.”\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is a condition that results from a deficiency in the production and/or secretion of pancreatic enzymes. It is associated with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis, and affects approximately 85 percent of cystic fibrosis patients. There is no cure for EPI and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the main treatment for the condition.\nApproved in 2010, PANCREAZE is a pancreatic enzyme preparation consisting of pancrelipase, an extract derived from porcine pancreatic glands, as well as other enzyme classes, including porcine-derived lipases, proteases and amylases. The pancreatic enzymes in PANCREAZE act like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas. PANCREAZE is specifically indicated for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions. Upon closing, VIVUS will acquire PANCREAZE from Janssen for $135 million.\nAbout PANCREAZE\nPANCREAZE is a prescription medicine used to treat people who cannot digest food normally because their pancreas does not make enough enzymes due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions. PANCREAZE may help your body use fats, proteins, and sugars from food. PANCREAZE contains a mixture of digestive enzymes including lipases, proteases, and amylases from pig pancreas. PANCREAZE is safe and effective in children when taken as prescribed by your doctor.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nWhat is the most important information I should know about PANCREAZE?\nPANCREAZE may increase your chance of having a serious, rare bowel disorder called fibrosing colonopathy that may require surgery.
