    "text": "PORT LOUIS, May 8 (Reuters) - Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mauritius grew faster in 2017 than earlier reported, driven by inflows into real estate, revised central bank data showed on Tuesday.\nThe Bank of Mauritius said in a statement FDI grew 28 percent year-on-year to 17.49 billion rupees ($507.69 million).\nLast month the bank put the figure at 14.22 billion rupees in 2017 compared with 13.64 billion in 2016.\nForeign investment in real estate led with 8.79 billion rupees, followed by financial and insurance activities with 6.58 billion, up from an earlier estimate of 3.32 billion, the central bank said.\n“The biggest chunk of direct investment came from Europe with France and Luxembourg combined accounting for over 40 per cent of total gross direct investment inflows,” it said.\nFrance was the biggest source, accounting for 4.38 billion rupees, followed by Luxembourg, with 3.31 billion.\nMauritius is moving from an economy traditionally focused on sugar, textiles and tourism towards offshore banking, business outsourcing, luxury real estate and medical tourism.
