    "text": "ZURICH (Reuters) - The World Cup referee given a life ban in his homeland Saudi Arabia this month for a match-fixing attempt will not be replaced at next month’s tournament in Russia, world soccer’s ruling body FIFA said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Mexico v Russia - FIFA Confederations Cup Russia 2017 - Group A - Kazan Arena, Kazan, Russia - June 24, 2017 Russia's Aleksandr Samedov and referee Fahad Al-Mirdasi REUTERS/John Sibley/File Photo The Saudi Arabia Football Federation (SAFF) said two weeks ago that it had barred referee Fahad Al Mirdasi after he confessed to offering to fix the final of his country’s domestic cup competition.\nFIFA confirmed in a statement to Reuters that Al Mirdasi’s World Cup selection had been withdrawn with immediate effect.\n“The FIFA Referees Committee has taken the decision not to directly replace Al Mirdasi,” it said, adding that the two assistant referees in his team, Mohammed Al Abakry and Abdulah Alshalwai, had also been dropped.\nThe SAFF said that Al Mirdasi offered to fix the King’s Cup final, played on May 12, on behalf of the Al Ittihad club.\nThe 32-year-old referee made the approach to Al Ittihad chief Hamad Al-Senaie, who immediately handed over the WhatsApp messages to SAFF officials and they alerted the relevant government authorities, the SAFF said.\nAl Mirdasi was taken into police custody where he confessed to soliciting the corrupt payment, the SAFF Ethics Committee said.\nAl Ittihad beat Al Faisaly in the King’s Cup final, winning after extra-time a game refereed by former Premier League official Mark Clattenburg.\nClattenburg, who was appointed Head of Refereeing at the SAFF last year, stepped in to replace Al Mirdasi on the eve of the game.\nAl Mirdasi has been on the FIFA referees’ list since 2011 and officiated at last year’s Confederations Cup in Russia.\nWriting by Brian Homewood, Editing by Ken Ferris and Ed Osmond\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
