    "text": "CAESAREA, Israel, May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mazor Robotics Ltd. (TASE: MZOR) (NASDAQ-GM: MZOR), a pioneer and a leader in the field of robotic guidance systems, reported record first quarter revenue of $15.5 million compared to $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Our record first quarter revenue reflects clinical adoption, as we surpassed 33,000 cases performed, and the continued global demand for the Mazor X and Renaissance systems,\" commented Ori Hadomi, Chief Executive Officer. \"Commercially, we successfully expanded into a new international market with the Mazor X and making progress penetrating into the Ambulatory Surgery Center (\"ASC\") market in the U.S. with the Renaissance. Our performance, coupled with the growing number of peer-reviewed papers, presentations and the interim data from our prospective studies, is transforming spine surgery in markets around the world. Finally, we are also advancing and expanding our technology development efforts with Medtronic, and I am pleased to share that commercialization of the Mazor X platform, which integrates Medtronic's Stealth navigation and offers a unique robot-guided implant solution that eliminates the need for guidewires, is expected at the end of 2018.\"\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS ON IFRS BASIS (\"GAAP\")\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 32% to $15.5 million compared to $11.7 million in the year-ago first quarter, mainly due to increased recurring revenue from kit sales, services and other. U.S. revenue increased 27% to $14.2 million compared to $11.2 million in the year-ago first quarter. International revenue increased 160% to $1.3 million compared to $0.5 million in the year-ago first quarter.\nThe Company's gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 58.3% compared to 64.6% in the year-ago first quarter. This expected decrease is attributed mainly to the pricing terms with Medtronic. Total operating expenses were $10.5 million compared to $13.3 million in the year-ago first quarter, mainly due to lower selling and marketing expenses, following the transition to the global distribution phase of the Medtronic partnership. Operating loss was $1.4 million compared to an operating loss of $5.7 million in the year-ago first quarter. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.3 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.2 million, or $0.11 per share, for the year-ago first quarter.\nCash provided by operating activities was $2.7 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $0.7 million in last year's first quarter as a result of high collection efforts from customers. As of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $114.5 million.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS ON NON-GAAP BASIS\nThe tables below include reconciliations of the Company's GAAP results to non-GAAP results. The reconciliations relate to non-cash expenses in the amount of $1.6 million with respect to share-based payments and amortization of intangible assets recorded in the first quarter of 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, the net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to net loss of $3.9 million, or $0.08 per share, for the year-ago first quarter.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nThe company will host a conference call to discuss these results on Monday, May 14, 2018, at 8:30 AM EDT (3:30 PM IDT).

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance that enhances management's and investors' ability to evaluate the Company's net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share and to compare them to historical net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share.\nThe presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when operating and evaluating the Company's business internally and therefore decided to make these non-GAAP adjustments available to investors.\nAbout Mazor\nMazor Robotics (TASE: MZOR; NASDAQGM: MZOR) believes in healing through innovation by developing and introducing revolutionary technologies and products aimed at redefining the gold standard of quality care. Mazor Robotics Guidance System enables surgeons to conduct spine and brain procedures in an accurate and secure manner.
