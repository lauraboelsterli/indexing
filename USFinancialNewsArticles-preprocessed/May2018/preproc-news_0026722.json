    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 7:50 PM / Updated 4 minutes ago Report: Mesa brothers leaving Cuba to pursue MLB careers\nOutfielders Victor Victor Mesa and Victor Mesa Jr. are leaving Cuba in hopes of joining Major League Baseball. A view of a replica of New York's statue of Cuba's independence hero Marti beside Cuba's flag in Havana, Cuba, January 28, 2018. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\nThe brothers, sons of Cuban veteran Victor Mesa, will be represented by Magnus Sports, according to the report by Jesse Sanchez of MLB.com.\nThe elder brother, Victor Victor, is 21 and has six years of pro ball in Cuba under his belt.\nMesa Jr. is just 16 years old.\nVictor Victor is said to be a strong defender in the outfield and a proficient runner who had a slash line of .354/.399/.539 last season. He also stole 40 bases in 70 games.\nPer MLB’s rules, the Mesas would be considered amateurs and would have to be signed via teams’ international player bonus pools.\nThe league also has to declare them free agents before they become available to sign, which could take several months.\nInternational bonus pools rest for teams in July, though eight teams — the Reds, A’s, Nationals, Braves, White Sox, Astros, Cardinals and Padres — are barred from spending more than $300,000 on a player after going over their allotments in the past.\nThe current collective bargaining agreement bars teams from going over their limits to sign players.\n—Field Level Media",
