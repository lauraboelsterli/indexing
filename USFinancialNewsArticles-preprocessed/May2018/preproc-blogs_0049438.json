    "text": "Fiat Chrysler is warning the owners of approximately 4.8 million vehicles to stop using the cruise control immediately due a potential defect that could leave the driver unable to cancel cruise control during certain circumstances.\nThe recall is one of the largest ever issued in the U.S.\nIt covers 15 Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and Dodge models built between 2014 and 2018.\nThe automaker says it knows of no accidents, injuries or fatalities caused by the defect.\nIn premarket trading Friday, Fiat Chrysler shares fell about 2.5 percent.\nThe warning to stop using cruise control comes as more than 36 million people get ready to hit the road for the long holiday weekend. Many are likely to be in Fiat Chrysler models covered by the warning and recall.\nFiat Chrysler says if drivers are unable to cancel cruise control, they can eventually stop the vehicle by shifting it into neutral and braking. Once the vehicle has stopped, drivers must put it in park in order to cancel the cruise-control engagement.\nThe automaker is planning to fix the defect with a software update. FCA says it will soon start notifying owners when they should bring their vehicles into dealerships for the repair.\nThe following models are affected:\n2015-17 Chrysler 200 sedan 2014-18 Chrysler 300 sedan 2017-18 Chrysler Pacifica minivan 2015-18 Dodge Challenger coupe 2014-18 Dodge Charger sedan 2014-18 Dodge Journey CUV 2014-18 Dodge Durango SUV 2014-18 Jeep Cherokee SUV 2014-18 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV 2018 Jeep Wrangler 2014-19 Ram 1500 pickup 2014-18 Ram 2500 pickup 2014-18 Ram 3500 pickup 2014-18 Ram 3500 cab chassis\n(Correction: The recall covers 15 Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and Dodge models built between 2014 and 2018.)",
