    "text": "President Donald Trump 's former longtime doctor says he felt \"raped, frightened and sad\" after a top White House aide conducted a \"raid\" on his New York City medical offices and took the president's health records last year, according to a new report.\nDr. Harold Bornstein told NBC News that the \"raid\" by Trump's longtime personal bodyguard Keith Schiller and another \"large man\" came on Feb. 3, 2017, and that they were joined by the Trump Organization's chief legal officer, Alan Garten.\nThat was just two days after Bornstein, who had been Trump's doctor since 1980, told The New York Times that he had prescribed the president the hair-growth medicine Propecia for years.\nBornstein said Schiller, who at the time was director of Oval Office operations at the White House, and his team did not give him a form signed by Trump that would have authorized the release of the records they took, \"which is a violation of patient privacy law,\" NBC News noted.\nshow chapters Trump's doctor says he aced his mental fitness test. Here's how hard it really was. 11:21 PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 | 01:10 Bornstein also said the men asked him to take down a photograph on the office wall that showed Trump and the doctor together. In that photo, Trump is giving his signature \"thumbs-up\" gesture.\nThe doctor also was Quote: d as saying that Trump cut ties with him after the Times story.\n\"I couldn't believe anybody was making a big deal out of a drug to grow his hair that seemed to be so important,\" Bornstein said.\n\"And it certainly was not a breach of medical trust to tell somebody they take Propecia to grow their hair. What's the matter with that?\"\nBornstein gained notoriety in 2016 when he wrote a letter claiming that, if elected , Trump would be the healthiest American president ever, calling Trump's health \"astonishingly excellent.\"\nBornstein was not available for comment when CNBC called his office.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, when asked about Bornstein account on Tuesday, said, \"It would be standard procedure for the president, a newly elected president's medical records, to be in possession by the White House medical unit.\"\n\"And that's what was taking place,\" Sanders said at a press briefing. \"Those records were being transferred to the medical unit, as requested.\"\nSchiller left the White House last fall. After that, CNBC reported in February that his private security firm had been collecting $15,000 per month for services provided to the Republican National Committee.\nWATCH: Trump's fight against 'fake news' has been a boon for media companies show chapters Trump's fight against 'fake news' has been a boon for media companies 11:50 AM ET Tue, 24 April 2018 | 01:49",
