    "text": "MONTREAL, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Siyata Mobile Inc. (the \" Company \" or \" Siyata \") (TSX-V:SIM) (OTCQX:SYATF) announces that it has filed its Q1 2018 financial results and will hold a conference call on Thursday May 31, 2018 at 09:00AM EST.\nHighlights\nRevenue for the quarter was $3.0MM compared to $4.9MM for the same period in the previous year. This negative variance of $1.9MM (39%) is due mainly to the decrease in demand for the legacy products as well as sales decline in North America primarily due to new 4G products which required FCC and IC certification as well as customer acceptance procedures;\nAdjusted EBITDA is negative $833,775 versus positive $163,480 in the same period in 2017 a negative variance of $997,255;\nGross Margin for the Q1 2018 was 27.8% vs. 27% in Q1 2017;\nWorking Capital as of March 2018 is $8.5MM vs. $8.2MM in March 2017.\nMarc Seelenfreund, CEO and Chairman of Siyata Mobile, comments, “Q1 was a challenging quarter as we continued to shift both our existing and new customers from our legacy 3G products towards our new 4G LTE portfolio. In Q2 we are witnessing a lift in sales of our 4G products and we are very confident that this momentum will continue in the coming quarters of 2018 and beyond.”\nThe company will hold a conference call on Thursday May 31 at 09:00 am Eastern Time (06:00 am PST) to discuss the Q1 2018 results, along with a Q&A session with Siyata Mobile CEO and Chairman, Marc Seelenfreund.\nDetails of the conference call:\nDate: Thursday, May 31, 2018\nTime: 06:00 am PT / 09:00 am ET\nOperator Assisted Toll-Free Dial-In Number: (866) 521-4909\nLocal or International Dial-In Number : (647) 427-2311\nThere will also be a playback of the conference call, available in MP3 format by contacting investor relations below.\nThe company also announces that it has received approval from the TSX Venture Exchange (the “ Exchange ”) to amend the expiry date of share purchase warrants of an aggregate of 8,299,714 that were originally issued on June 10, 2016 with an exercise price of $0.50 in connection with the Company’s private placement (the “ Warrants ”). The Warrants now have an expiry date of December 10, 2018. No amendment to the exercise price of the Warrants was made.\nIn addition, the Company is pleased to announce that, subject to regulatory approval, it has retained Mackie Research Capital Corporation (“ Mackie Research ”) to initiate market making services to the Company in compliance with the policies and guidelines of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nBeginning June 01, 2018, Mackie Research will trade shares of the Company on the Venture Exchange for the purposes of maintaining and improving the liquidity of the Company’s common shares.
