    "text": "Helen Zhao: CNBC Business News Associate Published 11:42 AM ET Tue, 1 May 2018 Updated 3:08 PM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 CNBC.com\n\"My name's Helen Zhao, and I'm a rotating business news associate here at CNBC.\nMy journey here started at the Business News Associate Workshop at the AAJA Convention.\nI applied for this workshop because I knew I wanted to be a business news journalist at the most multi-faceted environment possible, where my career could potentially go in so many different directions, and the workshop definitely provided a window into that. \"So, the workshop itself is just so dynamic, it's so interactive, it's got this electrifying energy where you're meeting with some of CNBC's top producers, editors and anchors, and they're there to guide you on how to think critically about a news event from multiple different angles and from a business perspective.\"\nSo from meeting so many different people, I definitely got this familial vibe that's been further cemented during my time here at CNBC.\" Business News Associate Workshop at #AAJA18 | Houston | Aug 10 ",
