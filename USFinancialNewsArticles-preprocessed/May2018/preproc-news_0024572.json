    "text": "TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp on Thursday forecast a 9.1 percent slide in operating profit for the current financial year as it expects a stronger yen and higher R&D costs to offset rising sales of cars mainly in India, its biggest market.\nJapanâ€™s fourth-biggest automaker expects operating profit to ease to 340.0 billion yen ($3.10 billion) in the year to March 2019, lower than a median forecast for 374.6 billion yen from 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nOperating profit was 374.2 billion yen in the year ended March, outperforming analyst estimates. ($1 = 109.8200 yen) (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n ",
