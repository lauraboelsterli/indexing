Servers/storage and net/com products experienced strong revenue growth in this segment with an increase of 19% and 18%, respectively. Gross margin increased by 229 basis points to 17.6% primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and the increase in invoice selling margins. Net sales as presented for the first quarter of 2018 were $257.2 million for the Enterprise Solutions (Large Account) segment. Net sales prior to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 14.7% to $290.2 million, compared to $252.9 million for the prior year’s quarter. Mobility and server/storage products experienced solid growth during the quarter at 27% and 13%, respectively. Gross margin increased by 176 basis points to 14.3% primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and the increase in invoice selling margins.

Net sales prior to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 22.5% to $111.6 million, compared to $144.0 million for the prior year’s quarter. Gross margin increased by 364 basis points to 12.9% primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and the increase in invoice selling margins.\nQuarterly Sales by Product Mix :\nNotebook/mobility sales, the Company’s largest product category, as presented, increased by 7% year over year and accounted for 26% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 22% of net sales in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, notebook/mobility sales increased by 6% year over year and accounted for 23% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 22% in the prior year quarter. Sales of this product category grew year over year in Enterprise Solutions, but were offset by lower notebook sales made under federal contracts in our Public Sector, compared to the prior year quarter. Servers/storage, as presented, increased by 21% year over year and accounted for 12% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 9% of net sales in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, servers/storage sales increased by 21% year over year and accounted for 10% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 9% in the prior year quarter. All three selling segments experienced strong year-over-year growth in server/storage sales. Software sales, as presented, decreased by 46% year over year and accounted for 11% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 19% of net sales in the prior year quarter. The decrease in software sales was due to the adoption the new revenue recognition standard. Excluding the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, software sales increased by 15% year over year and accounted for 21% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 19% of net sales in the prior year quarter. We experienced solid growth in cloud-based offerings, security, and office productivity.\nAs reported, gross profit increased by $9.6 million, or 11.1%, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the prior year quarter. Gross profit prior to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard increased by $9.0 million, or 10.4% from the first quarter a year ago. Consolidated gross margin as reported, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 15.4% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 12.9% for the prior year quarter. Gross margin prior to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard was 13.7% compared to 12.9% a year ago. The increase in gross margin was attributed to an increase in invoice selling margins related to an increase in higher-margin advanced solution sales.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as reported, increased in the first quarter of 2018 to $80.9 million from $75.3 million in the prior year quarter. SG&A in the first quarter of 2018 prior to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard was $80.8 million. The increase was primarily the result of increased variable compensation associated with our higher gross profits as well as investments made in our technology solutions group. SG&A as reported as a percentage of net sales was 12.9%, compared to 11.2% in the prior year quarter. However, SG&A in the first quarter of 2018, prior to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, was 11.5%.\nCash and cash equivalents were $71.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $50.0 million at December 31, 2017. During the quarter we paid a $9.1 million special dividend to our shareholders. Also during the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 116,241 shares of stock for $3.0 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $14.8 million available for stock repurchases remaining under previous authorizations made by its Board of Directors. Days sales outstanding were 53 days at March 31, 2018, up from 48 days in the prior year quarter; the increase of 5 days from 48 days was due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Inventory turns were 23 turns in the first quarter of 2018, down from 25 turns in the prior year quarter; excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, inventory turns would have increased to 26 turns.\n“We are pleased with our record first quarter results in gross margin and earnings per share, while generating significant operating cash flow. It was also good to see continued execution and double-digit growth in our vertical markets; retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and finance.” said Tim McGrath, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We remain focused on our strategic plan to help our customers solve their business challenges with innovative technology solutions,” concluded Mr. McGrath.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA A reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is detailed below. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for stock-based compensation and special charges. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either includes or excludes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance including our ability to fund our future capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements.

Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either includes or excludes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance including our ability to fund our future capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements.
