    "text": "CARLSBAD, Calif., May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Callaway Golf Company (NYSE:ELY) announced today that the Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million of the Company's common stock in open market or in private transactions. The Company will assess market conditions, buying opportunities and other factors from time to time and will make strategic repurchases as appropriate. The open market repurchases will be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, and the repurchases will be made consistent with the terms of the Company's credit facility, which defines the amount of stock that can be repurchased. The new repurchase program replaces the prior repurchase program, which was near completion and has been terminated by the Board of Directors. The repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire a specific number of shares and it will remain in effect until completed or until terminated by the Board of Directors.\nThe Company also announced today that the Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on its Common Stock.
