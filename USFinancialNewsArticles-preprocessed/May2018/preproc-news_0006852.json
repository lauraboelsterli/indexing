    "text": "SHANGHAI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Blank Rome LLP is pleased to announce that Louis Meng has joined the Firm as a Partner in the Corporate, M&A, and Securities group, head of the Firm’s Greater China Practice, and Chief Representative of the Shanghai office, known locally as Blank Rome LLP Shanghai Representative Office, USA . At Blank Rome, Mr. Meng’s practice will focus primarily in the areas of business and corporate transactions. He joins Blank Rome from Haynes and Boone, where he served as co-chair of the Asia Practice Group.\n“We are thrilled to welcome Louis to Blank Rome,” said Alan J. Hoffman , Chairman and Managing Partner. “Having Louis and Mike Margolis anchoring our Shanghai office enhances our ability to counsel clients in the Greater China region and beyond. Whether U.S. companies are looking to operate in Asia, or Asian-based companies are seeking to enter the U.S. or other foreign markets, they face a challenging business environment and need lawyers who understand the changing marketplace. Louis and Mike have significant experience with the cultural nuances of the region and are highly skilled at navigating the complex regulatory considerations of cross-border transactions.”\nMr. Meng counsels clients through business and corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, private equity, venture capital, emerging growth, alternative and initial public offerings, fund formation, foreign direct investments and joint ventures, distressed property and non-performing loan transactions, real estate finance, direct selling, structured finance, and other cross-border corporate transactions.\n“We are very excited that Louis has joined us in Shanghai,” said Mike Margolis, Partner and Chair of Blank Rome’s Asia Practice . “Blank Rome has been a market leader in serving Chinese businesses and helping them operate and succeed in the United States. Additionally, many parent companies of U.S.-based businesses are in China and, with Louis’ significant experience, we are further equipped to counsel those clients, as well as to help U.S. companies enter – and succeed in – the Chinese market.”\nFor more than 20 years—both as a partner in a domestic Chinese firm and as a partner in U.S.-based law firms—Mr. Meng has advised Chinese and multinational public and private companies, financial institutions, emerging growth companies, investment banks, asset managers, PE and VC funds, LPs and GPs, and hedge funds. He has also assisted many Chinese companies doing business in the United States and elsewhere. He has advised them on raising capital overseas through public offerings and private placements and acquiring international assets and technologies through licensing and cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Meng has also advised many public and private U.S. companies going into and operating in China.\n“I am very excited to join Blank Rome as Chief Representative of the Shanghai office,” said Mr. Meng. “Blank Rome understands the Chinese market and is committed to expanding its capabilities and team in the region. Additionally, the Firm offers a full spectrum of legal talent from its international business, corporate, and litigation teams across offices to counsel Asia-based clients doing business in the United States and U.S. companies doing business in Asia. I’m impressed by the seamless collaboration across the Firm’s practices and offices and look forward to working with my new colleagues in Shanghai and the United States to support our clients.”\nMr. Margolis added, “Over the past 18 months or so, we’ve seen some Western law firms close or reduce their presence in China in response to new challenges in the market, regulatory changes, and the geopolitical environment. At Blank Rome, however, we see these challenges as opportunities—clients on both sides of the ocean have an even greater need to understand each other’s laws and navigate the legal landscape in one another’s countries, and we’re here to help them do just that.”\nMr. Meng earned his LL.M. and J.D. from the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, his LL.B. from Soochow University Law School, Taipei, Taiwan.\nBlank Rome’s expansion into China in May 2011 was driven by the needs of clients with business operations around the world, including China-based clients with growing consumer and industrial enthusiasm for foreign products and technology, resulting in increasing investment by Chinese companies in the United States. Blank Rome’s lawyers often work closely with local law firms in China to help Chinese clients and U.S. clients succeed in one another’s countries.\nBlank Rome’s Asia Practice has extensive experience in advising Asia-based businesses in capital formation transactions and listings on U.S. exchanges; mergers and acquisitions; private equity; and venture capital investments, as well as resolution of cross-border disputes. The practice also advises clients doing business in Asia with regard to foreign direct investments in Asia; strategic alliances; maritime transactional, regulatory, and litigation matters; bank lending and finance; international taxation; patent, trademark, and other intellectual property matters; international dispute resolution and litigation; international trade, including import/export matters; anti-bribery, FCPA and related issues; energy development and technology; labor and employment, including immigration; and government relations matters.\nAbout Blank Rome LLP\nBlank Rome is an Am Law 100 firm with 13 offices and more than 600 attorneys and principals who provide comprehensive legal and advocacy services to clients operating in the United States and around the world. Our professionals have built a reputation for their leading knowledge and experience across a spectrum of industries, and are recognized for their commitment to pro bono work in their communities.
