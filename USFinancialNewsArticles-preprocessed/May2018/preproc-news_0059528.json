    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 29 (Reuters) - San Francisco’s city attorney has subpoenaed Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc to turn over records relating to how the ride-hailing firms classify drivers, as well as driver wages, health care and other benefits in the latest probe in the city’s year-long investigation into the companies.\nCity Attorney Dennis Herrera said on Tuesday he was seeking evidence that Uber and Lyft are in compliance with a recent California Supreme Court decision that makes it much easier for workers to prove that they are employees entitled to benefits and protections, rather than independent contractors.
