    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 7:01 PM / Updated an hour ago Supporters cheer Maltese leader as government faces pressure after journalist murder Francesco Guarascio 2 Min Read\nVALLETTA (Reuters) - Several thousand people rallied in the Maltese capital Valletta on Tuesday in a show of support for the government, which is facing judicial inquiries into alleged corruption and European Union questions over the rule of law.

REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi\nThe rally, organised by Malta’s Labour Party to mark Workers’ Day, took place two days after demonstrators marched through Valletta chanting anti-government slogans and calling for justice after the killing of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\nGalizia was killed by a car bomb in October. Three people have been charged for carrying out the murder but police have not identified who ordered it. Labour Party supporters celebrate during a May Day rally, after Prime Minister Joseph Muscat urged supporters to attend as a response to the revelations made by the Daphne Project, according to local media, in Valletta, Malta May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi\nAddressing the crowd, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said Malta was moving forward on issues of justice but he did not mention the investigation into Caruana Galizia’s murder.
