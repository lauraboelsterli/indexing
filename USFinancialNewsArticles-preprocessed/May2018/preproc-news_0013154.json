    "text": "Pinterest\nTelecom Italia’s shareholders have voted to form a new board, ending a bitter battle for control between activist investor Elliott Management and French conglomerate Vivendi.\nElliott Management, an activist fund run by its billionaire founder Paul Singer, won the vote securing two-thirds of seats on Telecom Italia’s board.\nElliott had accused Vivendi of failing shareholder interest in Italy’s biggest phone company and subsequently forced Friday’s vote over the company’s stewardship.\nTelecom Italia shares rose sharply on the news on Friday afternoon.\nShareholders were asked to pick between Elliott’s preferred board of 10 independent Italian business figures and Vivendi’s list which included a majority of Vivendi employees, including its own CEO as executive chairman.\nAfter losing the vote, Vivendi said in a press release that it would maintain its long-term commitment to Telecom Italia and would “take all measures necessary to preserve its value and avoid its dismantling.” ",
