    "text": "MONMOUTH JUNCTION, N.J., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CytoSorbents Corporation (CTSO), CytoSorbents Corporation (CTSO), a critical care immunotherapy leader commercializing its CytoSorb® blood purification technology to treat deadly inflammation in critically-ill and cardiac surgery patients around the world, will report Q1 2018 financial results after the market close on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.\nCytoSorbents' management will host a live conference call and presentation webcast that will recount both operational and financial progress during Q1 2018 followed by a question and answer session.\nConference Call Details:\nDate: Tuesday, May 8, 2018\nTime: 4:45 PM Eastern\nParticipant Dial-In: 323-794-2551\nConference ID: 3912277\nLive Presentation Webcast: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129408\nIt is recommended that participants dial in approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the call. There will also be a simultaneous live webcast of the conference call that can be accessed through the following audio feed link: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129408\nAn archived recording of the conference call will be available under the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at http://cytosorbents.com/investor-relations/financial-results/\nAbout CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO)\nCytoSorbents Corporation is a leader in critical care immunotherapy, specializing in blood purification. Its flagship product, CytoSorb® is approved in the European Union with distribution in 45 countries around the world, as an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber designed to reduce the \"cytokine storm\" or \"cytokine release syndrome\" that could otherwise cause massive inflammation, organ failure and death in common critical illnesses. These are conditions where the risk of death is extremely high, yet no effective treatments exist. CytoSorb is also being used during and after cardiac surgery to remove inflammatory mediators that can lead to post-operative complications, including multiple organ failure. CytoSorbents recently initiated its pivotal REFRESH 2 trial – a multi-center, randomized controlled, clinical trial intended to support U.S. regulatory approval of CytoSorb for use in a heart-lung machine during complex cardiac surgery to reduce organ injury. CytoSorb® has been used in more than 35,000 human treatments to date.\nCytoSorbents' purification technologies are based on biocompatible, highly porous polymer beads that can actively remove toxic substances from blood and other bodily fluids by pore capture and surface adsorption. Its technologies have received non-dilutive grant, contract, and other funding of nearly $22 million from DARPA, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and others. The Company has numerous products under development based upon this unique patented blood purification technology including CytoSorb-XL™, HemoDefend™, VetResQ™, K + ontrol™, ContrastSorb, DrugSorb, and others.
