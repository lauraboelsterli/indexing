It made a return of 11 percent from public equity investments outside of Canada.\n“The protection for us is diversification,” said Machin. “We’ve got to be diversified across geographies, asset classes and strategies.”\n$1 = 1.2778 Canadian dollars Reporting by Matt Scuffham Editing by Bernadette Baum and Frances Kerry\n ",
