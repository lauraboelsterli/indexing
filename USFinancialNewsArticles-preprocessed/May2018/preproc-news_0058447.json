    "text": "Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones insists there is no tension between himself and the organization.\nDec 24, 2017; New Orleans, LA, USA; Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones (11) makes a catch while defended by New Orleans Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore (23) in the second quarter at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Chuck Cook-USA TODAY Sports Jones has skipped Atlanta’s voluntary organized team activities but said there are no issues that have led to his absence. He also stated that his contract isn’t a problem. Jones has two seasons remaining on the five-year, $71.25 million contract he signed in 2015.\n“It’s not even about that,” Jones told TMZ. “Everyone wants a story right now. There’s no story. I’m just working on getting myself better. There’s no bad blood with the team or anything like that. ... I’m not going anywhere.”\nQuestions about Jones’ intentions began circulating after he recently removed all photos and references to the Falcons from his social media accounts. The 29-year-old caught 88 passes for 1,444 yards last season but had just three touchdowns.\nJones, a five-time Pro Bowler, has 585 receptions for 9,054 yards and 43 touchdowns during his seven NFL seasons.\nThe Falcons added fellow former Alabama wide receiver Calvin Ridley in the first round of this year’s NFL draft.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
