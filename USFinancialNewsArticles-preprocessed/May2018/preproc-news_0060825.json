    "text": "By Emily Price 2:43 PM EDT\nNext time you’re in Sweden, you can grab a bottle of beer made from sewage. Nya Carnegiebryggeriet brewery, Carlsberg and the Swedish Environmental Research Institute (IVL) recently collaborated on a pilsner that includes organic malt, hops… and recycled wastewater.\nThe beer launched on May 25th.\nCalled PU:REST the idea behind the brew is to raise awareness about the ability to make wastewater into safe drinking water, which happened before the water made its way into the brew, Lonely Planet reports .\n“Ultimately, this comes down to beating the drum for sustainable water treatment, and for the value of fresh water,” Staffan Filipsson of IVL said in a press release.\nPurification for the water happens at Sweden’s Hammarby water treatment plant.\nNya Carnegiebryggeriet is jointly owned by Carlsberg and Brooklyn Brewery. The beer will be available this summer in Sweden at retailers as well as at some selected bars and festivals. ",
