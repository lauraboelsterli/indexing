    "text": "Female politicians have been making waves with a number of firsts this year. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth became the first sitting senator to give birth while in office last month, and then took it a step further, when she became the first to bring her newborn to the Senate floor for a vote.\nNow Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has surprised residents of the capital, announcing on Monday evening that she had adopted a newborn. In so doing, she has become the first single mother to run D.C.\nBowser has never married and this is her first child. Despite announcing the adoption on Twitter , Bowser and her office have thus far chosen to maintain a level of discretion regarding other details. The baby’s gender, name, and age have not been released; nor have they released any photos of the baby.\nOctober 13th, 2015.
