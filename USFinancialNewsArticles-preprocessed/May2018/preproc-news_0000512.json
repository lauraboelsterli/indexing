    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 7:25 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago Former Wilmington Trust executives convicted in U.S. fraud trial Nate Raymond 3 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Four former Wilmington Trust Co executives were convicted on Thursday of U.S. charges that they concealed from regulators the amount of troubled loans still on the bank’s books after the 2008 financial crisis, prosecutors said.\nThe verdict by a federal jury in Wilmington, Delaware, came in one of the few criminal cases in which federal prosecutors sought to hold top executives at a well-known financial company accountable for conduct tied to the crisis.\nThe former Wilmington Trust executives are President Robert Harra, Chief Financial Officer David Gibson, Controller Kevyn Rakowski and Chief Credit Officer William North.\nJurors found them guilty on all counts they faced, including securities fraud, conspiracy and making false statements to federal regulators, prosecutors said. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIn October, Wilmington Trust, now owned by M&T Bank Corp, reached a $60 million deal resolving related charges, a sum that included $16 million it paid in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settlement in 2014.\nFounded by the du Pont family in 1903, Wilmington Trust received $330 million of federal bailout money in 2008 under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which was meant to bolster U.S. lenders following the real estate market crash.\nTwo years later, Wilmington Trust raised $273.9 million in a February 2010 sale with the intention of repaying the TARP funds.\nAt the time, it reported to regulators just $10.8 million in commercial loans that were 90 days past due, but prosecutors said the real figure was $344 million, and continued to grow. Prosecutors accused the defendants of hiding the bank’s deteriorating finances.\nMounting losses from construction loans and commercial mortgages led to Wilmington’s November 2010 agreement to sell itself to Buffalo, New York-based M&T Bank at a 46 percent discount to its market value.\nThe case is U.S. v. Wilmington Trust Corporation, et al, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 15-cr-00023. Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Peter Cooney",
