    "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia and NEW YORK, Mesoblast Limited (ASX:MSB) (Nasdaq:MESO) today announced the appointment of Josh Muntner as its new Chief Financial Officer, based in New York.\nChief Executive Dr Silviu Itescu welcomed the appointment of Mr Muntner stating he would bring substantial U.S. corporate finance, transactional and capital markets experience to Mesoblast.\nMr Muntner has accrued 20 years’ experience in healthcare investment banking and corporate finance, and has been involved in a wide range of healthcare-related transactions with approximately $11 billion in value. Most recently, he led corporate development and financial transactions at Nasdaq-listed biotechnology company, C ontraFect Corporation . Previously, Mr Muntner served as Managing Director and Co-Head of Healthcare Investment Banking at Janney Montgomery Scott, and spent nine years at Oppenheimer & Co. and its U.S. predecessor, CIBC World Markets. He also served as an investment banker at Prudential Securities.\nMr Muntner said he was delighted to be joining Mesoblast as it transitions to a commercial organization. “Mesoblast is a dynamic company that is well positioned to capitalize on its portfolio of cell therapy product candidates with the potential to bring about paradigm-changing clinical outcomes.”\nThe Mesoblast Board and management thanked outgoing Chief Financial Officer Paul Hodgkinson for his significant contribution over the past four years and wished him well in his future endeavors.\nIgnite Partners advised Mesoblast on the appointment of Mr Muntner.\nAbout Mesoblast\nMesoblast Limited (ASX:MSB) (Nasdaq:MESO) is a global leader in developing innovative cell-based medicines. Through a proprietary process, Mesoblast selects highly purified mesenchymal lineage precursor and stem cells from the bone marrow of healthy adults, and creates master cell banks which can be industrially expanded to produce thousands of doses from each donor that meet stringent release criteria, have lot to lot consistency, and can be used off the shelf without the need for tissue matching.\nThe Company has leveraged its proprietary technology platform to establish a broad portfolio of late-stage product candidates. Mesoblast’s allogeneic, ‘off-the-shelf’ cell product candidates are being evaluated in their ability to target advanced stages of diseases with high, unmet medical needs including cardiovascular conditions, orthopedic disorders, immunologic and inflammatory disorders and oncologic/hematologic conditions.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement includes that relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these .
