(\"Kulicke\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: KLIC) and certain of its officers and directors alleging violations of the federal securities laws. Class members interested in serving as lead plaintiff are reminded of the July 10, 2018 lead plaintiff deadline.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (No. 2:18cv03969), alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements in the Company's annual report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\nMore specifically, on May 10, 2018, after the market closed, the Company announced that its Quarterly Report for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 would not be timely filed due to an investigation into \"certain unauthorized transactions by a senior finance employee of the Company.\" Moreover, Kulicke disclosed that certain warranty accrurals in prior periods were accounted for incorrectly.\nIf you purchased KLIC stock between November 16, 2017 and May 10, 2018 and wish to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 10, 2018.
