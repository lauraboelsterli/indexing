(Nasdaq: CTRP), a leading travel service provider of accommodation reservation, transportation ticketing, packaged tours and corporate travel management in China (\"Ctrip\" or the \"Company\"), today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKey Highlights for the First Quarter of 2018\nCtrip reported strong financial results in the first quarter of 2018. Net revenue increased 11% year-on-year to RMB6.7 billion (US$1.1 billion) in the first quarter of 2018. Net income attributed to Ctrip's shareholders increased by more than 19 times year-on-year to RMB1.1 billion (US$ 170 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB52 million in the same period in 2017. Ctrip's international businesses sustained robust growth momentum. Excluding Skyscanner, international air ticketing accounted for over 40% of the group's air ticketing revenue, as we continue to ride the wave of Chinese outbound customers and expand our customer base in overseas markets. Skyscanner's direct booking program continues to gain momentum, delivering revenue growth of over 600% year-on-year in the first quarter. The Company increased its presence in lower-tier cities. Total gross merchandise volume of the offline stores grew around 50% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2018.\n\"I'm glad that Ctrip achieved solid results in the first quarter of 2018,\" said Jane Sun, Chief Executive Officer. \"We are hugely grateful for the trust of our customers. Together with our partners, we strive to make their travel easier and more enjoyable. There are still many improvements for us to make, and also many areas where we can further unleash our potential. We are in a good position to capture growth in the travel industry, both domestically and globally, and we are very excited about the bright future ahead of us.\"\n\"In the past 19 years since the launch of Ctrip, we have claimed many firsts in the travel service area,\" said James Liang, Executive Chairman. \"We must be mindful that Ctrip's success to date has come from the value we created for customers, and this will not change in the future. Despite the challenges and setbacks along the way, we believe that as long as we stick to customer centric principles and continually make investments and innovations, we will become the best travel service provider in the world and the pride of the travel industry.\"\nFirst Quarter of 2018 Financial Results and Business Updates\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Ctrip reported net revenue of RMB6.7 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing an 11% increase from the same period in 2017.

Transportation ticketing revenue decreased 1% from the previous quarter.\nPackaged tour revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB834 million (US$133 million), representing an 18% increase from the same period in 2017, primarily driven by an increase in volume growth of organized tours and self-guided tours. Packaged-tour revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased 52% from the previous quarter, primarily due to seasonality.\nCorporate travel revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB180 million (US$29 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2017, primarily driven by expansion in travel product coverage. Corporate travel revenue for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 13% from the previous quarter, primarily due to seasonality.\nGross margin was 82% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 80% in the same period in 2017, and 83% for the previous quarter.\nProduct development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 10% to RMB2.2 billion (US$344 million) from the same period in 2017, primarily due to the increase in product development personnel related expenses.

Excluding share-based compensation charges, Non-GAAP product development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 accounted for 29% of the net revenue, which increased from 28% for the same period in 2017 and decreased from 30% for the previous quarter.\nSales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 11% to RMB2.1 billion (US$333 million) from the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing activities to strengthen our market position and personnel related expenses.

The change in the Group's effective tax rate primarily reflects profitability changes in our subsidiaries with different tax rates, certain non-tax deductible losses including the share based compensation and fair value change in equity securities investments.\nNet income attributable to Ctrip's shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB1.1 billion (US$170 million), compared to RMB52 million in the same period in 2017 and RMB350 million in the previous quarter. Excluding share-based compensation charges and fair value changes of equity securities investments, Non-GAAP net income attributable to Ctrip's shareholders was RMB2.1 billion (US$341 million), compared to RMB574 million in the same period in 2017 and RMB750 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to the net gain recognized from a number of investing activities.\nDiluted earnings per ADS were RMB1.81 (US$0.29) for the first quarter of 2018. Excluding share-based compensation charges and fair value changes of equity securities investments, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS were RMB3.48 (US$0.55) for the first quarter of 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB52.5 billion (US$8.4 billion).\nNew Accounting Standards\nFrom January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the following new accounting standards.\n1> The \"New Revenue Accounting Standard\"\nThe new revenue standard (ASC 606) was effective from January 1, 2018 and the revenue of the first quarter of 2018 was reported under the new standard. We adopt the full retrospective transition approach which requires the financial statements for 2016 and 2017 to be retrospectively adjusted.\nThe new standard does not change the presentation of substantially all of the Company' revenues, which continues to be reported on a net basis. However, the timing of revenue recognition for certain revenue streams is changed under the new standard. In particular, revenue for accommodation reservation services, which used to be recognized after end-users completed their stays, is changed to be recognized when the reservation becomes non-cancellable. Revenue for packaged-tour services, which used to be recognized when packaged-tours were completed, is changed to be recognized on the departure date of the tours.\nAlthough the change in timing of revenue recognition does not have a significant impact to the Company's 2017 annual revenue and net income, the effects on quarterly revenue and net income are more significant due to the seasonality of the Company's business. The key line items of our quarterly operation results of 2017 that were previously released have been adjusted as follows:\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nRMB (million)\nRevenues:\nAccommodation reservation\n2,023\n2,326\n2,998\n2,184\nTransportation ticketing\n2,875\n2,993\n3,428\n2,925\nPackaged-tour\n709\n640\n1,075\n549\nCorporate travel\n144\n199\n203\n207\nOthers\n342\n347\n472\n354\nTotal revenues\n6,093\n6,505\n8,176\n6,219\nNet revenues\n6,045\n6,459\n8,119\n6,173\nGross profit\n4,856\n5,334\n6,816\n5,112\nIncome from operations\n374\n687\n1,579\n303\nNet income attributable to\nCtrip.com International, Ltd.\n52\n359\n1,394\n350\nIncome from operations\n(Non-GAAP)\n896\n1,215\n1,963\n703\nNet income attributable to\nCtrip.com International, Ltd.\n(Non-GAAP)\n574\n887\n1,778\n750\n2> The \"New Financial Instruments Accounting Standard\"\nThe Company adopted the new financial instruments accounting standard from January 1, 2018 and approximately RMB6.3 billion of accumulated other comprehensive income, reflective of the net unrealized gain for the available-for-sale equity securities that existed as of December 31, 2017 was reclassified into retained earnings upon the initial adoption. After the adoption of this new accounting standard, the Company measures its available-for-sale equity securities at fair value with gains or losses recorded through the income statements, which could vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The impact of applying this new standard for the first quarter of 2018 resulted in a decrease of approximately RMB0.7 billion in net income, net of tax of RMB0.1 billion.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects the net revenue growth to continue at a year-on-year rate of approximately 12%-17%, which is calculated on the estimated net revenue of the second quarter of 2018 under the new revenue recognition standard and the net revenue of the second quarter of 2017 retrospectively adjusted. This forecast reflects Ctrip's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nConference Call\nCtrip's management team will host a conference call at 8:00PM U.S. Eastern Time on May 22, 2018 (or 8:00AM on May 23, 2018 in the Shanghai/Hong Kong Time) following the announcement.\nThe conference call will be available on Webcast live and replay at http://ir.ctrip.com .

Among other things, quotations from management and the Business Outlook section in this press release, as well as Ctrip's strategic and operational plans, contain . Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, severe or prolonged downturn in the global or Chinese economy, general declines or disruptions in the travel industry, volatility in the trading price of Ctrip's ADSs, Ctrip's reliance on its relationships and contractual arrangements with travel suppliers and strategic alliances, failure to compete against new and existing competitors, failure to successfully manage current growth and potential future growth, risks associated with any strategic investments or acquisitions, seasonality in the travel industry in the relevant jurisdictions where Ctrip operates, failure to successfully develop Ctrip's existing or future business lines, damage to or failure of Ctrip's infrastructure and technology, loss of services of Ctrip's key executives, adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government, inflation in China, risks and uncertainties associated with PRC laws and regulations with respect to the ownership structure of Ctrip's affiliated Chinese entities and the contractual arrangements among Ctrip, its affiliated Chinese entities and their shareholders, and other risks outlined in Ctrip's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Ctrip's management believes the non-GAAP financial measures facilitate better understanding of operating results from quarter to quarter and provide management with a better capability to plan and forecast future periods.\nNon-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for GAAP results. A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures is that non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charges and fair value changes of equity securities investments that have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in Ctrip's business for the foreseeable future.\nReconciliations of Ctrip's non-GAAP financial data to the most comparable GAAP data included in the consolidated statement of operations are included at the end of this press release.\nAbout Ctrip.com International, Ltd.\nCtrip.com International, Ltd. is a leading travel service provider of accommodation reservation, transportation ticketing, packaged tours, and corporate travel management in China.
