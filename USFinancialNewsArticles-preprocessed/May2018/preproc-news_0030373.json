The increase is primary due to organic growth in the North American Transaction segment, which experienced 27% growth over the prior year.\nTotal transactions dollars processed globally during the first quarter of 2018 were $839 million, an increase of 51% compared to $557 million in the first quarter of 2017 Total transactions dollars processed geographically in North America in Q1 2018 were $642 million, an increase of 37% compared to $470 million in Q1 2017 Total transactions dollars processed in international markets in Q1 2018 were $197 million, an increase of 140% as compared to $82 million in Q1 2017 Total number of transactions processed during the first quarter of 2018 was approximately 30 million, an increase of 11% as compared to 27 million transactions processed during the first quarter of 2017.\nUnited States accounted for 87% of our total revenues, while international revenues were 13% in the first quarter of 2018. Growth across all categories was organic:\nNorth American Transaction Solutions segment: Continued organic growth of small- and medium-sized business (“SMB”) merchants with emphasis on value-added offerings. Revenues for this segment were $14 million, an increase of 27% over the same period of the prior year International Transaction Solutions segment: As a result of the consolidation of Online and Mobile Solutions segments during 2017, revenues for the International Solutions segment were $2 million, a decrease of 22% over the same period of the prior year\n“We are pleased to have made a strong start to the year, becoming more competitive for our sales partners and merchants while continuing to deliver growth,” commented Oleg Firer, CEO of Net Element. “We expect to continue to improve growth across all segments during the year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nCNBC cast member of “Halftime Report” and “Fast Money”, Jon Narjarian joins Board of Directors Appointed seasoned fintech executive Mr. Jonathan Fichman to the Board of Directors CEO, Oleg Firer, joined the Advisory Board of CoinBoost and presented at NASDAQ Market Site Prestigious Enterprise Ethereum Alliance welcomed Net Element to its network of innovative companies Launched Netevia, our proprietary multi-channel payments platform; Netevia to provide same business-day settlement and funding for merchants\nOutlook\nOn February 7, 2018, Net Element launched a future-ready multi-channel payments platform, Netevia. Connecting and simplifying payments across sales channels through a single integration point, Netevia delivers end-to-end payment processing though easy-to-use APIs. This model complements Net Element’s ability to perform in a multi-channel environment, including point-of-sale (POS), e-commerce, and mobile devices.\nNetevia will form part of the recently-announced technology solution to connect with merchants and customers via an efficient blockchain technology enabled transaction processing ecosystem with an ability to build value added service for platforms users.\nNorth America Transaction Solutions segment will continue to lead our growth with focus on improving margin through value-added offerings.\nInternational Transaction Solutions segment will see improvement through its newly launched payment facilitator solution offering for SMB segment.\nAs previously stated in our recent press releases and our filings, the Company is in the best financial position in its history and poised for continued growth. We are pleased to present the progress we have made during the first quarter and are working diligently to increase shareholder value by growing revenues, reducing expenses and creating proprietary payment services technology and services that benefit our merchants and their customers.\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nWe reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1,610,847 or ($0.42) per share 2018 as compared to a net loss of $2,487,498 or ($1.51) per share 2017. This resulted in a decrease in net loss attributable to stockholders of $876,651 primarily due to an increase in revenues and decreases in general and administrative expenses, non-cash compensation, and bad debt expenses.\nAdjusting for non-cash compensation, we have a non-GAAP adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1,528,836, or $0.40 loss per share, for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, as compared to a non-GAAP adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1,891,094, or $1.00 loss per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSource of Revenues Three\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 Mix Three\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 Mix Increase /\n(Decrease) North American Transaction Solution $ 13,966,617 87.4 % $ 10,964,919 80.9 % $ 3,001,698 International Transaction Solutions 2,015,777 12.6 % 2,597,022 19.1 % (581,245 ) Total $ 15,982,394 100.0 % $ 13,561,941 100.0 % $ 2,420,453 Net revenues were $15,982,394 2018 as compared to $13,561,941 2017. The increase was driven by a $3,001,698 increase in net revenues from our North American Transaction Solutions segment due to organic growth, which was partially offset by a $581,245 decrease in net revenues from our International Transaction Solutions segment as we reorganized our international business and consolidated our mobile payments operations with Pay Online.\nGross Margin Three\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 % of\nrevenues Three\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 % of\nrevenues Increase /\n(Decrease) North American Transaction Solution $ 1,902,545 13.6 % $ 1,503,469 13.7 % $ 399,076 International Transaction Solutions 461,515 22.9 % 598,480 23.0 % (136,965 ) Total $ 2,364,060 14.8 % $ 2,101,949 15.5 % $ 262,111 Gross Margin 2018 was $2,364,060, or 14.8% of net revenue, as compared to $2,101,949, or 15.5% of net revenue, 2017. The primary reason gross margin percentage decreased was due to increased business mix from our North American Transaction Solutions segment offset by a decrease in our mobile payments business in our International Transaction Solutions segment that typically had higher margins than North America.\nGeneral and administrative expenses 2018 were $2,446,480 as compared to $2,831,160 2017. The $384,680 reduction in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases in salaries and benefits ($338,787), professional fees ($106,582) and rent ($72,010).\nGeneral and administrative variances increase / (decrease) 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 were as follows:\nCategory North\nAmerican\nTransaction\nSolutions International Transaction\nSolutions Corporate\nExpenses & Eliminations Total Salaries, benefits, taxes and contractor payments $ (103,076 ) $ (72,143 ) $ (163,568 ) $ (338,787 ) Professional fees (54,238 ) (156,664 ) 104,320 (106,582 ) Rent — (56,036 ) (15,974 ) (72,010 ) Business development 51,990 (9,271 ) (1,045 ) 41,674 Travel expense 13,500 (8,798 ) (20,931 ) (16,229 ) Filing fees — — 5,009 5,009 Transaction (gains) losses — 60,591 (698 ) 59,893 Office expenses 29,853 (11,197 ) (61,580 ) (42,924 ) Communications expenses 1,214 7,652 6,170 15,036 Insurance expense — (2,537 ) (12,008 ) (14,545 ) Other expenses (1,326 ) 1,703 84,408 84,785 Total $ (62,083 ) $ (246,700 ) $ (75,897 ) $ (384,680 ) Salaries and benefits were $1,328,923 2108 as compared to $1,667,710 2018. A $300,000 reduction in discretionary bonus and an increase in sales incentives charged to cost of sales versus salaries were the primary reason for the decrease.\nProfessional fees were $567,108 2018 as compared to $673,690 2017. The reduction in professional fees was primarily due to a decrease of $156,664 from the re-organization of our International Transaction Solutions segment operations.\nRent expense was $81,054 2018 as compared to $153,064 2017. The decrease of $72,010 was primarily due to reduction of $56,036 in rent as International Transaction Solutions moved to less expensive office space.\nOther general and administrative expenses were $93,713 2018 as compared to $8,928 2017, representing an increase of $84,785. The increase was caused primarily by an $83,155 increase in corporate franchise taxes in 2018 due to a higher assessment and a credit taken in 2017.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Regulation G Disclosure\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company provides additional measures of its operating results by disclosing its adjusted net loss attributable to Net Element, Inc. stockholders. Adjusted net loss attributable to Net Element, Inc. stockholders is calculated as net loss attributable to Net Element, Inc. stockholders excluding non-cash share-based compensation. Net Element discloses this amount on an aggregate and per share basis. These measures meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that application of these non-GAAP financial measures is appropriate to enhance the understanding by the Company’s investors of its historical performance through use of a metric that seeks to normalize period-to-period earnings.\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to Regulation G, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP 2018 and 2017 is presented in the following Non-GAAP Financial Measures Table.\nGAAP Share-based\nCompensation Adjusted Non-GAAP Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Net (loss) income attributable to Net Element Inc stockholders $ (1,610,847 ) $ 82,011 $ (1,528,836 ) Basic and diluted earnings per share $ (0.42 ) $ 0.02 $ (0.40 ) Basic and diluted shares used in computing earnings per share 3,853,130 3,853,130\nGAAP Share-based\nCompensation Adjusted Non-GAAP Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Net (loss) income attributable to Net Element Inc stockholders $ (2,487,498 ) $ 596,404 $ (1,891,094 ) Basic and diluted earnings per share $ (1.32 ) $ 0.32 $ (1.00 ) Basic and diluted shares used in computing earnings per share 1,890,961 1,890,961 Additional information regarding Net Element’s results for its three months ended March 31, 2018 may be found in Net Element’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which was filed with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 14, 2018 and may be obtained from the SEC’s Internet website at http://www.sec.gov.\nAbout Net Element\nNet Element, Inc.
