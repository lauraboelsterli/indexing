    "text": "Mastercard reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by higher consumer spending on credit and debit cards.\nShares of the company were up 3.5 percent at $186.51 in premarket trading on Wednesday.\nU.S. gross dollar volume (GDV) — the value of transactions processed in the United States, which is also Mastercard's largest market — rose 10.5 percent to $419 billion.\nA rise in customers using its cards internationally also helped drive a 31.8 percent rise in cross-border volumes when converted into dollars.\nNet income rose to $1.49 billion, or $1.41 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $1.08 billion, or $1 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the Purchase, New York-based company earned $1.50 per share, topping analysts' estimates of $1.25 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nOperating expenses rose 43 percent to $1.76 billion, partly from investments in the company's developmental programs.\nNet revenue rose 31 percent to $3.58 billion.",
