    "text": "(Adds details, new year trading)\nLONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - British discount retailer B&M European Value reported a 25 percent rise in full-year profit on Wednesday, saying its cheaper offer was winning over customers in a difficult economic environment.\nThe fast-growing company, which finished the year with 576 B&M stores, reported profit before tax of 229.3 million pounds ($304 million) for the 53 weeks to end-March on sales of 2.98 billion pounds, up 22.4 percent.\nIt said categories such as food and groceries, DIY and pet care performed well, but cold weather in March hit demand for its new 2018 spring and summer ranges, taking the shine off what would have been a very strong second half.\nThe company, which also has a German business, said its British stores B&M in the UK, have delivered a “pleasing trading performance” in the early weeks of the new financial year.\nExcluding the Easter week, it said its UK like-for-like revenue grew 3.1 percent in the first eight weeks of the year.\n“Whilst there are five weeks still to go to the end of the period, we are confident of a solid outcome for the quarter,” the company said.\n$1 = 0.7537 pounds Reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton and Sarah Young\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
