    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ladder Capital Corp (“Ladder” or the “Company”) (NYSE: LADR) today announced the declaration by its Board of Directors of a second quarter 2018 dividend of $0.325 per share of Class A common stock. The cash dividend is payable on July 2, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 11, 2018.\nThis declaration reflects a 3% increase in Ladder’s recurring quarterly cash dividend, effective in the current quarter, to $0.325 per share from $0.315 per share. Since electing to be taxed as a REIT on January 1, 2015, Ladder’s recurring quarterly cash dividend has been increased by 30% in four separate increases.\nLadder expects to review its dividend policy again at year end.\nAbout Ladder\nLadder is an internally-managed real estate investment trust that is a leader in commercial real estate finance. Ladder originates and invests in a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate and real estate-related assets, focusing on senior secured assets. Ladder’s investment activities include: (i) direct origination of commercial real estate first mortgage loans; (ii) investments in investment grade securities secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate; and (iii) investments in net leased and other commercial real estate equity. Founded in 2008, Ladder is run by a highly experienced management team with extensive expertise in all aspects of the commercial real estate industry, including origination, credit, underwriting, structuring, capital markets and asset management. Led by Brian Harris, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Ladder is headquartered in New York City with a West Coast office in Santa Monica.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release may constitute “forward-looking” statements. These statements are based on management’s current opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results.

Actual results, levels of activity, performance, achievements and events could differ materially from those stated, anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements. While Ladder believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results.
