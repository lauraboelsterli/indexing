(“Divestco” or the “Company”), an exploration services company dedicated to providing a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of data, software and services to the oil and gas industry worldwide, today announced its financial and operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nOverall Performance and Operational Results\nFinancial Results (Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts) Three months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 2017 2016 $ Change % Change 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Revenue $ 3,323 $ 7,679 $ (4,356 ) -57 % $ 12,755 $ 15,966 $ (3,211 ) -20 % Operating Expenses (1) 3,044 2,501 543 22 % 11,424 10,141 1,283 13 % Other Loss (Gain) 50 18 32 178 % (756 ) 80 (836 ) N/A EBITDA (2) 229 5,160 (4,931 ) -96 % 2,087 5,745 (3,658 ) -64 % Finance Costs 403 236 167 71 % 1,634 1,305 329 25 % Depreciation and Amortization (3) 1,610 1,627 (17 ) -1 % 7,995 6,377 1,618 25 % Net Loss $ (1,784 ) $ 3,297 $ (5,081 ) N/A $ (7,542 ) $ (1,937 ) $ (5,605 ) N/A Per Share - Basic and Diluted (0.03 ) 0.05 (0.08 ) N/A (0.11 ) (0.03 ) (0.08 ) N/A Funds from (used in) Operations $ 253 $ 4,136 $ (3,883 ) -94 % $ 1,098 $ 4,703 $ (3,605 ) -77 % Per Share - Basic and Diluted - 0.06 (0.06 ) -100 % 0.02 0.07 (0.05 ) -71 % Class A Shares Outstanding 66,133 66,884 N/A N/A 66,133 66,884 N/A N/A Weighted Average Shares Outstanding Basic and Diluted 66,180 67,150 N/A N/A 66,565 67,217 N/A N/A\n(1) Includes salaries & benefits, general & administrative expenses and share-based payments but excludes depreciation and amortization and other losses (income)\n(2) See the “Non GAAP Measures” section of the Company’s Management Discussion and Analysis filed on the Company’s website and on SEDAR\n(3) Increase in 2017 from 2016 is due to a new seismic survey completed in Q1 2017. The Company’s policy is to amortize 40% of the cost of a new seismic survey in the period of data delivery.\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nDivestco generated revenue of $3.3 million in Q4 2017 compared to $7.7 million in Q4 2016, a decrease of $4.4 million (56%) which was mainly due to lower seismic data library sales partially offset by higher Services and Software & Data revenues. Revenue in the Seismic Data segment ($0.7 million) decreased by $5.6 million (89%) as there no new seismic participation surveys in Q4 2107. Revenue in the Software & Data segment ($1.8 million) increased by $1.0 million (125%) due to a large log data sale. Revenue in the Services segment ($0.9 million) increased by $0.3 million (50%) due to additional international projects.\nOperating expenses increased by $0.5 million (22%) to $3.0 million in Q4 2017 from $2.5 million in Q4 2016. Salaries increased by $0.4 million (36%) due to the expiry of certain austerity measures put in place in 2016. G&A expenses increased by $81,000 (7%) due to an increase in stock-based compensation, as well as software licences and contractor fees and an increase in bad debts partially offset by lower discretionary expenses.\nFinance costs increased by $167,000 (71%) to $403,000 in Q4 2017 from $236,000 in Q4 2016 due to a new term loan secured in March 2017. While debt levels are lower at December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, a portion of the term loan was not repaid until December 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization was $1.6 million in Q4 2017 compared to $1.6 million in Q4 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2016\nDivestco generated revenue of $12.8 million during 2017 compared to $16.0 million in 2016, a decrease of $3.2 million (20%). During 2017, Seismic Data, Services, and Software & Data had lower revenue. Revenue in the Seismic Data segment ($6.4 million) decreased by $2.9 million (31%) mainly due to lower seismic participation revenue. Revenue in the Software & Data segment ($3.9 million) decreased by $0.2 million (5%) mainly due to reduced industry activity. Revenue in the Services segment ($2.4 million) decreased by $0.2 million (8%) mainly due to delays in the awarding of new contracts on successful bids. These projects are expected to be completed by Q2 2018. The Company recognized gains of $0.5 million in 2017 for the sale of shares in one of its investees and $0.3 million in 2017 for the sale of intangible assets.\nOperating expenses increased by $1.3 million (13%) to $11.4 million in 2017 from $10.1 million in 2016. Salaries increased by $0.9 million (16%) due to the expiry of certain austerity measures put in place in 2016. G&A expenses increased by $0.3 million (6%) due to an increase in occupancy costs and stock-based compensation partially offset by lower bad debt expenses.\nFinance costs increased by $0.3 million (25%) to $1.6 million in 2017 from $1.3 million in 2016 due to higher debt levels as the Company entered into a new term loan agreement in March 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $1.6 million (25%) to $8.0 million from $6.4 million in 2016 mainly due to the addition of new seismic data in March 2017 which commenced in Q4 2016.\nFinancial Position (1)\nAs at December 31, 2017, Divestco had an adjusted working capital deficiency of $3.7 million (December 31, 2016: $3.9 million deficiency), excluding deferred revenue of $1.6 million (December 31, 2016: $1.7 million). The decrease in the adjusted working capital deficiency from the end of 2016 was due to the repayment of a bridge loan in March 2017, which was replaced by a long-term debt facility and positive funds from operations.\n(1) See the “Non GAAP Measures” section of the Company’s Management Discussion and Analysis filed on the Company’s website and on SEDAR\nOperations Update and Outlook\nThe improvement in West Texas Intermediate oil prices in 2018 is expected to have a positive impact on capital spending by the industry in later part of the year. As access to capital remains challenging in Canada, Divestco continues to pursue international opportunities and continues to be awarded new projects. To mitigate the continued pressure on the domestic oil and gas market, the Company recently announced the formation of two new joint arrangements with Bird River Resources Inc., an oil and gas E&P company. The first is a cogeneration project set up to generate up to three megawatts of low-cost electricity. The natural gas required for the cogeneration project will be supplied by a company controlled by two of the directors of Divestco. The other is a cryptocurrency mining operation. It is expected that these projects will generate additional cash flows for the companies. Divestco is also expected to benefit from the addition the new computer hardware required for the cryptocurrency mining activity in its seismic processing division. Both activities are heavily reliant on high-volume data processing.\nMr. Stephen Popadynetz, CEO and President commented: “Despite significantly improved oil prices, Divestco has actually seen a reduction of project work domestically and our industry now appears to be entering stagnation. We have come to the realization that the bottlenecks caused by the political climate we are in is beyond our control and focusing on international projects and pursuing new revenue streams within our existing operations is the best way we can assure new growth. As such, Divestco has taken a bold leap to commence a cogeneration energy project and to leverage its substantial infrastructure into cryptocurrency mining. We have completed our initial proof of concept phase for both projects and are now beginning the first phase of commercial implementation. We have also commenced a Blockchain scoping project in the seismic industry and look forward to presenting this to our clients for full industry review and buy in. We continue to see interest in our stable of products and services; however, many of our clients have delayed spending on exploration given the current environment. If the Western Canadian industry can secure the political stability it needs to grow, this backlog is expected to quickly convert into paying projects and substantially grow our existing business lines. We remain optimistic that a solution will be found to realize the immense potential of the Alberta economy and coupled with our new business lines, enable Divestco to exit 2018 stronger and better than ever.”\nAbout the Company\nDivestco is an exploration services company that provides a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of data, software, and services to the oil and gas industry.
