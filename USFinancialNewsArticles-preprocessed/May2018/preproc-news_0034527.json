    "text": "May 14, 2018 / 1:32 PM / in 7 minutes UPDATE 4-IMF says supports Argentina floating exchange rate as peso tumbles Reuters Staff\n(Recasts first paragraph with IMF statement about conditions, updates prices, adds details on Lebac auction)\nBy Walter Bianchi and Luc Cohen\nBUENOS AIRES, May 14 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Monday a target exchange rate for the peso will not be a condition of a financing deal with Argentina, as the currency opened more than 6 percent weaker at a record low of 24.90 per U.S. dollar.\nArgentina requested a “high access stand-by arrangement” from the IMF last week after the peso depreciated rapidly, prompting the central bank to sell reserves and hike interest rates to 40 percent in a bid to contain one of the world’s highest inflation rates as well as stop the peso slide.\nThe bank continued selling foreign currency reserves on Monday, traders said, offering $5 billion at the open. After selling $500 million, the monetary authority withdrew the offer, traders said. During all of last week, the peso weakened 6.30 percent, and for the first 11 days of May it weakened 12.03 percent.\nThe currency then pared losses and was trading at 24.56 as of 12:36 p.m. local time (1536 GMT). The Merval stock index opened 0.7 percent lower on Monday before rising somewhat to trade flat.\nIn a statement, an IMF spokesman said the Fund had not discussed any specific target for the exchange rate with Argentine authorities during negotiations in Washington.\n“Argentina has a floating, market-determined exchange rate, and we fully support that,” the spokesman said. “The exchange rate should continue to be determined by market forces, with the central bank continuing to use all the policy tools that are at its disposal.”\nIn an earlier statement, the IMF said its board would discuss Argentina at an informal board meeting scheduled for Friday. The Fund said that meeting was “part of our usual process of briefing the board on negotiations for high access IMF programs.” POLITICAL RISKS\nWeak fundamentals, skittishness regarding devaluation and concern over Argentina’s drought-hit soy harvest are pressuring the peso lower.\nTraders were also looking ahead to the maturity of 670 billion pesos ($27.32 billion) worth of central bank notes known as Lebacs on Tuesday, representing more than half the total stock of outstanding Lebacs and 67 percent of the monetary base.\nInterest rates on the notes have been rising in secondary markets, as the bank is widely expected to hike rates in Tuesday’s auction to entice traders to roll over their maturing notes.\n“The possibility of a complete renewal of the maturing (Lebacs) is not expected,” consultancy Portfolio Personal said in a note, adding that in the four auctions so far this year, 14 percent of maturing Lebacs had not been renewed.\nThe IMF negotiations carry political risks for President Mauricio Macri. Many Argentines blame IMF-backed policies of the late 1990s for the country’s 2001-2002 economic meltdown. Some opposition politicians and activists have voiced concerns that the deal being drawn up in Washington will require painful fiscal belt tightening.\nUnions marched through the city center on Monday to protest the IMF deal and Macri’s increases in utilities prices, part of his effort to reduce the fiscal deficit.\nIn a statement, Macri’s office said he had spoken by phone with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday morning, and that Trump had said he supported Macri’s discussions with the IMF. The United States has the most voting power of any IMF member country, with 16.5 percent of the votes.
