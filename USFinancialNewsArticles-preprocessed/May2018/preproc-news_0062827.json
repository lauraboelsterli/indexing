    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 7:35 PM / Updated an hour ago Tennis-Serena shows plenty of fight to subdue Barty Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nPARIS, May 31 (Reuters) - The “warrior princess” inside Serena Williams came out in full fighting mode on Thursday as the American proved she was no pushover in a Grand Slam with her 3-6 6-3 6-4 French Open second round win over Ashleigh Barty.\nThe rankings show Serena as only the 451st best player in the world and her nine-month-old daughter Alexis Olympia will need a few years to appreciate what her mum’s day job is.\nBut anyone foolish enough to think that motherhood would kill off Williams’ competitive edge got a rude reminder about why the 23-times Grand Slam champion is considered one of the sport’s all-time great athletes.\nA set and a break down, it looked like Williams’ comeback slam following her maternity break would end in the second round against the 17th seeded Australian.\nBut when Serena slammed a crosscourt forehand winner into an open court to break back in the next game, the roar that rocked Philippe Chatrier Court told the world she was not done yet.\nSo it proved just over an hour later as Serena was roaring again and holding her arms aloft in triumph after setting up a third round showdown with Germany’s 11th seed Julia Goerges.
