    "text": "Memorial Day kicks off the summer vacation season, with crowds eager to take advantage of the three-day holiday weekend and warming weather.\nEver wonder where most people are jetting off to? Priceline analyzed its current bookings for May 25 to May 28 to determine the most popular destinations for Memorial Day weekend 2018, revealing that most travelers are opting for city getaways as opposed to beach escapes.\n\"Travelers can often secure discounts on city travel,\" says Brigit Zimmerman, senior vice president of flight, hotel and packages at Priceline. \"Visiting coastal cities like L.A. and Miami gives you the option to do both at once. Memorial Day weekend provides a perfect opportunity to explore and deals abound.\"\nHere are this year's most popular Memorial Day hot spots, according to Priceline.\n1. Chicago, Illinois\nScoring the top spot on Priceline's list is the Windy City. Chicago offers a bustling city scene — with award-winning dining, scores of museums and epic shopping along its Magnificent Mile — as well as fun, lakeshore views via Navy Pier. One of the most popular tourist attractions of the city is its Chicago Architecture River Cruise tour.\n2. Las Vegas, Nevada\nVisitors to Sin City can expect a plethora of parties going down Memorial Day weekend, as well as performances from musicians including Jennifer Lopez and Celine Dion. Other fun things to do in Vegas include checking out the nearby Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area or The Neon Museum.\n3. Atlanta, Georgia\nThis southern hot spot also ranked 18th on Priceline's ranking for the Top Growing Destinations for Memorial Day Weekend 2018, based on comparison data between 2017 and 2018 Priceline bookings. Atlanta is rich in history — visitors can check out the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site as well as the Center for Civil and Human Rights. And sport fanatics shouldn't miss the College Football Hall of Fame.\n4. Los Angeles, California\nL.A. is a good option for jet-setters who want to squeeze in a little sunshine over the holiday weekend. It has a growing art scene, trendy restaurants and popular tourist attractions include Rodeo Drive, Santa Monica Pier and beach, the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Sunset Boulevard.\n5. Orlando, Florida\nSunny Orlando is home to Walt Disney World, a favorite vacation choice for both families and Disney fanatics alike. However, the city also offers attractions outside its famous theme parks, and is a popular spot for golfers and nature-lovers.\n6. Boston, Massachusetts\nThis East Coast hub, rich in history and culture, also recently claimed the top spot on U.S. News & World Report's ranking for Best Summer Vacation Destinations, making it a must-see this season.

Other fun things to do in this beach city include checking out its vibrant Wynwood art, shopping and food scene as well as nearby, Everglades airboat tours.\n9.
