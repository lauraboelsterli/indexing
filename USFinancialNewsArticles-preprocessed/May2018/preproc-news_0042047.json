    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will travel to China next week to help finalize a trade agreement after Washington and Beijing reached an initial framework last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday.\n“Secretary Ross has to go over and turn that into a signed piece of paper with companies,” Mnuchin told reporters at the White House. “This is not a government-to-government purchase order, but we have an agreement with them as to what will be executed.” (Reporting by Susan Heavey Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n ",
