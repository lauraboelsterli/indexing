    "text": "May 7 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc reported an 7.4 percent fall in quarterly profit on Monday, as the No. 1 U.S. meat processor felt the brunt of higher freight costs and gave one time cash bonuses to employees as a result of benefits from changes in the U.S. tax law.\nNet income attributable to the company fell to $315 million, or 85 cents per share, in quarter ended March 31, from $340 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.\nThe Springdale, Arkansas-based company said its sales rose to $9.77 billion from $9.08 billion last year.
