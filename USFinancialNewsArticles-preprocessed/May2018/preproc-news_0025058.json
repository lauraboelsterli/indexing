    "text": "CINCINNATI, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The board of directors of The E.W. Scripps Company (NYSE: SSP) has declared a cash dividend for the second quarter of 2018.\nScripps shareholders of record as of June 15, 2018, will receive 5 cents per share, payable on June 25, 2018. The dividend will be paid out of the company's capital surplus.\nThe second-quarter dividend follows the company's first-quarter cash dividend initiated in February 2018 and paid in March.\n\"Our board's continuation of a quarterly dividend reflects its strong belief in Scripps' transformation strategy and the priority we place on returning value to shareholders,\" said Scripps President and CEO Adam Symson. \"Our solid first-quarter performance, combined with the tangible results we are seeing from the plan we laid out last year, is creating meaningful value for our shareholders in the near- and long-term.\"\nWhile the company intends to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed quarterly and declared by the board at its discretion. The declaration and payment of future dividends will be dependent upon, among other things, the company's financial position, results of operations, cash flow and other factors.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements related to the company's businesses that are based on management's current expectations.
