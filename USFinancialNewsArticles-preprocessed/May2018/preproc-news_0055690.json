Reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA:\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: (i) income tax expense; (ii) gain on insurance proceeds; (iii) other income (iv) interest expense; (v) depreciation expense; (vi) acquisition related amortization expense; and (vii) acquisition related compensation expenses, which include retention bonuses and restricted stock. Our method of calculating adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our own operating performance and as an integral part of our planning process. We present adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure because we believe such measure is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance. We believe this measure is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings (losses), net earnings (loss) from continuing operations or cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP.\n($ in thousands) Thirteen Weeks Ended May 5, April 29, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (8,147 ) $ 3,533 Income tax expense 4 54 Gain on insurance proceeds - (8,835 ) Other income (79 ) (15 ) Interest expense 64 56 Operating loss (8,158 ) (5,207 ) Depreciation expense 1,261 2,252 Acquisition related amortization expense 971 971 Acquisition related compensation expense 1,122 909 Adjusted EBITDA $ (4,804 ) $ (1,075 ) The Company believes that etailz adjusted income from operations, per the segment disclosure, when considered together with its GAAP financial results, provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of its business operating results, including underlying trends, by excluding the effects of certain charges. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings (losses), net earnings (loss) from continuing operations or cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTrans World Entertainment is a leading multi-channel retail, blending a 40-year history of entertainment retail experience with digital marketplace expertise.
