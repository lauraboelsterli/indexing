    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of the liver targeted SCD1 modulator Aramchol™, a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, today provides updated information reaffirming the schedule of the release of the ARREST study top line results and reports financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company will host a conference call and webcast at 08:30 a.m. ET today.\nBusiness Update\nARREST Phase IIb NASH study:\nPhase IIb top line results for Aramchol™ in 247 NASH patients are expected, as planned during June 2018. All patients completed treatment during the last week of February and the follow-up period is scheduled to end this month. Preparations for a pre-phase III meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the fourth quarter of 2018 are ongoing. In April 2018, the Company sold to Biotechnology Value Fund, L.P. 1,000,000 ordinary shares and warrants to purchase 1,000,000 ordinary shares, for a purchase price of $6.00 per share and related warrant. The warrants have an exercise price of $15.00 per share and will expire one year from the date of issuance. The proceeds of this financing are intended to be used for working capital needs, clinical development, business development activities and the advancement of the Company's ongoing pipeline activities. The Company is conducting pre-clinical studies of Aramchol™ in combination with advanced clinical stage representative anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic compounds for the treatment of NASH. The Company intends to submit data related to these combinations for presentation at The Liver Meeting®, to take place on November 9-13, 2018 in San Francisco.\nFinancial Summary - First Quarter 2018 vs. First Quarter 2017:\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $15.5 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $19.0 million at December 31, 2017. As mentioned above, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company raised gross proceeds of $6.0 million in a registered direct offering. Galmed believes that its current cash balance will be sufficient to maintain its current operations through the first half of 2020. Net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.17 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $3.2 million, or $0.26 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This period's net loss included $0.3 million of non-cash, stock-based compensation expense, versus $0.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense incurred during the corresponding period in 2017. The Company recognized $0.3 million of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018, the same amount as in the corresponding quarter in 2017. The revenue relates to the amortization of the up-front payments under the license agreement with Samil Pharm. Research and development (\"R&D\") expenses amounted to approximately $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to approximately $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in expenses in connection with the ARREST study. General and administrative expenses amounted to approximately $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to approximately $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The slight increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 resulted primarily from an increase in professional fees. Financial expenses amounted to $0.05 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to financial income of $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from changes in the foreign currency exchange rate.\nConference Call & Webcast:\nWednesday, May 9 th @ 8:30am Eastern Time\nWithin the US:\n800-239-9838\nOutside the US:\n323-794-2551\nFrom Israel:\n1809-212-883\nConference ID:\n4575906\nWebcast:\nhttp://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129551\nReplays, available through May 23, 2017\nToll-Free:\n844-512-2921\nToll/International:\n412-317-6671\nReplay PIN:\n4575906\nAbout Aramchol and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)\nAramchol (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, inducing beneficial modulation of intra-hepatic lipid metabolism. Aramchol's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating downregulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol on fibrosis is mediated by downregulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol has been granted Fast Track designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH.\nNASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\nAbout Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGalmed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of Aramchol, a first in class, novel, once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of NASH for variable populations. Galmed is currently conducting the ARREST Study, a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol in subjects with NASH, who are overweight or obese, and who are pre-diabetic or type-II-diabetic. More information about the ARREST Study may be found on ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02279524.\nGALMED PHARMACEUTICALS LTD.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nU.S. Dollars in thousands, except share data and per share data\nAs of\nMarch 31,\n2018\nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2017\nUnaudited\nAudited\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,631\n$\n13,021\nMarketable securities\n12,871\n5,976\nOther accounts receivable\n365\n155\nTotal current assets\n15,867\n19,152\nProperty and equipment, net\n433\n491\nTotal assets\n$\n16,300\n$\n19,643\nLiabilities and stockholders' equity\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade payables\n$\n2,196\n$\n2,276\nOther accounts payable\n232\n1,034\nShort-term portion of deferred revenue\n270\n538\nTotal current liabilities\n2,698\n3,848\nStockholders' equity:\nOrdinary shares par value NIS 0.01 per share; Authorized 50,000,000; Issued and outstanding: 14,472,414 shares as of March 31, 2018; 14,435,161 shares as of December 31, 2017\n40\n40\nAdditional paid-in capital\n92,723\n92,381\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(36)\n(7)\nAccumulated deficit\n(79,125)\n(76,619)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n13,602\n15,795\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$\n16,300\n$\n19,643\nGALMED PHARMACEUTICALS LTD.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited)\nU.S. Dollars in thousands, except share data and per share data\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n268\n$\n268\nResearch and development expenses\n1,944\n2,743\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n883\n789\nTotal operating expenses\n2,559\n3,264\nFinancial income, net\n(53)\n(102)\nNet loss\n$\n2,506\n$\n3,162\nBasic and diluted net loss per share from continuing operation\n$\n0.17\n$\n0.26\nWeighted-average number of shares outstanding used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share\n14,467,627\n12,164,983\nGALMED PHARMACEUTICALS LTD.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited)\nU.S. Dollars in thousands\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nCash flow from operating activities\nNet loss\n$\n(2,506)\n$\n(3,162)\nAdjustments required to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities\nDepreciation and amortization\n59\n60\nStock-based compensation expense\n330\n361\nAmortization of discount/premium on marketable securities\n9\n(140)\nLoss from Realization of marketable securities\n3\n78\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nIncrease in other accounts receivable\n(210)\n(52)\nDecrease in trade payables\n(80)\n(584)\nDecrease in other accounts payable\n(802)\n(167)\nDecrease in deferred revenue\n(268)\n(268)\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(3,465)\n(3,874)\nCash flow from investing activities\nPurchase of property and equipment\n(1)\n(7)\nInvestment in available for sale securities\n(8,185)\n-\nConsideration from sale of available for sale securities\n1,249\n2,444\nNet cash provided in (used in) investing activities\n(6,937)\n2,437\nCash flow from financing activities\nProceeds from exercise of options\n12\n-\nNet cash used in financing activities\n12\n-\nDecrease in cash and cash equivalents\n(10,390)\n(1,437)\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\n13,021\n3,097\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n$\n2,631\n$\n1,660\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information:\nCash received from interest\n$\n46\n88\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis press release may include forward-looking statements.
