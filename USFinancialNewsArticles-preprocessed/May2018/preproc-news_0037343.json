    "text": "WINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Coffee fans can celebrate the upcoming royal wedding of Prince Harry to actress Meghan Markle by sipping a special type of hot drink - the “Megharrycino”.\nA bakery in the picturesque town of Windsor, where Britain’s sixth-in-line to the throne will marry his American fiancée on Saturday, is serving up cappuccino and latte coffees topped with a frothy portrait of the couple.\nSurrounded by Union Jack bunting and a large cut-out of the pair, baristas at Heidi’s bakery use a special machine to reproduce an image of one of Harry and Markle’s engagement pictures onto the froth with coffee.\nPriced at 4.50 pounds ($6), the drinks, which Heidi bakery co-owner of Edward Durkin described as “unique”, are more expensive than usual coffees but were proving popular on Wednesday morning with a steady stream of customers ordering them.\n“I’m afraid to spoil it,” customer Ann Brooker, 78, said, hesitant to drink her coffee at first before tucking in. “That’s the nearest to a kiss you’re going to get from Harry,” her husband Alan joked.\n($1 = 0.7424 pounds)\nAn image of Britain's Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle is seen on top of a cup of coffee being sold ahead of their forthcoming wedding in Windsor, Britain, May 16, 2018.
