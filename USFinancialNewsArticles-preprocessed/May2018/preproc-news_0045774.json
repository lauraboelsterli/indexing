    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 7:02 PM / Updated an hour ago UEFA to turn down AC Milan's request for fair play settlement agreement - source Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMILAN (Reuters) - UEFA will turn down a request by Italian football club AC Milan for a settlement agreement regarding a breach of financial fair play rules, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: AC Milan's flag waves in front of San Siro stadium in Milan April 29, 2015, ITALY. REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo/File Photo\nUnder UEFA regulations, any European football club spending more than its generated revenue faces possible sanctions, including, in certain circumstances, a ban from playing.\nMilan asked UEFA to exercise its right to waive the rules after Chinese entrepreneur Li Yonghong bought the club from Italian holding company Fininvest.\nU.S. private equity fund Elliott last year gave Li a 180 million euro (Â£157.8 million) lifeline to complete the purchase of the Serie A club, which is trying to emerge from years of losses with a turnaround plan.\nUEFA was not immediately available for a comment.
