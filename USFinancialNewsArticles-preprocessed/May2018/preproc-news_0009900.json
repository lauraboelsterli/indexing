Therefore, past periods will not be adjusted, thus impacting comparability of figures to prior year.\n“We are pleased with our results in the first quarter across nearly all facets of our business plan. Our financial results were strong and continue to improve in terms of organic same store revenue trends, our acquisition activity was robust, and we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share,” said Michael E. Reed, New Media President and Chief Executive Officer. “From a financial standpoint the first quarter was quite good, with Revenue, As Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow all increasing by double digits versus first quarter last year on a reported basis. This performance was driven by our accretive acquisitions and the organic growth we are realizing in our newer businesses, particularly UpCurve and GateHouse Live.”\n“An important measure for us is the organic same store revenue trend. We are very pleased to report that we saw improvement in this trend for the second consecutive quarter. First quarter same store revenues, excluding the $1.4 million impact of ASC Topic 606, were down 4.5%, as compared to 5.6% in Q4 last year and 6.4% in Q3 last year We are excited about the direction we are moving, and the impact that our investments in growth initiatives are having on our overall performance.”\n“2018 is off to a great start from an acquisition standpoint, too. We have closed $112.5 million in newspaper acquisitions this year to date. All of these deals fit within our acquisition criteria, and valuation expectations. Further, our new markets are outstanding and we are very optimistic about the growth potential for UpCurve and GateHouse Live in these new markets. We also expect to close another $20-$25 million in acquisitions before the end of the second quarter. Finally, the pipeline for future deals remains strong.”\n“Our new business initiatives all experienced very nice growth in the quarter. UpCurve, GateHouse Live and our promotions business all grew at rates of more than 25%. We expect these growth rates to continue and in some cases improve as the year goes on.”\n“When we look at our newly acquired businesses, combined with the strong and improving financial performance we are seeing, it gives us great optimism with regard to our opportunity to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNew Media recorded total revenues of $340.8 million for the quarter, up 10.8% to the prior year, and down 4.5% on an organic same store basis, excluding the $1.4 million impact of ASC Topic 606. This was an improvement of 110bps from the fourth quarter organic same store trend. Traditional Print Advertising decreased 12.3% on an organic same store basis. Over the past four quarters, this trend has held stable, declining in a 12-14% range.\nDigital revenue increased 23.3% on a reported basis from the prior year to $38.6 million, or grew 27.8% excluding the $1.4 million impact of ASC Topic 606. UpCurve generated $19.4 million in revenue, an increase of 27.0% to the prior year on a reported basis. Excluding the $1.4 million impact of ASC Topic 606, UpCurve performance increased 36.3% to the prior year.\nCirculation revenue declined 1.6% on an organic same store basis. With regards to consumer marketing, we are making some new strategic investments that we believe will lead to growth and that we expect to be realized in our performance later in 2018 and 2019. Commercial Print, Distribution and Events revenue increased 5.8% to the prior year on an organic same store basis, with promotions and GateHouse Live being a large contributor to this growth.\nOperating income was $7.1 million and Net loss was $0.7 million.\nAs Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow were $32.5 million and $22.5 million, respectively.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Dividend\nNew Media’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2018 cash dividend of $0.37 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on May 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 14, 2018.\nThe declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, which may decide to change the Company’s dividend policy at any time.\nShare Repurchase Extension\nNew Media’s Board of Directors authorized an extension of the Company’s previously announced authorization to repurchase up to $100 million of the Company's common stock (the \"Share Repurchase Program\") through May 18, 2019.

The Company is one of the largest publishers of locally based print and online media in the United States as measured by our 144 daily publications. As of April 1, 2018, New Media operates in over 565 markets across 38 states reaching over 23 million people on a weekly basis and serves over 219,000 business customers.\nFor more information regarding New Media and to be added to our email distribution list, please visit www.newmediainv.com .\nSame Store and Organic Same Store Revenues\nSame store results take into account material acquisitions and divestitures of the Company by adjusting prior year performance to include or exclude financial results as if the Company had owned or divested a business for the comparable period. The results of several acquisitions (“tuck-in acquisitions”) were funded from the Company’s available cash and are not considered material. Organic same store revenues are same store revenues adjusted to remove non-material acquisitions and non-material divestitures, and to adjust for Commercial Print revenues that are now intercompany.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company strongly urges stockholders and other interested persons not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, these non-GAAP measures, as presented in this press release, may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit), interest/financing expense, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash impairments. The Company defines As Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA before transaction and project costs, merger and acquisition related costs, integration and reorganization costs, gain/loss on sale or disposal of assets, non-cash items such as non-cash compensation, and Adjusted EBITDA from non-wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as As Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, cash taxes, interest paid, and pension payments.\nManagement’s Use of Adjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to income from operations, net income (loss), cash flow from continuing operating activities or any other measure of performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. New Media’s management believes these non-GAAP measures, as defined above, are useful to investors for the following reasons:\nEvaluating performance and identifying trends in day-to-day performance because the items excluded have little or no significance on the Company’s day-to-day operations; and Providing assessments of controllable expenses that afford management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow as measures of our deployed revenue generating assets between periods on a consistent basis. We believe As Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow measure our financial performance and help identify operational factors that management can impact in the short term, mainly our operating cost structure and expenses. We exclude mergers and acquisition, transaction, and project related costs such as diligence activities and new financing related costs because they represent costs unrelated to the day-to-day operating performance of the business that management can impact in the short term. We consider the loss on early extinguishment of debt to be financing related costs associated with interest expense or amortization of financing fees, which by definition are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Such charges are incidental to, but not reflective of our day-to-day operating performance of the business that management can impact in the short term.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain items in this press release may constitute within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our ability to deliver on our investment thesis and execute on our operational strategy and growth initiatives, including growing our digital and events businesses, our ability to complete the anticipated acquisitions and disposition described in this press release and the anticipated timing of closing such acquisitions and disposition, the availability of future acquisitions and strategic opportunities, finding, pursuing and completing future acquisitions and strategic opportunities and the benefits associated with such opportunities, including our ability to grow our digital and events businesses in newly acquired markets, our ability to pay continue to deliver shareholder returns, expected revenue trends, including expectations for revenue growth in our digital, events, circulation and consumer marketing businesses, and the impact of such growth on organic same store revenue trends, our ability to realize growth from our investments in consumer marketing, the amount, timing and manner of the Company’s repurchase of its shares pursuant to the stock repurchase program described above and our ability to identify, implement, and realize expense savings. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, such as continued declines in traditional revenue categories, economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, competition from other media companies, the possibility of insufficient interest in our digital business, technological developments in the media sector, an ability to source acquisition opportunities with an attractive risk-adjusted return profile, inadequate diligence of acquisition targets, and difficulties integrating and reducing expenses, including at our newly acquired businesses.
