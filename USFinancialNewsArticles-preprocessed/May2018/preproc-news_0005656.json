    "text": "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MyoKardia, Inc. (Nasdaq:MYOK), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach for the treatment of heritable cardiovascular diseases, today announced that it will report first quarter 2018 financial and operating results after the U.S. financial markets close on Tuesday, May 8, 2018. Management will host a conference call and live audio webcast to discuss these results and provide a business update at 4:30 p.m. ET (1:30 p.m. PT).\nConference Call and Webcast\nAnalysts and investors are invited to participate in the conference call by dialing 844-494-0193 (domestic) or 508-637-5584 (international) using the conference ID 1678364.\nThe webcast may be accessed live on the Investor Relations section of MyoKardia’s website at http://investors.myokardia.com . A replay of the webcast will be available on the MyoKardia website for 90 days following the call.\nAbout MyoKardia\nMyoKardia is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach to discover, develop and commercialize targeted therapies for the treatment of serious and rare cardiovascular diseases. MyoKardia’s initial focus is on the treatment of heritable cardiomyopathies, a group of rare, genetically driven forms of heart failure that result from biomechanical defects in cardiac muscle contraction. MyoKardia has used its precision medicine platform to generate a pipeline of therapeutic programs for the chronic treatment of two of the most prevalent forms of heritable cardiomyopathy – hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MyoKardia’s most advanced product candidate is mavacamten (formerly MYK-461), a novel, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin intended to reduce hypercontractility. Mavacamten is advancing into a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, known as EXPLORER-HCM in patients with symptomatic, obstructive HCM. MyoKardia is also developing mavacamten in a second indication, non-obstructive HCM, in the Phase 2 MAVERICK clinical trial. MYK-491, MyoKardia’s second product candidate, is designed to increase cardiac output in DCM patients by increasing the overall extent of the heart’s contraction cardiac contractility. MyoKardia is currently evaluating MYK-491 in a Phase 1b study in DCM patients. A cornerstone of the MyoKardia platform is the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), a multi-center, international repository of clinical and laboratory data on individuals and families with genetic heart disease, which MyoKardia helped form in 2014. MyoKardia’s mission is to change the world for patients with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.\nContacts:\nMichelle Corral\nCorporate Communications & Investor Relations\nMyoKardia, Inc.\n650-351-4690\nmcorral@myokardia.com\nBeth DelGiacco (Investors)\nStern Investor Relations, Inc.\n212-362-1200\nbeth@sternir.com\nSource:MyoKardia, Inc.",
