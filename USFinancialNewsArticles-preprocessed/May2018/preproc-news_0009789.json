    "text": "TORONTO and AUSTIN, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EEStor Corporation (the \"Company\") (TSX-Venture:ESU) announced today that Bryan Kelly, Production Manager, and Dr. Abhijit Paul, Principal Polymer Scientist, have been promoted to the newly created positions of Vice President Production and Vice President Research and Development of operating subsidiary EEStor, Inc., respectively.\n\"These senior appointments will assure the Company continues on a path of rapid growth under highly effective operational and scientific management. Both Bryan and Abhi’s track records speak for themselves as they have guided the Company through dramatic improvements in its scientific approach, quality controls and protocols. Bryan has successfully revamped our third-party certification processes to ensure the most accurate and unassailable results possible. This work is critical to support the assessment of our technology by potential licensees. And Abhi has built a team that is pushing into new territory for our technology and the results are compelling on many levels,\" said Ian Clifford, Founder and Chief Executive Officer.\n\"The promotion of Abhi and Bryan into these newly created positions recognizes their commitment to the Company and a deep understanding of our objectives. I will rely more and more on both of them to participate in the “outward facing” work with our diverse stakeholder groups,” said Clifford.\nPrior to joining EEStor, Dr. Paul had over 15 years of experience with polymer synthesis, analysis, testing and characterization of polymeric materials, including formulations of high-performance organic coatings and rubber compounds. His advanced research interests include surface functionalization of nanoparticles, solid state and thermal battery technologies, phase change materials, polymer colloids, organic photovoltaic, polymer nanocomposites, polymer blends, alloys and zwitterions. He holds a B.S. in Chemistry from Assam University, an M.S. in Polymer Science from Tezpur University, and a Ph.D. in Polymer Chemistry from Oklahoma State University. His research work has been featured as a cover article in Renewable Energy Global Innovations, Canada, pertaining to excellence in renewable energy research and he has received several honors and awards for excellence in academic and industrial research.\nPrior to joining EEStor, Bryan Kelly worked for United Space Alliance in NASA’s mission operations directorate as the manager of the guidance and propulsion systems branch. In that role for 8 years, Bryan managed 45 flight controllers for space shuttle and space station operations across 5 disciplines. Bryan started his career as a space shuttle flight controller for Rockwell Space Operations Company in 1995 and holds a Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.\nAbout EEStor\nEEStor is a developer of high energy density solid-state capacitor technology utilizing the company’s patented Composition Modified Barium Titanate (CMBT) material. The Company is focused on licensing opportunities for its technology across a broad spectrum of industries and applications.\nThe Company’s success depends on the commercialization of its technology. There is no assurance that EEStor will be successful in the completion of the various enhancement phases underway to warrant the anticipated licensing opportunities in the technology. Readers are directed to the “Risk Factors” disclosed in the Company’s public filings.\nFor additional information please contact:\nIan Clifford\nChief Executive Officer\nEEStor Corporation\nTel. 416-535-8395 ext. 3\nian.clifford@eestorcorp.com\nMark Olson\nSenior Vice President\nSparkpr\nTel. 512-507-1993\nmark.olson@sparkpr.com\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain statements and documents referred to in this release, other than statements of historical fact, may include forward-looking information that involves various risks and uncertainties that face the Company; such statements may contain such words as “may”, “would”, “could”, “will”, “intend”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect” and similar expressions, and may be based on management’s current assumptions and expectations related to all aspects of the power and energy storage industries, consumer demand for energy storage products and solutions and the global economy. Risks and uncertainties that may face the Company include, but are not restricted to: EEStor may not be able to replicate test results in mass produced commercial products; the EEStor capacitor and energy storage technology may not be successfully commercialized at all, in a manner providing the features and benefits expected while under development, or on a timely basis or the Company may not be able to successfully incorporate this technology into its current or proposed products or the products of others; steps taken by the Company to protect its proprietary rights may not be adequate or third parties may infringe or misappropriate the Company’s proprietary rights; the Company has a history of losses from operations and may not be able to obtain financing, if and when required or on acceptable terms due to market conditions or other factors, to fund future expenditures for general administrative activities, including sales and marketing and research and development, expansion, strategic acquisitions or investment opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures; competitors may develop products which offer greater benefits to consumers, have greater market appeal or are more competitively priced than those offered by the Company; the Company may be exposed to product liability claims which exceed insurance policy limits; the Company is dependent on the ability and experience of a relatively small number of key personnel; new products introduced by the Company may not be accepted in the market or to the extent projected; new laws and regulations may be enacted or existing ones may be applied or governmental action may be taken in a manner which could limit or curtail the production or sale of the Company’s products; and the Company may be negatively affected by reduced consumer spending due to the uncertainty of economic and geopolitical conditions.\nThese risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ from information contained in this release, when estimates and assumptions have been used to measure and report results. There can be no assurance that any statements of forward-looking information contained in this release will prove to be accurate. Actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.\nThese and all subsequent written and oral statements containing forward-looking information are based on the estimates and opinions of management on the dates they are made and expressly qualified in their entirety by this notice. Except as required by applicable laws, the Company assumes no obligation to update should circumstances or management’s estimates or opinions change.
