Slideshow (3 Images)\nJordan Ayew should have equalised minutes later only to shoot wide from six metres but although they had their chances, Carlos Carvalhal’s side were unable to add to their 33-point haul in the danger zone.\nSwansea, winless in seven matches, have two more games at home to relegation rivals Southampton and doomed Stoke City but Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth, who could have won more convincingly but for fine keeping from Fabianski, are safe.
