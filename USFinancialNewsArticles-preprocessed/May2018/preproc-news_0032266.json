    "text": "Catcher J.T. Realmuto went 3-for-4 with an RBI to lead the Miami Marlins to a 4-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night at Marlins Park.\nRealmuto raised his batting average to .322 as he continues to make his case to be an All-Star this year.\nRight fielder Yasiel Puig hit a home run — his second of the season and his second in the past two games — to lead the Dodgers. Puig also threw out a runner at third and walked twice.\nDodgers first baseman Cody Bellinger hit a solo home run in the ninth inning off Marlins closer Brad Ziegler, who was able to regroup and nail down his sixth save of the season.\nMiami starter Wei-Yin Chen, who was in line for a win with a 2-0 lead, couldn’t make it through the fifth inning. He went 4 1/3 and allowed three hits, three walks and no runs while striking out three.\nMarlins reliever Nick Wittgren (2-0), who pitched 1 2/3 perfect innings, earned the win.\nDodgers starter Alex Wood (0-4), who went 16-3 last year, pitched in tough luck yet again. He allowed just two runs, one earned, on nine hits in six innings, striking out five and walking none. He took the loss due to a lack of offensive and defensive support.\nThe latter was evident in the first inning as Miami opened the scoring with an unearned run. Martin Prado led off with a single, moved to second on Realmuto’s hit and scored when Dodgers second baseman Logan Forsythe tried to turn what would’ve been an inning-ending double play. Instead, Forsythe’s throw was low for an error.\nThe Marlins extended their lead to 2-0 in the fourth. Brian Anderson hit a leadoff single, advanced to second on Justin Bour’s hit and moved to third on a groundout. Anderson scored on Miguel Rojas’ sacrifice fly.\nLos Angeles cut its deficit to 2-1 in the seventh. Puig hit an 84 mph slider from reliever Tayron Guerrero for his home run to left-center field. Guerrero’s two previous pitches to Puig were 100 mph fastballs.\nMiami answered with two runs in the bottom of the seventh. Pinch hitter Yadiel Rivera led off the inning with a double to left. Miami then came through with a pair of two-out RBI hits — a double by Realmuto and a single by Anderson.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. ",
