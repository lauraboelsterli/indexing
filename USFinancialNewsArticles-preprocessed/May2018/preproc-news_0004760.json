    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MKThink welcomes back Marijke Smit, who steps in as Partner. She will lead company growth and best practices in Planning and Architecture and advance the work of the Futures Lab.\n“MKThink taught me how to think differently about the built environment and its relationship to the human condition—an analytic mindset I’ve brought to every aspect of my career,” said Smit, who was Director of Planning from 2008 - 2010. “I’m excited to come home to MKThink, apply my learnings, and help steer the next generation of the company.”\n“Marijke has the innovative DNA and creative mindset to advance MKThink’s vision of intelligent places,” said CEO Mark Miller. “I’m thrilled that she has returned to the fold to contribute her brainpower to reengineering architecture for the information age.”\nSmit returns from an eight-year tenure at Project Frog, the pre-fab sustainable building company launched by MKThink in 2006. Rising from Vice President of Partnerships to Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, she defined and expanded the company’s component building solutions in the education, civic, and retail sectors. Under her leadership, Inc. Magazine named Project Frog to its 2013 list of the 100 fastest growing manufacturing companies.\nSmit brings twenty years of experience in urban design, planning, entrepreneurship, green technology, community engagement, marketing, and corporate leadership. Prior to MKThink and Project Frog, she directed the Strategies Group at Perkins Eastman in New York and led Community and Environmental Affairs for the Moynihan Station Redevelopment Corporation.\nBuilding Design + Construction named Smit on its 2008 list of “40 Under 40”. Her work has been featured in Wired Magazine, Preservation Magazine, and The New York Times. She earned her Bachelor’s in American Studies from Columbia University and went on to earn a Master’s in Urban Planning from the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.\nAbout MKThink\nAn architecture strategy firm headquartered in San Francisco, MKThink creates intelligent places that improve the quality of life. Since 2000, MKThink has been pioneering the application of data-analytics, design-thinking, and a systems approach to the built environment. Clients include Stanford University, Oakland Unified School District, Office of Naval Research, Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, Mozilla, Fannie Mae, and The Nature Conservancy.\nFor more information, please contact Ashley M Wells at 415.686.2272, email wells@mkthink.com , or visit the MKThink website at www.mkthink.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180504005633/en/\nMKThink\nAshley M Wells, 415-686-2272\nwells@mkthink.com\nSource: MKThink",
