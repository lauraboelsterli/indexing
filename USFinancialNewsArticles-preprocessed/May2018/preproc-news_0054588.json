    "text": "Immediate focus is new markets in Europe and Asia\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ClassPass , the leading fitness membership, today announced it will be expanding its global presence by launching in nine new countries by the end of 2018. The company’s immediate focus includes widening its existing network in the UK and launching three new countries in Asia. ClassPass has hired Chloe Ross as VP of International to lead the charge on global strategy and execution.\nClassPass is currently in 50 cities across four countries including the US, Canada, the UK and Australia. After successfully launching 10 new domestic cities in the US last fall, the company has now shifted its focus to launching more than 20 new countries internationally by the end of 2019 while doubling-down on the density of studio offerings in its existing markets.\n“ClassPass is already the leading fitness aggregator in the US, and we have yet to find a city where ClassPass does not work,” said Fritz Lanman, ClassPass CEO. “We are excited to accelerate our footprint both domestically and internationally with the goal of more than doubling our network size and establishing a major global presence. Chloe joining the team is a critical piece in implementing the infrastructure and team on the ground in order to accomplish these ambitious goals.”\nChloe Ross joins ClassPass with nearly two decades of strategy and operating experience across the tech, policy and corporate sectors, including international strategy at Microsoft and developing policy in the UK Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit. Having also previously been a CEO herself for a SaaS eCommerce platform, she brings extensive B2B marketplace knowledge and an entrepreneurial spirit that are inherent to the ClassPass culture. She will be based out of the ClassPass London office.\n“I look forward to joining the ClassPass team at this inflection point of hypergrowth,” said Chloe Ross, ClassPass VP of International. “ClassPass has the team, product, partners and technology to be the global leader in the fitness space, and I’m excited to be part of the ride as we expand into new territories.”\nClassPass is immediately launching new cities in the US, Canada and UK, including Manchester and Bristol, and will launch in three new countries in Asia within the coming months and an additional six countries by the end of the year. The company’s 2019 plans include adding 17 new international markets to the growing network.\n“As we continue towards our vision of ‘every life, fully lived,’ this rapid expansion will allow us to positively impact the lives of even more people across the world,” said Payal Kadakia, ClassPass Founder. “When we first launched in New York, the goal was always to bring ClassPass to a massive global audience, so this is a huge milestone in making that a reality.”\nAbout:\nFounded in 2013, ClassPass is the leading fitness membership. With over 9,000 partners in 50 cities worldwide, ClassPass connects members to a variety of fitness experiences, including yoga, cycling, Pilates, barre, running, strength training, dance, sports, videos and more. Recognized as one of Forbes's Next Billion Dollar Startups, ClassPass leverages proprietary technology to dynamically merchandise and surface over a million fitness classes for a seamless booking experience that facilitates discovery.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180524005769/en/\nClassPass PR\nAshley Hennings\nahennings@classpass.com\nSource: ClassPass",
