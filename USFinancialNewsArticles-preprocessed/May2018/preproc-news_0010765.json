The Company sincerely thanks Mr. Kord for his guidance and wise counsel during his tenure on the Board.\nAbout the Company\nAtlanta Gold Inc. holds through its 100% owned subsidiary, Atlanta Gold Corporation (“AGC”), leases, options or ownership interests in its Atlanta properties which comprise approximately 2,159 acres (8.74 square kilometres) located 90 air kilometers east of Boise, in Elmore County, Idaho. A long history of mining makes Atlanta very suitable for development of new mining projects.
