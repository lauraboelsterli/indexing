    "text": "\nOn Wednesday, Trump signed a \"right-to-try\" bill that gives severely ill patients the ability to access experimental drug treatments that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nTrump also weighed in on a cultural controversy on Wednesday, criticizing Disney CEO Bob Iger over the cancellation of \"Roseanne,\" the revival of Roseanne Barr's sitcom from the 1980s and '90s.\nThe show, which garnered a huge audience in its first season back on television, was abruptly canceled after Barr compared Valerie Jarrett, a black aide to former President Barack Obama, to an ape in a tweet.\nThe tweet, which has been deleted, said of Jarrett: \"muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\"\nTrump asked on Wednesday why Iger had not called him for \"the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.\" Trump tweet Iger\nBarr is a vocal Trump supporter who has spread conspiracy theories from her social media account in the past. Trump had previously congratulated Barr on the success of her show's revival.\nMeanwhile, a new study from Harvard estimated that 4,600 people or more may have died from Hurricane Maria , which decimated the island in September. The official death count from the hurricane is 64.
