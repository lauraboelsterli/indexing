    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France’s top court on Thursday authorized the extradition to Argentina of a former police officer accused of crimes against humanity during the Latin American country’s 1976-1983 “dirty war”.\nMario Sandoval, who moved to France after the fall of Argentina’s seven-year military dictatorship and obtained French citizenship in 1997, is accused by Argentine prosecutors of more than 600 human rights violations including torture.\nThursday’s ruling by the Cour de Cassation ends a five-year legal tussle. A decree permitting Sandoval’s extradition needs now to be signed by the French government.\n“It is time for Mario Sandoval to face Argentine justice,” said Sophie Thonon-Wesfreid, a lawyer representing Argentina.\nSandoval’s attorney told Reuters the ruling was a “disappointment”.\nA former federal police officer, Sandoval is accused of committing crimes at a secret prison where he was a specialist in fighting “subversive elements”. He denies the charges.\nAs many as 30,000 Argentines were murdered during the military dictatorship’s so-called dirty war against suspected leftists and political dissidents, according to human rights groups.\nReporting by Simon Carraud; writing by Richard Lough, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ",
