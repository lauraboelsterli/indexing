    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 3:53 PM Deutsche Bank mistakenly transferred $24 billion in 2014 Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) erroneously transferred 21 billion euros ($24.62 billion) to Macquarie ( MQG.AX ) in 2014, a spokesman said on Thursday, the latest such error to come to light. FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of Germany's Deutsche Bank is photographed early evening in Frankfurt, Germany, January 26, 2016. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\nThe transfer was a human error and not related to faulty technology, said a person familiar with the matter. It was corrected within a few hours and didnâ€™t result in any financial damages.\nBloomberg News first reported the mistake.\nIn March, Deutsche Bank transferred 28 billion euros ($33 billion) instead of 28 billion yen ($257 million) to its own account at the derivative exchange Eurex.
