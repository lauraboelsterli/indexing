Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - Olympique Lyonnais vs OGC Nice - Groupama Stadium, Lyon, France - May 19, 2018 Lyon's Memphis Depay celebrates scoring their second goal REUTERS/Emmanuel Foudrot\nMonaco finished runners-up to Paris St Germain after their 3-0 win at Troyes sent their opponents down to Ligue 2, while Lyon ended third after coming from behind to beat Nice 3-2, thanks to Memphis Depay’s treble.\nFourth-placed Marseille, who lost to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League final on Wednesday, beat visiting Amiens 2-1 but it was not enough to put them on the podium.\nThey end up with 77 points, one behind Lyon, while Monaco have 80.\nBut PSG, who had already been crowned, finished well clear on 93 points after a 0-0 draw at Caen that kept the Normandy side in the elite.

Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - Olympique Lyonnais vs OGC Nice - Groupama Stadium, Lyon, France - May 19, 2018 Lyon coach Bruno Genesio celebrates with their players after the match REUTERS/Emmanuel Foudrot\nMonaco needed a draw to secure a Champions League spot but went further, defeating Troyes.\nRony Lopes beat Erwin Zelazny on 21 minutes after the keeper had parried Youri Telemans’ shot into the Portugal striker’s path.\nLopes made sure there would be no late drama when he scored again with a low shot in the 71st minute and Jordi Mboul added a third in stoppage time.\nAt Lyon’s Groupama stadium, Nice went ahead in the 18th minute when Alassane Plea collected a fine through ball from Mario Balotelli and shot between keeper Mathieu Gorgelin’s legs.\nLyon hit the woodwork before the break, but Depay struck three times in the second half. Slideshow (3 Images)\nThe Dutch striker poked the ball home from Nabil Fekir’s cross in the 48th minute and he made it 2-1 on 65 minutes with a low free kick that went under the wall.\nFour minutes before time, Depay chipped the ball past Walter Benitez to wrap up the game. Plea pulled one back two minutes later with a powerful strike for his second of the game.\nMarseille, too, did what they needed to, but it proved to be in vain.\nThey opened the scoring after 10 minutes when Morgan Sanson found the back of the net with a half-volley from inside the box.\nThey doubled the tally eight minutes later, Kostas Mitroglou heading home from Lucas Ocampos’s cross. Amiens reduced the arrears on the half-hour when Moussa Konate beat Steve Mandanda from close range.\nBut while Marseille hung on, it was not enough to take them into a Champions League place.
