The dividend will be credited to shareholders’ daily investment accounts at the close of business on May 21, 2018.\nIf you have questions, please contact FHLBank Atlanta’s Funding Desk at 1.800.536.9650, ext. 8011.\nAbout FHLBank Atlanta\nFHLBank Atlanta offers competitively-priced financing, community development grants, and other banking services to help member financial institutions make affordable home mortgages and provide economic development credit to neighborhoods and communities.
