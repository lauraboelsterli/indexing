    "text": "MIDLAND, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ring Energy, Inc. (NYSE American: REI) (“Ring”) (“Company”) announced today financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the three month period ended March 31, 2018, Ring had oil and gas revenues of $29,891,391 compared to $12,243,793 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and net income of $5,665,634, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1,279,281, or $0.03 per diluted share.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the net income included a pre-tax “Unrealized Loss on Derivatives” of $790,701. Excluding this item, the net income per diluted share would have been $0.11.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, oil sales volume increased to 479,864 barrels, compared to 240,260 barrels for the same period in 2017, an 99.7% increase, and gas sales volume increased to 210,031 MCF (thousand cubic feet), compared to 168,349 MCF for the same period in 2017, a 24.7% increase. On a barrel of oil equivalent (“BOE”) basis for the three months ended March 31, 2018, production sales increased to 514,869 BOEs, compared to 268,318 BOEs for the same period in 2017, a 91.9% increase. The average commodity prices received by Ring were $60.73 per barrel of oil and $3.58 per MCF of natural gas for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $48.69 per barrel of oil and $3.25 per MCF of natural gas for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nLease operating expenses, including production taxes, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $14.00 per BOE, a 14% increase from the prior year. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs, including accretion, increased 25% to $16.82 per BOE. General and administrative costs, which included a $1,081,199 charge for stock based compensation, were $5.99 per BOE, a 43% decrease.\nCash provided by operating activities, before changes in working capital, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $19,168,262 or $0.33 per fully diluted share, compared to $7,221,936, or $0.14 per fully diluted share for the same period in 2017. Earnings before interest, taxes, depletion and other non-cash items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $19,203,791, or $0.33 per fully diluted share, compared to $7,105,257, or $0.14 per fully diluted share for the same period in 2017. (See accompanying table for a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA).\nIn February 2018, the Company closed on an underwritten public stock offering of 6,164,000 shares of its common stock, including 804,000 shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of an over-allotment option, at $14.00 per share for gross proceeds of $86,296,000. Total net proceeds from the offering were $81,822,066 after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses.\nThere was no outstanding debt on the Company’s $500 million senior secured credit facility at March 31, 2018.\nRing’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kelly Hoffman, stated, “Our first quarter results have gotten the Company off to a great start for 2018. We continue to have excellent results from our horizontal drilling program. We have 60 wells scheduled to be drilled this year and look forward to continued exceptional results. Our new gas pipeline is completed, and now, instead of having to flare the gas associated with our horizontal drilling, we are selling it. This, along with added saltwater disposal wells and the restimulation of some of our older wells, is only adding to our momentum. The North Gaines and Brushy Canyon wells are on track with encouraging results that will be released in the near future. Our goal of being cash flow positive by year end is on track. Our dedicated staff continues to search for and evaluate complementary, accretive properties and opportunities that will build on our success. With the completion of our stock offering in February, we have strengthened an already strong balance sheet. We look forward to the rest of 2018 and couldn’t be more excited for Ring and its shareholders.”\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes a non-cash charge for stock based compensation of $1,081,199. Excluding this item, the Company’s net income would have been $0.11 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company believes results excluding this item are more comparable to estimates provided by security analysts and, therefore, are useful in evaluating operational trends of the Company and its performance, compared to other similarly situated oil and gas producing companies.\nAbout Ring Energy, Inc.\nRing Energy, Inc. is an oil and gas exploration, development and production company with current operations in Texas.\nwww.ringenergy.com\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis release contains within the meaning of the “safe-harbor” provisions of the 1995 that involve a wide variety of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitations, statements with respect to the Company’s strategy and prospects.
