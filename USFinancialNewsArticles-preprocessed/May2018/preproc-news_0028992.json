    "text": "CAMDEN, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- International Wire Group Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCMKTS:ITWG) today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. First quarter 2018 operating income was lower than in the first quarter of 2017.\n“First quarter results reflect sustained improvement in demand in our largest markets served. Electronics/data communications and consumer/appliance market demand remained very strong and demand in the industrial and energy segment strengthened further from fourth quarter of 2017. Automotive market volumes were down for the quarter year over year. HPC medical products and aerospace demand remained firm. Our Engineered Wire Products-Europe segment continues to perform well, benefiting from recently introduced new products and new platforms. Significant freight and logistics cost increases negatively impacted performance in the quarter,” said Edwin J. Flynn, Chief Executive Officer of International Wire Group Holdings, Inc.\nFirst Quarter Results\nNet sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $147.0 million, an increase of $10.8 million, or 7.9%, compared to $136.2 million for the same period in 2017. This increase was partly due to a higher selling price of copper, partially offset by a higher proportion of tolled copper. Tolled copper is customer-owned copper. The value of tolled copper is not included in net sales and costs of sales. Excluding the effects of higher copper prices and a higher proportion of tolled copper, net sales increased $7.0 million, or 5.0%, versus the same period in 2017. This increase resulted from $6.0 million of higher sales and $1.9 million from the effects of favorable foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by $0.9 million of lower customer pricing/mix. Total pounds of product sold in the first quarter of 2018 increased by 6.2% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $5.1 million compared to $6.9 million for the 2017 period, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 26.1%, primarily from lower LIFO/copper profits and higher selling, general and administrative expenses (primarily freight related).\nNet loss of $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was an increase of $2.0 million from net loss of $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to lower operating income and a lower income tax benefit, partially offset by lower interest expense.\nNet loss per basic and diluted share was $0.51 and $0.09 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Results and Net Debt\nIn an effort to better assist investors and noteholders in understanding the Company’s financial results, as part of this release, the Company is also providing Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is net loss excluding interest expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation (income)/expense, impairment charges, gain/loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, (gain)/loss on early extinguishment of debt and extraordinary non-recurring gains and losses. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in evaluating the performance of our business. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently. As a result, our measures of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to measures used by other companies. Below is a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to Net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Net debt as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 is also presented below.
