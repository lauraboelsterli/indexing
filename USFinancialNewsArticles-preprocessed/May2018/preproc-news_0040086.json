    "text": "'Big Short' Steve Eisman blasts cryptocurrencies, bets against Deutsche Bank Neuberger Berman portfolio manager Steve Eisman is betting against Canadian financials, Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo. \"Deutsche Bank has real profitability issues. They haven't spent money on technology in a very very long time. They're probably under-capitalized,\" he says. 4 Hours Ago | 01:23\nSteve Eisman, the investor whose forecast of the financial crisis was depicted in \"The Big Short,\" is still finding problematic stocks and investing manias in the financial markets.\nThe Neuberger Berman portfolio manager confirmed his fund is short Canadian financials, Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo . He spoke in a Bloomberg Television interview that aired on Sunday from the CFA Institute's annual conference in Hong Kong.\n\"Deutsche Bank has real profitability issues. They haven't spent money on technology in a very very long time. They're probably under-capitalized,\" he said. \"I think they'll probably raise capital again next year. Deutsche Bank is a problem bank. I think it has to shrink dramatically.\" show chapters 2:13 PM ET Mon, 23 March 2015 | 08:35\nEisman is known for being one of the few investors to profitably bet against subprime mortgage securities during the financial crisis. He was a key character in Michael Lewis' best-selling book \"The Big Short\" and was depicted by actor Steve Carell in the movie based on the book.\nOn stage Monday at the CFA Institute's annual conference in Hong Kong, Eisman expressed skepticism over cryptocurrencies.\n\"I don't see the purpose of it,\" he said, according to The Wall Street Journal. \"What value does cryptocurrency actually add? No one's been able to answer that question for me.\"\nEisman also said digital currency prices are rising due to speculation and money laundering, according to the Journal.\nDespite his negative views on certain bank stocks, the investor is generally optimistic on the environment for the U.S. banking sector.\n\"The financial system in the United States has changed radically. Leverage has been reduced enormously,\" he said on Bloomberg Television. \"For the first time in all the years I've covered bank stocks, I can honestly say the financial system in the United States is safe.\"\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment for this story. Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.",
