    "text": "Reblog The business of big trucks is bigger than ever, opening up a new front in the market-share battle between General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., which dominate the production of these multitasking pickups. A strong economy and the December tax overhaul are helping lift sales of commercial vehicles, mainly pickup trucks and delivery vans used by general contractors, farmers and other skilled trades, auto dealers say. While Ford has for years had a sizable lead in the battle for business customers, with its F-Series pickup, GM later this year plans to reintroduce a so-called medium-duty commercial truck, a category the auto giant abandoned around the time of its 2009 bankruptcy.",
