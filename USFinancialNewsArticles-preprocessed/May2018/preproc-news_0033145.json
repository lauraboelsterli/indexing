    "text": "Q1 2018 total sales of $2.9 million, up 473% year over year\nCannabis oil sales represent 29% of domestic medical patient revenue in Q1 2018\nTORONTO, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ, TSX-V: CRON) ( \" Cronos Group \" or the \" Company \") today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We are pleased that the strategic initiatives launched in 2017 are coming to fruition,\" said Mike Gorenstein, CEO of Cronos Group. \"2017 was a building block year which set the groundwork and foundation for the results achieved in the first quarter. Cronos is focused on continuing to increase capacity in order to serve existing distribution and newly established markets, developing intellectual property and launching recreational brands.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nSales were $2.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of $2.4 million, or 473%. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, sales increased by $1.3 million, or 83%, for the first quarter of 2018.\nSince November 2017 when Health Canada approved the Company's new extraction laboratory, Cronos Group has ramped-up production of strain-specific cannabis oils that have been received favorably by customers. In Q1 2018, cannabis oil sales represented 29% of domestic medical patient revenue. The Company expects oil sales to continue to become a larger part of sales over time.\nIn February 2018, Cronos Group became the first licensed producer to list on a major stock exchange in the United States. The Company's common shares trade on the NASDAQ under the trading symbol \"CRON\".\nIn February 2018, the Company announced a strategic joint for venture in Australia ( \"Cronos Australia\" ) for the research, production, manufacture and distribution of medical cannabis. The Company owns a 50% equity interest in Cronos Australia. In the initial phase of the joint venture, Cronos Australia is planning to construct a 20,000 sq. ft. purpose built indoor facility that is expected to produce up to 2,000 kilograms of cannabis annually.\nIn March 2018, Cronos Group announced a strategic joint venture with MedMen Enterprises USA, LLC. The Company owns a 50% equity interest in the joint venture MedMen Canada Inc. MedMen Canada is focused on branded products, research and development activities in Canada and creating a Canadian branded retail chain in provinces that permit private retailers.\nIn January 2018, Peace Naturals received a dealer's license (the \" Peace Naturals Dealer's License \") from Health Canada pursuant to the Narcotic Control Regulations and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada) (\" CDSA \") for the possession, sale, transportation and delivery of controlled substances under the CDSA. The Peace Naturals Dealer's License allows Peace Naturals to develop products that are not yet available for sale in Canada and to export medical cannabis extracts, including concentrated oil and resin products.\nCompleted construction of, received regulatory approvals for, and commenced cultivation of cannabis in, the 28,000 sq. ft. greenhouse at Peace Naturals. The greenhouse's first harvest is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018.\nCompleted a rebrand of Peace Naturals, which included new proprietary packaging, an evolution of the brand's logo, new marketing materials, a revised website, a new shopping portal experience, and new products such as strain specific oils and limited edition cultivars. Peace Naturals also established a new classification system for products, which helped educate patients on key product differences.\nStrengthened liquidity by raising $46.0 million of gross proceeds through a bought deal offering by way of a short form prospectus offering in Canada in January 2018.\nHighlights Subsequent to First Quarter 2018\nStrengthened liquidity by raising $100.0 million of gross proceeds through a bought deal offering in April 2018. The common shares were offered in the United States pursuant to the Company's effective registration statement on Form F-10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and in Canada by way of a short form prospectus offering.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. EST to discuss first quarter 2018 results.
