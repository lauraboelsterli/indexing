    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alio Gold Inc (TSX:ALO) (NYSE AMERICAN:ALO) (“Alio Gold” or the “Company”), or the “Company”), today reported its first quarter 2018 results. Production results were previously released on April 11, 2018. The Company will host a conference call at 11:00am EDT today to discuss the results and the details of the call can be found at the end of the release.\nFirst Quarter Highlights and Recent Developments\nGold production of 17,624 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost 1 (“AISC”) of $1,262 per ounce. Maintained 2018 guidance of between 90,000 and 100,000 ounces of gold. Initiated construction of the underground decline at the Ana Paula project (“Ana Paula”) including the first mechanized blast on March 17, 2018. Completed a six-hole 3,800 metre surface exploration program at Ana Paula. Developed a drilling program for a high priority surface target 150 meters north of the proposed open pit (North Area Target) at Ana Paula which included geological mapping at a scale of 1:2,000 and completing the drill pads and drill road access. Announced a business combination with Rye Patch Gold that is supported by major shareholders, and is on track to close May 25, 2018. Appointed Markus Felderer as Vice President, Corporate Development.\n“Our priorities for 2018 are focused on the further optimization of the performance of the San Francisco Mine, advancing the Ana Paula project and undertaking a review on the opportunities to increase productivity at the Florida Canyon Mine following the expected close of the Rye Patch business combination on May 25, 2018” said Greg McCunn, Chief Executive Officer. “The addition of a second producing mine in Nevada will provide us with increased diversification and is expected to enhance our capital markets profile and appeal to a broader investor base.”\n“At Ana Paula, the 1,200 meter underground decline is under construction with the first mechanized blast taking place in Q1. We also completed the six-hole surface drill program which met our objective of providing further understanding of the geometry of the complex high-grade breccia and the nature and extent of the mineralization prior to commencing drilling from the underground decline which is expected in Q3 2018. The drilling also tested a lower-grade hydrothermal breccia structure lying south of the proposed pit and and on the southern edge of the alteration halo. Positive results were returned and we are following up with an additional 300 meter hole that is oriented on a steeper angle to explore the southern extension during Q2. These results provide confirmation of our decision to change the scope of the project to include an underground component and we will defer the completion of the DFS and the commencement of construction for at least the remainder of 2018.”\nMining and Processing\nCategory Three months ended\nMarch 31 2018 2017 Gold sold (ounces) 17,449 26,048 Silver sold (ounces) 5,826 11,899 Metal revenues 23,338 32,306 Production costs, excl. depreciation and depletion 15,866 19,362 Net earnings from operations 3,651 9,780 Net earnings 3,230 6,042 Net earnings per share, basic 0.07 0.17 Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities* (1,826) 9,743 By-product cash costs 2 (per ounce) 884 735 AISC 1 (per ounce) 1,262 848 Average realized gold price per gold ounce 1,332 1,232 *after changes in non-cash working capital\nFinancial performance\nMetal revenues decreased to $23.3 million compared to $32.3 million during Q1 2017, as a result of fewer ounces sold.\nProduction costs, which comprise the full cost of operations excluding depreciation and depletion, form a component of cost of sales and decreased to $15.9 million compared to $19.4 million during Q1 2017. The decrease was a result of lower ounces of gold produced.\nDepletion and depreciation costs decreased to $1.3 million compared to $1.8 million during Q1 2017. This decrease was due to an improved mine plan, resulting in lower unit-of-production depreciation rates.\nEarnings for the Company decreased to $3.2 million, or $0.07 per share compared to $6.0 million, or $0.17 per share during Q1 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower gold ounces sold. Additionally, there were lower earnings from mine operations of $3.7 million compared to $9.8 million during Q1 2017 primarily a result of fewer ounces sold.\nCorporate and administrative expenses increased to $2.9 million compared to $1.3 million during Q1 2017 as a result primarily of Rye Patch transaction costs.\nCash used by operating activities was $1.8 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $9.7 million during Q1 2017. The decrease was primarily due to:\nA decrease in metal revenues due to fewer ounces sold; Building of ore in process\nCash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 31, 2018, were $39.3 million. During the quarter, the Company used $1.8 million from operations at the San Francisco Mine (“Mine”), and at the Mine invested $1.7 million on sustaining capital expenditures and $2.7 million on deferred stripping. At the Ana Paula Project the Company invested $5.6 million. The Company also incurred $0.4 million of expenditures related to the Rye Patch transaction.\nWorking capital 3 at March 31, 2018 was $57.7 million.\nSan Francisco Mine (100%-owned)\nThe Mine produced 17,624 gold ounces and 8,997 silver ounces compared to 26,048 gold ounces and 11,899 silver ounces during Q1 2017. The decrease was a result of lower grade. Mining was primarily from the upper level of Phase 5 of the San Francisco pit which has slower leach kinetics, in addition the impact of the increased cut-off grade to the crusher feed has not yet materialized and the average grade fed to the crusher of 0.42 g/t gold was below expectations. Under-reconciliation and higher than anticipated dilution was seen during Q1 which is primarily as a result of being at the perimeter of the main ore body and is anticipated to reverse when the active benches mined are in the heart of the ore-body in the second quarter. The blasting improvement strategy which has been underway since December 2017 will continue to be monitored closely over the next two quarters to ensure it is not contributing to the under-reconciliation and dilution within the mine plan.\nThe Mine’s by-product cash cost was $884 per ounce while AISC was $1,262 per ounce. During Q1 2017 by-product cash cost was $735 per ounce and AISC was $848 per ounce. The increase in cash cost was due to an increase in tonnage and fewer ounces produced.\nAna Paula Project (100%-owned)\nDefinitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”)\nThe Company is continuing to evaluate how best to integrate the underground component into the existing project development. This potential project improvement could enhance the project economics and as a result, the Company has deferred the completion of the DFS and the commencement of construction for at least the remainder of 2018. As a result, the Company expects to spend approximately $20 million in capital expenditures for 2018.\nWork continues on a number of key components within the feasibility study while the Company evaluates incorporating the underground component into the project scope. Additional metallurgical testwork is underway and will continue in 2018. The testwork includes geochemical analysis to track deportment of key impurities, including arsenic, through the process and kinetic tests of leach tails. The testwork indicates that a significant amount of arsenic is leached in the ambient oxidization process (“AOX”). Arsenic removal technology has been identified and tested. Comminution and flotation optimization testwork was also completed, which indicated that the ore hardness is similar to that indicated during the PFS.\nA field program of geological mapping, borehole drilling, and seismic evaluation to characterize the ground conditions for the tailings, waste dump and plant site areas was completed. The geotechnical program identified that the ground conditions in the area of the proposed PFS Tailings dam embankment area and the plant site areas are not favourable and a number of trade-off studies were initiated to optimize locations for these facilities. Additional trade-off studies were also initiated to evaluate a number of tailings storage configurations to most cost effectively manage arsenic bearing tailings materials to meet water quality criteria. These studies and subsequent water balance and quality modelling are in progress and further drilling is needed to confirm hydrogeology in the tailings site.\nKey offsite infrastructure for the Project is also being engineered to a higher level of detail in the DFS including power, road access and water supply. Power to the site is readily available from multiple power sources adjacent to the mine site and a System Impact Study and a Facilities Study are underway to confirm the point of connection to grid power and the costs of connection, respectively.\nThe site is currently accessed by a 7.5 kilometre road from the town of Cuetzala. This road has been upgraded to improve road conditions and travel time. For the main project construction access, a route accessing the project site via existing roads from the North has been delineated. Minor upgrades have been completed on the northern route to allow access to site for the underground mining equipment, camp and support facilities.\nThe site is estimated to have a negative water balance and a hydrological study has identified a prospective water source to the southwest of the Project site. Although initial drilling programs did not locate sufficient volumes of water for operations, a modified approach is expected to yield the required supply.\nExploration\nThe main objective of the current exploration program at Ana Paula is to further delineate the known extension of the high-grade breccia mineralization below the proposed open pit. A 3,800 meter diamond drilling program was initiated in January 2018 and completed in April 2018. The program consisted of six drill holes of 600 to 700 meters each. Following the success of the program and the confirmation of a near surface hydrothermal breccia south of the proposed pit and on the southern edge of the alteration halo, an additional hole of 300 meters is planned in Q2 2018 to explore this southern extension of the hydrothermal breccia.\nThe extension of the high-grade breccia system below the proposed pit will be further tested from drilling underground in Q3 and Q4 2018. Currently, a 1,200 meter underground decline is under construction and is being driven from a portal site located in the adjacent valley from the proposed pit, approximately 400 meters from the proposed mill site. It is expected that the underground decline will be advanced sufficiently in the third quarter 2018 to enable commencement of the first phase of the underground diamond drill program. The drill program is expected to confirm the continuity and shape of the high-grade gold mineralization below the proposed pit that is hosted in the breccia and it will also explore the gold mineralization indications at depth hosted in hornfels skarn, typical of the Guerrero Gold Belt. The underground drilling program proposed includes 55 diamond drill holes (12,000 meters) and will include geochemical sampling and assaying. Construction of the decline commenced in December 2017 with the mine portal site prepared and under construction. The explosives magazine site has been completed and surface infrastructure including offices and workshops have been installed to support mining. A 100 person camp has been under construction since January 2018 and is now operational.\nA second exploration initiative planned for 2018 will test a high priority target 150 metres north (“north target”) of the proposed open pit. Drilling on the north target is expected to commence in Q2 2018 following the completion of the surface program testing the hydrothermal breccia extension. In addition, regional exploration work is underway on the 56,000 hectare land package that includes an airborne magnetic survey targeting further breccia or skarn targets. This work will continue through 2018.\nPlease refer to the Company's financial statements, related notes and accompanying Management Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for a full review of the San Francisco operation and Ana Paula project.

Information circulars were mailed to shareholders on April 25, 2018, and a special and annual meeting of the Company and Rye Patch Gold are to be held simultaneously on May 18, 2018. A majority of the shareholder votes cast at the Company’s shareholder meeting are required for approval and 66 2/3% of votes cast at Rye Patch Gold’s shareholder meeting are required for approval. If successful, the transaction is expected to close on May 25, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will release its 2018 first quarter results prior to the market open on May 9, 2018, followed by a conference call and webcast at 11:00am (EDT).\nFirst quarter 2018 conference call and webcast details:\nDate: Wednesday, May 9, 2018\nTime: 11:00am (EDT)\nToll Free (US and Canada): (855) 427-9509\nToll Free (Outside North America): (210) 229-8822\nConference ID: 1099349\nWebcast: https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/tq2s9yme\nReplay: To be available at http://www.aliogold.com\nAbout Alio Gold\nAlio Gold is a growth oriented gold mining company, focused on exploration, development and production in Mexico. Its principal assets include its 100%-owned and operating San Francisco Mine in Sonora, Mexico and its 100%-owned development stage Ana Paula Project in Guerrero, Mexico. Located within the highly prospective Guerrero Gold Belt on 56,000 hectares of underexplored land the Ana Paula Project is a high-grade, high margin project currently in the definitive feasibility stage. An underground decline to provide access for an exploration drill program has been initiated. The drill program will target the continuation of the high-grade gold mineralization below the proposed pit which has the potential to significantly enhance the robust economics of the project. The Company recently announced an agreement to acquire Rye Patch Gold, including its 100% owned Florida Canyon Mine and all of its resource and exploration projects along the Oreana and Cortez Gold trends. The acquisition is expected to be completed in late May 2018. The Company also has a portfolio of other exploration properties, all of which are located in Mexico.\nFootnotes:\n1) Non-GAAP Measure: All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce\nThe Company has adopted an all-in sustaining cost per ounce on a by-product basis performance measure which is calculated based on the guidance note issued by the World Gold Council. Management uses this information as an additional measure to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash.\nAll-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis include total production cash costs, corporate and administrative expenses, sustaining capital expenditures and accretion for site reclamation and closure costs. These reclamation and closure costs represent the gradual unwinding of the discounted liability to rehabilitate the area around the Mine at the end of the mine life. The Company believes this measure to be representative of the total costs associated with producing gold; however, this performance measure has no standardized meaning. As such, there are likely to be differences in the method of computation when compared to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the all-in sustaining cost per gold ounce on a by-product basis to the consolidated financial statements:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Production costs $ 15,514 $ 19,362 Corporate and administrative expenses (1) 2,113 1,325 Sustaining capital expenditures 4,414 1,561 Accretion for site reclamation and closure 76 57 Less: By-product silver credits (93 ) (208 ) All-in sustaining costs 22,024 22,097 Divided by gold sold (ozs) 17,449 26,048 All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce on a by-product basis $ 1,262 $ 848 (1) Corporate and administrative expenses adjusted for the three months ended March 31, 2018, to remove Rye Patch transaction costs of $0.8 million.\n(2) Sustaining capital expenditures include deferred stripping of $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n2) Non-GAAP Measure: Cash cost per gold ounce and cash cost per gold ounce on a by-product basis\nCash cost per gold ounce and cash cost per gold ounce on a by-product basis are non-GAAP performance measures that management uses to assess the Company’s performance and its expected future performance. The Company has included the non-GAAP performance measures of cash cost per gold ounce and cash cost per gold ounce on a by-product basis throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, these are common performance measures but they do not have any standardized meaning. As such, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nManagement believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, presentation of these measures is to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe cash cost per gold ounce is calculated by dividing the operating production costs by the total number of gold ounces sold. The cash cost per gold ounce on a by-product basis is calculated by deducting the by-product silver credits per gold ounce sold from the cash cost per gold ounce. The following table provides a reconciliation of the cash cost per gold ounce and cash cost per gold ounce on a by-product basis to the consolidated financial statements:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Production costs $ 15,514 $ 19,362 Divided by gold sold (ozs) 17,449 26,048 Cash cost per gold ounce 889 743 Less: By-product silver credits per gold ounce (1) (5 ) (8 ) Cash cost per gold ounce on a by-product basis $ 884 $ 735 (1) Management determined that silver metal revenues, when compared to gold metal revenues, are immaterial and therefore considered a by-product of the production of gold. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 total by-product silver credits were $0.1 million (three months ended March 31, 2017 - $0.2 million).\nFor further details on the calculation of production costs, refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Cash cost per gold ounce and cash cost per gold ounce on a by-product basis are not necessarily indicative of earnings from operations or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.\n3) Working capital is calculated by deducting current liabilities from current assets\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements and information contained in this news release constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable U.S. securities laws and “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws, which we refer to collectively as “forward-looking statements”.
