    "text": "A free ice cream cone for a good cause. What more could you ask for?\nHäagen-Dazs locations in the U.S. will be giving out free cones from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday. But instead of asking for your loyalty in return, Häagen-Dazs is using the free cones to draw attention to the plight of bees.\nFor 10 years, Häagen-Dazs has been supporting initiatives to help bees in the face of colony collapse disorder—which is what happens when the majority of worker bees abandon a colony—and in general to draw attention to the ecological necessity of the oft-maligned little insects. As noble as the campaign for bees may be, Häagen-Dazs also has an ulterior motive: 1/3 of Häagen-Dazs ice cream flavors depend on bees.\nGetting a free cone from Häagen-Dazs today, then, is really a no-brainer. The hardest decision you’ll have to make is cup, sugar cone, or cake cone.\nAfter you finish savoring your free ice cream, you might think about donating all that cash you didn’t spend to the Xerces Society , an organization that works to protect bees and other invertebrates.\nOf course, if you can’t make it to a Häagen-Dazs location today for a free cone, you can still learn more about bees.",
