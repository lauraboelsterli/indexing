    "text": "EditorsNote: rewords lede\nRight-hander Jordan Lyles made the second-longest bid for a perfect game in Padres history Tuesday, and a pair of two-run homers by Eric Hosmer and Christian Villanueva provided all the offense needed by San Diego in a 4-0 victory over the visiting Colorado Rockies.\nTrevor Story’s one-out single to left in the eighth ended Lyles’ bid for the first no-hitter in Padres history as well as the perfect game.\nThe Padres are the only major league team without a no-hitter — a record that spans 7,858 games since the franchise’s birth in 1969 as an expansion team.\nAfter Story singled, Lyles walked Pat Valaika before leaving the field to a standing ovation.\nLyles, 27, tied his career high with 10 strikeouts. He threw 85 pitches in his second start of the season, with 64 going for strikes.\nBefore Story’s single, the Padres’ position players hadn’t really been called upon to make a strong defensive play behind Lyles, who had at least one strikeout in every inning except for the fourth.\nLyles (1-1) had played parts of four seasons with Colorado before signing with the Padres last August after being released by the Rockies. He had made 13 relief appearances this season before he made his first start on May 10 against the St. Louis Cardinals.\nTuesday marked the first time that Lyles won a game against the Rockies. It was also his first victory at Petco Park.\nThis is the second time this season the Padres came close to their first no-hitter: Tyson Ross allowed no hits for 7 2/3 innings April 20 in Arizona.\nTuesday’s one-hitter was the 30th in Padres’ history and followed April 20 as the second this year.\nAfter Lyles departed, the Rockies loaded the bases in the eighth before center fielder Manuel Margot charged in to make an inning-ending catch of Ian Desmond’s line drive.\nHosmer hit a two-run homer in the first off German Marquez (2-5) to give the Padres the lead. Travis Jankowski opened the inning with a single, and Hosmer followed with his sixth homer to right-center.\nVillanueva, who ended a franchise-record 0-for-37 run Monday night, hit a two-run homer in sixth after Franmil Reyes got his first major league hit. The long ball was Villanueva’s 10th of the season.\nKirby Yates recorded one out in the eighth, and Brad Hand got the final four outs for his 12th save.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
