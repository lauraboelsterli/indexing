    "text": "3 Hours Ago | 04:25\nLeon Cooperman , chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, shared his market views Tuesday on CNBC's \" Halftime Report .\"\n\"A lot of these FANG stocks with the exception of Amazon support very very reasonable valuations relative to their growth rates,\" he said. \"The biggest concern I have frankly is government intervention. The government looking at their success and dominance and sticking their beak into their business.\"\nFANG stocks are a basket of high-growth technology stocks â€” Facebook , Amazon , Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) that have led the bull run of the last 9 years. Scott Mlyn | CNBC Leon Cooperman on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\"\nThe investor confirmed his firm was long Facebook shares and said he had an open order to buy more of the social media company's stock at the $180 per share level.\nHe said Facebook can grow its earnings at 20 percent per year and trades around a 20 times this year's earnings versus the S&P 500's 5 percent growth and 17 times earnings.\nFacebook has \"a fortress balance sheet. It doesn't look expensive to me,\" he said.\nThe investor also recommended AMC Networks .\nCooperman founded Omega Advisors in 1991. The firm has approximately $3.4 billion in assets under management, according to its website .",
