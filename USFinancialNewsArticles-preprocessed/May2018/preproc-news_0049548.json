FILE PHOTO: Customers leave a Mothercare shop in London October 11, 2008. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo\nMark Newton-Jones proposed taking the struggling retailer private before his departure in April, Bloomberg reported. Newton-Jones was rehired as chief executive last week.\nMothercare said in a statement that “at certain points the board considers various strategic options available to the company.\n“However, no specific plans were drawn up in relation to an MBO.” Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Kate Holton",
