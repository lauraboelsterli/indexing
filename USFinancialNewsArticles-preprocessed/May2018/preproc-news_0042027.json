    "text": "Dustin Fowler hit his first major league home run and added an RBI double to lead the visiting Oakland Athletics to a 3-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night.\nThe Athletics, who ended a six-game losing streak at the Rogers Centre on Thursday, have won the first two games of the four-game series and are 5-3 with two games left on a 10-game road trip.\nThe Athletics lost their starting pitcher in the early innings for the second game in a row.\nBrett Anderson, who allowed two hits and no runs in the first inning, left the game after one inning. The left-hander started to warm up for the bottom of the second but left with a shoulder strain. Right-hander Josh Lucas, recalled Friday from Triple-A Nashville, replaced him.\nRight-hander Andrew Triggs left his start in the third inning Thursday with right arm nerve irritation and was put on the disabled list Friday.\nOakland left-hander Danny Coulombe (1-1) allowed one walk and struck out three in 1 1/3 innings to pick up the win.\nBlake Treinen punched out three over 1 1/3 perfect innings to earn his ninth save. Oakland pitching struck out 15 Toronto hitters for the game.\nToronto starter Marco Estrada (2-4) allowed three runs, seven hits and no walks and struck out six in 6 2/3 innings.\nFowler led off the third with the first homer of career, an opposite-field blast off Estrada.\nThe Blue Jays tied the game in the fifth when Luke Maile doubled and scored on Gio Urshela’s two-out single. Lucas, who struck out seven in 3 2/3 innings, was then replaced by Coulombe.\nThe A’s took a 3-1 lead in the seventh with two-out doubles by Chad Pinder, Fowler and Josh Phegley. Danny Barnes then replaced Estrada.\nOakland’s Chris Hatcher pitched around a single in the seventh.\nTreinen took over in the eighth after Yusmeiro Petit allowed a two-out walk to Justin Smoak and a single to Yangervis Solarte.\nFor the A’s, Lucas and right-hander Emilio Pagan were recalled from Nashville on Friday with Triggs going on the DL and reliever Ryan Dull being optioned to Nashville.\nBefore the game, the Blue Jays put left-hander Jaime Garcia (shoulder inflammation) on the DL and recalled right-hander Deck McGuire from Triple-A Buffalo.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
