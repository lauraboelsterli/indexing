    "text": "First quarter production volumes averaged 16.8 MBoe per day, above high end of guidance\nEnhanced completion wells continue to outperform type curve First quarter GAAP net income of $13.9 million, or $0.68 per diluted share; adjusted net income (1) of $21.8 million, or $1.07 per diluted share; adjusted EBITDAX (1) of $29.7 million\n(1) Non-GAAP measures, see attached Reconciliation Schedules\nDENVER, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (NYSE:BCEI) (the \"Company\" or \"Bonanza Creek\") today announces its first quarter 2018 financial results and operating outlook and has posted an updated investor presentation on its corporate website.\nEric Greager, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"I am excited to be part of the Bonanza Creek team and believe that the first quarter marked a solid start to the year. Our team has made great progress in driving better well results through the application of higher-intensity completions. I look forward to continuing our innovation in this area and applying these techniques across our acreage position. I am also pleased with Bonanza’s differentiated midstream capabilities and the demonstrated value that they provide to our operations. I believe that 2018 will be a pivotal year for our company and shareholders.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported average daily production of 16.8 MBoe per day, which exceeded the high end of the Company's guidance range of 16.0 – 16.6 MBoe per day. Production outperformance for the quarter was a result of strong new well completions and consistently low line pressures on the Company's Rocky Mountain Infrastructure system (\"RMI\").The Company's first quarter production decreased by 5% when compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to minimal drilling and completion activity throughout the first half of 2017. Product mix for the first quarter of 2018 was 59% oil, 17% NGLs, and 24% natural gas.\nNet revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $64.2 million, compared to $52.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in first quarter 2018 net revenue compared to 2017 was a result of increased commodity pricing, greater oil-weighted production, and the adoption of ASC 606, which requires revenues to be reported on a gross basis and no longer net of certain gathering, transportation, and processing charges. The net effect of these changes in presentation increased revenues and related gathering, transportation, and processing line items for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, by $2.3 million, and had no effect on net income. Please see additional disclosure on the adoption of this revenue recognition standard in note 3 of the Company's 10-Q filed on May 8, 2018. Crude oil accounted for approximately 81% of total revenue. Differentials for the Company's Rocky Mountain oil production during the quarter averaged approximately $5.68 per Bbl off of NYMEX WTI. Corporate average realized prices for the first quarter of 2018 are presented below.\nAverage Realized Prices Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Oil (per Bbl) 57.89 Gas (per Mcf) 2.78 NGL (per Bbl) 23.33 Boe (Per Boe) 42.27 Lease operating expense (\"LOE\") for the first quarter of 2018 was $10.5 million, or $6.93 per Boe, a 5% increase in total LOE compared to $9.9 million, or $6.28 per Boe, in the first quarter of 2017. Gas plant and midstream operating expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.6 million, or $2.39 per Boe, a 34% increase in total gas plant and midstream operating expense compared to $2.7 million, or $1.71 per Boe, in the first quarter of 2017. Absolute and per-unit LOE and gas plant and midstream operating expenses increased during the first quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of implementation costs from compressor swaps that occurred during the quarter. The Company accelerated its transition to an efficient fleet, which is expected to reduce compressor costs and help ensure low gathering system pressures going forward. These reduced costs, along with increased production, are expected to drive down per-unit LOE metrics each quarter for the remainder of 2018.\nBelow is a breakout of the Company's regional LOE and gas plant and midstream operating expense for the first quarter of 2018.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Rocky Mountain Mid-Continent Total Company ($M) ($/Boe) ($M) ($/Boe) ($M) ($/Boe) Lease operating expense $ 7,424 $ 6.00 $ 3,035 $ 11.15 $ 10,459 $ 6.93 Gas plant and midstream operating expense $ 2,368 $ 1.92 $ 1,245 $ 4.57 3,613 $ 2.39 Total $ 9,792 $ 7.92 $ 4,280 $ 15.72 $ 14,072 $ 9.32 The Company's general and administrative (\"G&A\") expense was $9.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, a 21% decrease from the first quarter of 2017. The decrease is primarily due to reduced advisory fees and cost reduction initiatives that were implemented since the Company's restructuring, including the previously announced reduction in force, which occurred in August of 2017.\nReported net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $13.9 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $94.3 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. The net loss in 2017 was driven by reorganization items of $89.0 million. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $21.8 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $0.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in adjusted net income over the prior year was driven by improved cost structure, greater oil-weighted production, and an increase in commodity prices over the prior period.\nAdjusted EBITDAX for the first quarter of 2018 was $29.7 million, a 9% increase compared to $27.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDAX are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the respective reconciliations in the schedules at the end of this release for additional information about these measures.\nThe table below summarizes the Company's annual results as compared to previously provided guidance.\nGuidance vs Actual Summary 1Q18 Guidance 1Q18 Actual Production (MBoe/d) 16.0 - 16.6 16.8 Annual Guidance YTD Actual Lease operating expense ($/Boe) $5.00 - $6.00 $ 6.93 Gas plant and midstream operating expense ($/Boe) $1.40 - $1.80 $ 2.39 Cash G&A ($MM)* $32 - $34 $ 9 Production taxes (% of pre-derivative realization) 7% - 8% 8 % CAPEX ($MM) $280 - $320 $ 52 * Cash G&A guidance is a non-GAAP measure that is exclusive of the Company's stock based compensation. The Company does not guide to GAAP G&A expense as it has excessive uncertainty due to the stock based compensation portion of GAAP G&A. Please refer to the non-GAAP disclosure at the end of this release for information regarding cash G&A. The Company reported quarterly production above the high end of guidance in the first quarter. The Company's lease operating expense and gas plant and midstream operating expense for the first quarter were above the Company's expectation due to the aforementioned accelerated compressor swap program, which resulted in moderately higher per Boe metrics. The Company expects its per-unit operating costs to reduce throughout the year as production volumes increase and system efficiencies are utilized.\nProduction, Capital, and Expense Outlook\nThe Company is updating its 2018 annual guidance and providing second quarter 2018 production guidance. Annual operating cost and CAPEX guidance ranges remain unchanged from the previously provided guidance ranges with the exception of recurring cash G&A, which has been updated to reflect compensation for the Company's newly-appointed CEO. Below is a table summarizing the Company's production, capital, and expense guidance for the remainder of 2018.\nGuidance Summary Three Months Ended\nJune 30, 2018 Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2018 Production (MBoe/d) 18.0 – 18.6 17.7 – 18.7 LOE ($/Boe) $5.00 – $6.00 Midstream expense ($/Boe) $1.40 – $1.80 Recurring cash G&A* ($MM) $33 – $35 Production taxes (% of pre-derivative realization) 7% – 8% Total CAPEX ($MM) $280 – $320 * Recurring Cash G&A is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the Company's stock based compensation. The Company does not guide to GAAP G&A expense as it has excessive uncertainty due to the stock based compensation portion of GAAP G&A. Operational Highlights\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company spud 18 gross (12.6 net) operated wells, seven of which were extended reach lateral (\"XRL\") wells, and completed 8 gross (6.5 net) operated wells, all of which were standard reach lateral (\"SRL\") wells.\nThe Company is providing initial well results for the three XRL wells on its J21 and T21 pads, which were completed in the second half of 2017 on the Company's central acreage. These two pads had a combined well count of five wells, two SRLs and three XRLs. The three XRL wells have average cumulative production of 8.6 MBoe per 1,000 feet of lateral after 156 days of production and are outperforming the Company's legacy central XRL type curve by approximately 35%. The average projected three-stream EUR for these XRL wells is approximately 680 MBoe. The Company is encouraged by these results, as they are the first XRL results the Company has obtained using the enhanced stimulation and controlled flow-back programs.\nAt the beginning of 2018, the Company turned online its eight-SRL F26 pad on its western legacy acreage. Results from these wells have been encouraging and are exceeding the Company's legacy west SRL type curve by 40%. These eight SRL wells have average cumulative production of 6.5 MBoe per 1,000 feet of lateral after 78 days of production. The wells on this pad still have increasing daily production rates, and as such the Company is waiting for the rates to peak before determining an EUR.\nThe Company has provided updated production results for these wells along with updated production data from its other enhanced completion wells in its May Investor Presentation, which is available on the Company's website.\nFinancial Highlights\nAs of the end of the first quarter, the Company had liquidity of $182.5 million, which included cash on hand of $5.8 million and $176.7 million of borrowing capacity under its credit facility. The Company has no outstanding term debt and had $15.0 million outstanding on its credit facility. The Company's balance sheet strength allows it to be flexible, patient and selective in its investment decisions, and the opportunity to participate in growth opportunities.\nCommodity Derivative Position\nThe Company's current hedge position is summarized in the table below and reflects additional hedges the Company entered into through May 8, 2018.\nCrude Oil\n(NYMEX WTI) Natural Gas\n(NYMEX Henry Hub) Bbls/day Weighted Avg.\nPrice per Bbl MMBtu/day Weighted Avg.\nPrice per MMBTU 2Q18 Cashless Collar 2,000 $42.00/$52.50 6,259 $2.75/$3.38 Swap 3,835 55.03 — — 3Q18 Cashless Collar 2,000 $43.00/$53.50 7,600 $2.75/$3.31 Swap 5,000 57.87 — — 4Q18 Cashless Collar 2,000 $43.00/$53.50 6,600 $2.75/$3.37 Swap 5,000 58.07 — — 1Q19 Cashless Collar 2,000 $43.00/$54.53 7,600 $2.75/$3.22 Swap 4,000 58.16 — — 2Q19 Cashless Collar 1,330 $44.01/$54.79 2,505 $2.75/$3.22 Swap 4,500 58.32 — — 3Q19 Swap 3,000 55.00 — — 4Q19 Swap 3,000 55.00 — — Conference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these financial and operating results on May 9, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Mountain Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

share amounts, unaudited)\nAdjusted net income (loss) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management to present recurring profitability that is more comparable between periods by excluding items that are non-recurring in nature or items which are not easily estimable. Management believes adjusted net income (loss) provides external users of the Company's consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts, investors, creditors, and rating agencies with additional information to assist in their analysis of the Company. The Company defines adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss) after adjusting first for (1) the impact of certain non-cash items and one-time transactions and then (2) the non-cash and one time items’ impact on taxes based on a tax rate that approximates the Company's effective tax rate in each period. Adjusted net income (loss) is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted net income (loss).\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ 13,870 $ (94,276 ) Adjustments to net income (loss): Derivative loss 8,742 — Derivative cash settlements (4,312 ) — Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties 2,502 — Exploratory dry hole expense — 2,701 Unused commitments 21 993 Stock-based compensation (1) 1,008 1,725 Reorganization items, net — 89,003 Pre-petition advisory fees (1) — 683 Total adjustments before taxes 7,961 95,105 Income tax effect — — Total adjustments after taxes $ 7,961 $ 95,105 Adjusted net income (loss) $ 21,831 $ 829\nAdjusted net income (loss) per diluted share (2) $ 1.07 $ 0.02\nDiluted weighted-average common shares outstanding (2) 20,470 49,452 (1) Included as a portion of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. (2) For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company used the Successor's diluted weighted average share count to calculate adjusted net income per diluted share. Schedule 7: Adjusted EBITDAX\n(in thousands, unaudited)\nAdjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management to provide a metric of the Company's ability to internally generate funds for exploration and development of oil and gas properties. The metric excludes items which are non-recurring in nature and/or items which are not reasonably estimable. Management believes adjusted EBITDAX provides external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies with additional information to assist in their analysis of the Company. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, impairment, exploration expenses and other similar non-cash and non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income (loss) or cash flows as determined by GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDAX.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ 13,870 $ (94,276 ) Exploration 29 3,407 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 7,508 21,212 Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties 2,502 — Unused commitments 21 993 Stock-based compensation (1) 1,008 1,725 Interest expense 357 4,568 Derivative loss 8,742 — Derivative cash settlements (4,312 ) — Pre-petition advisory fees (1) — 683 Reorganization items, net — 89,003 Income tax effect — — Adjusted EBITDAX $ 29,725 $ 27,315 (1) Included as a portion of general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Schedule 8: Cash G&A\n(in thousands, unaudited)\nCash G&A is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management to provide only the cash portion of its G&A expense, which can be used to evaluate cost management and operating efficiency on a comparable basis from period to period. Management believes cash G&A provides external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies with additional information to assist in their analysis of the Company. The Company defines cash G&A as GAAP general and administrative expense exclusive of the Company's stock based compensation and one-time charges, such as severance costs and advisor fees. The Company refers to cash G&A to provide typical cash G&A costs that are planned for in a given period. Cash G&A is not a fully inclusive measure of general and administrative expense as determined by GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of general and administrative expense to the non-GAAP financial measure of cash G&A.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 General and administrative $ 9,533 $ 12,094 Stock-based compensation (1,008 ) (1,725 ) Cash G&A $ 8,525 $ 10,369\nSource:Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc.",
