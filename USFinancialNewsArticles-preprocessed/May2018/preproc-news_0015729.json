    "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation (NASDAQ:OCSL) (“Oaktree Specialty Lending” or the “Company”), a specialty finance company, today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSecond Fiscal Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal investment income of $34.8 million, or $0.25 per share;\nNet investment income of $15.3 million, or $0.11 per share;\nNet asset value per share as of March 31, 2018 of $5.87; and\nOriginated $223.2 million of new investment commitments and received $151.8 million in connection with five full repayments and exits of investments.\nManagement Commentary\n“We have made measurable progress in executing on our plan to reposition the portfolio and enhance its return on equity,” said Edgar Lee, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Oaktree Specialty Lending. “In the second quarter, we continued to reduce non-core investments, while redeploying capital into $223 million of new investments better aligned with Oaktree’s investment approach. The significant advantages of Oaktree’s platform, including scale, relationships and a disciplined approach to credit investing have begun to show tangible results for OCSL.”\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $1.4 billion and was comprised of investments in 115 companies. These included loans to 72 companies, 8 public bond issuances, the investment in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC (“SLF JV I”) and equity investments in 59 companies, including in SLF JV I and 16 private equity funds. 25 of these equity investments were in companies in which Oaktree Specialty Lending also had a debt investment.\nAt fair value, 92.4% of the Company's portfolio as of March 31, 2018 consisted of debt investments, including 52.8% of first lien loans, 23.8% of second lien loans and 15.8% of unsecured debt investments, including the debt investments in SLF JV I.\nAs of March 31, 2018, SLF JV I had $322.9 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 40 portfolio companies. The joint venture generated income of $4.2 million for Oaktree Specialty Lending during the second quarter.\nThe weighted average yield on the Company's debt investments as of March 31, 2018, including the return on our mezzanine note investments in SLF JV I, was 9.3%.\nAs of March 31, 2018, $1.1 billion of the Company's debt investments, or 84.6% of the total debt portfolio, at fair value, had floating interest rates.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company originated $223.2 million of investment commitments, including investments in nine new and one existing portfolio company, and funded $227.8 million of investments across new and existing portfolio companies.\nDuring the quarter, the Company received $151.8 million from the full repayments and exits of five investments, and $90.1 million from other paydowns and sales of investments.\nResults of Operations\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $34.8 million, including $26.6 million of cash interest income from portfolio investments. Payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") interest income, net of PIK collected in cash, represented 5.3% of total investment income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet expenses for the quarter were $19.5 million, a decrease of $1.0 million from the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net expenses was due primarily to a decrease in professional fees, interest expense and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in Part I incentive fees.\nNet unrealized depreciation on the investment portfolio for the quarter was $0.4 million and net realized gains on investments and secured borrowings for the quarter were $4.9 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $8.2 million of cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash), total principal value of debt outstanding of $586.0 million and $417.0 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facility, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 4.9% as of March 31, 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s total leverage ratio was 0.71x debt-to-equity.\nDividend Declaration\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.095 per share, payable on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record on June 15, 2018.\nDividends are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of dividend distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company’s stockholders.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nAs of March 31, 2018, there were eight investments on which the Company had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or original issue discount (\"OID\") income that, in the aggregate, represented 12.8% of the debt portfolio at cost and 2.4% at fair value.\n($ in thousands) Non-Accrual - Debt Investments As of March 31, 2018 As of September 30, 2017 Non-Accrual Investments at Fair Value $ 30,886 $ 67,015 Non-Accrual Investments/Total Investments at Fair Value 2.4 % 4.7 %\nOaktree Specialty Lending Corporation Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities (in thousands, except per share amounts) March 31, 2018 (unaudited) December 31, 2017 (unaudited) September 30,\n2017 ASSETS Investments at fair value: Control investments (cost March 31, 2018: $431,809;
