    "text": "Zelalem — May 8, 2018 0 comment\nCAIRO (Reuters) – Technical talks between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over a disputed dam Ethiopia is building on the Nile river failed to make a breakthrough, Egypt’s foreign minister said on Monday, amid pressure for a deal before the project opens this year. A general view of Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam in Ethiopia March 31, 2015. REUTER/Tiksa Negeri\nEgypt and Ethiopia are at loggerheads over the construction of the Grand Renaissance Dam, a $4 billion-hydroelectric project that Cairo fears will reduce waters that run to its fields and reservoirs from Ethiopia’s highlands and via Sudan.\nAddis Ababa hopes the dam will make it a hub for the electricity-hungry region and denies it will undermine Egypt’s access to water.\nSameh Shoukry said technical experts who met in Addis Ababa last week did not achieve a breakthrough.\n“I have spoken to the minister of irrigation, who attended this meeting, and what has reached me is that the obstruction that has bogged down this path for more than a year has not been overcome,” Shoukry told reporters during a news conference in Cairo with his visiting Ugandan counterpart.
