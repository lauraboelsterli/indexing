    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” A Los Angeles man who helped evade taxes on 143 million cigarettes has been sentenced to federal prison.\nUn Hag Baeg got a 46-month sentence on Monday for conspiracy and was ordered to pay more than $7 million to the government.\nBaeg ran a company that provided supplies to cargo vessels. Authorities say he evaded millions of dollars in excise taxes due on cigarettes sold in the United States by claiming they were for export only and would be provided to ships sailing out of the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports.\nThe cigarettes were kept in an L.A. port warehouse and sold in the U.S., with paperwork faked to indicate they'd been exported.\nAnother man, Isaac Rojas of El Monte, also pleaded guilty last year and awaits sentencing.",
