    "text": "PORTLAND, Maine, ImmuCell Corporation (Nasdaq:ICCC) (“ImmuCell” or the “Company”), a growing animal health company that develops, manufactures and markets scientifically-proven and practical products that improve the health and productivity of dairy and beef cattle, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nManagement Discussion:\n“Customer demand for our products is up, but orders shipped during the first quarter of 2018 were below expectations, primarily due to manufacturing challenges related to the production of our First Defense ® product line,” commented Michael F. Brigham, President and CEO. “We ended the first quarter with a backlog of orders worth approximately $1.2 million.”\nThe market’s response to the newly introduced Tri-Shield ™ First Defense ® has been very strong, creating a backlog for the product. This Tri-Shield ™ backlog is a strong indication that dairy and beef producers value the ability to protect newborn calves with immediate immunity from the three most common scours-causing pathogens – E. coli , coronavirus and rotavirus – in one preventative treatment at birth. Additionally, in the short time that the product has been on the market, the Company has gained substantial traction with its Beyond Vaccination ™ message that positions the product as a viable substitute for traditional dam-level scours vaccine programs. This is a large new market opportunity for the Company. Although the Company is currently experiencing some supply interruptions, which can be common with the roll-out of new products, the expectation is that the Tri-Shield ™ backlog should be alleviated by the end of 2018.\n“We also ended the first quarter with a substantial order backlog of our flagship First Defense ® bivalent product, primarily due to a reduction in the biological yield from an expanded supply of colostrum,” continued Mr. Brigham. “We have reacted by improving quality control processes, modifying production methods to increase yields and implementing manufacturing redundancies. Since the end of the first quarter, the backlog for the legacy formats of the First Defense ® product line (excluding Tri-Shield ™ First Defense ® ) has been cut by approximately 41% to approximately $536,000. We expect to clear this backlog in June and proceed forward with adequate inventory.”\nFirst Quarter Results:\nSales:\nIf the Company had sufficient inventory to fulfill all orders on hand as of March 31, 2018, sales would have been up 16% and 9% during the three-month period and rolling twelve months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, in comparison to the same periods ended March 31, 2017. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, total product sales decreased by approximately $663,000 to $2.9 million due to limited supply compared to $3.5 million during the same period in 2017, a decrease of 19%. During the rolling twelve months ended March 31, 2018, total product sales decreased by approximately $333,000 to $9.8 million compared to $10.1 million during the same period ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of 3%. Sales of the First Defense ® product line decreased by 14% and less than 1% during the quarter and rolling twelve months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, in comparison to the same periods ended March 31, 2017.\nOther:\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $285,000 and $218,000 during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Product development expenses were $583,000 and $340,000 during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of approximately $243,000 or 72%. Product development expenses were $2.3 million and $1.3 million during the rolling twelve months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of approximately $1 million or 79%. Net (loss) was ($221,000), or ($0.04) per share, during the first quarter of 2018 in contrast to net income of $584,000, or $0.12 per diluted share, during the first quarter of 2017. Cash provided by operating activities was approximately $250,000 and $1.3 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company is making consistent progress toward meeting the final requirements for FDA approval of its Nisin-based intramammary treatment for subclinical mastitis. The first phased Nisin Drug Substance CMC Technical Section submission to the FDA is anticipated during the third quarter of 2018. A second phased submission, which would include responses to the first phased review, is expected to be filed in the first half of 2019. This timeline supports obtaining FDA approval by late 2019 or early 2020.\n“While the financial results for the three months may be off, I am already eager to report the results for the six-month period ending June 30, 2018,” concluded Mr. Brigham. “Our most immediate objective for the balance of the year is to increase our production output, regain any lost customers and position ImmuCell for consistent growth going forward. Our flagship First Defense ® bivalent product line and our newly introduced Tri-Shield ™ First Defense ® product are both experiencing strong demand, and our Nisin-based intramammary treatment for subclinical mastitis continues through the FDA process. We believe that 2018 will be an important year that sets the stage for our success in the coming years.”\nB alance Sheet Data as of March 31, 2018:\nCash and cash equivalents decreased to $3.1 million as of March 31, 2018 from $3.8 million as of December 31, 2017. Net working capital decreased to $5 million as of March 31, 2018 from $5.4 million as of December 31, 2017.
