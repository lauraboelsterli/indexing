    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda, April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:BCRH) (the \"Company\"), a Bermuda holding company that, through its operating subsidiaries, offers collateralized reinsurance in the property catastrophe market and invests in various insurance-linked securities, today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company recorded net income of $0.5 million ($0.06 per share) for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company’s fully converted book value per common share was $14.25 at March 31, 2018, reflecting a 0.5% increase for the quarter inclusive of dividends declared.\nReinsurance premiums written for the current quarter were $12.5 million, decreasing by $4.5 million over the same period a year ago. The decrease was a result of reduced writings driven by a smaller capital base and greater cessions to third party reinsurers, partially offset by an average risk adjusted price increase of 12% during the January renewals.\nThe combined ratio for the current quarter was 98.0% compared to 56.5% in the same period a year ago. The deterioration in the current periods' combined ratio was driven by significantly higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratios. The current quarter's loss and loss adjustment expenses of $4.5 million compared unfavorably to the $1.8 million reported a year ago, stemming from an increase in estimated losses related to Hurricane Irma which made landfall in Florida in September 2017. Reinsurance acquisition costs for the current quarter were $1.9 million compared to $2.7 million a year ago, reflecting lower premium earnings and profit commissions. General and administrative expenses for the current quarter were $1.1 million compared to $1.3 million a year ago due to lower performance fees in the current quarter.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company declared a regular dividend of $0.30 per common share, which was paid on April 13, 2018.\nMichael J. McGuire, Chairman and CEO, commented: \"The first quarter results were adversely impacted by an increase in reported losses related to Hurricane Irma as claim settlements and related loss adjustment expenses were greater than originally expected. Pricing continues to show positive momentum, and as we previously reported, we achieved improved pricing during January renewals. The market improvements coupled with our strategic alignment with Sompo International Holdings Ltd., has enabled us to construct an improved portfolio year over year with higher return expectations and a lower risk profile.\"\nAbout the Company\nBlue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Ltd., through its operating subsidiaries, offers collateralized reinsurance in the property catastrophe market, leveraging underwriting expertise and infrastructure from established resources.

However, these measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP.\n(2) Computed as the change in fully converted book value per common share plus common dividends declared of $0.30 and $0.90 during the three and twelve month periods ended March 31, 2018, respectively.\nBLUE CAPITAL REINSURANCE HOLDINGS LTD.\nNatural Catastrophe Risk Management\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the \" Risk Factors \" included in Item 1A of the Company’s 2017 Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the risk factor entitled \"Our stated catastrophe and enterprise-wide risk management exposures are based on estimates and judgments which are subject to significant uncertainties.\"\nExposure Management\nThe Company’s Investment and Insurance Manager (the \"Manager\") monitors our net exposure to any one catastrophe loss event in any single zone within certain broadly defined major catastrophe zones at each treaty renewal date. The last major treaty renewal date was January 1, 2018. Our January 1, 2018 estimated net exposures by zone were in compliance with our underwriting guidelines. Namely, our estimated net exposure from any one catastrophe loss event in any individual zone was at or below 50% of our then-projected March 31, 2018 shareholders’ equity. These broadly defined major catastrophe zones are defined as follows:\nNorth America : Europe : Rest of World: U.S. - Northeast Western Central Europe (1) Australia U.S. - Mid-Atlantic Eastern Europe New Zealand U.S. - Florida Southern Europe Japan U.S. - Gulf Northern Europe, Benelux South America U.S. - New Madrid and Scandinavia Middle East U.S. - Midwest U.K. and Ireland U.S. - California U.S. - Hawaii Canada - Eastern Canada - Western (1) Consisting of France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria.\nSingle Event Losses\nFor certain defined natural catastrophe region and peril combinations, the Manager assesses the probability and likely magnitude of losses using a combination of industry third-party models, proprietary models and underwriting judgment. The Manager attempts to model the estimated net impact from a single event, taking into account contributions from property catastrophe reinsurance (including retrocessional business), property pro-rata reinsurance and event-linked derivative securities, offset by the net benefit of any reinsurance or derivative protections we purchase and the benefit of premiums.\nOn January 1, 2018 our estimated single event loss exposures were within our underwriting guidelines. Namely, the estimated net impact from any one catastrophe loss event (excluding earthquake) at the 1 in 100 year return period for any one zone did not exceed 35% of our then-projected March 31, 2018 shareholders’ equity, and the estimated net impact from any one earthquake loss event at the 1 in 250 year return period for any zone did not exceed 35% of our then-projected March 31, 2018 shareholders’ equity.\nUpdated Single Event Loss Projections\nThe table that follows details our estimated net impact from single event losses as of January 1, 2018 for selected zones at specified return periods using industry-recognized third-party vendor models. The values noted take into account the impact of the 2017 third quarter loss events on our limits reinsured and shareholders' equity. It is important to note that each catastrophe model we use contains its own assumptions as to the frequency and severity of loss events, and results may vary significantly from model to model.\nNet Impact From Single Event Losses at Specified Return Periods\nNet Impact\n(Millions) Return Period (1) Percentage of March 31, 2018\nShareholders’ Equity U.S. - Florida hurricane $ 34 1 in 100 year 27 % U.S. - California earthquake 24 1 in 250 year 19 % Japan earthquake 20 1 in 250 year 16 % U.S. - Gulf hurricane 19 1 in 100 year 15 % All other zones less than 15 % (1) A \"100-year\" return period can also be referred to as the 1.0% occurrence exceedance probability (\"OEP\"), meaning there is an estimated 1.0% chance in any given year that this level will be exceeded. A \"250-year\" return period can also be referred to as the 0.4% OEP, meaning there is an estimated 0.4% chance in any given year that this level will be exceeded.\nOur single event loss estimates represent snapshots as of the time of such estimates. The composition of our in-force portfolio may change materially at any time due to the acceptance of new policies, losses incurred, the expiration of existing policies and changes in our ceded reinsurance and derivative protections. There were no material changes made to the composition of our in-force portfolio from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.\nSource:Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings",
