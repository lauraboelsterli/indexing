    "text": "Jonathan Schoop homered twice to help starter David Hess win in his major league debut as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 6-3 in the first game of a doubleheader on Saturday at Oriole Park.\nThe Orioles now have won a season-best four straight games, and they hit three homers in this contest.\nTampa Bay has dropped five in a row.\nHess was the 26th man on the Orioles’ roster (which is allowed for doubleheaders), and after starting poorly, rebounded strongly. The right-hander gave up three runs on four hits in the first inning and then retired 18 of the final 20 batters he faced.\nOverall, Hess (1-0) allowed three runs on six hits in six innings. He struck out three without a walk and threw just 78 pitches.\nTanner Scott (1 1/3 innings) and Mychal Givens (1 2/3 innings) took care of the final three innings. Givens earned his first career save.\nRays starter Chris Archer (2-3) gave up all six runs Baltimore scored in seven innings. He allowed seven hits and couldn’t hold the early 3-0 lead.\nMatt Duffy and the Rays gave Hess a rude welcome to the big leagues in the first. After the Rays got a pair of one-out singles, Duffy then crushed the first pitch from Hess and sent it into the Oriole bullpen in left-center for the 3-0 lead.\nBut the Orioles scored three in the second and then went ahead for good with two more in the third.\nSchoop hit a solo homer off Archer in the second, and Chance Sisco added an RBI double. Sisco later stole home on the back end of a double-steal, tying the game at 3-3.\nManny Machado and Schoop then hit back-to-back solo homers in the third to give the Orioles a 5-3 lead. Machado now has four homers in his last three games.\nThe Orioles added one more when Mark Trumbo scored on an Archer wild pitch in the sixth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
