    "text": "MARKHAM, Ontario, Sienna Senior Living Inc. (“ Sienna ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX:SIA) today announced its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Management’s Discussion and Analysis are available on the Company’s website at www.siennaliving.ca and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\n2018 First Quarter Highlights\nRevenue of $145.4 million in Q1 2018, up 8.5% from Q1 2017. Retirement Same Property NOI of $7.8 million in Q1 2018, up 5.5% from Q1 2017. Strong Balance Sheet: Debt to Gross Book Value at 50.3% vs 52.4% year-over-year, a decline of 210 bps. On a fully diluted basis, Debt to Gross Book Value would be 48.1%. Completed the previously announced acquisition of 10 high-quality retirement residences in Ontario, consisting of 1,245 private-pay suites located in the Greater Toronto Area and the Greater Ottawa Area, for an aggregate purchase price of $382 million (the “ Acquisition ”).\nSubsequent to the First Quarter:\nOn April 23, 2018, the Company gave notice that it will redeem on May 23, 2018 all of its outstanding Convertible Debentures. On May 1, 2018, the Company acquired an additional 16% in Glenmore Lodge in British Columbia, increasing the Company’s interest from 61% to 77%. This additional interest was purchased for $6.3 million, before closing costs and subject to customary closing adjustments.\n“We are pleased to report a strong first quarter of operating results, along with a robust balance sheet,” said Lois Cormack, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sienna. “In March,we completed the acquisition of 10 high-quality retirement residences, further executing on our strategy to expand our retirement portfolio in key markets, and taking a transformative step towards achieving a 50/50 portfolio mix of retirement and long-term care/residential care.”\nFinancial and Operating Highlights:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 Three months ended\nMarch 31, 2017 LTC/RC – Average total occupancy 97.9 % 97.9 % LTC/RC – Average private occupancy 98.4 % 98.8 % Retirement – Average occupancy 92.6 % 94.3 % Retirement – As at occupancy 92.6 % 93.8 %\n$000s except occupancy, per share and ratio data Three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2017 Revenue $ 145,357 $ 133,966 Operating expenses $ 112,953 $ 106,505 NOI (1) $ 32,404 $ 27,461 Net income $ 1,033 $ 4,679 Operating Funds from Operations (OFFO) (1) $ 18,471 $ 14,190 Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) (1) $ 20,816 $ 16,666 Net income per share, diluted $ 0.018 $ 0.099 OFFO per share, diluted $ 0.307 $ 0.299 AFFO per share, diluted $ 0.345 $ 0.349 Dividends declared per share $ 0.225 $ 0.225 Payout Ratio (2) 63.6 % 62.3 % Notes:\nNOI, OFFO and AFFO are not measures recognized under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS. NOI, OFFO and AFFO are supplemental measures of a company's performance, and management of the Company believes that NOI and OFFO are relevant measures of the Company’s earnings performance, and AFFO is a relevant measure of the Company’s ability to earn cash and pay dividends. The IFRS measurement most directly comparable to OFFO and AFFO is net income and cash flow from operating activities, respectively. Payout Ratio is calculated using dividends declared per share divided by the basic AFFO per share for the respective periods.\n2018 First Quarter\nRevenue increased by $11.4 million or 8.5% to $145.4 million over the comparable prior year period. The increase was principally related to the revenues generated from the acquisitions completed during 2017 and Q1 2018.\nOperating expenses increased by $6.4 million or 6.1% to $113.0 million over the comparable prior year period. The increase was principally related to timing of expenditures and expenses incurred by the properties acquired during 2017 and Q1 2018, partially offset by a prior year tax adjustment of $1.3 million.\nNOI increased by $4.9 million or 18.0% to $32.4 million over the comparable prior year period.\nThe Company generated net income of $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which was lower than the comparable prior year period. The decrease was principally related to the transaction costs incurred for the acquisition in Q1 2018 and an increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by income generated from the acquisitions completed during 2017 and Q1 2018.\nOFFO increased by $4.3 million or 30.2% to $18.5 million over the comparable prior year period. The increase was principally related to the income generated from the acquisitions completed during 2017 and Q1 2018, and a prior year tax adjustment of $1.3 million, partially offset by the dilution of earnings from the February public offering in connection with the Acquisition that was completed in March, and incremental interest expense on the acquisitions completed during 2017 and Q1 2018.\nAFFO increased by $4.2 million or 24.9% to $20.8 million over the comparable prior year period. The increase was principally related to the increase in OFFO noted above and income support received, partially offset by an increase in maintenance capital expenditures due to the timing of such expenditures and the Company’s growth.\nConference Call\nThe toll-free dial-in number for participants is 1-844-543-5234, please enter pass code: 6782748.
