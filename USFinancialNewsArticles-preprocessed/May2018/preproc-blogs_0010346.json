Photo: Stephen Lam/Reuters\nAmid concerns over its handling of user data, Facebook Inc. is extending its push into the corporate technology market, adding business-software integrations to Workplace, its fast-growing enterprise collaboration tool.\nThe move, unveiled Tuesday at the company’s annual developer conference in San Jose, Calif., will enable workers with premium accounts to connect Workplace to other cloud applications they use on the job, including Jira, Sharepoint, ServiceNow, Adobe and SurveyMonkey.\nFacebook charges a monthly fee of $3 per active user for the premium version of the platform, which includes administrative controls, monitoring tools for IT teams and APIs for custom integrations and bots.\nThose using the free version “will have access to a more limited set of integrations,” Facebook said in a post on its website. This includes content integrations with tools like Box, Microsoft Corp.’s OneDrive and Dropbox, according to the post.\nThe Workplace update enables business users to connect to other cloud apps they use on the job. Photo: Facebook Inc.\n“We are taking Workplace from collaboration to IT integration and automation,” Julien Codorniou, Workplace vice president, told CIO Journal. “We want to connect everyone and get everyone working together,” he added, “this is what every chief information officer is telling us.”\nRather than changing the applications businesses already use, the aim of the Workplace integrations is to “help them make their applications work better together,” Mr. Codorniou said.\nMore than 30,000 organizations, with over one million separate user groups, are currently using Workplace, which the company launched in October 2016.\nThat number has more than doubled within the past year, including the likes of Walmart Inc ., Starbucks Corp. and Stanley Black & Decker Inc.\nIn the past year alone, Mr. Codorniou said, Farmers Insurance Group, Weight Watchers International Inc. and Campbell Soup Co. have also deployed the tool.\nHe cited growing momentum in the corporate market behind the need to expand IT capabilities: “It was the right time.”\nGlobally, the market for enterprise social-networking and collaboration tools is forecast to reach $2.4 billion this year, up 11.8% from 2017, and is expected to be worth $3.2 billion by 2021, according to market-research firm International Data Corp.\nWorkplace enables co-workers to communicate, collaborate and share data through a web interface or mobile app with built-in enterprise-grade security and administration features.\nFacebook has been embroiled in controversy since revelations earlier this year that data on some 87 million users was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica , a political data firm that aided the Trump campaign in 2016.\nChief Executive Mark Zuckerberg last month appeared before Congress , vowing to redouble efforts to weed out developers who misuse its platform and better protect user data.\nFor now, none of those concerns appear to have impacted its business. The company last week reported a net income gain during the latest quarter of 63%, to nearly $5 billion, compared with $3.06 billion a year ago, while revenue rose nearly 50% to $11.97 billion.\nMr. Codorniou said the Facebook has built security controls into Workplace integrations.\nSoftware integrations on the enterprise version are extensively reviewed, both internally and through a third-party security audit, he said. Systems administrators also retain full control over any integrations enabled on the tool, and can review data access permissions and manage all integrations, he added.\nThe goal, he added, is to position the tool to become a “closed and highly curated directory” of a company’s core business software that acts as the main hub for worker collaboration, he said.\nShare this: CORPORATE SOCIAL NETWORKS FACEBOOK Previous The Morning Download: Cloud Giants Experience Even Faster Growth Rates",
