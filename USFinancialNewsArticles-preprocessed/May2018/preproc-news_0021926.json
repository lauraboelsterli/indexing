As the newest member of EHA’s executive leadership team, Dr. McCabe will be responsible for the development, implementation and continuation of best practices across EHA’s group practices and ambulatory surgery centers, including The Eye Associates, Clemson Eye and Piedmont Surgery Center.\n“EHA exists to provide best-in-class, full-service eye care to patients—and to do this we invest in technology, process improvement and talent,” said Rod Roeser, CEO of Eye Health America. “We trust that with her background in clinical excellence and innovation, Dr. McCabe will have a positive impact on not only our patients’ lives, but also those of our staff. We are thrilled to have her on board.”\nEHA partners with eye care practices and ASCs across the Southeast U.S. to help them deliver superior eye care. As they grow in number of locations and services offered, practices and ASCs can focus on delivering best-in-practice eye care, while EHA provides financial support, management and administrative resources and business insights. Member practices offer a wide range of eye care from routine eye exams, contact lenses and glasses, to medical ophthalmology and surgery such as cataract, cornea, retina, glaucoma, pediatrics and oculoplastics.\n“Patient need for high-quality eye care is growing rapidly, but the availability of practice locations, services and offerings are not keeping pace to match this demand,” said Dr. McCabe. “EHA is taking an innovative approach to solving this problem by bringing the right people and the right practices together.”\nMcCabe adds that, “I am honored to serve as chief medical officer of EHA and will make it my mission to ensure that all of our practices are continually growing, learning and applying the most innovative and cutting-edge approaches.”\nDr. McCabe has been an ophthalmologist and partner at The Eye Associates of Manatee for eight years and specializes in cataract and refractive surgery.
