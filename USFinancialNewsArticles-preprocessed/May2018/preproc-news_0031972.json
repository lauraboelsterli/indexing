    "text": "May 14, 2018 / 2:57 PM / Updated an hour ago Germany aims to spend 1.5 percent of GDP on defense by 2025: minister Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will tell NATO in July that it expects to boost military spending to around 1.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2025, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen told Germanyâ€™s top military brass on Monday.\nThat would mark a significant increase from the current percentage of 1.2 percent, but would still fall short of a NATO target calling for its members to move toward spending 2 percent of GPD on defense by 2024.
