    "text": "TORONTO, May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CCL Industries Inc. (TSX:CCL.A) (TSX:CCL.B) (“the Company”), a world leader in specialty label, security and packaging solutions for global corporations, government institutions, small businesses and consumers, today announced that it has signed a binding agreement to acquire privately held Nortec International Ltd. (“Nortec”), based near Tel Aviv, Israel for approximately $9 million in cash and assumed debt.\nNortec is a specialty manufacturer of high performance labels and marking systems for the Israeli high technology sector and also exports its products around the world. 2017 sales were $9.6 million with an estimated, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 million. The business will change its trading name to CCL Design Israel on closing, which is expected during the second quarter of 2018.\nCommenting on the proposed transaction President & Chief Executive Officer, Geoffrey T. Martin said, “Israel is an important country for the electronics industry, and our CCL Design team has known Nortec for some time so we are pleased to welcome its founder Doron Lavi and his people to the Company.”\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking information and forward-looking statements (hereinafter collectively referred to as “forward-looking statements”), as defined under applicable securities laws, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are predictive in nature or depend on future events or conditions. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans” or similar expressions. Statements regarding the operations, business, financial condition, priorities, ongoing objectives, strategies and outlook of the Company, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Specifically, this press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the expected closing in the second quarter of 2018.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties relating to future events and conditions including, but not limited to, the after-effects of the global financial crisis and its impact on the world economy and capital markets; the impact of competition; consumer confidence and spending preferences; general economic and geopolitical conditions; currency exchange rates; interest rates and credit availability; technological change; changes in government regulations; risks associated with operating and product hazards; and the Company’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as the Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are also based on a number of assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, including, but not limited to, assumptions about the following: global economic environment and higher consumer spending; improved customer demand for the Company’s products; continued historical growth trends, market growth in specific sectors and entering into new sectors; the Company’s ability to provide a wide range of products to multinational customers on a global basis; the benefits of the Company’s focused strategies and operational approach; the achievement of the Company’s plans for improved efficiency and lower costs, including stable aluminum costs; the availability of cash and credit; fluctuations of currency exchange rates; the Company’s continued relations with its customers; the Company’s estimated annual cost reductions and financial impact from the restructuring of the Checkpoint Systems, Inc. acquisition; and economic conditions. Should one or more risks materialize or should any assumptions prove incorrect, then actual results could vary materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Further details on key risks can be found in the 2017 Annual Report, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, particularly under Section 4: “Risks and Uncertainties.” CCL’s annual and quarterly reports can be found online at www.cclind.com and www.sedar.com or are available upon request.\nExcept as otherwise indicated, forward-looking statements do not take into account the effect that transactions or non-recurring or other special items announced or occurring after the statements are made may have on CCL’s business. Such statements do not, unless otherwise specified by the Company, reflect the impact of dispositions, sales of assets, monetizations, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or transactions, asset write-downs or other charges announced or occurring after forward-looking statements are made. The financial impact of these transactions and non-recurring and other special items can be complex and depends on the facts particular to each of them and therefore cannot be described in a meaningful way in advance of knowing specific facts. The forward-looking statements are provided as of the date of this press release and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nThe financial information presented herein has been prepared on the basis of IFRS for financial statements and is expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\nBusiness Description\nCCL Industries Inc. employs approximately 20,000 people operating 168 production facilities in 40 countries with corporate offices in Toronto, Canada, and Framingham, Massachusetts.
