Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Corporations are working to extract value from the use of artificial intelligence, which is baked into more and more software. After 10-straight quarters of losses, one of the longest downturns in its history, Hennes & Mauritz AB ’s H&M is turning to AI for help. The WSJ’s Saabira Chaudhuri reports that the company is taking a more granular, store-by-store approach to analytics, using algorithms to assess receipts, returns and loyalty-card data and better align supply and demand.\nTrendspotting. Hoping to more accurately detect trends three-to-eight months in advance, H&M is analyzing data on a large scale from blog posts, search engines and other sources rather than relying mainly on staff. Fashion experts use this quantitative analysis in an effort to make better informed decisions. It’s a largely untested approach in retail, and some analysts are skeptical it will work, according to the Journal.\nGut + machine. “It’s about empowering that gut feeling,” says Arti Zeighami, H&M’s head of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence. “We can now be sharper, more accurate and hyper-relevant, not have one solution that fits all.”\nMICROSOFT BUILD 2018\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is leading the company past the Windows era. Photo: GIAN EHRENZELLER/EPA/SHUTTERSTOCK\nMicrosoft touts AI, edge computing. Microsoft Corp. used day one of its Build developer conference Monday to highlight how its AI tools could be infused into more everyday business activities, including transcribing business meetings and recognizing people who come into a conference room, CNBC reports. The company also demonstrated its Azure IoT Edge cloud service, designed to deliver insights from data collected by sensors and computers at the edge of networks, ZDNet reports .\nMicrosoft as moral leader. Avoiding a replay of the 1990s, where the company was constantly in the government spotlight over its Windows dominance, Microsoft is taking up the mantle as the industry’s “moral conscience,” says the New York Times . The company’s president, Brad Smith, has emerged as an ambassador “on the big social issues facing technology in Washington,” while CEO Satya Nadella has become an advocate for protecting user privacy and applying ethical guidelines towards designing AI systems design. See more below.\nNadella plots Microsoft’s future. On the eve of Microsoft’s annual developer conference CEO Satya Nadella talked with the Verge . Some highlights:\nMicrosoft’s post-Windows strategy. “Windows and multi-deviced experiences are not at odds.”\nAI. “We are moving from celebrating AI breakthroughs to really now how can we celebrate AI being deployed everywhere.”\nPrivacy. “You have to recognize that privacy is a human right and you need to treat it as such.”\nBLOCKCHAIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCY\nA scene from the HBO show “Silicon Valley.” Photo: HBO/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nCrypto goes to Hollywood. This Sunday HBO series Silicon Valley tackled bitcoin. And coming in June is “No Postage Necessary,” a –cough!– bitcoin-themed romantic comedy. The project’s director tells the Hollywood Reporter that the film will accept payments in cryptocurrency.\nEt tu, NYSE? The New York Times reports that Intercontinental Exchange , the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, is working on an online trading platform that would let large investors buy bitcoin.\nBuffett bashes bitcoin. The billionaire investor is not impressed with bitcoin, saying the cryptocurrency seduces the ill-informed, Reuters reports . But Charlie Munger, a Berkshire vice chairman, wins the prize for voicing his distaste for bitcoin, resurrecting Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting, calling it “the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.”\nMORE TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nA Model S assembly line at Tesla’s Fremont plant in 2012 Photo: NOAH BERGER/REUTERS\nTesla’s production process: Flawed but nimble. Where the auto giants typically iron out manufacturing issues in a preproduction phase, making changes before a model reaches dealer showrooms, Tesla Inc. is determined to make dramatic changes on the fly in order to address product quality, production snags and consumer claims in real time. The WSJ’s John D. Stoll visits Tesla’s secretive factory in Northern California.\nReport: Software at fault in fatal Uber crash. The ride-hailing company is blaming its own software for a March accident in Arizona where one of its prototype self-driving vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian. According to the Information , the car’s sensors detected the pedestrian, but the software judged that a reaction was not required.\nEgypt’s bill prompts data privacy concerns. Egypt’s parliament passed legislation Monday requiring ride-hailing apps such as Uber to hand over passenger data when requested by the country’s security agencies, the Journal’s Jared Maslin reports .\nDrupalgeddon 2 leads to illegal crypto-mining. Hackers exploited a bug in web content management system Drupal to convert hundreds of websites into cryptocurrency mining operations, Ars Technica reports . Websites affected included those belonging to Lenovo Group Ltd. , the University of California at Los Angeles and the US National Labor Relations Board.\nChess master learned from his defeat by a machine (and so can you). Gary Kasparov writes in the Wall Street Journal : “My chess loss in 1997 to IBM supercomputer Deep Blue was a victory for its human creators and mankind, not triumph of machine over man. In the same way, machine-generated insight adds to ours, extending our intelligence the way a telescope extends our vision.”\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nWashington’s European allies were bracing for the U.S. to withdraw from the Iran nuclear accord. (WSJ)\nCable giant Comcast is getting the pieces in place to make a possible hostile bid for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets . (WSJ)\nThe U.S.-China trade fracas has obscured the fact that global trade growth is coming off the boil . (WSJ)\nShares of energy companies are rallying as crude prices top $70 a barrel.
