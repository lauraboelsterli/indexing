Photocall for the animation film \"Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation\" (Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation) out of competition - Voice cast members Anke Engelke, Janina Uhse, and Lesia Nikitiuk pose on a pier. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\nDancing to Michael Jackson’s “Thriller”, the undead were not there to eat human brains, but to take advantage of the world’s press gathered a day ahead of the start of the Cannes Film Festival to publicise a movie, “Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation”.\nThe animated comedy follows the adventures of a part-monster, part-human family, on a cruise holiday.\nDirector Genndy Tartakovsky said he had decided the second instalment of the Sony Pictures franchise would be the last, but was inspired to make a third after his in-laws invited his family on a cruise holiday. Slideshow (2 Images)\n“Who doesn’t want to be on a ship with their in-laws for a week?” he joked with reporters.\n“But as I got on the boat I realised: ‘Hey, it’s all about family, and what a great venue for our monster family.’”\n Reporting by Natasha Howitt; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",
