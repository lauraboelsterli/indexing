    "text": "By Sarah Gray May 4, 2018\nAvengers: Infinity War is expected to cross the $1 billion threshold in global box office sales in record time, according to Variety .\nThe Disney and Marvel’s superhero super-movie, which combines multiple Marvel franchises in a battle against villain Thanos, reached the $900 million marker in nine days. It is expected to cross the $1 billion mark on Friday or Saturday—its tenth or eleventh day after release on April 25.\nIt would become the 33rd movie to cross the $1 billion threshold, Variety reports.\nThe speed record is currently held by Star Wars: The Force Awakens, another Disney franchise, which surpassed the worldwide $1 billion mark in 12 days, according to The Hollywood Reporter .\nAvengers: Infinity War has already hit other box office milestones, including the largest opening weekend . It made more than $250 million in North America—breaking the Star Wars: Force Awakens record of $248 million—and $380 million overseas (excluding China, where it has not yet opened ), making it a combined $630 million opening weekend.\nIn its first week Avengers: Infinity War made $338.4 million domestically and $566.7 internationally.
