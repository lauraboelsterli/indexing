    "text": "FLORENCE (Reuters) - The euro zone needs a new, common “fiscal instrument” if it is to ensure its member countries are not pulled apart by an economic shock, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Friday.\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi holds a news conference following the governing council's interest rate decision at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach “We need an additional fiscal instrument to maintain convergence during large shocks, without having to over-burden monetary policy,” Draghi said.\n“Its aim would be to provide an extra layer of stabilization, thereby reinforcing confidence in national policies.”\nReporting By Silvia Ognibene; Writing by Francesco Canepa in Frankfurt; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
