Successful conversion of engineering program backlog into sales is largely dependent on the execution and completion of our engineering design efforts. We have experienced some technical delays and issues with our major development programs which are being resolved as they arise. The facility refit, which will enable us to build and test our newest transformers, is well underway with completion scheduled for FY19 Q1. With successful completion of our current engineering programs and completion of the factory refit, we will be well positioned for the future.\nEspey's primary business is the development, design, and production of specialized military and industrial power supplies/transformers. The Company can be found on the Internet at www.espey.com .\nFor further information, contact Mr. David Oâ€™Neil (518)245-4400.\nThis press release may contain certain statements that are \"forward-looking statements\" and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
