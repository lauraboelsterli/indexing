    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc was returning workers to the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Chevron Corp restored some production on Monday after the passage of Subtropical Storm Alberto, the companies said.\nFILE PHOTO: Logo of Shell is seen at the 20th Middle East Oil & Gas Show and Conference (MOES 2017) in Manama, Bahrain, March 7, 2017. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo Shell plans to restore production at its Ram Powell Hub in the Viosca Knoll area of the Gulf as it soon as it confirms the platform can be operated safely, the company said in a statement.\nOn Friday, Shell shut in production at its offshore Ram Powell hub ahead of the stormâ€™s move into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The facility is capable of processing about 60,000 barrels of oil and 200 million cubic feet of gas per day.\nSeparately, Chevron restored production on the Blind Faith and Petronius production platforms in the Gulf after the passage of Storm Alberto, a company spokeswoman said on Monday.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Marco Bello The two platforms were shut in as Alberto, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018, was charging across the eastern Gulf. The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1.\nThe Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of daily U.S. crude output and 5 percent of natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nMore than 45 percent of U.S. refining capacity and 51 percent of natural gas processing capacity are located along the Gulf.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Peter Cooney\n ",
