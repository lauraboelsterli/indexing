    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Kindred Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: KIN), a biopharmaceutical company focused on saving and improving the lives of pets, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine approved Mirataz (mirtazapine transdermal ointment) for the management of weight loss in cats.\n\"We are pleased to announce the FDA approval of Mirataz for cats experiencing unintended weight loss, a serious medical and potentially fatal condition,\" said Richard Chin, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of KindredBio. \"Based on our market research, we estimate that veterinarians in the U.S. see as many as 9 million cats each year with unintended weight loss due to various underlying conditions. We developed this first-in-class product in less than five years, which is a testament to the quality of our team and validates our strategy of quickly and cost-efficiently developing animal health therapeutics.\"\nMirataz is the first and only transdermal medication specifically developed, and FDA approved, for cats. Weight loss is the leading cause of visits to the veterinarian for cats. Mirataz, which is formulated with KindredBio's proprietary Accusorb™ technology, is applied topically to the cat's inner ear (pinna) once a day, providing a more attractive application route compared to oral administration. Mirataz is a serotonin (5HT2A, 5HT2C, and 5HT3) and histamine (H1) receptor antagonist, which has demonstrated body weight gain in cats experiencing weight loss. The product is classified as a weight gain drug and can be used in cats with various underlying diseases associated with unintended weight loss.\nKindredBio will provide additional updates regarding commercialization and pipeline during its first quarter 2018 financial call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 4:30 PM Eastern Time / 1:30 PM Pacific Time. Interested parties may access the call by dialing toll-free (855) 433-0927 from the US, or (484) 756-4262 internationally, and using conference ID 8967967. The call will also be webcast live at https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/nhw6xeop .\nAbout Kindred Biosciences\nKindred Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company focused on saving and improving the lives of pets.
