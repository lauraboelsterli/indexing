Former officials with Cambridge Analytica was not immediately available to comment.\nCambridge Analytica was created around 2013, initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million (£11.1 million) in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times has reported. Bannon left the White House on August 2017. Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Peter Cooney",
