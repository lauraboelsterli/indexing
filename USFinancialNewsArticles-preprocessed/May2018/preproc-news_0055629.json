REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\nSaft formed the alliance with European partners Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ), Solvay ( SOLB.BR ) and Manz ( M5ZG.DE ) in February to research, develop and build a new generation solid-state battery to compete with Asian and U.S. manufacturers.\nThe level of funding from its partners is still to be decided, Saft told Reuters in response to questions.
