Lynch 1 Min Read\nWASHINGTON, May 24 (Reuters) - Drug maker Pfizer will pay $23.85 million to settle civil charges that it illegally paid kickbacks by using a foundation as a “conduit” to cover co-pay costs for Medicare patients taking three of the company’s drugs, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday.\nAs part of the settlement, the company will also enter a corporate integrity agreement with the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services, which will require the company to implement new compliance measures.
