    "text": "UBS shared with its clients the firm's best current stock picks.\nIn addition to screening for factors like the potential for gains over the price targets, sector weightings and liquidity, the list focuses on \"stocks where we believe our analysts have a truly differentiated view versus consensus,\" the firm's research group said in a report Tuesday.\nHere are five buy-rated companies that made the UBS recommended list and their price targets.\n1) First Solar (FSLR)\nUBS analyst Jon Windham has a $94 price target for First Solar shares, representing 34 percent upside to Tuesday's close.\n\"FSLR is our preferred name for exposure to solar module manufacturing. We see the Series 6 module achieving a lower production cost relative to Chinese commodity modules, driving more sustainable earnings growth. FSLR has pursued a conservative strategy of steady growth funded with cash from operations and no debt. FSLR is best positioned to ride out policy driven demand cycles in the U.S.\"",
