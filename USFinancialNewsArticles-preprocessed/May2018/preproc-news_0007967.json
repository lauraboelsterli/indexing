    "text": "IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Endologix, Inc. (NASDAQ: ELGX), a developer and marketer of innovative treatments for aortic disorders, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Our top-line performance during the first quarter reflects slightly better-than-expected growth in our OUS business driven by solid AFX growth in both the European and CAPLA markets. In the U.S. market, a decline in our AFX business was partially offset by continued growth in our Ovation business,” commented Vaseem Mahboob, Endologix’s Chief Financial Officer. “On the product development and clinical side, we successfully completed enrollment of the first patient in our EVAS2 IDE clinical study of the Nellix ® EndoVascular Aneurysm Sealing (EVAS) System. Additionally, we announced positive results from our global ENCORE analysis with polymer endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using our Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft Systems. These accomplishments reinforce Endologix’s value proposition and our commitment to delivering the best products to physicians and patients around the globe.”\nFinancial Results\nGlobal revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $42.3 million, a 0.8% decrease from $42.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.

International revenue was $12.9 million, a 10.1% increase from International revenue of $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a constant currency basis, first quarter 2018 International revenue increased 3.3% over the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit was $28.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, which represents a gross margin of 67.0%. This compares to a gross profit of $28.6 million, or a gross margin of 67.2%, in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal operating expenses decreased 6.6% to $41.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $44.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to effective cost management.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $19.8 million, or $(0.24) per share, compared to a net loss of $21.3 million, or $(0.26) per share, a year ago. Adjusted Net Loss (non-GAAP, defined below) totaled $12.9 million, compared to an Adjusted Net Loss of $15.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.

The Company's focus is endovascular stent grafts for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). AAA is a weakening of the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in the body, resulting in a balloon-like enlargement. Once an AAA develops, it continues to enlarge and, if left untreated, becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture. The overall patient mortality rate for ruptured AAA is approximately 80%, making it a leading cause of death in the U.S. For more information, visit www.endologix.com .\nThe Nellix ® EndoVascular Aneurysm Sealing System has obtained CE Mark in the EU and is only approved as an investigational device in the United States. The Ovation Alto ® System is only approved as an investigational device and is not currently approved in any market.\nCautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nExcept for historical information contained herein, this press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Endologix's management uses these financial measures for strategic decision making, forecasting future financial results, and evaluating current period financial and operating performance. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\"GAAP\" is generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Definition:\n(1) \"Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\" is a non-GAAP measure defined by Endologix as net income (loss) under GAAP, excluding: (i) the fair value adjustment to the Nellix ® acquisition contingent consideration; (ii) interest expense; (iii) foreign currency (gains) or losses; (iv) legal settlement costs; (v) contract termination and business acquisition expenses; (vi) business development expenses, including licensing costs related to research and development activities; (vii) restructuring and other transition costs; (viii) fair value adjustment of derivative liabilities; (ix) inventory step-up amortization; and (x) loss on extinguishment of debt.\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2018, this GAAP adjustment to net loss specifically represents: (i) the fair value adjustment to Nellix contingent consideration liability; (ii) interest expense; (iii) foreign currency (gains) or losses; (iv) restructuring and other transition costs; and (v) loss on extinguishment of debt.\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2017, this GAAP adjustment to net loss specifically represents: (i) the fair value adjustment to Nellix contingent consideration liability; (ii) interest expense; (iii) foreign currency (gains) or losses; and (iv) restructuring and other transition costs.\nIn future periods, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) will continue to exclude: (i) the fair value adjustments to the Nellix contingent consideration liability; (ii) interest expense; (iii) foreign currency (gains) or losses; (iv) legal settlement costs; (v) contract termination and business acquisition expenses; (vi) business development expenses; (vii) restructuring and other transition costs; (viii) fair value adjustment of derivative liabilities; (ix) inventory step-up amortization; (x) loss on extinguishment of debt; and (xi) other non-recurring expenses or income, as described by Endologix.\nAdjusted EBITDA Definition:\n(2) “Adjusted EBITDA” is a non-GAAP measure defined by Endologix as “Adjusted Net Income (Loss)” excluding income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and stock-based compensation expense.\nENDOLOGIX, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nUnaudited\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenue U.S. $ 29,375 $ 30,889 International 12,909 11,723 Total Revenue 42,284 42,612 Cost of goods sold 13,958 13,970 Gross profit $ 28,326 $ 28,642 Operating expenses: Research and development 5,499 5,530 Clinical and regulatory affairs 3,571 3,835 Marketing and sales 21,725 25,900 General and administrative 10,369 8,873 Restructuring costs 233 166 Total operating expenses 41,397 44,304 Loss from operations (13,071 ) (15,662 ) Other income (expense) (5,441 ) (4,298 ) Change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisition 1,100 (1,200 ) Loss on debt extinguishment (2,270 ) — Total other income (expense) (6,611 ) (5,498 ) Net loss before income tax expense $ (19,682 ) $ (21,160 ) Income tax expense (85 ) (154 ) Net loss $ (19,767 ) $ (21,314 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) foreign currency translation (127 ) 356 Comprehensive loss $ (19,894 ) $ (20,958 ) Basic and diluted net loss per share $ (0.24 ) $ (0.26 ) Shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share 83,706 82,928 Non-GAAP Reconciliations: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Loss to Adjusted Net Loss: Net loss $ (19,767 ) $ (21,314 ) Fair value adjustment to Nellix contingent consideration liability (1,100 ) 1,200 Interest expense 5,807 4,295 Foreign currency (gain) loss (325 ) 4 Restructuring and other transition costs 233 547 Loss on extinguishment of debt 2,270 — (1) Adjusted Net Loss $ (12,882 ) $ (15,268 ) Adjusted Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted Net Loss $ (12,882 ) $ (15,268 ) Income tax expense 85 154 Depreciation and amortization 1,992 2,313 Stock-based compensation expense 3,021 2,954 (2) Adjusted EBITDA $ (7,784 ) $ (9,847 ) ENDOLOGIX, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nUnaudited\n(In thousands)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 48,020 $ 57,991 Restricted cash 2,067 2,608 Accounts receivable, net allowance for doubtful accounts of $634 and $470, respectively. 29,241 32,294 Other receivables 437 418 Inventories 45,809 45,153 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 3,120 4,670 Total current assets 128,694 143,134 Property and equipment, net 18,598 19,212 Goodwill 120,977 120,927 Intangibles, net 79,380 80,403 Deposits and other assets 1,694 1,371 Total assets $ 349,343 $ 365,047 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 13,005 $ 12,351 Accrued payroll 14,519 15,054 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 15,571 16,002 Current portion of debt 17,474 17,202 Revolving line of credit — 21 Total current liabilities 60,569 60,630 Deferred income taxes 201 201 Deferred rent 7,742 7,724 Other liabilities 3,150 3,877 Contingently issuable common stock 8,200 9,300 Debt 210,587 208,253 Total liabilities 290,449 289,985 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value;
