    "text": "ST PETERSBURG, May 25 (Reuters) - Russia’s second-biggest grocery chain Magnit plans to adjust its dividend policy, possibly making payouts contingent on development plans and aiming for a payout ratio of at least 40 percent, Magnit head Khachatur Pombukhchan told Reuters.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of an economic forum in St Petersburg, the CEO of the Krasnodar-based retailer also said he expected the company’s new investor, the Marathon Group, to get one seat on Magnit’s board.\nMarathon Group, founded by Russian businessmen Alexander Vinokurov and Sergey Zakharov, bought an 11.82 percent stake in Magnit on Thursday from state bank VTB.
