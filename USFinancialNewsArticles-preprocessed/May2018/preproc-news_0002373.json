Q1 2018 End of Period Meeting Subscribers were up 13.4% and End of Period Online Subscribers were up 39.0% versus the prior year period. Total Paid Weeks in Q1 2018 were up 27.4% versus the prior year period, driven by growth in all major geographic markets. Q1 2018 Meeting Paid Weeks increased 13.3% and Online Paid Weeks increased 38.1% versus the prior year period. Revenues in Q1 2018 were $408.2 million. On a constant currency basis, Q1 2018 revenues increased 19.5% versus the prior year period. Service Revenues in Q1 2018 were $328.7 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues increased 21.3% versus the prior year period. This increase was driven by growth in all major geographic markets. Product Sales and Other in Q1 2018 were $79.6 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues increased 12.6% versus the prior year period. Operating Income in Q1 2018 was $62.1 million. On a constant currency basis, operating income increased 95.6% versus the prior year period. This increase in operating income was primarily driven by operating leverage on higher revenues in the quarter versus the prior year period. Income Tax in Q1 2018 was a benefit of $12.6 million, which reflected a one-time $17.3 million net tax benefit due to Oprah Winfrey's exercise of a portion of her stock options during the quarter. In the prior year period, income tax was a benefit of $9.1 million, which reflected a one-time $11.9 million tax benefit related to the previously announced cessation of operations of the Company's Spanish subsidiary. Net Income in Q1 2018 was $39.1 million compared to $10.7 million in the prior year period. Earnings per fully diluted share (EPS) in Q1 2018 was $0.56 compared to $0.16 in the prior year period. Certain items affect year-over-year comparability. Q1 2018 results included a $0.25 per fully diluted share tax benefit from Ms. Winfrey's exercise of a portion of her stock options during the quarter. Q1 2017 results included a tax benefit of $0.18 per fully diluted share that was offset by $0.01 per fully diluted share of expense, both related to the previously announced cessation of operations of the Company's Spanish subsidiary.\nOther Items\nCash balance as of March 31, 2018 was $117.6 million. On that same date, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its $150 million revolving credit facility.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 Earnings Guidance\nThe Company is raising its full year fiscal 2018 earnings guidance to between $3.00 and $3.20 per fully diluted share. Prior earnings guidance was between $2.40 and $2.70 per fully diluted share. This guidance increase reflects the operating strength of the Company's business and expected continued global momentum through the year.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call and Webcast\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET. During the conference call, Mindy Grossman, Officer, and Nicholas Hotchkin, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the first quarter of fiscal 2018 results and answer questions from the investment community. Live audio of the conference call will be simultaneously webcast over the Internet on the Company's corporate website, www.weightwatchersinternational.com . A replay of the webcast will be available on this site for approximately 90 days.\nStatement regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following provides information regarding non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release:\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the Company has disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. The Company presents in the attachments to this release the non-GAAP financial measure earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (\"EBITDAS\"). In addition, the Company presents certain of its financial results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. In this release and any attachments, the Company calculates constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's business. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this release and reconciliations, if any, included elsewhere in this release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nAbout Weight Watchers International, Inc.\nWeight Watchers is a global wellness company and the world's leading commercial weight management program.
