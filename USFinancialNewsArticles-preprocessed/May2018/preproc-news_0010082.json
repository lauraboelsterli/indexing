With the acquisition of the Halyard S&IP business, a recognized leader in its segment, Owens & Minor takes a significant step in transforming its business into a global healthcare solutions provider. This transaction expands Owens & Minor’s reach into new markets around the world, develops its presence in the medical products segment, and opens new channels for growth. The acquisition will also add greater scale to Owens & Minor’s existing own-brand product portfolio and help to expand the company’s addressable markets.\n“With the completion of this transaction—the largest in Owens & Minor’s history—we have achieved a key step in our strategy, which positions us for more profitable growth as we continue to transform the company,” said P. Cody Phipps, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer of Owens & Minor. “The S&IP business provides a global manufacturing network, a strong pipeline of new products, and a successful track record of product development. Additionally, the S&IP business will add scale to our existing own-brand product portfolio and our global sales team, contributing to expansion of the markets we serve. We are very pleased to welcome the Halyard Health S&IP teammates and their exceptional products and capabilities to the Owens & Minor family.”\nThe S&IP business is a leading global provider of medical supplies and solutions for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections across acute care and non-acute care markets around the globe. S&IP’s surgical and infection prevention offerings range from sterilization wraps, surgical drapes and gowns, facial protection and protective apparel to medical exam gloves. Highly regarded in the industry, recognized S&IP brands include surgical drape products such as AEROBLUE and AEROCHROME; exam gloves including PURPLE, LAVENDER and STERLING; and sterilization wraps such as ONE-STEP, QUICK CHECK and SMART-FOLD.\n“The S&IP transaction enhances our ability to execute our strategy and pursue growth opportunities in 90 countries around the world, and will further position us to achieve sustainable, profitable growth with its leading portfolio of surgical and infection prevention products and global manufacturing capabilities,” said Richard Meier, EVP, Chief Financial Officer and President-International. “Strategically and financially attractive, the transaction gives us a highly regarded portfolio of products, while further enabling our ability to provide value for our customers. We believe this will enhance our ability to respond quickly to a changing healthcare industry by focusing on unique product solutions and value-enhancing bundles as we expand into more clinically relevant points of care.”\nOwens & Minor’s transformation strategy is anchored by several key initiatives, including building the most intelligent route to market, expanding along the continuum of care, becoming a leading outsourcer for manufacturers, and offering data and analytics services.\nWith the S&IP transaction, Owens & Minor expects to acquire approximately $1 billion in revenues. Owens & Minor expects that annual pre-tax synergies will reach approximately $13.5 million in the next 12 months and approximately $40 million over the next three years. As previously discussed, Owens & Minor is financing the transaction with a combination of cash and debt. Owens & Minor expects the transaction to be accretive to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in 2018, and increasingly accretive thereafter.\nBofA Merrill Lynch and Lazard acted as lead financial advisors to Owens & Minor. Citigroup also provided advice to Owens & Minor. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, LLP acted as lead legal counsel to Owens & Minor; while Eversheds Sutherland provided legal counsel on international legal matters, and Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, P.C. provided legal counsel on regulatory matters.\nSafe Harbor\nThis release is intended to be disclosure through methods reasonably designed to provide broad, non-exclusionary distribution to the public in compliance with the SEC's Fair Disclosure Regulation.
