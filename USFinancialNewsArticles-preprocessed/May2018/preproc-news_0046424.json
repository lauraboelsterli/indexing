REUTERS/Stringer “Change of management, change of board, change of everything ... it’s up to Mr. Ross, who will make a recommendation to the president,” said Kudlow, who is President Donald Trump’s Director of the National Economic Council.\nKudlow said trade talks with China “are going very well” but added that if they don’t succeed, Trump “is prepared to take tough action on his own.”\n(This version of the story in first sentence, corrects attribution to Fox Business Network, not Fox Business News)\nReporting by Eric Beech; writing by Eric Walsh; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ",
