    "text": "Declares a $0.34 Per Share Distribution\nClosed Investments of $98.2 million in First Quarter of 2018\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OFS Capital Corporation (Nasdaq: OFS) (“OFS Capital”, the \"Company\", “we”, “us”, or “our”) today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nNet investment income of $3.8 million, or $0.29 per share, which includes $0.5 million, or $0.04 per share of expenses related to a debt transaction the Company elected not to pursue. Declared distributions of $1.05 per share in the first half of 2018, including a $0.37 per share special dividend. Closed investments of $98.2 million in first quarter of 2018. 78% and 76% of the fair value of our loan portfolio was senior and floating rate, respectively, and the weighted average yield of our performing loan portfolio was 12.57% as of March 31, 2018 (1) . 100% of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average cost of approximately 4.30% as of May 4, 2018; all maturities in 2022 through 2025. On May 1, 2018, OFS Capital's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.34 per share for the second quarter of 2018, payable on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record as of June 22, 2018.\n\"The first quarter of 2018 was a productive quarter and we believe positions us for significant income growth beginning in the second quarter,\" said Bilal Rashid, OFS Capital's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We deployed $98 million in the first quarter, which we funded with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. In April 2018, we issued $50 million of bonds locking in fixed rate, unsecured financing for seven years. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay our revolving credit facility. We believe that our commitment to capital preservation, and strong long-term performance is enhanced by the alignment of interests of our stockholders and our external manager, which owns approximately 22% of the outstanding OFS Capital common stock.\"\n(1) See Highlights contained in this press release for further information on our weighted average yield. Including assets on non-accrual, the weighted average yield of our debt investment portfolio was 12.12% at March 31, 2018. HIGHLIGHTS\n($ in millions, except for per share data)\nPortfolio Overview At March 31, 2018 Total assets $ 374.7 Investment portfolio, at fair value $ 335.5 Net assets $ 182.5 Net asset value per share $ 13.67 Weighted average yield on performing debt investments (1) 12.57 % Weighted average yield on total debt investments (2) 12.12 % Weighted average yield on total investments (3) 10.91 % (1) The weighted average yield on our performing debt investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest on our debt investments at the balance sheet date, plus the annualized accretion of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees divided by (b) amortized cost of our debt investments, excluding assets on non-accrual basis as of the balance sheet date. (2) The weighted average yield on our total debt investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest on our debt investments at the balance sheet date, plus the annualized accretion of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees divided by (b) amortized cost of our debt investments, including assets on non-accrual basis as of the balance sheet date. (3) The weighted average yield on total investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest on our debt investments at the balance sheet date, plus the annualized accretion of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees, plus the effective cash yield on our performing preferred equity investments divided by (b) amortized cost of our total investment portfolio, including assets on non-accrual basis as of the balance sheet date. The weighted average yield of investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses. Quarter ended March 31, Operating Results 2018 2017 Total investment income $ 9.0 $ 8.0 Net investment income $ 3.8 $ 3.3 Net investment income per common share, basic and diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.34 Adjusted net investment income (a Non-GAAP measure\ndescribed below)\n$ 3.8 $ 3.6 Adjusted net investment income (a Non-GAAP measure\ndescribed below) per share, basic and diluted\n$ 0.29 $ 0.37 Net increase in net assets resulting from osperations $ 3.5 $ 4.9 Quarter ended March 31, Portfolio Activity 2018 2017 Number of new portfolio companies 7 — Investments in new portfolio companies $ 73.0 $ — Investments in existing portfolio companies $ 25.2 $ 6.1 Number of portfolio companies at end of period 39 38 PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, OFS Capital closed $47.4 million of senior secured debt investments, including a delayed draw funding of $0.5 million, in five new portfolio companies, as well as $1.9 million and $2.5 million of common and preferred equity investments, respectively, in three of these new portfolio companies. In addition, we made $20.9 million of subordinated debt investments in two new portfolio companies, as well as a $0.3 million common equity investment in one of these new portfolio companies, and $24.9 million of new senior secured debt investments in existing portfolio companies, including a new revolver funding of $1.4 million, and a common equity investment of $0.3 million made in connection with a senior secured debt investment.\nThe total fair value of OFS Capital’s investment portfolio was $335.5 million at March 31, 2018, which was equal to approximately 96% of amortized cost. As of March 31, 2018, the fair value of OFS Capital's debt investment portfolio totaled $299.0 million in 35 portfolio companies, of which 78% and 22% were senior secured loans and subordinated loans, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, we also held approximately $36.5 million in equity investments, at fair value, in 19 portfolio companies in which we also held debt investments and four portfolio companies in which we solely held an equity investment. We had unfunded commitments of $10.0 million to four portfolio companies at March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, floating rate loans comprised 76% of OFS Capital’s debt investment portfolio, with the remaining 24% in fixed rate loans, as a percentage of fair value.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIncome\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased by $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to a $1.5 million increase in recurring interest income caused by a 22% increase in the average outstanding loan balance, offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in recurring interest income resulting from a 35 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield in our portfolio. Acceleration of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees of $0 and $0.1 million were included in interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFee Income\nFee income decreased by $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in prepayment fees. We recorded prepayment fees of $0.2 million resulting from $16.9 million of unscheduled principal payments during the three months ended March 31, 2017. We did not record prepayment fees during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nExpenses\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased over the corresponding period in the prior year due primarily to an increase in borrowings under our revolving line of credit with Pacific Western Bank (the \"PWB Credit Facility\"). The average dollar amount of borrowings outstanding under the PWB Credit Facility during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $22.4 million and $5.7 million, respectively. There were no borrowings under the PWB Credit Facility during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nManagement fee\nManagement fee expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $0.2 million over the corresponding period in the prior year due to an increase in our average total assets, primarily due to a increase in net investment activity.\nIncentive fee\nIncentive fee expense decreased by $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to a decrease in the accrued Capital Gain Fee. We accrue the Capital Gain Fee if, on a cumulative basis, the sum of net realized capital gains and (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation and (depreciation) is positive, and was $0 and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On May 1, 2018, our investment adviser agreed to irrevocably waive the receipt of Part One incentive fees (based on net investment income) of $22,000 related to net investment income, that it would otherwise be entitled to receive under the Investment Advisory Agreement for the three months ended March 31, 2018. As a result of the voluntary fee waiver, the Company incurred Part One incentive fee expense of $714 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which is equal to the Part One incentive fee expense the Company incurred for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nAdministration fee\nAdministration fee expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased $0.2 million over the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in our allocable portion of OFS Services’s overhead in connection with a foreign debt transaction that we elected not to pursue due to regulatory changes and market conditions.\nOther expenses\nOther expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased over the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to legal and other offering costs incurred during the first quarter of 2018 in connection with a foreign debt transaction that we elected not to pursue due to regulatory changes and market conditions.\nNet Gain (Loss) on Investments\nWe recognized net gains of $0.3 million on senior secured debt during the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily as a result of realized gains of $0.4 million from the sale of five senior secured loans, offset by unrealized losses of $0.2 million, primarily as a result of the net negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors and the impact of changes to certain market loan indices.\nWe recognized net losses of $1.4 million on subordinated debt during the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors, including an unrealized depreciation of $1.2 million recognized on our subordinated debt investment in Southern Technical Institute, LLC, which was placed on non-accrual during 2017 and written down to a fair value of $0 at March 31, 2018.\nWe recognized net losses of $1.1 million on preferred equity investments for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the net negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors.\nWe recognized net gains of $1.9 million on common equity and warrant investments for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the positive impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt March 31, 2018, we had $31.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, which includes cash and cash equivalents of $31.2 million held by our wholly owned small business investment company, and $149.9 million in outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures. Our use of cash held by SBIC I LP is restricted by SBA regulation, including limitations on the amount of cash SBIC I LP can distribute to OFS Capital Corporation as parent company. As of March 31, 2018, we had $9.0 million available for additional borrowings under our PWB Credit Facility and had drawn all of our available SBA-guaranteed debentures.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nRegistered unsecured bond offering\nIn April 2018, we closed the public offering of approximately $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.375% notes due 2025 (the \"Notes\"). The total net proceeds to us from the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts of approximately $1.6 million and estimated offering expenses of $0.4 million, were approximately $48.0 million. The Notes will mature on April 30, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 6.375%. The Notes are unsecured obligations of OFS Capital and rank pari-passu with our existing and future unsecured, subordinated indebtedness; effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any subsidiaries, with respect to claims on the assets of any such subsidiaries, including the SBA-guaranteed debentures. The Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after April 30, 2020 at the redemption price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on the Notes is payable quarterly on January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year. The Notes are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “OFSSL.” We may from time to time repurchase Notes in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act) and the rules promulgated thereunder. As of May 1, 2018, the outstanding principal balance of the Notes was approximately $50.0 million.\nModified asset coverage\nOn March 23, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which includes the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCAA”), was signed into law. The SBCAA amends the 1940 Act to permit a business development company (a “BDC”) to reduce the required minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to it from 200% to 150%, subject to certain requirements described therein.\nOn May 3, 2018, the board of directors (the “Board”) of OFS Capital, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As a result, the asset coverage ratio test applicable to OFS Capital will be decreased from 200% to 150%, effective May 3, 2019.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nOFS Capital will host a conference call to discuss these results on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.

Adjusted NII represents net investment income excluding the net capital gains incentive fee (fee adjustments) in periods in which they occur. Our management agreement with our investment adviser provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses for such year. Management believes that Adjusted NII is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any net capital gains incentive fee, as net investment income does not include gains associated with the capital gains incentive fee. In addition, management believes that providing Adjusted NII may facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into OFS Capital’s ongoing operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period, and afford investors a view of results that may be more easily compared to those of other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from net investment income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted NII for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nQuarter ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net investment income $ 3,794 $ 3,340 Capital gains incentive fee — 283 Adjusted net investment income $ 3,794 $ 3,623 Adjusted net investment income per common share: Basic and diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.37 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic and diluted 13,340,502 9,700,329 ABOUT OFS CAPITAL\nOFS Capital Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company.
