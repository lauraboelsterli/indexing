    "text": "Average price of US gas jumps 10 cents to $3 a gallon Published 7 Hours Ago The Associated Press Getty Images\nThe average price of regular-grade gasoline in the U.S. jumped 10 cents a gallon over the past two weeks to $3.\nIndustry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that the price has spiked 41 cents over the past three months.\nLundberg says the increase is largely driven by higher crude oil costs and the phasing-in of summer-grade gasoline, which is used to prevent smog.\nThe highest average price in the contiguous 48 states was $3.79 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The lowest was $2.54 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nThe average price for diesel fuel rose 9 cents, to $3.23.",
