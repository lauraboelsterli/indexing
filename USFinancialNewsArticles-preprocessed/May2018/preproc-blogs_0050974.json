Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Companies are beginning to see a competitive advantage in text-based chatbots that offer just a little bit more to everyday insurance and banking tasks than the usual no-nonsense customer service. CIO Journal’s Kim S. Nash and Sara Castellanos report on the efforts made by software developers at Progressive Insurance and Capital One Financial to translate wit, empathy and branding into code.\nGiving chatbots more of voice offers advantages… Bots that bring “humanity” to banking, rather than simply convey data, are a competitive advantage, Capital One Financial Corp. CIO Rob Alexander says. “The winners in banking are going to be great technology companies that are able to … bring banking to customers in ways that really appeal to them,” he said.\n…and new challenges. Doing business via text, where tone and context is everything, pushes corporate software programmers into new territory, teaching systems to understand and “chat” in natural language. Plus, the AI that powers many of these virtual assistants can be unpredictable. “Now we need to design a conversation,” says Roberto Masiero, vice president of innovation labs at Automated Data Processing Inc ., which is working on chatbots for human resources.\nGDPR\nEurope’s strict new GDPR privacy laws take effect Friday, requiring even many small and medium-size U.S. firms to overhaul the way they handle customer data. Photo: DADO RUVIC/REUTERS\nGDPR has companies big and small racing to comply. The new General Data Protection Regulation is forcing hundreds of thousands of companies—multinationals like Mastercard Inc . and insurer Allianz SE , but also small manufacturers and even restaurants—to change how they gather and handle information about Europeans, even if the companies have no physical footprint in Europe. The Journal’s Sam Schechner and Natalia Drozdiak check the pulse .\nAllianz. The Munich-based insurer said it has spent tens of millions of euros to get ready for GDPR, including mobilizing hundreds of privacy experts from 80 subsidiaries to make changes.\nAccor SA. The French hotel group hired an outside vendor to build a map of all the ways it uses data, and then to keep that map updated in case regulators come for an audit.\nMastercard. The credit-card firm joined with International Business Machines Corp. to set up an external trust that will hold and anonymize the data, so Mastercard has no ability to reidentify individuals from it.\nCYBERSECURITY\nThe final match in soccer’s UEFA Champions League competition is taking place Saturday in Kiev, Ukraine.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation moved to dismantle a large network of hacked routers and storage devices that Cisco Systems Inc. and U.S. and Ukraine authorities said could be used to launch a massive cyberattack, possibly timed to next Saturday’s UEFA Champions League soccer final in Kiev. The WSJ’s Robert McMillan reports that Ukraine has blamed Russia for a wave of disruptive cyberattacks that have shut down electricity and hacked computers across the country over the past three years.\nOTHER TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nSamsung Electronics' home appliances are displayed at Samsung's headquarters in Seoul. Photo: LEE JAE-WON/ZUMA PRESS\nSamsung wants AI in all devices. To speed the effort, Samung Electronics Co. is opening AI research centers in Cambridge, U.K., Toronto and Moscow this month, the Journal’s Timothy W. Martin reports . The company plans to build an internal team of at least 1,000 AI-dedicated engineers and researchers by 2020.\nUber ends self-driving program in Arizona. The company made its announcement two months after one of its vehicles operating in autonomous mode killed a pedestrian in Arizona, Reuters reports. Uber Technologies Inc. will continue tests in Pittsburgh and in two cities in California.\nBookings up. Uber’s first-quarter revenue rose 70% from the prior year to $2.59 billion, while gross bookings, a measure of how many rides and fresh food deliveries were made, jumped 55%, the WSJ’s Greg Bensinger reports .\nMacron meets with tech leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday told chief executives from Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. , Intel Corp. and IBM that tech must contribute more to society and, hey, why not France. “There is no free lunch,” he told the executives, according to Reuters . “So I want from you some commitments.”\nIBM helps with the tab. The company announced it would hire 1,400 people in France over the next couple of years. Reuters reports that the new hires will focus on blockchain, cloud and the internet of things.\nElon Musk shares latest proposal. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, unhappy with media coverage of Tesla Inc. , said he plans to create a Yelp.com-like site to let people rate the credibility of journalists and news organizations, the Journal’s Tim Higgins reports . Mr. Musk suggested he would name it after Pravda, the former Soviet Union’s main propaganda outlet.\nJudge rules Trump may not block critics on Twitter. Doing so violates their right to free speech, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the Southern District of New York ruled. The WSJ’s Rebecca Ballhaus has more .\nNext PlayStation is three years off. Sony Corp. wants to spend three more years readying its next videogame move, the head of the PlayStation business said. The WSJ’s Takashi Mochizuki says the announcement marks a slight slowdown in the six-to-seven-year update cycle for the console since the first one debuted in 1994.\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nU.S. trading partners expressed alarm about threatened American tariffs on imported cars, which could hit allies hard and disrupt the industry around the world. (WSJ)\nA senior North Korean official renewed a threat to call off a Kim-Trump summit and warned that Pyongyang could “make the U.S. taste an appalling tragedy it has neither experienced nor even imagined.” (WSJ)\nComcast is escalating its threat to disrupt Walt Disney’s megadeal to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox’s assets , a potential move that could reshape the power structure in the entertainment industry. (WSJ)\nNASA chief James Bridenstine unequivocally told a Senate panel that human activity is the primary cause of climate change.
