    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Air France expects to cancel one in five flights on Tuesday as staff carry out a fifteenth day of strikes over a pay dispute that has forced the resignation of parent company Air France-KLM’s chief executive.\nThe empty podium is seen after Jean-Marc Janaillac, Chief Executive Officer of Air France-KLM Group, attended a news conference to announce his resignation in Paris, France, May 4, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau The airline said it anticipated operating 75 percent of medium-haul flights and 95 percent of long-haul services to and from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, and 82 percent of short-haul flights.\nShares in Air France-KLM tumbled on Monday after CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac’s gamble to put a salary hike offer to employees backfired on Friday, prompting him to announce he would step down.\nReporting by Richard Lough; editing by Luke Baker\nOur ",
