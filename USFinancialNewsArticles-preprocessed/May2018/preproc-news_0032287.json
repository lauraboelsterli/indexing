    "text": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s ( TSLA.O ) energy unit has lost two major executives, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nCharging stations for electric-powered Tesla cars are installed in Melide near Lugano, Switzerland May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann Arch Padmanabhan, the product director for Tesla’s stationary storage unit, and Bob Rudd, a former SolarCity vice president who led North American commercial and utility sales, have both left the company, according to the report.\nTesla declined to comment on the report.\nChief Executive Officer Elon Musk told employees on Monday that the company was undergoing a “thorough reorganization”.\nTesla has seen a flurry of senior executive exits in recent months at a time when the company is looking to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
