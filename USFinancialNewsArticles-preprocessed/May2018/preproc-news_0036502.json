    "text": "ZURICH, May 15 (Reuters) - Sika said it is selling a 1.5 billion Swiss franc ($1.50 billion) convertible bond, with the proceeds going towards buying its own shares back from Saint-Gobain.\nThe bonds, which will be due in 2025, are expected to carry a coupon between 0.00 percent and 0.30 percent per annum, the company said.\nFrench building materials company Saint-Gobain and Swiss peer Sika said on Friday they had reached an agreement to end a long-standing legal dispute, which will result in Saint-Gobain acquiring a large stake in Sika.\nUnder the deal, Sika will buy a 6.97 percent stake in itself back from Saint-Gobain, and then cancel the shares.
