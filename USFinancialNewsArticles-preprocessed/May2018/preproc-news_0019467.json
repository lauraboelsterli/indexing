    "text": "SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quidel Corporation (NASDAQ: QDEL), a provider of rapid diagnostic testing solutions, cellular-based virology assays and molecular diagnostic systems, announced today financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenue was $169.1 million as compared to $73.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Cardiac Immunoassay revenue was $68.4 million. Influenza revenue increased 59% from the first quarter of 2017 to $64.6 million. Total Rapid Immunoassay revenue increased 40% from the first quarter of 2017. Reduced debt by over $182.0 million through sale/leaseback transaction of the Summers Ridge facility and convertible note exchange. Reported GAAP EPS of $0.86 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $0.42 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017 and reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.29 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $0.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Received 510(k) clearance for Sofia Lyme assay on Sofia® 2 Immunoassay Analyzer. Re-introduced CLIA waived QuickVue® Influenza A+B test, now meets FDA's Class II RIDT requirements.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $169.1 million, versus $73.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The 130% increase in sales from the first quarter of 2017 was driven by incremental revenue from the acquired Cardiac Immunoassay business, as well as 40% revenue growth from the Rapid Immunoassay business, primarily driven by sales of Influenza immunoassay products.\nCardiac Immunoassay revenue, which includes revenues from the Triage, Triage Toxicology and BNP products acquired in October 2017, totaled $68.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. Rapid Immunoassay product revenue (which includes QuickVue, Sofia and Eye Health products) increased 40% in the first quarter of 2018 to $80.7 million, led by a 131% rise in Sofia revenue, while QuickVue sales declined 34% from the first quarter of 2017. Molecular Diagnostic Solutions revenue increased 65% to $5.1 million, led by 178% revenue growth from Solana, our instrumented molecular diagnostic system. Specialized Diagnostic Solutions revenue, which includes revenue from Virology/DHI, Specialty and Other, increased 14% from the first quarter of 2017 to $14.9 million, due to growth in both Virology and Specialty products.\n“We had a great quarter on many fronts, and revenue growth was strong and broad-based. Cardiac Immunoassay revenues in the quarter confirmed our belief in the underlying market's demand for Triage products. Also, we made steady progress in integrating the Triage and Beckman BNP businesses, and we continue to leverage our stronger sales channel and strengthen our international presence,” said Douglas Bryant, president and CEO of Quidel Corporation. \"Organically, we also grew the Rapid Immunoassay business in the quarter by capitalizing on a very strong Influenza season and driving Sofia 2 and Solana instrument placements. In the quarter, we also de-levered the business by a considerable sum through a couple executed transactions. Overall, the first quarter presented a solid start to the year for the new Quidel, as we position ourselves for long-term growth.”\nGross Profit in the first quarter of 2018 increased to $106.3 million, the result of increased sales volumes associated with the acquired Triage and BNP businesses and Rapid Immunoassay products, as well as favorable product mix. Overall, gross margin for the quarter was 63% as compared to 66% for the same period last year. Amortization of intangibles reduced the gross margin by 2 percentage points, and the Triage/BNP inventory step-up of fair value reduced the consolidated gross margin by an additional 2 percentage points. R&D expense increased by $4.7 million in the first quarter as compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the increase in R&D personnel related to the acquired Triage business. Sales and Marketing expense increased by $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, largely due to incremental personnel costs associated with the Triage business. G&A expense increased by $3.4 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher incentive and stock-based compensation as well as costs associated with the Triage and BNP businesses. Acquisition and Integration Costs were $3.5 million, driven by acquisition costs associated with the Triage and BNP businesses. Interest expense was $7.9 million in the quarter, loss on extinguishment of debt includes one-time costs of $3.0 million related to the partial write down of unamortized debt issuance costs, and $1.6 million loss associated with the convertible senior note exchange agreements.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $34.0 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $14.3 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $54.3 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $15.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company is providing non-GAAP financial information to exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, non-cash interest expense, impact of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and certain non-recurring items on income and net earnings per share as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP.\nManagement is providing the adjusted net income and adjusted net earnings per share information for the periods presented because it believes this enhances the comparison of the Company’s financial performance from period-to-period, and to that of its competitors.
