    "text": "May 4 (Reuters) - A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Hawaiiâ€™s Big Island on Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey said, just south of where the Kilauea volcano has been spewing flows of lava into residential areas, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate.\nThe USGS said the tremor was very shallow - only 4.3 miles (7 km) deep - and centered 11 miles (17.7 km) southeast of Fern Forest.\nThe USGS said earlier the eruption of the volcano, one of five on the island, followed a series of earthquakes over the past week.
