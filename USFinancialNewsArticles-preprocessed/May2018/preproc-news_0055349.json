    "text": "2 COMMENTS TODAY IS Sarah Arison’s big day: It’s the annual New York benefit for the National YoungArts Foundation, the arts education nonprofit she heads. For the next 12 hours, Arison, 33, will pinball all over town, starting in the art-filled Greenwich Village apartment she shares with her financier husband, Thomas Wilhelm, and ending at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where the YoungArts New York Gala is held each April. The celebration and fundraiser is the culmination of a much larger project to nurture and support young artists in visual, literary, design and performing arts, a mission that has proved even more vital as arts funding goes on the chopping block in many places.\nEach January, YoungArts invites 170 young artists, ages 15 to 18, to its Miami headquarters for a week of master classes, workshops, performances and evaluations—with mentors like tenor Plácido Domingo and dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov. More than 20,000 students have gone through the program since its founding in 1981, including luminaries such as Timothée Chalamet, Viola Davis, Doug Aitken and Nicki Minaj. Arison, who was named chair earlier this year, says it gives “a life-changing experience to a group of the greatest young artists in the country.”\nSarah Arison in New York City.

Magazine YoungArts was established by Arison’s grandparents, Ted and Lin Arison. “My grandfather really wanted to be a concert pianist growing up, but he didn’t find the support,” says Arison, who was raised in Miami and also serves as president of the Arison Arts Foundation. Arison recounts that when her grandfather made a fortune by founding the Norwegian and Carnival cruise lines, he resolved, “I never want another young aspiring artist to go through what I went through.” In 2004, Arison joined the board while a sophomore at Emory University and immediately set about transforming the way the organization connected to past YoungArts participants. “We had no relationship with our alums—this amazing resource,” she says. Now former students are key to its success when they give back by mentoring. Arison also helps leverage corporate partnerships, like securing funding for the Max Mara Young Visionary Award, given to a standout YoungArts student (this year the prize went to an opera singer).\nBut it’s hardly all do-gooding, all the time for Arison: She and Wilhelm, who also have homes in Miami and Aspen, are planning a summer motorcycle road trip to visit land art masterpieces like Walter De Maria’s The Lightning Field , and they’re adopting a dog—a cavapoo rescue named Sir Arthur. In the words of one of the gala guests, Brooklyn Museum director Anne Pasternak, “Sarah’s just fabulous—and this event gives me hope.”",
