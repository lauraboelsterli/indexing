    "text": "0 COMMENTS KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—Opposition leader Mahathir Mohamad dared Malaysian authorities on Thursday to charge him in court under a harsh new law against “fake news” after police placed him under investigation as election campaigning heats up.\nDr. Mahathir, the country’s 92-year-old former leader, is attempting to unseat his former protégé Prime Minister Najib Razak. Dr. Mahathir and many others have accused Mr. Najib of skimming several hundred million dollars from a scandal-tainted state investment fund.\nThe 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB, and Mr. Najib have denied wrongdoing and said they would cooperate with any lawful international investigation. But the controversy has injected an unusually high level of acrimony into the May 9 contest.\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Mahathir said Mr. Najib’s supporters were systematically sabotaging the opposition’s campaign . Among other things, Dr. Mahathir said a plane he chartered to take him to a northern district to register as a candidate had been sabotaged. He ended up flying on a friend’s aircraft and registered before the cutoff.\nRelated Coverage Mahathir Accuses Malaysian Government of Fighting ‘Dirty’ in Election (May 1) Malaysia Passes ‘Fake News’ Law That Critics Call an Assault on Speech (April 3) Malaysia Wields Law Against ‘Fake News’ for First Time (April 30) Government officials have denied the accusations, saying Dr. Mahathir was attempting to draw an emotional response from voters. Aviation regulators said there was no evidence of sabotage and that the plane couldn’t take off because air had leaked from one of the front tires.\nSupporters of the ruling United Malays National Organization filed a police complaint on Wednesday against Dr. Mahathir, accusing him of breaking the recently enacted law prohibiting the spread of false news. It provides for up to six years in prison and has been condemned by free-speech advocates.\nDr. Mahathir urged authorities to pass the case directly to prosecutors. “They can charge me in court. I have no fake news, only the truth,” he told a local television channel while campaigning in Pekan, Mr. Najib’s hometown.\nLater, Dr. Mahathir told a campaign rally in Kuala Lumpur that “I might be arrested soon,” drawing laughter and applause from the crowd. He also accused government officials of spreading false rumors that he would admit himself to hospital before election day to win sympathy votes.\nPolice are required to investigate formal complaints and confirmed late Wednesday that they had begun an investigation into Dr. Mahathir, which could involve his arrest and questioning. Most investigations don’t result in charges. Police officials didn't respond to requests Thursday for more comment.\nOne person, a tourist from Denmark, has been convicted under the anti-fake-news law and was sentenced on Monday to a month in prison after he accused police of being slow to respond to the killing of a Palestinian university lecturer in Kuala Lumpur last month.\nPolitical analysts such as Ibrahim Suffian at the Merdeka Center polling firm in Kuala Lumpur say the election could be close but that Mr. Najib would likely secure enough support among the majority ethnic-Malay population to form another government. However, as in 2013, the multiethnic opposition alliance may win the popular vote, leaving the country politically divided.\nWrite to James Hookway at james.hookway@wsj.com",
