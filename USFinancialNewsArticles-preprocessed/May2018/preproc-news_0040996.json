    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 10:35 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Porsche to recall 60,000 SUVs for emissions problems: German regulator Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nHAMBURG (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) sports-car brand Porsche has been asked by Germany’s KBA automotive regulator to recall around 60,000 diesel-engined Macan and Cayenne sport-utility vehicles, a KBA spokesman said. A Porsche logo is pictured during the Volkswagen Group's annual general meeting in Berlin, Germany, May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nGerman magazine Der Spiegel reported the recall earlier on Friday, saying the two models equipped with the latest Euro-6 diesel engine generation were fitted with more so-called defeat devices capable of reducing emissions in laboratory tests.\nPorsche was immediately available for comment.\nThe Stuttgart-based sports-car manufacturer earlier this year already issued a recall for six-cylinder Macan models to update emissions-control software with the aim of averting a regulatory ban on sales.
