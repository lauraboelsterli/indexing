    "text": "(Reuters) - Glencore Plc ( GLEN.L ) has won a temporary injunction against Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler over alleged unpaid royalties he said he is owed by the company, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of commodities trader Glencore is pictured in front of the company's headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, July 18, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo Last week, Glencore said its mining subsidiaries in the Democratic Republic of Congo were served freezing orders for alleged unpaid royalties of nearly $3 billion by a company affiliated with Gertler.\nA spokesman for Glencore declined to comment. Gertler’s Fleurette Group and his foundation did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request to comment.\nGertler, who is the subject of U.S. sanctions, is owed some royalties by Glencore, but the London-listed company disputes the amounts claimed.\nGertler’s Ventora Development Sasu is seeking $695 million in unpaid and future royalties from Glencore’s unit Mutanda Mining and $2.28 billion from Glencore unit Kamoto Copper Co (KCC)\nThe injunction forbids Gertler from taking any steps in his legal action against the KCC mine, the FT said. on.ft.com/2KsjOIX\nThere will be a hearing on the case in London on May 11, the newspaper said.\nReporting by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru.
