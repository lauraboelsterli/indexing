We are at the mercy of the (Trump) administration, not just on North Korea but on trade with the auto tariffs,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, New York.\n“Sure, the summit was seen as a positive and it being called off is, I suppose, a negative. But I think the weakness in the market is broader.”\nAt 12:19 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 133.75 points, or 0.54 percent, at 24,753.06, the S&P 500 was down 9.76 points, or 0.36 percent, at 2,723.53 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 11.92 points, or 0.16 percent, at 7,414.04.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were in the red, with the energy sector down 1.53 percent.\nOil prices recorded their largest one-day drop in two weeks, with expectations building that OPEC could wind down an output deal due to concerns about supplies from Venezuela and Iran.\nThe financial sector dropped 0.8 percent after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting tempered expectations of faster interest rate hikes.\nFord and General Motors gained on the possibility of tariffs on European and Asian car imports. U.S.-listed shares of Fiat fell 1.6 percent.\nBest Buy Co tumbled 7.68 percent after the consumer electronics retailer reported a slowdown in quarterly online sales and did not update its full-year outlook.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.17-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.24-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 16 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 77 new highs and 36 new lows.
