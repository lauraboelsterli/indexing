    "text": "2 COMMENTS Two hundred years ago, Samuel Slater —known to the British as “Slater the traitor”—helped launch the U.S. industrial revolution with pilfered British textile machinery designs.\nFast forward to 2018 and the U.S. is trying to keep its sensitive technology out of the hands of its challenger, China. The Trump administration correctly views Chinese acquisition of U.S. technology, through nefarious means or otherwise, as a threat to American pre-eminence .\nEven so, China’s ability to dominate next-generation technologies like semiconductors and robotics hinges as much on the strengths and weaknesses of its own state-led innovation system as U.S. policy. To date, China has proven excellent at mobilizing capital and digesting foreign designs. Its record on real innovation is much patchier.\nMany of China’s notable high-tech successes have resulted from technology transfers. In the past two decades China has licensed Japanese high-speed rail technology and signed tech transfer agreements with Westinghouse for its nuclear technology—both in return for market access. These days, it promotes its own supposedly “indigenous” designs for export.\nBut homegrown Chinese technology champions and global brands are still rare—one reason Beijing is lobbying so hard for the Trump administration to reverse its sanctions on telecom market leader ZTE. China’s new $47 billion microprocessor fund, headed up by the government-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund , sounds impressive. But more-established competitors are already spending heavily: Intel alone spent $13 billion on research and development in 2017.\nChina’s past attempts to stoke indigenous innovation have a checkered history. A flood of cheap capital and high, state-set solar power rates in the mid-2000s secured China’s place as the world’s number one solar cell manufacturer. But it also led to enormous overcapacity, which sank prices and pushed debt burdens higher, making investment in real R&D more difficult. For investors, China’s solar champions have been a losing proposition—American depositary receipts of top firms such as JinkoSolar are worth less than half of their peak in 2010. Robotics, a key element of Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” plan to dominate high-tech manufacturing, is exhibiting similar tendencies.\nThe state-centric nature of China’s financial system —and its weak intellectual property protection—represents a double whammy for prospective entrepreneurs. Small private-sector firms often only have access to capital through expensive shadow banking channels, and face the risk that some better connected, state-backed firm will make off with their designs—with very little recourse.\nThe sheer amount of cash Beijing is throwing at robotics, chips and electric vehicles makes it likely some Chinese companies will succeed in those sectors over the long run. But the wait could be longer, and the results less satisfactory for investors, than current rhetoric on both sides of the Pacific suggests.\nWrite to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com",
