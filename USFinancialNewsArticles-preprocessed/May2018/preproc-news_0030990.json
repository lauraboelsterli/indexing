Martinez hit a two-run homer and added an RBI single as the visiting Boston Red Sox defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 5-3 Sunday afternoon in the rubber match of a three-game series.\nMay 13, 2018; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Boston Red Sox Right Fielder J.D. Martinez (28) celebrates with teammate shortstop Xander Bogaerts (2) after hitting a home run against the Toronto Blue Jays during the first inning at Rogers Centre. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Sousa-USA TODAY Sports Boston left-hander Drew Pomeranz allowed three runs, five hits and five walks while striking out six in four-plus innings and did not factor into the decision.\nThe win went to reliever Hector Velazquez (5-0), who allowed two hits and struck out two in two innings. Joe Kelly pitched a perfect ninth to earn his second save of the season.\nToronto’s Joe Biagini (0-2), recalled from Triple-A Buffalo for the start, allowed four runs, four hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings. The right-hander struck out three.\nThe Red Sox too a 2-0 lead in the first inning when Martinez hit his 10th homer of the season after Andrew Benintendi singled.\nMay 13, 2018; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Boston Red Sox second baseman Brock Holt (12) makes a play at second base to get out Toronto Blue Jays first baseman Justin Smoak (14) during the first inning at Rogers Centre. Mandatory Credit: Kevin Sousa-USA TODAY Sports The Red Sox tacked on a run in the third when Biagini walked Mitch Moreland with the bases loaded. Jackie Bradley Jr. started the inning with a walk and went to third on a single by Mookie Betts. Martinez walked to fill the bases.\nBetts made a superb catch on Richard Urena’s fly to right field with a runner at second to end the Toronto fourth.\nBoston scored a run in the fifth on an RBI single by Martinez against John Axford. It scored Betts, who singled, stole second and took third on Benintendi flyout to the wall in left and Biagini was removed from the game.\nSlideshow (3 Images) The Blue Jays scored three runs in the fifth. Teoscar Hernandez and Josh Donaldson singled and both scored on Justin Smoak’s double. Yangervis Solarte walked and Hector Velazquez replaced Pomeranz. Russell Martin, who had three hits in the game, hit an RBI single.\nBoston reliever Matt Barnes allowed a single to Solarte in the seventh. Solarte was out at home on Martin’s two-out double to left.\nToronto reliever Sam Gaviglio pitched a perfect seventh before allowing a walk and a single in the eighth to leave runners at the corners with one out for Tyler Clippard.\nClippard fumbled a comebacker hit by Xander Bogaerts and settled for the out at first instead of a potential double play and a run scored to make it 5-3 for Boston.\nHeath Hembree pitched around a single in the bottom of the eighth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
