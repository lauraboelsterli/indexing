REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\nTencent obtained a license plate for its self-driving car from the Shenzhen Transport Bureau, state news agency Xinhua said on Monday.\nIt follows Beijing move in April to issue national guidelines for testing self-driving cars, which was reported by the China Daily newspaper.\nChina is making a major push into autonomous vehicles to develop national champions to compete with global leaders such as Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google parent Alphabet Inc, and Tesla Inc.\nBeijing, Shanghai and other Chinese cities previously announced local guidelines for self-driving tests.\nInternet giant Baidu Inc already has approval to test self-driving vehicles in Beijing, while SAIC Motor Corp Ltd and electric vehicle start-up NIO have licences to test autonomous cars in Shanghai.\nXinhua said several cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, have issued self-driving car licenses after testing regulations came into effect.\nFollowing two high-profile crashes in the United States involving Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] and Tesla, China’s central government officials said Beijing would make safety a priority.\nThe Shenzhen Transport Bureau required Tencent’s autonomous car to have both a driver and second person for safety reasons to be in the car during tests, Xinhua reported.
