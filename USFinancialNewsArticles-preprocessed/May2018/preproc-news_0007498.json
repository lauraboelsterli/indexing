    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 9:30 AM / Updated 30 minutes ago Barclays chairman insists not going yet, shareholders back CEO Lawrence White , Emma Rumney 3 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - John McFarlane is not about to quit as chairman of Barclays ( BARC.L ), he said on Tuesday, adding that most shareholders backed Jes Staley to remain as the British bank’s chief executive following a misconduct inquiry. FILE PHOTO: John McFarlane, Chairman of Barclays, arrives for a meeting with Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, at Downing Street in London, Britain July 5, 2016. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\nBarclays has faced uncertainty over its top leadership, mainly due to regulatory scrutiny of Staley’s treatment of a whistleblower and concerns among some investors about its investment bank-focused strategy.\nMcFarlane told Barclays’ annual general meeting that while he had asked chairman of its nominations committee, Crawford Gillies, to prepare for his eventual departure, he had only served three years of his four year term.\n“You are not getting rid of me yet,” he told the meeting.\nBarclays is also under pressure from the recent presence of activist investor Edward Bramson, a turnaround expert who has taken a 5 percent holding in the bank.\nMcFarlane told Michael Mason-Mahon, a frequent bank critic and AGM attendee, that more than 95 percent of shareholders had no worries over Staley’s fitness to run the bank.\n“You say you have been in banking over 38 years, you should have known better than to bring shame on our bank,” Mason-Mahon said, accusing Staley of hurting the bank’s reputation.\nThere had been speculation Staley could lose his job for trying to identify who sent a letter raising “concerns of a personal nature” about an unnamed senior bank official.\nBut Staley survived the ensuing inquiry with a fine and McFarlane said the “malicious letter” contained false allegations and had not come from within the bank.\n“If it had been a whistleblow from an employee, then the matter would have been much more serious,” he added. TURNING POINT\nShareholders have berated Barclays in recent years as profits, in particular from its investment bank, have disappointed. Mixed first quarter results last month failed to allay the concerns of some analysts.\nMcFarlane said that the shareholder meeting marked a “turning point”, but agreed there was more to do.\nSignificant investment was still needed to secure revenue growth, benefit from the digital economy and bolster defences against risks like cybercrime, he said.\nMeanwhile, Staley said he had no plans to set up a trading desk for cryptocurrencies, after some reports suggested that the bank was gauging clients’ interest.\nSecurity guards removed climate change advocates who used the meeting to protest at what they said was Barclays’ funding of industries that damage the environment.\nMcFarlane said a review had been carried out into the bank’s financing of tar sands and other natural resources, and this would be published later this year.
