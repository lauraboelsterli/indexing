Photo: iStockphoto.com/ziggymaj\nAn emerging trend among some big corporations is the melding of their risk and compliance functions with their environmental, social, governance and human-rights programs.\nCompanies embracing these changes include Barrick Gold Corp., which is bringing together its corruption, human rights and compliance programs; Novartis AG, which is combining its risk management and compliance programs; and both Lockheed Martin Corp. and AstraZeneca PLC, which are melding their compliance and sustainability functions.\nThe change comes as part of a growing recognition among multinationals that protecting their organization’s reputation and mitigating its risks requires a more coordinated and integrated response, said Alison Taylor, managing director at BSR, a global nonprofit sustainability organization.\n“The regulator is no longer the only thing to worry about; compliance is becoming privatized,” said Ms. Taylor. “We are in uncharted territory on a range of ethical issues such as data ownership, diversity and inclusion. Structures and approaches that have worked until now may not serve companies well in the future.”\nPart of this emerging shift is driven by the increased focus of activists using social media to name and shame companies that displease them, and among governments to hold companies to account for the impact their decisions have, she said. This pressure puts the onus on companies to get ahead of potential problems.\nPhilosophies, Efficiencies\nBarrick Gold decided to merge its compliance and human-rights programs for philosophical and practical reasons, said Jonathan Drimmer, the company’s newly named chief compliance officer who previously served as vice president and deputy general counsel. Barrick decided to keep its environmental and social programs separate because “we treat as distinctly different legal compliance from operational compliance,” said Mr. Drimmer.\nThe process to integrate began several years ago and has matured to the point where the results have led to more-nuanced views of risk and compliance issues, said Mr. Drimmer. For example, organizations with new or less-mature programs tend to focus more inwardly on what they are doing and whether it is the right thing to do, while more sophisticated operations also consider external factors, he said.\n“From a philosophical standpoint we should treat human-rights issues as legal issues…so bringing it in with legal made sense,” said Mr. Drimmer. “Often where you find corruption issues and risk you find human-rights issues and risk, so purely from an efficiency and risk-mitigation standpoint it made sense.”\nLeo MacKay was vice president of ethics and sustainability at Lockheed Martin when the company’s chief executive, Marillyn Hewson, asked him to bring into his fold the internal audit enterprise risk function.\nOne of the first things he discovered was the commonalities between the various programs, such as the emphasis on risk awareness and risk management and the use of similar analytics tools and processes. “Having people thinking about enterprise risk in close association with those generating sustainability programs designed to mitigate long-term risk…makes a lot of sense,” said Mr. Mackay.\nThere was a period of “sorting out” as the two programs were integrated; Mr. Mackay said it took some time to break down barriers, build trust and convince people it wasn’t a takeover of one department by another. “It also helps when the initiative comes from the CEO, who is also the chairman of our board,” and who has a background in internal audit, he said.\nChange is a challenge\nAstraZeneca’s compliance program “felt like the natural spot” to add sustainability because of the overlap between the areas of concern, said James Massey, the company’s global vice president of sustainability. Other than taking on a broader, longer-term scope for its mission, there hasn’t been a “big change in day-to-day responsibilities,” he said.\nOne of the challenges was taking pains to understand the impact of products on the global markets where they are sold, he said. For example, whether third-party partners are meeting the company’s standards for human rights, fair pay, proper working conditions. That means staying aware of any changes occurring globally.\n“The biggest challenge we are facing now is change; it’s one of the things we talk about quite a bit,” said Mr. Massey. “Things are moving around us and continually changing and it’s critical we as function, if we truly are going to be sustainable, are changing with those changing expectations.”\nNovartis in April combined its risk management and compliance teams into one to give executives “a better view of the risks we face as an organization, and how those risks could impact our ability to deliver on strategic priorities,” said Shannon Klinger, the company’s chief ethics, risk and compliance officer.\nNo single event prompted the change, she said, other than as Novartis moves toward becoming a more integrated company “it’s only natural to adapt risk functions to this business model.”\nThe change in structure should result in a simplification and reduction of administrative burdens on the company’s various operating units, she said. For example, business units respond to multiple risk assessments, each requiring data on a range of complex variables.\n“Our aim is to ensure agility in a fast-changing environment,” she said.\nWrite to Ben DiPietro at ben.dipietro@wsj.com , and follow him on Twitter @BenDiPietro1.\nShare this: AstraZeneca Barrick Gold environmental ESG governance Lockheed Martin Corp.
