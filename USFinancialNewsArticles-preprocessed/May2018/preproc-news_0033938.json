As a result of the appointment of Mr. Farlinger, Mr. Farlinger will no longer be considered an independent director of the Company. Mr. Farlinger will remain a member of the Audit Committee, however, the role of Chair will be assumed by independent director Martin Burian.

The initial scope of work conducted by RubinBrown included the following: (i) a review of compensation paid to Mr. Parsons and Mr. Matthew Willer, the former President and former director of the Company; (ii) activity in the Company’s shareholder distribution general ledger accounts for Mr. Parsons and Mr. Willer; (iii) activity in the Company’s due to/from management general ledger accounts for Mr. Parsons and Mr. Willer; and (iv) use of the Company’s credit card for business expenses and personal expenses of Mr. Parsons and Mr. Willer.\nOn May 3, 2018, RubinBrown provided the Audit Committee with its confidential report (the “ Forensic Report ”). The Audit Committee has reviewed the Forensic Report and has recommended that its findings be accepted by the Board. On May 7, 2018, the Board accepted the May 3, 2018 Forensic Report and authorized RubinBrown to conduct additional work as described below.\nBased on the findings of the Forensic Report, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board and the Board has determined that the amount of $788,702 previously characterized as shareholder distributions in the Q2 2017 unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company be reclassified as amounts due from related parties to be repaid to the Company. As a result, Mr. Parsons owes $600,000 to the Company and Mr. Willer owes $188,702.\nIn addition, the Forensic Report finds that Mr. Willer was paid a total amount of $30,956 in excess of compensation amounts authorized to him under his employment agreement in calendar year 2017 and that utilization of the Company Credit Card for personal use from the time of the completion of the RTO, on May 25, 2017 to March 31, 2018 totaled $849,695 for Mr. Parsons and $39,531 for Mr. Willer. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, accepted by the Board, these amounts will be added as amounts due from related parties in future financial disclosure of the Company. The Company is completing its final review of Company Credit Card expenses to determine if there are any additional amounts to be reclassified as personal expenses to be added to the amounts due from related parties.\nMr. Parsons has agreed in writing to repay all amounts owed to the Company and is working with the Company to finalize a debt settlement agreement and repay the Company in the short term. It has been determined that Mr. Willer currently owes the Company $265,423.74, which includes the amounts specified above. The Company expects Mr. Willer to repay all amounts owed to the Company and the Audit Committee is charged with the responsibility of reaching acceptable terms with Mr. Willer for such repayment to the Company in the short term.\nThe Company is committed to remediating its internal controls and control environment over financial reporting, and has committed to resolving the material weaknesses leading to the errors mentioned above. The Company has already begun a process for in-sourcing its outsourced accounting function, implemented various revised or additional procedures and controls, including limiting access to cash accounts to only key executives Alex Rasmussen, the Executive Vice-President of Operations and Mr. Peter Csapo, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Csapo has significant regulatory and risk management experience with public healthcare companies in the United States and is working with the Audit Committee and Board to improve management oversight, internal controls, control environment over financial reporting, and the tone at the top.\nManagement Cease Trade Order\nThis release also serves to provide the Company’s default status report in accordance with National Policy 12-203 – Management Cease Trade Orders (“ NP 12-203 ”). As a result of the Company’s delay in filing its Annual Filings, the British Columbia Securities Commission granted a management cease trade order (the “ MCTO ”) on May 1, 2018. The MCTO restricts all trading in securities of the Company, whether direct or indirect, by management of the Company until such time as the Annual Filings have been filed by the Company. The MCTO does not generally affect the ability of shareholders who are not insiders of the Company to trade their securities. The audit process is now underway and the Company is working closely with Squar Milner and expects to provide a further update regarding when it can expect to file the Annual Filings. The Company intends to satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines set out in NP 12-203 by continuing to issue by-weekly default status reports in the form of further news releases which will be filed on www.sedar.com , until the Annual Filings have been filed.\nThe Company confirms that as of the date of this news release there is no insolvency proceeding against the Company and there is no material information concerning the affairs of the Company that has not been generally disclosed. The Board is actively focused on determining whether the Company is properly capitalized to meet the financial demands associated with its working capital requirements and plans for growth. The Company would file, to the extent applicable, its next default status report on or about May 29, 2018.\nAbout Assure Holdings Corp.\nAssure Holdings Corp. is a Colorado-based company that works with neurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons to provide a turnkey suite of services that support intraoperative neuromonitoring activities during invasive surgeries.
