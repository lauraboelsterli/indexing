    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs will probably take effect on June 1 unless a deal is struck, a spokesman for the German economy ministry said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: Aluminium wheels are pictured at a scrapyard in Hamburg, September 28, 2012. Picture taken September 28. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer U.S. President Donald Trump has granted the European Union an exemption from the tariffs until June 1.\nAsked about the procedure, the ministry spokesman said:\n“As far as I know it is in the night (going into) June 1,” said the spokesman. “As far as I know, they (the tariffs) would automatically take effect,” he said, adding talks were still going on to try to get a deal.\nReporting by Michelle Martin and Madeline Chambers\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
