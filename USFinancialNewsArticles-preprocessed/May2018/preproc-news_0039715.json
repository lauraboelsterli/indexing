Total course enrollments were 589,000, a decrease of 9.4% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Cash receipts from online course registration were $43.9 million, a 25.4% increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit increased by 10.0% to $11.1 million from $10.1 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP [1] gross profit increased by 9.8% to $11.1 million from $10.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 37.2%, compared with 46.0% in the prior year period. Non-GAAP1 gross margin was 37.3%, compared with 46.2% in the prior year period. Operating loss increased to $2.9 million from $2.1 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP [1] operating loss increased to $2.4 million from $1.6 million in the prior year period. Net loss was $3.3 million, compared with net loss of $2.4 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP [1] net loss was $2.7 million compared with non-GAAP net loss of $1.9 million in the prior year period. Basic and diluted net loss per American Depositary Share (\"ADS\") were $0.098, compared with basic and diluted net loss per ADS of $0.073, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Each ADS represents four ordinary shares. Basic and diluted non-GAAP [1] net loss per ADS were $0.082, compared with basic and diluted non-GAAP [1] net loss per ADS of $0.059, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Cash flow from operations decreased by 36.1% to $7.2 million from $11.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\n[1]\nFor more information about the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release, please see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below\nMr. Zhengdong Zhu, Chairman and CEO of CDEL, said, \"During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we delivered strong net revenue growth of 36.1% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, with our accounting vertical again driving the outperformance relative to our guidance. Our total course enrollments were down 9.4% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, primarily due to the decrease in enrollments of our continuing education courses. However, excluding continuing education course enrollments, our total course enrollments in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 increased 17.2% year-over-year. In addition, even though the cash receipts from continuing education courses were down, we are pleased to report that our overall cash receipts from online course registration were up 25.4% year-over-year in our second fiscal quarter.\"\nMr. Zhu concluded, \"We credit the acceleration of net revenue and cash receipt growth during the first half of fiscal year 2018 to our best-in-class educational offerings, the strength of our brand, and the resiliency of our proven business model. We remain steadfast in our efforts to further enhance our industry-leading lifelong learning ecosystem, and aim to continue to grow our existing industry verticals while expanding into select educational disciplines which complement our overall business.\"\nMr. Mark Marostica, Co-Chief Financial Officer of CDEL, said, \"We are encouraged by our strong momentum in cash receipt growth. As expected, the year-over-year increase in salaries and related expenses in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, which stemmed from the acceleration in hiring activity ahead of fiscal 2018 as previously disclosed, continued to be the primary driver of the year-over-year decline in our second quarter operating margin. However, our second quarter headcount remained relatively stable compared with the first quarter fiscal 2018 as anticipated.\"\nMr. Marostica continued, \"Of note, the year-over-year decline in operating margin narrowed significantly in our second quarter fiscal 2018, compared with the year-over-year decline in operating margin in our first quarter fiscal 2018, owing to strong second quarter revenue growth, relatively stable headcount as previously discussed, and efficient cost control with respect to our second quarter selling expenses, which decreased by 1.1% compared with the same period of last year. As we head into our second half of fiscal year 2018, we will continue to balance investments in growth initiatives while maintaining a keen focus on profitability.\"\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nNet Revenue. Total net revenue increased by 36.1% to $29.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $21.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Net revenue from online education services, books and reference materials, and other sources contributed 78.6%, 4.7% and 16.7%, respectively, of total net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nOnline education services. Net revenue from online education services increased by 38.7% to $23.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $16.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly due to strong revenue growth from the core test preparation courses and practical skills training courses of our accounting vertical. In addition, the moderate revenue growth from our healthcare vertical also contributed to the revenue growth.\nBooks and reference materials. Net revenue from books and reference materials increased by 9.0% to $1.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, from $1.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOthers. Net revenue from other sources increased by 33.6% to $5.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $3.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to revenue growth from offline accounting professional training courses, and revenue from accounting and related advisory services contributed by our newly acquired Jiangsu Asset. The increase in revenue from other sources was partially offset by year-over-year decreases in revenue from the sale of learning simulation software and business start-up training services.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased by 58.3% to $18.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $11.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP 1 cost of sales increased by 58.7% to $18.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $11.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was mainly due to increased salaries and related expenses resulting from a higher number of personnel for the expansion of online and offline course offerings, increased lecture fees, increased cost of books and reference materials, increased rental and related expenses, as well as other miscellaneous expenses.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin . Gross profit was $11.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 10.0% from $10.1 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 gross profit was $11.1 million, increasing 9.8% from $10.1 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 37.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with 46.0% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP 1 gross margin was 37.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with 46.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased by 7.9% to $14.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, from $13.1 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 total operating expenses increased by 7.5% to $13.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, from $12.6 million in the prior year period.\nSelling expenses. Selling expenses decreased by 1.1% to $8.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $8.4 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 selling expenses decreased by 1.1% to $8.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $8.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased advertising and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by increased commissions to our agents.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 24.0% to $5.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $4.6 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 general and administrative expenses increased by 24.4% to $5.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $4.2 million in the prior year period. The increase was mainly due to increased salaries and related expenses.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Income tax benefit increased by 150.2% to $1.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $0.6 million in the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in taxable loss.\nNet Loss. As a result of the foregoing, net loss was $3.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with net loss of $2.4 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 net loss was $2.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with non-GAAP net loss of $1.9 million in the prior year period.\nOperating Cash Flow. Net operating cash inflow decreased by 36.1% to $7.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $11.3 million in the prior year period. The operating cash inflow was mainly attributable to the decrease in accounts receivable and inventories, and the increase in deferred revenue. The operating cash inflow was partially offset by the net loss before non-cash items incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in prepayments and other current assets, deferred tax assets, other non-current assets and the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and income tax payable also contributed to the operating cash outflow.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments as of March 31, 2018 decreased by 9.2% to $93.5 million from $103.0 million as of December 31, 2017, mainly due to (i) the payment of balance of $8.7 million in connection with investment in Beijing teacheredu, (ii) the payments of $3.5 million and $2.4 million in connection with investments in an offline IT training company and Beijing Taixing #1 LP, respectively, (iii) the repayment of a bank loan of $7.4 million, (iv) the payment of dividend of $14.9 million, and (v) the capital expenditure of $1.3 million. The decrease was partially offset by the operating cash inflow generated and a 1-year bank loan of $15.2 million raised in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nFirst Six Months of Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nNet Revenue. Total net revenue increased by 21.9% to $65.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 from $53.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017.

Among other things, the outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2018 and quotations from management in this announcement, as well as the Company's strategic and operational plans (in particular, the anticipated benefits of strategic growth initiatives, including the promotion of the Company's lifelong learning ecosystem, as well as cost control) contain forward-looking statements. The Company may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic and annual reports to the SEC, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: our goals and growth strategies; future prospects and market acceptance of our courses and other products and services; our future business development and results of operations; projected revenues, profits, earnings and other estimated financial information; projected enrollment numbers; our plans to expand and enhance our courses and other products and services; competition in the education and test preparation markets; and Chinese laws, regulations and policies, including those applicable to the Internet, Internet content providers, the education and telecommunications industries, mergers and acquisitions, taxation and foreign exchange.\nFurther information regarding these and other risks is included in the Company's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. All information provided in this press release is as of the date of this press release. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.\nStatement Regarding Unaudited Financial Information\nThe unaudited financial information set forth in this press release is preliminary and subject to adjustments. Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when audit work is performed for the year-end audit, which could result in significant differences from this preliminary unaudited financial information.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP net income, operating income, gross profit, cost of sales, selling expenses, general and administrative expenses, net income margin, operating margin, gross profit margin and basic and diluted earnings per ADS and per share. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures\" set forth at the end of this release.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based compensation expenses. However, non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the Company's operating performance from a cash perspective. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical performance and liquidity. The Company computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of excluding share-based compensation expenses from the above-mentioned line items and presenting these non-GAAP measures is that such items may continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying table at the end of this release provides more detail on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\nContacts:\nChina Distance Education Holdings Limited\nInvestor Relations Department\nTel: +86-10-8231-9999 ext. 1805\nEmail: IR@cdeledu.com\nThe Piacente Group | Investor Relations\nBrandi
