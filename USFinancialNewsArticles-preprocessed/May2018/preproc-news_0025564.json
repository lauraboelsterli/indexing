The use of any of the words \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"should\", \"believe\" and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions \"may\" or \"will\" occur are intended to identify forward-looking information. These statements are only predictions. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking information because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.

Certain risks relating to the integration and future performance of Medi-Green may also arise. Since forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by its very nature it involves inherent risks and uncertainties.
