    "text": "(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window)\nLONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday, boosted by some strong earnings updates and a rising tech sector after results from Apple exceeded weak expectations, while investors’ focus turned to euro zone GDP figures and the U.S. Fed meeting.\nShares in iPhone supplier ams jumped 8.1 percent after Apple surprised the market with solid iPhone X sales, flouncing investors’ expectations for a much weaker performance.\nOther chipmakers STMicroelectronics, Infineon , BE Semiconductor and ASML also gained 1.1 to 3.8 percent after the tech giant’s results helped sentiment on the sector.\nEurope’s tech sector rose 1.1 percent to a six-week high.\nIt helped the pan-European STOXX 600 climb 0.4 percent, reaching its highest level since Feb 5 in early deals as investors awaited GDP data for the euro zone at 0900 GMT, and the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting later in the day.\nBroadly strong earnings have helped the European index rise in recent weeks.\nOn Wednesday British satellite firm Inmarsat led the pack, jumping 10.9 percent after reporting stronger first-quarter revenue.\nShares in Swedish oil firm Lundin rose 4.7 percent after it became the latest European oil company to beat earnings expectations, helped by higher output.\nBritish online grocer Ocado was a top gainer, up 5.2 percent after it signed a partnership deal with Swedish grocer ICA to develop its online business.\nAmong results disappointments, Paddy Power Betfair was the worst-performing on the European index, down 6.3 percent after first-quarter earnings fell. The bookmaker also announced a 500 million pound share buyback programme.\nMining stocks gained 1.7 percent, providing the bedrock for Europe’s gains as copper prices recovered on strong China factory data.
