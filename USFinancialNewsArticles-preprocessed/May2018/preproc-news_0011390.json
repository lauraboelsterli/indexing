Through strong partnerships and customer service, the LifeLabs team is working each day to maintain Canadians’ trust. To sustain this, we must aspire to continuously improve and innovate for the benefit of the patients we serve,” Brown said. “LifeLabs has an impressive base of patients and healthcare partners, which presents exciting opportunities to find new and innovative solutions for improved health outcomes.”\nThe announcement is effective May 1st, 2018. Jon Hantho, Chair of LifeLabs Board of Directors, says Brown’s appointment comes at a pivotal and exciting time for the company.\n“On behalf of the entire LifeLabs organization, I warmly welcome Charles to his new role. LifeLabs is rapidly advancing its position as the leading diagnostics and health technology provider in Canada serving patients, physicians and healthcare partners, including more than 2.3 million Canadians who rely on us for online access to their testing results,” Hantho said. “We continue to make significant investments in medical and scientific innovations in areas such as genetic testing and digital health.
