    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE:TRQ) (TSX:TRQ) today announced its financial results for the 2018. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nOyu Tolgoi achieved a strong All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.21 per 200,000 hours worked for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nUnderground development achieved record-level monthly progress during Q1’18, with 2.6 equivalent kilometres completed during the quarter.\nIn March 2018, the underground team experienced their highest development month to date.\nSince the restart of development, a total of 10.3 equivalent kilometres of lateral development has been completed.\nSinking of Shaft 2 was completed in January 2018 and sinking of Shaft 5 was completed in March 2018.\nDuring Q1’18, underground expansion spend was $270.5 million, resulting in total project spend since January 1, 2016 of approximately $1.4 billion.\nProduction from first draw bell remains planned for mid-2020 and sustainable first production in 2021.\nDuring Q1’18, Oyu Tolgoi produced 38,800 tonnes of copper and 42,000 ounces of gold.\nRevenue of $245.6 million in Q1’18 increased 3.4% over Q1’17 reflecting higher copper and gold prices partly offset by lower concentrate sales volumes.\nFor Q1’18, the Company recorded income of $79.7 million and net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $85.7 million or $0.04 per share.\nTurquoise Hill generated cash flow from operating activities before interest and taxes of $14.7 million in Q1’18.\nFor Q1’18, Oyu Tolgoi’s cost of sales was $2.23 per pound of copper sold, C1 cash costs were $1.76 per pound of copper produced and all-in sustaining costs were $2.07 per pound of copper produced 1 .\nOperating cash costs 1 of $176.6 million in Q1’18 increased 4.9% over Q1’17 reflecting higher open pit and concentrator maintenance costs.\n1 Please refer to the NON-GAAP MEASURES section of this press release for further information.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nIncome in Q1’18 was $79.7 million compared with $29.7 million in Q1’17. The increase mainly reflects the impact of higher copper prices, reduced depreciation and depletion and lower finance costs due to higher amounts of interest capitalized to property, plant and equipment, partially offset by reduced sales volumes. Cash generated from operating activities in Q1’18 was $19.4 million compared with $86.3 million in Q1’17. This reduction was primarily driven by significant movements in working capital, partly offset by higher copper prices. Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment was $285.7 million on a cash basis in Q1’18 compared to $147.9 million in Q1’17, attributed principally to underground ($270.5 million) with the remainder related to open-pit capital activities.\nTurquoise Hill’s cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 were approximately $1.5 billion.\nOYU TOLGOI\nThe Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia’s capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Oyut deposit and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension).\nThe Oyu Tolgoi mine was initially developed as an open-pit operation. The copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure, was originally designed to process approximately 100,000 tonnes of ore per day from the Oyut open pit. However, since 2014, the concentrator has improved operating practices and gained experience, which has helped achieve a consistent throughput of over 110,000 tonnes per day. This continued through 2017 with softer ores from the Central zone. Due to increased processing of harder ore from Phase 4, concentrator throughput for 2018 is expected to be approximately 102,000 tonnes per day.\nIn August 2013, development of the underground mine was suspended pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia. Following signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan (Underground Plan) in May 2015 and the signing of a $4.4 billion project finance facility in December 2015, Oyu Tolgoi received formal notice to proceed approval by the boards of Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and Oyu Tolgoi LLC in May 2016, which was the final requirement for the re-start of underground development. Underground construction recommenced in May 2016.\nOyu Tolgoi is expected to be the world’s third-largest copper mine at peak metal production in 2025. Copper and gold production is expected to increase by more than 340% and 150% respectively between 2018 and 2025. Average copper and gold production from 2025 to 2030 is expected to be more than 550,000 tonnes of copper and over 450,000 ounces of gold per year.\nAt the end of Q1’18, Oyu Tolgoi had a total workforce, including underground project construction, of more than 14,000, of which 94% were Mongolian.\nUnderground development progress\nThe main focus of underground development for 2018 will be underground lateral development, the fit out of Shaft 2, completion and commissioning of Shaft 5, support infrastructure and the convey-to-surface decline. In January 2018, the Company announced the sinking of Shaft 2 was complete. Additionally, earthworks for Shafts 3 and 4 commenced during Q1’18 and the sinking award package is expected to occur in Q2’18. The Company continues to expect the first draw bell in mid-2020 and sustainable first production in 2021.\nDuring Q4’17, Rio Tinto undertook a schedule and cost review. Rio Tinto has provided Turquoise Hill with a high-level overview of the review’s outcomes, in which Rio Tinto concluded there were no material changes in project scope, cost or schedule.\nOyu Tolgoi spent $270.5 million on underground expansion during Q1’18. Total underground project spend from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018 was approximately $1.4 billion. In addition, Oyu Tolgoi had further capital commitments 2 of $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2018. At the end of Q1’18, the underground project had committed 62% of direct project contracts and procurement packages, of which 71% were to Mongolian companies. Since the restart of project development, Oyu Tolgoi has committed almost $1.6 billion to Mongolian vendors and contractors.\n2 Please refer to the NON-GAAP MEASURES section of this press release for further information.\nUnderground lateral development achieved record-level monthly progress during Q1’18, with 2.6 equivalent kilometres completed during the quarter. The underground team experienced their highest development month to date in March. Since the re-start of development, a total of 10.3 equivalent kilometres of lateral development has been completed. During 2018, underground development is expected to advance approximately 10.0 kilometres. The following table provides a breakdown of the various components of completed lateral development since project restart:\nYear Total\nEquivalent\nKilometres Lateral\nDevelopment\n(kilometres) Mass\nExcavation\n(’000 metres 3 ) 2016 1.6 1.5 3.0 Q1’17 1.0 0.8 5.2 Q2’17 1.4 0.9 9.2 Q3’17 1.4 1.2 8.3 Q4’17 2.2 1.9 8.9 2017 6.1 4.8 31.6 Q1’18 2.6 2.1 11.6 Total 10.3 8.4 46.2 Shaft 2 sinking was completed in January 2018. Structural steel installation commenced during Q1’18 at the 1,202 metre level and equipping of the shaft is ongoing. Fit out of Shaft 2 is expected to occur throughout 2018. Shaft 2 is a key part of future increases in lateral development activity.\nSinking of Shaft 5 was completed in March 2018. During Q1’18, installation of the shaft’s three exhaust fans was mechanically complete and commissioning underway. Shaft 5 will be dedicated to ventilation thereby increasing the capacity for underground activities.\nThe following table outlines the status of shafts for underground development as of March 31, 2018.\nShaft 1\n(early development\nand ventilation) Shaft 2\n(production and ventilation) Shaft 5\n(ventilation) Shaft 3\n(ventilation) Shaft 4\n(ventilation) Total Depth 1,385 metres 1,284 metres 1,178 metres 1,148 metres 1,149 metres Diameter 6.7 metres 10 metres 6.7 metres 10 metres 11 metres Completion 2008 Q1’18 Q1’18 Expected 2021 Expected 2021 Remaining Complete Complete Complete Not started Not started During Q1’18, advancement of the convey-to-surface decline continued to progress. The convey-to-surface system is the eventual route of the full 95,000 tonne per day underground ore delivery system to the concentrator; however, it is not a critical path item for first draw bell planned in mid-2020. Expected completion of the convey-to-surface system is 2022, which will facilitate the ramp up to full production by 2027.\nSupporting infrastructure continued to progress during Q1’18. Construction of the new camp was more than 75% complete at the end of Q1’18, including completion and occupancy of eight buildings. Two additional buildings were approved for occupancy by the state commissioning authorities at the end of the quarter.\nSafety performance\nSafety is a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi’s operations and the mine’s management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a strong All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.21 per 200,000 hours worked for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1’18 open-pit operations performance\nKey financial metrics for Q1’18 are as follows:\nOyu Tolgoi Key Financial Metrics (1)\n($ in millions, unless otherwise noted) 1Q\n2017 2Q\n2017 3Q\n2017 4Q\n2017 1Q\n2018 Full Year\n2017 Revenue 237.5 203.7 246.9 251.7 245.6 939.8 Revenue by metals in concentrates Copper 196.6 173.7 209.2 216.1 202.1 795.6 Gold 37.5 26.6 34.2 32.5 40.3 130.8 Silver 3.4 3.3 3.5 3.2 3.2 13.4 Cost of sales 194.4 188.9 197.8 182.7 168.9 763.8 Production and delivery costs 120.7 117.7 123.4 106.6 114.6 468.4 Depreciation and depletion 78.3 75.0 77.4 73.4 55.6 304.1 Capital expenditure on cash basis 147.9 205.2 234.0 330.4 285.7 917.5 Underground 136.4 184.7 205.6 309.0 270.5 835.7 Open pit (2) 11.5 20.5 28.4 21.4 15.2 81.8 Royalties 14.3 12.5 14.5 15.8 14.9 57.1 Operating cash costs (3) 168.4 163.6 161.9 217.7 176.6 711.6 Unit costs ($) Cost of sales (per pound of copper sold) 2.23 2.30 2.43 2.32 2.23 2.32 C1 (per pound of copper produced) (3) 1.85 1.92 1.83 2.05 1.76 1.92 All-in sustaining (per pound of copper produced) (3) 2.15 2.27 2.76 2.40 2.07 2.39 (1) Any financial information in this press release should be reviewed in conjunction with the Company‘s consolidated financial statements or condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the reporting periods indicated.\n(2) Open-pit capital expenditure includes both sustaining and non-underground development activities.\n(3) Please refer to the NON-GAAP MEASURES section of this press release for further information.\nRevenue of $245.6 million in Q1’18 increased 3.4% over Q1’17 reflecting higher copper and gold prices partly offset by lower concentrate sales volumes.\nCost of sales for Q1’18 was $168.9 million compared to $194.4 million in Q1’17 reflecting lower volumes of concentrates sold and reduced depreciation and depletion due to certain long-lived assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives.\nCapital expenditure on a cash basis for Q1’18 was $285.7 million compared to $147.9 million in Q1’17, comprising amounts attributed to the underground project and open-pit activities of $270.5 million and $15.2 million respectively.\nTotal operating cash costs 3 at Oyu Tolgoi was $176.6 million in Q1’18 compared to $168.4 million in Q1’17 mainly due to higher open pit and concentrator maintenance costs. Operating cash costs include the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia and exclude deferred stripping costs.\nCost of sales was $2.23 per pound of copper sold in Q1’18 consistent with $2.23 per pound of copper sold in Q1’17.\nOyu Tolgoi’s C1 cash costs 3 in Q1’18 were $1.76 per pound of copper produced, a decrease from $1.85 per pound of copper produced in Q1’17, due primarily to lower realization costs and higher gold sales.\nAll-in sustaining costs 3 in Q1’18 were $2.07 per pound of copper produced, compared with $2.15 per pound of copper produced in Q1’17, with key drivers being the same as for C1 cash costs per pound of copper produced.\n3 Please refer to the NON-GAAP MEASURES section of this press release for further information.\nKey operational metrics for Q1’18 are as follows:\nOyu Tolgoi Production Data\nAll data represents full production and sales on a 100% basis\n1Q\n2017 2Q\n2017 3Q\n2017 4Q\n2017 1Q\n2018 Full Year\n2017 Open pit material mined (‘000 tonnes) 24,333 25,193 27,466 28,929 23,131 105,921 Ore treated (‘000 tonnes) 10,087 9,637 10,615 10,838 9,561 41,177 Average mill head grades: Copper (%) 0.51 0.51 0.48 0.53 0.51 0.51 Gold (g/t) 0.15 0.16 0.18 0.20 0.25 0.17 Silver (g/t) 1.30 1.38 1.34 1.54 1.32 1.39 Concentrates produced (‘000 tonnes) 176.0 171.0 170.0 205.4 177.3 722.5 Average concentrate grade (% Cu) 21.6 21.8 21.7 22.0 21.9 21.8 Production of metals in concentrates: Copper (‘000 tonnes) 38.1 37.2 36.9 45.3 38.8 157.4 Gold (‘000 ounces) 25 24 31 35 42 114 Silver (‘000 ounces) 215 236 239 285 221 974 Concentrates sold (‘000 tonnes) 190.2 182.0 176.6 175.5 163.1 724.3 Sales of metals in concentrates: Copper (‘000 tonnes) 39.5 37.3 36.9 35.7 34.3 149.3 Gold (‘000 ounces) 32 23 29 27 31 111 Silver (‘000 ounces) 205 222 229 205 206 860 Metal recovery (%) Copper 74.9 74.6 73.5 78.0 79.5 75.4 Gold 48.8 47.7 51.2 50.5 55.0 49.7 Silver 51.8 53.9 52.8 53.0 54.6 52.9 Oyu Tolgoi’s first quarter production was in line with expectations. Material mined decreased 20.0% over Q4’17 due to winter weather effects in January as well as dig-unit maintenance work during the quarter. Mill throughput decreased 11.8% over Q4’17 due to the January planned maintenance. Copper production in Q1’18 decreased 14.3% over Q4’17 mainly due to lower throughput and slightly lower grades. Gold production increased 20.0% over Q4’17 due to higher gold grades from Phase 4A and an increase in recovery.\nOperational outlook\nOyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 125,000 to 155,000 tonnes of copper and 240,000 to 280,000 ounces of gold in concentrates for 2018. Open-pit operations are expected to mine in Phase 6 in early 2018 and Phase 4 throughout the year. In addition, stockpiled ore will be processed during 2018. The increased gold production relative to the 2016 technical report is due to splitting Phase 4 into two parts (4A and 4B) and bringing production forward from future years.\nOyu Tolgoi tax assessment\nOn January 16, 2018, Turquoise Hill announced that Oyu Tolgoi had received and was evaluating a tax assessment for approximately $155 million from the Mongolian Tax Authority (the MTA) relating to an audit on taxes imposed and paid by Oyu Tolgoi LLC between 2013 and 2015. In January 2018, Oyu Tolgoi paid an amount of approximately $5.0 million to settle unpaid taxes, fines and penalties for accepted items.\nFollowing engagement with the MTA, Oyu Tolgoi was advised that the MTA could not resolve Oyu Tolgoi’s objections to the tax assessment. Accordingly, on March 15, 2018, Oyu Tolgoi issued a notice of dispute to the Government of Mongolia under the 2009 Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement (Investment Agreement) and on April 13, 2018, Oyu Tolgoi submitted a claim to the Mongolian Administrative Court. Chapter 14 of the Investment Agreement sets out a dispute resolution process. The issuance of a notice of dispute is the first step in the dispute resolution process and includes a 60-working-day negotiation period. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution during the 60-working-day period, the dispute can be referred to international arbitration.\nTurquoise Hill is of the opinion that Oyu Tolgoi has now paid all taxes and charges required under the Investment Agreement, the Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement (ARSHA), the Underground Plan and Mongolian law.\nForce majeure declaration\nOn January 17, 2018, Oyu Tolgoi declared force majeure in connection to customer contracts for concentrate due to protestors using a large number of vehicles to obstruct the main access road within China at the Ganqimaodu Border Zone. The border crossing for goods and supplies remained open. The placement of protestors’ vehicles prevented any traffic from safely traversing the border, both inbound and outbound.\nOn January 18, 2018, the blockade was lifted and the border reopened and on January 19, 2018, Oyu Tolgoi concentrate convoys recommenced crossing the border. Due to ongoing border congestion, a waiting period was required for border traffic to return to pre-blockade levels. In order to lift force majeure, a period of consistent convoy crossings was required reconfirming a stable concentrate supply chain.\nEffective March 1, 2018, Oyu Tolgoi lifted force majeure notice to customers. Safe and normal operations, including underground development, were maintained during the force majeure period, and no production impact is expected. Turquoise Hill expects any force majeure-related sales impact to be made up over the next few quarters.\nOyu Tolgoi power supply\nOn May 12, 2017, Oyu Tolgoi LLC signed a new power purchase agreement (PPA) with the National Power Transmission Grid (NPTG) of Mongolia. The PPA was executed in connection with the power import arrangement between NPTG and the Inner Mongolia Power International Corporation (IMPIC). The new arrangement took effect on July 4, 2017, subsequent to the expiry of the existing IMPIC agreement, for a term of up to six years, with possibility of early cancellation after the fourth year, if a domestic power plant is commissioned earlier. The extension is essential for Oyu Tolgoi to have secure access to power while it works with the Government of Mongolia on establishing a permanent domestic power source.\nOn February 15, 2018, Oyu Tolgoi received notification that the Government of Mongolia (Government) had cancelled the Power Sector Cooperation Agreement (PSCA), which was signed in August 2014. The Government’s cancellation, under Section 1.3 of the PSCA, indicated the Tavan Tolgoi power project was no longer a viable option. As a result of the Government’s cancellation, effective February 15, 2018, long-term power for Oyu Tolgoi must be domestically sourced within four years, in accordance with the Investment Agreement. Oyu Tolgoi, Turquoise Hill and Rio Tinto are committed to fulfilling all requirements under the Investment Agreement and are continuing to evaluate all viable power options, including construction of an Oyu Tolgoi based power plant. A final decision on the outcome, cost and financing of a domestic power supply has not been concluded.\nFunding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill\nIn accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi’s cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt.\nFor amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. As of March 31, 2018, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $4.1 billion, including accrued interest of $0.4 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%.\nIn accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes’ share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As of March 31, 2018, the cumulative amount of such funding was $0.9 billion, representing 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $0.4 billion.\nAnti-Corruption Authority Information Requests\nOyu Tolgoi LLC has received information requests from the Mongolian Anti-Corruption Authority (ACA) for information relating to Oyu Tolgoi. Turquoise Hill has inquired as to the status of the investigation and Oyu Tolgoi has confirmed that it is complying with the requests, which Turquoise Hill believes relates to an ACA investigation into possible abuses of power by certain Government of Mongolia officials in relation to the Oyu Tolgoi project. To date, neither Turquoise Hill nor Oyu Tolgoi have received notice from the ACA, or indeed from any regulator, that they are subjects of any investigation involving the Oyu Tolgoi project.\nThe Investment Agreement was authorized by the Mongolian Parliament, concluded after 16 months of negotiations and reviewed by numerous constituencies within the Mongolian Government. Turquoise Hill has been operating in good faith under the terms of the Investment Agreement since 2009, and we believe not only that it is a valid and binding agreement, but that it has proven to be beneficial for all parties.\nAdherence to the principles of the Investment Agreement has allowed for the development of Oyu Tolgoi in a manner that has given rise to significant long-term benefits to Mongolia. Benefits from Oyu Tolgoi’s open-pit operations and underground development include, but are not limited to, employment, royalties and taxes, local procurement, economic development and sustainability investments.\nCORPORATE ACTIVITIES\nLetter to shareholders\nOn March 14, 2018, the Board of Directors of Turquoise Hill Resources issued a letter to shareholders regarding a meeting between members of Turquoise Hill’s board of directors and representatives of SailingStone Capital Partners (SailingStone). The meeting followed a publicly-filed letter by SailingStone on February 1, 2018 in which it raised corporate governance concerns.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nThe Company presents and refers to the following non-GAAP measures, which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of each measure is given below and may differ from similarly named measures provided by other issuers. These measures are presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders with additional understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi and are not intended to be used in isolation from, or as a replacement for, measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nOperating cash costs\nThe measure of operating cash costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory) and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nC1 cash costs\nC1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company’s principal metal product, copper, to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers net of gold and silver credits from concentrates sold. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders with additional information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of gold and silver credits on the operations’ cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company’s operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company deducts gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these products.\nAll-in sustaining costs\nAll-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash-based cost metric providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company’s principal metal product, copper, in both the short term and over the life-cycle of its operations; as a result, sustaining capital expenditure on a cash basis is included rather than depreciation. As the measure seeks to present a full cost of copper production associated with sustaining current operations, development project capital is not included.
