GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Rhetoric over U.S. exit from Iran deal rises amid threat of sanctions The United States threatened on Sunday to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran, as the remaining participants in the Iran nuclear accord stiffened their resolve to keep that agreement operational. • Xerox says it is ending Fujifilm deal, settles with Icahn, Deason Xerox said on Sunday it was ending a planned $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm Holdings and had reached a settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason. • Family of IS-inspired suicide bombers attack Indonesian churches, at least 13 dead A family of six launched suicide attacks on Christians attending Sunday services at three churches in Indonesia's second-largest city of Surabaya, killing at least 13 people and wounding 40, officials said. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading down 0.1 percent at 10,816.00 • The Indian rupee is expected to open marginally higher against the U.S. currency after the dollar index declined to a one-week low and crude oil pulled back from multiyear highs. • Indian government bonds are likely to trade little changed ahead of release of inflation data for April after market today. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.70 percent-7.75 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • The S&P 500 rose on Friday, helped by healthcare stocks after President Donald Trump blasted high drug prices but avoided taking aggressive measures to cut them. • Asian shares shot up to near two-month highs on signs the United States and China were toning down their trade war rhetoric, while Malaysian Ringgit hit a four-month trough in the first onshore trade since a shock election result last week. • The dollar held steady, its recent rally running out of steam on the back of sagging U.S. yields as investors wound back expectations that the Federal Reserve will launch a series of quick rate hikes. • The Treasury yield curve on Friday was the flattest it had been since July 2007 as shorter-dated yields rose on expectations the Federal Reserve would hike U.S. interest rates in spite of weaker-than-expected economic data this week. • Oil prices fell away from last week's multi-year highs as a relentless rise in U.S. drilling activity pointed to increased output, while resistance emerged in Europe and Asia to U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran. • Gold prices rose on the back of a subdued dollar as investors considered the prospects of slower interest rate hikes in the United States.
