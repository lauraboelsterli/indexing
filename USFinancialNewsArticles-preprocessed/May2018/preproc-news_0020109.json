    "text": "ST. LOUIS, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) (\"Centene\" or the \"Company\") announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Centene Escrow I Corporation (the \"Escrow Issuer\"), commenced an offering to sell $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 (the \"Notes\"), subject to market and other conditions.\nCentene intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with Centene's previously announced acquisition of the assets of Fidelis Care, to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. The acquisition is expected to close on or about July 1, 2018, subject to regulatory approval from the New York Attorney General and certain closing conditions. Upon consummation of the acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation, and the Company will assume all of the Escrow Issuer's obligations under the Notes, the related indenture and the other applicable documents by operation of law. The closing of this offering is not conditioned on the closing of the acquisition. If the acquisition is not consummated, the Escrow Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\nThe Notes will be offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and outside the United States to non-United States persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration, qualification or exemption under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nAbout Centene Corporation\nCentene Corporation, a Fortune 100 company, is a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals.
