Europe shakes global markets , the euro falls against the dollar and government bond yields in Italy and Spain rocket higher.\nIn a lot of respects, we’ve been here before. The euro was at the heart of repeated financial market meltdowns earlier this decade, exacerbated by high levels of debt, bank runs and bailouts and sclerotic economies.\nItaly’s political crisis this week revived simmering concerns about the future of the common currency in an era of populist politicians, rising euroscepticism and diverging economies. This time isn’t exactly the same as before, but there are lots of reasons to dust off the history books.\nWhat’s Happening in Italy? On Sunday, Italian President Sergio Mattarella blocked the formation of a euroskeptic coalition government. Photo: italy photo press/Zuma Press On Sunday, Italian President Sergio Mattarella blocked the formation of a euroskeptic coalition government consisting of the antiestablishment 5 Star Movement and League parties, which have flirted openly with the idea of pulling Italy from the common currency. Analysts expect the turmoil to lead to new elections, most probably in the fall.\nWith investors worrying a new vote could strengthen the hand of anti-eurozone forces, the country’s two-year bond , which offered a negative yield as recently as two weeks ago, exploded to as high as 2.69% Tuesday. Italian stocks slipped and the euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar since July 2017.\nWhat’s at Stake for the Eurozone? A fracturing of the common currency, though still unlikely at this stage, would be a calamitous event for financial markets. A new election in Italy is expected to become a de facto referendum on the country’s membership of the euro.\nIf one country exits the currency area, others could quickly follow as levels of euroscepticism have risen on the continent in the past decade. Widespread capital controls would be needed to prevent destabilizing rushes of money from countries deemed likely to have a weak posteuro currency to those expected to have a strong one. Huge swaths of financial plumbing, including derivatives markets and common banking systems, would need to be disaggregated.\nOf Debts and Bailouts At the turn of the decade, a crisis in a few highly indebted small economies—Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain—turned into a threat to the survival of Europe’s common currency and a menace to the global economy. Austerity plans in Greece sparked strikes and riots in the streets.\nIn 2010, eurozone member countries set aside deep resistance to paying for each others’ debts and bailed out Greece and then Ireland. The next year came Portugal. And in following years, Spain, for its banks, and Cyprus.\nThe euro shed more than a fifth of its value in 2010. But markets felt the bailouts weren’t durable. The euro plunged again in 2011 as fears spread that troubles in smaller Spain and Portugal would spread to much larger Italy. Italy’s 10-year bond yield spiked above 7%, too expensive for the highly indebted nation to afford.\nWhatever It Takes In 2012 came an inflection point. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, in a now famous speech in July that year, said that “within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro and believe me: It will be enough.”\nIt was. The speech showed the ECB meant business and soon after it began buying unlimited eurozone government bonds from investors to reduce their yields. The reaction in eurozone government bond markets was rapid. Yields on the bonds of the most-fragile economies began to fall: Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields dropped 1.5 percentage points over the rest of 2012.\nGrexit? Fears about the euro flared up again in 2015 as the left-wing Syriza party took control of Greece amid rumblings about a return to the drachma. In the summer, voters overwhelmingly rejected European Union bailout terms in a referendum, while clashes raged in the streets.\nGreece defaulted on some of its debt, had to stomach capital controls and violent protests in central Athens. Later that year, Greece agreed to a third bailout, worth €86 billion ($100 billion), which imposed further spending cuts on the country.\nThe euro dropped to multiyear lows in 2015 and flirted with parity against the U.S. dollar a year later.\nWhat’s Changed Since The fear that chaos created by even one country’s exit proved to be a powerful glue holding the eurozone together during its debt crisis. Since then, there has been a flurry of changes meant to bind it still tighter, most notably, closer and more consistent supervision of banks and tougher fiscal rules, though these remain unfinished projects.\nGreece is also finally within striking distance of freeing itself from the burden of bailouts , the latest of which expires in August.\nWrite to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com\nMore on Italy’s Tumult\nUncertainty in Italy and Spain Roils Markets Analysis: Markets Are Flying Red Flags Italy’s Political Drama Raises Stakes for Euro Italy in Turmoil as New Government Fails to Form Italy Sparks Global Fear of Fresh Euro Crisis Analysis: Bank Investors Fear Return of European Doom Loop Italy Fears Rattle World’s Investors (Nov. 10, 2011)",
