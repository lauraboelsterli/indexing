    "text": "First Quarter\nTotal revenue of $2.20 billion Achieved sequential growth in consumer revenue Broadband trends improved sequentially The first quarter of positive CTF FiOS ® broadband net additions since acquisition Net income of $20 million Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $908 million\nNORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:FTR) today reported financial 2018.\n“In the first quarter we achieved growth in consumer revenue, reflecting the early results of the substantial initiatives we have underway across the company,” said Dan McCarthy, President and CEO. “We are also extremely pleased with the continued improvement in subscriber trends in our California, Texas and Florida (CTF) markets, most notably that we have achieved our first quarter of positive FiOS broadband net additions. We also have begun to improve the trends in the Legacy markets. The entire Frontier team remains focused on continuing to enhance the customer experience, achieving further improvements in churn, maintaining strong cash flow, and strengthening the balance sheet. We are very confident that we have the opportunity for sustained growth in consumer, and improvement in commercial.”\nConsolidated Results\nThe Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method effective January 1, 2018. The table below reflects the quarter under ASC 606, as well as what the first quarter results would have been under ASC 605, the prior accounting standard. For comparison, we have also included our fourth quarter results as reported under ASC 605.\n1 See “Non-GAAP Measures” for a description of this measure and its calculation. See Schedule A for a reconciliation to net income/(loss).\n$ in millions (except ARPC) Q1 2018 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 As Reported Excluding As Reported (Under ASC 606) Adoption (Under ASC 605) of ASC 606 Revenue Consumer $ 1,128 $ 1,089 $ 1,086 Commercial 974 917 941 Subsidy and Other Regulatory Revenue 97 187 190 Total Revenue $ 2,199 $ 2,193 $ 2,217 Data & Internet Services 985 942 939 Voice Services 702 670 687 Video Services 280 309 310 Other 135 85 91 Total Customer Revenue 2,102 2,006 2,027 Subsidy and Other Regulatory Revenue 97 187 190 Total Revenue $ 2,199 $ 2,193 $ 2,217 Net Income/(Loss) $ 20 $ 14 $ (1,029 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 908 $ 901 $ 919 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 41.3 % 41.1 % 41.5 % Consumer ARPC $ 86.21 $ 83.26 $ 81.61 Consolidated revenue for the first quarter 2018 was $2.20 billion. Within consolidated revenue, consumer revenue was $1.13 billion, commercial revenue was $974 million and subsidy and other regulatory revenue was $97 million. For the fourth quarter 2017, consolidated revenue was $2.22 billion, consumer revenue was $1.09 billion, commercial revenue was $941 million and subsidy and other regulatory revenue was $190 million.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $20 million. Net loss for the first quarter attributable to common shares was $(33) million, for a diluted net loss per common share of $(0.44). Adjusted EBITDA totaled $908 million, for an adjusted EBITDA margin 2 of 41.3%. For the fourth quarter of 2017, net loss was $(1.03) billion. Net loss for the fourth quarter attributable to common shares was $(1.08) billion, for a diluted net loss per common share of $(13.91). Adjusted EBITDA totaled $919 million for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41.5%.\n2 See Note 1, above. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure of performance, calculated as adjusted EBITDA, divided by total revenue. See “Non-GAAP Measures” for a description of this measure and its calculation. See Schedule A for a reconciliation to net loss.\nAs of the end of the first quarter, the Company had attained approximately $275 million in annualized cost synergies, and the Company remains on track to achieve its target of $350 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies by mid-2018.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net cash provided from operating activities was $251 million and operating free cash flow 3 was $(46) million, which reflects cash interest payments of $593 million, or 40% of the $1.5 billion expected annual cash interest expense. Over the four-quarter period ending March 31, 2018, net cash provided from operating activities was $1,801 million and operating free cash flow was $632 million.\nConsumer Business Highlights\nRevenue was $1.13 billion; the improved trend was driven by improved product mix and better base management. Customer churn improved to 1.94% (1.71% for Legacy and 2.30% for CTF operations). Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC) of $86.21.\nCommercial Business Highlights\nRevenue of $974 million. Excluding the impact of ASC 606, the commercial revenue decline was caused by the Small, Medium, and Enterprise (SME) portion of the business. Total commercial customers of 441,000 compared to 453,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017. Carrier/wholesale revenue was roughly stable sequentially.\nCapital Structure and Capital Allocation\nIn January 2018, Frontier amended its credit facilities to provide increased flexibility in managing its capital structure. In March 2018, Frontier issued $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Secured Notes due 2026. Frontier used the proceeds and cash on hand to repurchase $1.65 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2020 and 2021. As of March 31, 2018, Frontier’s leverage ratio (as calculated in accordance with its credit agreements) was 4.77:1. The leverage ratio was 4.59:1 as of December 31, 2017. The Board of Directors has declared a regular and final quarterly dividend on the Convertible Preferred of $2.78125 per share, payable in cash on June 29, 2018 to holders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2018. The Convertible Preferred will convert to common stock on June 29, 2018. Frontier remains committed to reducing debt and improving its financial leverage profile.\n3 Operating free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity derived from net cash provided from operating activities. See “Non-GAAP Measures” for a description of this measure and its calculation and Schedules A for a reconciliation to net cash provided from operating activities.\nGuidance\nGuidance for 2018 remains unchanged.\nAdjusted EBITDA – Approximately $3.6 billion Capital expenditures – $1.0 billion to $1.15 billion Cash taxes – Less than $25 million Cash pension/OPEB – Approximately $150 million Cash interest expense – Approximately $1.5 billion for the full year; second quarter cash interest payments of approximately $150 million Operating free cash flow – Approximately $800 million\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFrontier uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance, including EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, operating free cash flow, and adjusted operating expenses, each of which is described below. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to (i) assist in analyzing Frontier's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iii) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (iv) assist in the understanding of Frontier's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Frontier’s financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures (i) provide a more comprehensive view of Frontier’s core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation, and planning decisions and (iii) present measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing Frontier and its results of operations.\nA reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the accompanying tables. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP, nor are they alternatives to GAAP measures and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) less income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, investment and other income, pension settlement costs, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by total revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, as described above, adjusted to exclude acquisition and integration costs, certain pension/OPEB expenses, restructuring costs and other charges, stock-based compensation expense, goodwill impairment charges, and certain other non-recurring items (e.g., storm-related costs and work stoppage costs). Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by total revenue.\nManagement uses EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to assist it in comparing performance from period to period and as measures of operational performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors in evaluating Frontier’s operational performance from period to period because they exclude depreciation and amortization expenses related to investments made in prior periods and are determined without regard to capital structure or investment activities. By excluding capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends, among other factors, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. Management compensates for these shortcomings by utilizing these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted net income (loss) attributable to Frontier common shareholders is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Frontier common shareholders and excludes acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs and other charges, pension settlement costs, goodwill impairment charges, certain income tax items and the income tax effect of these items, and certain non-recurring items (e.g., storm-related costs and work stoppage costs). Adjusting for these items allows investors to better understand and analyze Frontier’s financial performance over the periods presented.\nManagement defines operating free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, as net cash provided from operating activities less capital expenditures. Management uses operating free cash flow to assist it in comparing liquidity from period to period and to obtain a more comprehensive view of Frontier’s core operations and ability to generate cash flow. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating cash available to service debt and pay dividends. This non-GAAP financial measure has certain shortcomings; it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as items such as debt repayments and preferred stock dividends are not deducted in determining such measure. Management compensates for these shortcomings by utilizing this non-GAAP financial measure in conjunction with the comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted operating expenses is defined as operating expenses adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, acquisition and integration costs, goodwill impairment charges, certain pension/OPEB expenses, stock-based compensation expense, one-time storm-related and work stoppage costs, and restructuring costs and other charges. Investors have indicated that this non-GAAP measure is useful in evaluating Frontier’s performance.\nThe information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in Frontier’s documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nConference Call and Webcast\nFrontier will host a conference call today at 4:30 P.M.

To provide comparability to our results, we provide a supplemental schedule (see Schedule D) which contains certain financial information on a pre adoption of ASC 606 basis. (2) Effective January 1, 2018, Frontier adopted ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” The standard requires certain benefit costs to be reclassified from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. This change in policy was applied using a retrospective approach and accordingly we have reclassified $1 million and $3 million of net operating expenses as non-operating expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Additional pension settlement costs of $6 million and $43 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively, were reclassified from operating expense to non-operating expense.

Additional pension settlement costs of $6 million and $43 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 , respectively, were reclassified from operating expense to non-operating expense. SCHEDULE D Comparability Disclaimer: We adopted Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)” on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective application. This method does not impact the prior periods, which continue to reflect the accounting treatment prior to the adoption of ASC 606. As a result, for items that were affected by our adoption of ASC 606, financial results of periods prior to January 1, 2018 are not comparable to the current period financial results. To provide comparability to our results, we provide the following supplemental schedule which contains certain financial information on a pre adoption of ASC 606 basis.\nFrontier Communications Corporation Consolidated Financial Data For the three months ended March 31, 2018 Impact Amounts Excluding Adoption of Adoption of As reported ($ in millions)\nAs reported ASC 606 ASC 606 December 31, 2017 Selected Statement of Operations Data Revenue: Data and Internet services $ 985 $ (43 ) $ 942 $ 939 Voice services 702 (32 ) 670 687 Video services 280 29 309 310 Other 135 (50 ) 85 91 Revenue from contracts with customers 2,102 (96 ) 2,006 2,027 Subsidy and other regulatory revenue 97 90 187 190 Total revenue $ 2,199 $ (6 ) $ 2,193 $ 2,217 Other Revenue Data Revenue: Consumer $ 1,128 $ (39 ) $ 1,089 $ 1,086 Commercial 974 (57 ) 917 941 Revenue from contracts Revenue from contracts with customers 2,102 (96 ) 2,006 2,027 Subsidy and other regulatory revenue 97 90 187 190 Total revenue $ 2,199 $ (6 ) $ 2,193 $ 2,217 For the three months ended March 31, 2018 Impact of Amounts Excluding Adoption of Adoption of As reported ($ in millions)\nAs reported ASC 606 ASC 606 December 31, 2017 Statement of Operations Data Revenue $ 2,199 $ (6 ) $ 2,193 $ 2,217 Operating expenses: Network access expenses 372 (3 ) 369 388 Network related expenses 483 - 483 491 Selling, general and administrative expenses 469 4 473 456 Depreciation and amortization 505 - 505 514 Goodwill impairment - - - 2,078 Acquisition and integration costs - - - 10 Restructuring costs and other charges 4 - 4 27 Total operating expenses 1,833 1 1,834 3,964 Operating income (loss) 366 (7 ) 359 (1,747 ) Investment and other income (loss), net 8 - 8 (3 ) Pension settlement costs - - - 6 Gain on extinguishment of debt 33 - 33 1 Interest expense 374 - 374 377 Income (loss) before income taxes 33 (7 ) 26 (2,132 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 13 (1 ) 12 (1,103 ) Net Income (loss) 20 (6 ) 14 (1,029 ) Less: Dividends on preferred stock 53 - 53 53 Net loss attributable to Frontier common shareholders\n$ (33 ) $ (6 ) $ (39 ) $ (1,082 ) Other financial data: Consumer ARPC $ 86.21 $ 2.95 $ 83.26 $ 81.61\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006707/en/\nFrontier Communications Corporation\nInvestors:\nLuke Szymczak, 203-614-5044\nVP, Investor Relations\nluke.szymczak@ftr.com\nor\nMedia:\nBrigid Smith, 203-614-5042\nAVP, Corporate Communications\nbrigid.smith@ftr.com\nSource: Frontier Communications Corporation",
