    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 6:03 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Big-hitting Shapovalov denies Paire birthday win in Madrid Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMADRID (Reuters) - Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov produced a relentless display of big-hitting to deny France’s Benoit Paire the perfect 29th birthday present with a 7-6(5) 4-6 6-4 victory in the second round of the Madrid Open on Tuesday. Tennis - ATP - Monte Carlo Masters - Monte-Carlo Country Club, Monte Carlo, Monaco - April 16, 2018 Canada’s Denis Shapovalov in action against Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece during the first round REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\nWorld number 43 Shapovalov struck 38 winners, including 18 on his forehand, to seal victory in just over two hours.\nThe 19-year-old will next face compatriot Milos Raonic or third seed Grigor Dimitrov in the last 16 on Thursday.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Croatia’s Borna Coric upset ninth seed Pablo Carreno Busta 6-4 6-2 in the opening round.\nCoric fought back from 4-3 down to win five straight games en route to a second straight victory over the Spaniard, who he also beat at the Qatar Open earlier this year.\nCoric was leading 5-2 in the second set when heavy rain interrupted play at Caja Magica, and after a 40 minute delay he returned to complete his 16th match win of the season.\nDutchman Robin Haase snapped a four-match losing streak to record the 200th match win of his career, defeating South Korean Chung Hyeon 6-2 6-0 in the other first round match.
