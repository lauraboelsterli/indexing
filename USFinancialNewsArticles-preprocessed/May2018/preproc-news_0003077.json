    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 8:25 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Pandora Media reports smaller-than-expected quarterly loss Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Compares with estimates, adds shares)\nMay 3 (Reuters) - Pandora Media Inc reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as the music streaming service provider benefited from higher subscription revenue.\nShares of the Oakland, California-based company rose 7.8 percent to $6.21 after the bell.\nThe company said total subscription and other revenue surged 61.3 percent to $104.7 million, slightly above analysts’ estimate of $104.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPandora’s advertising revenue fell 3.9 percent to $214.6 million, but topped analysts’ estimate of $198.7 million.\nThe company faces stiff competition from deep-pocketed music streaming rivals such as Apple Inc’s Apple Music and Sweden’s Spotify Technology SA, whose results on Wednesday failed to enthuse investors.\nNet loss available to common stockholders widened to $139.1 million, or 55 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $132.3 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Pandora posted a loss of 27 cents per share.\nTotal revenue increased to $319.2 million from $316.0 million.\nAnalysts on average had expected a loss of 38 cents per share and revenue of $304.3 million.
