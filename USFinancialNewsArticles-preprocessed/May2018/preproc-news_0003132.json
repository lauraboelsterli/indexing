    "text": "RUTLAND, Vt., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Casella Waste Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CWST), a regional solid waste, recycling and resource management services company, today reported its financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. In addition, the Company reaffirms its revenues, Adjusted EBITDA*, and Normalized Free Cash Flow* guidance ranges for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the 2018:\nRevenues were $147.5 million for the quarter, up $13.7 million, or 10.2%, from the same period in 2017. Net loss was $(3.9) million for the quarter, an increase of $(3.7) million from the same period in 2017. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders* was $0.1 million for the quarter, down $(0.2) million from the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $24.6 million for the quarter, up $1.5 million, or 6.4%, from the same period in 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 million for the quarter, up $2.1 million, or 19.8%, from the same period in 2017. Normalized Free Cash Flow was $7.2 million for the quarter, up $6.1 million, or 529.5%, from the same period in 2017. Overall solid waste pricing for the quarter was up 4.3%, driven by strong landfill pricing, up 4.9%, and robust collection pricing, up 4.8%.\n“We had another strong operational quarter, as we continued to execute well against our key strategies,” said John W. Casella, Chairman and CEO of Casella Waste Systems, Inc. “We remain focused on creating shareholder value through increasing landfill returns, improving collection profitability, creating incremental value through resource solutions, driving general and administrative efficiencies, and strong capital discipline.”\n“The progress we have made on our strategies is apparent in the positive financial results in the first quarter, despite significant recycling headwinds,” Casella said. “Our disciplined solid waste pricing programs continued to add value, with landfill pricing up 4.9% and collection pricing up 4.8%. This strong pricing was coupled with 6.6% solid waste volume growth, mainly driven by robust disposal volume growth. Roughly 60% of our disposal volume growth during the quarter was driven by a one-time $3.5 million soil remediation project for a key customer and the remaining 40% was driven by higher landfill volumes across all waste types as we continued to source new landfill volumes at higher prices in the tightening northeastern disposal markets.\"\n“Commodity pricing for recycled paper and cardboard continued to deteriorate during the first quarter due to China’s ban on mixed paper and new lower contamination standards,” Casella said. “Our average commodity revenue per ton was down roughly 50% year-over-year, with mixed paper pricing down over 90% during this same period. Our risk mitigation programs are working well to help offset this historic decline in commodity prices. However, several factors contributed to an under-recovery during the quarter, including: the rapid sequential decline in commodity prices from December to March caused our recovery fees to get behind due to their calculation based on a one-month trailing index; we are absorbing all of the commodity pricing risk on several legacy contracts, which make up roughly 15% of our commodity sales; and our variable costs were up as we had to slow processing lines to improve quality while we incurred higher transportation costs to deliver commodities to new markets. Given these headwinds, recycling operating income missed budget by roughly $2.0 million during the quarter.”\n“As we first announced in early August 2017, we have adjusted our capital strategy to balance delevering with prudent growth through acquisition or development investments,” Casella said. “We have set a goal to grow revenues by $20.0 million to $40.0 million per year through acquisition or development activity for the next three years as part of this new strategy. We are off to a great start with this strategy, with roughly $20.0 million of acquired revenues over the last four months. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we believe that investing a portion of our excess cash flows to grow our business will create additional shareholder returns through higher cash flows driven by new revenue streams, internalization to our disposal facilities and cost synergies.”\nFor the quarter, revenues were $147.5 million, up $13.7 million, or 10.2%, from the same period in 2017, with revenues growth mainly driven by: robust collection and disposal pricing; higher solid waste volumes; higher organics and customer solutions volumes; and the roll-over impact from acquisitions; partially offset by lower recycling commodity prices and volumes.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $(3.9) million, or $(0.09) per diluted common share for the quarter, an increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(3.7) million, as compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(0.2) million, or $(0.01) per diluted common share for the same period in 2017. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders was $0.1 million for the quarter, or Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share* of $0.00 for the quarter, as compared to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders of $0.3 million, or Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share of $0.01 for the same period in 2017.\nThe first quarter included: a $2.1 million contract settlement charge related to the termination of a recycling brokerage contract, exiting the contract has a positive return for the Company; a $1.6 million Southbridge Landfill closure charge primarily related to a reserve established for an expected settlement with the Town of Charlton; and a $0.3 million development project charge associated with certain costs incurred at our North Country Landfill.\nOperating income was $0.8 million for the quarter, as compared to operating income of $6.6 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted Operating Income was $4.8 million for the quarter, down $(1.7) million from the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $24.6 million for the quarter, up $1.5 million from the same period in 2017, with growth mainly driven by improved performance in the Company's collection and disposal lines-of-business, partially offset by a decline in the recycling line-of-business.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 million for the quarter, as compared to $10.7 million for the same period in 2017. Normalized Free Cash Flow was $7.2 million for the quarter, as compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nOutlook\n“While we have modeled recycling commodity prices to stay flat at the current historically low levels for the remainder of 2018, we remain confident that our outperformance in the solid waste, organics and customer solutions businesses will continue to more than offset this headwind,” Casella said. “As such, we have reaffirmed our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Normalized Free Cash Flow guidance ranges for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.”\nThe estimated ranges are as follows:\nRevenues between $618 million and $628 million;\nAdjusted EBITDA between $135 million and $139 million; and\nNormalized Free Cash Flow between $42 million and $46 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Normalized Free Cash Flow related to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 are described in the Reconciliation of 2018 Outlook Non-GAAP Measures section of this press release.\nConference call to discuss quarter\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nThe Company also discloses net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures (excluding acquisition related capital expenditures), less payments on landfill operating lease contracts, plus proceeds from divestiture transactions, plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, plus proceeds from property insurance settlement, plus (less) contributions from (distributions to) noncontrolling interest holders (“Free Cash Flow”), which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nThe Company also discloses Free Cash Flow plus certain cash outflows associated with landfill closure, site improvement and remediation expenditures, plus certain cash outflows associated with new contract and project capital expenditures, plus cash associated with certain contract settlement charges, (less) plus cash (inflows) outflows associated with certain business dissolutions, plus cash interest outflows associated with the timing of refinancing transactions (“Normalized Free Cash Flow”), which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nThe Company also discloses net cash provided by operating activities, plus changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures, gains on sale of property and equipment, environmental remediation charges, losses on debt extinguishment, stock based compensation expense, the non-cash Southbridge Landfill closure charge, interest expense, cash interest expense, provisions for income taxes, net of deferred taxes and adjustments as allowed by the Company's credit facility agreement (\"Consolidated EBITDA\") and total long-term debt and capital leases, less unencumbered cash and cash equivalents in excess of $2.0 million (\"Consolidated Funded Debt, Net\" and, divided by Consolidated EBITDA, the \"Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio\"), which are non-GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income are reconciled to net income (loss); while Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders is reconciled to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders; Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share is reconciled to diluted earnings per common share; Free Cash Flow, Normalized Free Cash Flow and Consolidated EBITDA are reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities; and Consolidated Funded Debt, Net is reconciled to total long-term debt and capital leases.\nThe Company presents Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, Free Cash Flow, Normalized Free Cash Flow Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Funded Debt, Net and the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio because it considers them important supplemental measures of its performance and believes they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company’s results. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further understand its “core operating performance.” The Company believes its “core operating performance” is helpful in understanding its ongoing performance in the ordinary course of operations. The Company believes that providing Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, Free Cash Flow, Normalized Free Cash Flow, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Funded Debt, Net and the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio to investors, in addition to corresponding income statement and cash flow statement measures, affords investors the benefit of viewing its performance using the same financial metrics that the management team uses in making many key decisions and understanding how the core business and its results of operations has performed. The Company further believes that providing this information allows its investors greater transparency and a better understanding of its core financial performance.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, Free Cash Flow, Normalized Free Cash Flow, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Funded Debt, Net and the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, Free Cash Flow, Normalized Free Cash Flow, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Funded Debt, Net and the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio presented by other companies.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain matters discussed in this press release, including, but not limited to, the statements regarding financial results and guidance, are “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
