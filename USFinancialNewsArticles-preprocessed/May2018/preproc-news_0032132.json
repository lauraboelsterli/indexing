    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif., Corium International, Inc. (Nasdaq:CORI), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of specialty transdermal products, today announced unaudited financial results for the second fiscal quarter and the six months ended March 31, 2018 and reported on recent corporate developments. Corium's fiscal year ends on September 30.\nCorporate Highlights\nCorplex™ Donepezil NDA to be submitted using pilot bioequivalence data — Based on positive feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Corium announced that it will submit the data from its successful pilot bioequivalence (BE) study for the planned New Drug Application (NDA) for Corplex Donepezil. Corium is now in the process of conducting the ancillary clinical studies required for the NDA. These ancillary studies, which include standard skin tolerability, alternative patch application site and heat effect studies, are well underway and progressing as planned. As previously announced, Corium is targeting submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA in the first quarter of calendar 2019. Notice of allowance for key U.S. Corplex Donepezil patent — The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a notice of allowance for a foundational patent related to Corplex Donepezil. This patent provides coverage of the drug product and its unique design features, including composition elements that achieve a sustained, controlled and effective delivery of donepezil across the skin for the 7-day wear period. This patent will be eligible for listing in the FDA Orange Book and should provide patent protection to at least July 2037. It is the first to be allowed in a series of pending Corium patent applications related to Corplex Donepezil. Completed $120 million convertible debt offering — In March, Corium completed the sale of $120 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. Corium used approximately $56 million of the proceeds to repay in full its outstanding borrowings under its term loan agreement with CRG, and will use the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n\"The quarter was highlighted by our decision to use our successful pilot bioequivalence data comparing Corplex Donepezil and Aricept ® as the basis for our NDA submission. This decision was driven by favorable feedback from the FDA following the agency’s review of the full pharmacokinetic report for that study and our consultations with external experts,” said Peter D. Staple, President and Chief Executive Officer of Corium. “The notice of allowance for our new composition of matter patent on this product validates the innovative approach that we have taken in developing Corplex Donepezil and further strengthens the long-term commercial value of the product.”\nFinancial Results for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nCorium reported total revenues of $10.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $7.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2017, and reported total revenues of $19.4 million for the six-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared with $14.3 million in the same period in fiscal 2017. Product revenues increased for both the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and for the six-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in revenues from Mayne Pharma for Clonidine TDS and an increase in revenues from Procter & Gamble for Crest ® Whitestrips. Contract research and development revenues increased for both the second quarter and the six-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of increased activities supporting Agile’s development program for Twirla ® , increased development activity for Mayne on multiple product candidates, and increased development for Procter & Gamble related to the ongoing acquisition of a third production line.\nTotal research and development (R&D) expenses were $15.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $10.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2017, and were $29.1 million for the six-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared with $18.4 million in the same period in fiscal 2017. The increase in total R&D expenses was driven by Corium’s investment in its proprietary product programs, primarily the advancement of Corplex Donepezil into a second BE trial, along with the ancillary clinical trials required to support the NDA filing for this product.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $3.0 million for the same period of fiscal 2017, and were $7.4 million for the six-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared with $6.0 million in the same period in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher one-time legal and outside services costs, as well as higher stock-based compensation costs.\nCorium reported a net loss of $18.0 million for the second quarter in fiscal 2018, or $0.50 per share, compared with a net loss of $11.0 million, or $0.42 per share, in the same period of fiscal 2017. For the six-month period ended March 31, 2018, the net loss was $31.3 million, or $0.87 per share, compared with a net loss of $21.5 million, or $0.88 per share, for the same period in fiscal 2017. As of March 31, 2018, there were 36,139,058 shares of Corium common stock outstanding.\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 were $94.2 million.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nCorium will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET (2:00 p.m. PT) to discuss the financial results for the second fiscal quarter and the six months ended March 31, 2018.
