    "text": "High Impact Acorazado-1 Exploration Well Drilling\nTORONTO, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Frontera Energy Corporation (TSX: FEC) (\" Frontera \" or the \" Company \") announced today the release of its consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2018, together with its management, discussion and analysis (\" MD&A \"). These documents will be posted on the Company's website at www.fronteraenergy.ca and SEDAR at www.sedar.com . All values in this news release and the Company's financial disclosures are in United States dollars unless otherwise stated.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nProduction Growth Driven by Peru Reactivation\nNet Production increased 3% quarter-over-quarter to 66,227 boe/d in Q1 2018. The Company completed the drilling of 33 development wells and three exploration wells during Q1 2018. Total capital expenditures were $78.8 million during Q1 2018, 29% lower than Q4 2017.\nCost Control Improves Profitability\nProduction costs of $12.47/boe were 5% lower in Q1 2018 than Q4 2017. General and administrative costs ( \"G&A\" ) of $22.1 million were 10% lower than the previous quarter. Frontera's Q1 2018 Operating Netback of $24.42/boe was 3% higher in Q1 2018 than Q4 2017.\nStrong Balance Sheet\nThe Company's total cash position, including restricted cash, increased 8% quarter-over-quarter to $695.9 million at the end of Q1 2018. Working capital increased 11% to $343.1 million during the first quarter, compared to $310.0 million at the end of Q4 2017.\nExploration Success and Exciting Exploration Opportunity Pipeline\nCoralillo-1 exploration well in the Guatiquia block completed and is currently testing at an average rate of 1,000 bbl/d. Alligator-2 exploration well in the Guatiquia block completed and tested at an average rate of 1,000 bbl/d. Jaspe-6D exploration well in the Quifa area completed and tested at an average rate of 187 bbl/d. Acorazado-1 exploration well in the Llanos 25 block started drilling on April 22, 2018. Frontera plans to drill the Delfin Sur-1 exploration well offshore Peru during Q3 2018.\nRichard Herbert, Chief Executive Officer of Frontera, commented:\n\"It has been an exciting start to my tenure as Chief Executive Officer at Frontera, as we pursue our 2018 theme, \"Positioning for Growth.\" After spending time with our operations and planning teams, I am encouraged that the Company can generate both significant cash flow, from stable production of our existing assets, and growth, from exploration and high impact strategic initiatives. We continue to enjoy exposure to strong international Brent oil prices, the positive impact of which is expected to be magnified when our current hedges roll off in November of this year. In April, we started drilling at our Acorazado-1 location in the Llanos foothills of Colombia, targeting a large structure on trend with the giant Cusiana and Cupiagua fields.\"\nQuarterly Production Growth Driven by Peru Reactivation:\nNet Production Summary\nNet Production: 1\n2018\n2017\nQ1\nQ4\nQ1\nOil and Liquids (bbl/d)\nColombia\n52,195\n56,593\n62,180\nPeru\n9,157\n2,538\n3,855\nTotal Oil and Liquids (bbl/d)\n61,352\n59,131\n66,035\nNatural Gas (boe/d) 2\nColombia\n4,875\n5,314\n6,489\nTotal Natural Gas (boe/d)\n4,875\n5,314\n6,489\nTotal Equivalent Production (boe/d)\n66,227\n64,445\n72,524\n1 Additional production details are available in the MD&A.\n2 Colombian standard natural gas conversion ratio of 5.7 Mcf per bbl as required by the Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy.\nNet Production in the first quarter of 2018 totalled 66,227 boe/d representing an increase of 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was driven by significant oil production growth in Peru that was partially offset by declines in Colombia as a result of social unrest at the Cubiro block that has now been resolved, increased volumes of 1,257 boe/d paid-in kind to Ecopetrol S.A. from production at the Quifa block pursuant to the high price participation clause in the governing exploration and exploitation contract and natural production declines on the Company's natural gas assets at La Creciente. First quarter Net Production decreased 9% from the Net Production of 72,524 boe/d reported in the same period of 2017, due to lower activity levels throughout 2017 and natural production declines of the Company's light and medium oil blocks in Colombia.\nA total of 33 development wells and three exploration wells were completed in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 36 development wells and three exploration wells in the previous quarter. The Company currently has six drilling rigs operating in Colombia, with three in each of our core light/medium and heavy oil areas. During the second quarter of 2018 the Company plans to drill 25 development wells and has started drilling one exploration well.\nExploration and Development Successes in Light/Medium and Heavy Oil Businesses:\nLight and Medium Oil Business:\nIn January 2018, the Company began drilling the Alligator-2 exploratory well on the Guatiquia block. On February 16, 2018, the well reached a true vertical depth ( \"TVD\" ) of 12,280 feet, encountering 24 feet of net pay in the Lower Sand-1A formation. The well was completed in the upper 10 feet of the Lower Sand-1A formation with an electrical submersible pump. The well flow tested for 26 days in March 2018 at an average rate of 1,000 bbl/d of 22.5 degree API oil with an average water cut of 40% at a stabilized bottomhole pressure with an 6% drawdown. The production test was concluded due to a pump failure and the well is awaiting a pump change to resume production. Since discovery, the well has produced a total of 24,000 bbls. In March 2018, the Company began drilling the Alligator-3 development well on the Guatiquia block. On April 27, 2018, the well reached a total depth of 12,416 feet (12,189 feet TVD), encountering 31.5 feet of net pay in the Lower Sand-1A formation. The well is currently being completed as a new production well. In February 2018, the Company began drilling the Coralillo-1 exploratory well on the Guatiquia block, which reached total depth of 13,240 feet (11,573 feet TVD) on March 27, 2018. The well encountered 13 feet of net pay in the Guadalupe formation, and 15 feet of net pay in the Lower Sand-1A formation. The well was completed in the Guadalupe and Lower Sand-1A formations with a selective completion and electrical submersible pump. The Lower Sand-1A formation has been flow tested for approximately 10 days at an average rate of 1,050 bbl/d of 15.3 degree API oil with an average water cut of 1% at stabilized bottomhole flowing pressure with a 60% drawdown. The well is currently shut-in for a pressure buildup test on the Lower Sand-1A formation. During the testing period, the well produced a total of 9,200 bbls of oil. On April 22, 2018, the Company began drilling the Acorazado-1 exploration well on the Llanos 25 block. The well is targeting to drill to a total depth of approximately 16,000 feet and will take between 90 to 120 days to complete and cost between $35 and $50 million.The well is currently drilling at nearly 7,000 feet TVD.\nHeavy Oil Business:\nIn January 2018, the Company drilled four vertical wells in the Quifa SW field which were outside the previously mapped field boundaries and successfully identified new areas of oil saturated reservoir sands. This finding has opened up new development well locations for drilling in 2018 and beyond. In March 2018, the Company received approval from its partner, Ecopetrol S.A., to begin implementing projects that will increase the water handling capacity in the Quifa area. The successful expansion of the Company's water handling capacity in the Quifa area will enable the Company to increase overall production from the block by allowing currently shut-in wells to be placed back on production. The implementation of this project will be undertaken during the second and third quarter of 2018 with the increased capacity coming on-stream during the fourth quarter of 2018. In January 2018, the Company began drilling the Jaspe-6D exploratory well in the Quifa area (partner Ecopetrol S.A., WI 40%). The well was drilled to a total depth of 4,900 feet measure depth (3,491 feet TVD) encountering 33 feet of net pay in the Basal Sand formation. The well was completed on February 5, 2018, with an electrical submersible pump and with 10 feet of perforations at the top of the Basal sand formation. The well was flow tested for 11 days at an average rate of 187 bbl/d of a 13 degree API oil with an average water cut of 10% at stabilized bottomhole flowing pressure with a 14% drawdown. During the last 24 hours of testing, the well averaged 174 bbl/d and with a 30% water cut. The well was then shut-in for a 14-day buildup. Since discovery, the well has produced a total of 2,100 bbls of oil. The well is currently shut-in and the Company is awaiting approvals for extended testing.\nFinancial Results:\nFinancial Summary\n2018\n2017\nQ1\nQ4\nQ1\nTotal sales after realized loss on risk management contracts ($ millions)\n249.5\n335.3\n316.6\nNet (loss) income ($ millions) 3\n(3.1)\n(32.5)\n8.5\nPer share - basic and diluted 2\n(0.06)\n(0.65)\n0.17\nNet cash provided by operating activities ($ millions)\n30.3\n166.8\n66.9\nOperating EBITDA ($ millions) 1\n86.0\n105.0\n92.4\nOperating EBITDA margin (Operating EBITDA/total sales) 4\n34%\n31%\n29%\nAdjusted EBITDA ($ millions) 1\n86.7\n2.0\n115.1\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA/total sales) 4\n35%\n1%\n36%\nAdjusted FFO ($ millions) 1\n34.3\n94.7\n78.8\nPer share - basic 2\n0.69\n1.89\n1.58\nNet Production (boe/d)\n66,227\n64,445\n72,524\nSales volumes (boe/d)\n52,440\n65,481\n70,452\nAverage shares outstanding - basic (millions)\n50.0\n50.0\n50.0\n1 These metrics are Non-IFRS financial measures. See advisories - \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" - below and \"Non-IFRS Measures \" on page 13 of the MD&A.\n2 The basic weighted average numbers of common shares for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were 50,005,832 and 50,002,363, respectively.\n3 Net (loss) income attributable to equity holders of the parent.\n4 Total sales represents total sales after realized loss on risk management contracts.\nThe average Brent oil benchmark price increased by $5.77/bbl, or 9% in the first quarter of 2018 to average $67.23/bbl, compared to $61.46/bbl in the fourth quarter of 2017. Brent oil benchmark price averaged $54.57/bbl in the first quarter of 2017. The Company's realized oil price of $63.43/bbl in the first quarter of 2018 excludes the impact of $8.98/bbl of realized losses on risk management contracts. The Company remains hedged on approximately 60% of net daily production volumes until the end of October 2018, however, the realized price for the Company will improve by approximately $4.50 per barrel in the third quarter as a result of higher hedged ceiling prices and is currently unhedged for November and December 2018. For the first quarter of 2018, total sales after realized risk management contracts, decreased 26% to $249.5 million compared to $335.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and decreased 21% from $316.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Historically, sales volumes trend between 3% and 5% below production volumes as a result of internal consumption. The 21% decrease in sales volumes as compared to production volumes in the first quarter of 2018 was a result of three factors. Firstly, oil inventory increased in Colombia by 522,700 bbls as a result of an oil cargo which finished loading on April 2, 2018. These volumes were not recorded as sales in the first quarter of 2018, but will be reflected in sales in the second quarter of 2018 and totalled approximately $31.1 million. Secondly, inventory increased in Peru as the ramp up in production on block 192 was higher than our sales entitlements based on the existing ownership of line fill in the pipeline. Inventories in Peru are expected to continue to build until the fourth quarter of 2018, at which point the Company's share of line fill and sales volumes will more closely match production volumes. Lastly, there was a settlement of an overlift of approximately 270,000 bbls relating to the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in inventory during the first quarter and settlement of volumes sold during the previous quarter had a follow on impact to other key financial metrics including Operating EBITDA and Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations ( \"Adjusted FFO\" ). A reconciliation between production volumes and sales volumes can be found on page 6 of the MD&A while a reconciliation of the impact of certain factors on the dollar value of sales can be found on page 8 of the MD&A. Despite the impact of reduced sales volumes, primarily related to the timing of events as between quarters, the Company continues to expect to deliver operational and financial results that meet annual guidance expectations. During the first quarter of 2018, net loss attributable to equity holders of the Company was $3.1 million or $0.06/share, compared with a net loss of $32.5 million or $0.65/share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was due to gains on unrealized risk management contracts and foreign exchange, lower depletion, depreciation, and amortization, higher share of income from associates and lower impairments offset by the reversal of the provision related to high price clause of Corcel recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 and higher income tax expense. The Company generated net income of $8.5 million or $0.17/share in the first quarter of 2017. Operating EBITDA of $86.0 million or $1.72/share for the first quarter of 2018, was lower in comparison with $105.0 million or $2.10/share achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $6.5 million lower than the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to lower volume sold during the quarter as discussed above. Adjusted FFO totalled $34.3 million or $0.69/share for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 64% compared to $94.7 million or $1.89/share achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $44.5 million lower than the first quarter of 2017. Lower Adjusted FFO was primarily due to lower Operating EBITDA of $19.0 million, no dividends received from investments in associates during the first quarter of 2018 ($35.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017), and higher downtime on the Bicentenario pipeline of $11.2 million.\nStrong Cash Position and Credit Profile: The Company continued to build cash during the quarter, with a total cash position of $695.9 million, as at March 31, 2018, an increase of 8% and 24% from the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. Unrestricted cash increased to $515.8 million as at March 31, 2018, from $511.7 million at year end 2017. The increase in cash during the first quarter of 2018 was due to cash generated from operating activities of $30.3 million and the receipt of gross cash proceeds of $20.0 million from the sale of Petroelectrica de los Llanos Ltd. to an affiliate of Electricas de Medellin-Ingeniería y Servicios S.A.S. and gross cash proceeds of $57 million received from InterOil Corporation (now ExxonMobil Canada Holdings ULC) in full satisfaction of the purchase price of the sale of its interests in the petroleum prospect license PPL 475 and petroleum retention license PRL 39 in Papua New Guinea. Working capital increased 11% to $343.2 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $310.0 million at year end 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, total capital expenditures were $78.8 million, lower than $111.2 million in the previous quarter and higher in comparison with $38.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently analyzing alternatives for reducing its current financing costs, increasing operating and financial flexibility and raising capital to address future operational commitments. In April 2018, Fitch Ratings Inc. (\"Fitch\") made changes to its rating methodology in respect of its treatment of country-specific recovery ratings. In its revised methodology, Fitch had capped the recovery rating of Colombian corporate issuers at \"RR4\". As a result, on May 9, 2018, Fitch had changed the credit rating on the Company's $250 million senior secured notes due in 2021 (\"Senior Secured Notes\") to \"B+/RR4\" from \"BB-/RR3\" to bring the Senior Secured Notes in line with their new methodology. Although Fitch has changed the rating of the Company's Senior Secured Notes, Fitch has also reaffirmed the Company's long term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Rating at \"B+\" (\"IDR Rating\"). Fitch had based its reaffirmation of the Company's IDR Rating on the Company's continued operational and financial stability. In addition, Fitch removed the Negative Ratings Watch on the Senior Secured Notes. The rating outlook continues to remain stable.\nContinued Focus on Cost Reductions and Cost Control:\nOperating cost per barrel decreased 6% to $27.94/boe compared to $29.65/boe in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to lower production and transportation costs (excluding fees paid on suspended capacity). Specifically, during the quarter, transportation costs were 11% lower quarter-over-quarter, as a result of a reduction in the average pipeline tariff rates due to using lower tariff alternative pipeline systems when the Bicentenario pipeline system was offline (81 days during the first quarter of 2018, compared to 56 days during the fourth quarter of 2017). This reduction was partially offset by an increase of $1.86/boe in fees paid on suspended pipeline capacity during the quarter. Operating costs in the first quarter of 2017 were $25.36/boe, primarily as a result of lower production costs and higher production and sales volumes. General and administrative costs were lower in the first quarter of 2018 at $22.1 million versus $24.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $27.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was mainly a result of the Company's continued efforts to reduce overhead costs. Operating Netback in the first quarter of 2018 was 3% higher to $24.42/boe, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of lower operating costs. Operating Netback in the first quarter of 2017 was $20.59/boe.\nAnnual Guidance Update:\nThe Company reiterates annual guidance metrics for net production of between 65,000 and 70,000 boe/d, Operating EBITDA of between $375 and $425 million, and capital expenditures of between $450 and $500 million. The unchanged annual guidance metrics reflects an average 2018 Brent oil price assumption of $63/bbl. If current Brent oil price trends continue for the remainder of 2018 the Company anticipates delivering financial results that will exceed current expectations, despite having 60% of production hedged until the end of October 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call Details:\nAs previously disclosed, a conference call for investors and analysts is scheduled for Friday, May 11, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. (Calgary time), 9:30 a.m. (Bogotá time) and 10:30 a.m. (Toronto time).

These non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning, and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures are included because management uses this information to analyze operating performance and liquidity.\nManagement believes that EBITDA is a common measure used to assess profitability before the impact of different financing methods, income taxes, depreciation and impairment of capital assets and amortization of intangible assets.\nOperating EBITDA represents the operating results of the Company's primary business, excluding the effects of capital structure, other investments (infrastructure assets), non-cash items that depend on accounting policy choices, and one-time items that are not expected to recur. Adjusted EBITDA excludes items of a non-recurring nature (one-time items), or items that could make the period-over-period comparison of results from operations less meaningful, but includes results from the Company's other investments (infrastructure assets).\nA reconciliation of Operating and Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\n(in thousands of US$)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNet (loss) income 1\n(3,121)\n(32,544)\n8,498\nAdjustments\nIncome tax expense (recovery)\n10,746\n(10,438)\n10,034\nDepletion, depreciation and amortization\n72,673\n95,062\n101,794\nImpairment expenses (reversal)\n20,341\n36,468\n(10,447)\nFinance costs, net\n4,247\n5,478\n4,897\nRestructuring, severance costs and others\n2,838\n2,436\n5,946\nReversal of provision related to high-price clause\n—\n(99,622)\n—\nEquity tax\n—\n—\n11,694\nOther loss (income)\n604\n4,786\n(2,498)\nForeign exchange unrealized (gain) loss\n(21,674)\n373\n(14,860)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n86,654\n1,999\n115,058\nUnrealized (gain) loss on risk management contracts\n(17,313)\n80,774\n(40,145)\nShare of income from associates\n(35,759)\n(14,809)\n(23,988)\nGain attributable to non-controlling interest\n12,779\n7,172\n10,783\nShare based compensation\n1,054\n2,119\n20\nForeign exchange realized loss\n2,669\n3,099\n3,614\nFees paid on suspended pipeline capacity\n35,904\n24,656\n27,100\nOperating EBITDA\n85,988\n105,010\n92,442\n1 Net (loss) income attributable to equity holders of the Company.\n2018\n2017\n(in thousands of US$ )\nQ1\nQ4\nQ3\nQ2\nQ1\nFinancial and Operational results:\nOperating EBITDA\n85,988\n105,010\n105,885\n86,857\n92,442\nAdjusted EBITDA\n86,654\n1,999\n44,203\n87,389\n115,058\nNetbacks\nManagement believes that Netback is a useful measure to assess the net profit after all the costs associated with bringing one barrel of oil to the market. It is also commonly used by the oil and gas industry to analyze financial and operating performance expressed as profit per barrel.\nOperating Netback represents realized price per barrel plus realized gain or loss on financial derivatives, less production costs, high-price participation payments and royalties paid in cash, transportation and diluent costs, and shows how efficient the Company is at extracting and selling its product.\nThe third quarter of 2017 marked the first time the Company disclosed Adjusted FFO, providing stakeholders with greater insight given the increasing significance of these metrics to evaluate operational results.\nAdjusted Funds Flow from Operations\nAdjusted FFO is a non-IFRS financial measure that adjusts an IFRS measure - cash flow provided (used) by operating activities - for changes in non-cash working capital, which management uses to analyze operating performance and liquidity. Changes to non-cash working capital can include differences in timing of cash flows related to accounts receivable and accounts payable, which management believes reduces comparability among periods. The indicator excludes assets retirement obligation settlements, one-time expenses for the Company not related to ongoing operations such as restructuring and severance costs, and loss (gain) from past assets.\nThree Months Ended\n(in thousands of US$)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n30,265\n166,750\n66,926\nChanges in non-cash working capital\n1,107\n25,458\n5,888\nFunds flow from operations\n31,372\n192,208\n72,814\nRestructuring and severance costs\n2,838\n2,436\n5,946\nSettlement of asset retirement obligations\n50\n367\n—\nGain from past assets\n—\n(100,316)\n—\nAdjusted FFO\n34,260\n94,695\n78,760\nPlease see the MD&A for additional information about these financial measures.\nBoe Conversion\nThe term \"boe\" is used in this news release. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of cubic feet to barrels is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In this news release, boe has been expressed using the Colombian conversion standard of 5.7 Mcf: 1 bbl required by the Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy. For properties in Peru, the Company has expressed boe using the Peruvian conversion standard of 5.626 Mcf: 1 bbl required by Perupetro S.A., Peru's state regulatory agency.\nDefinitions:\nbbl(s)\nBarrel(s) of oil\nbbl/d\nBarrel of oil per day\nboe\nRefer to \"Boe Conversion\" disclosure above\nboe/d\nBarrel of oil equivalent per day\nMboe\nThousand barrels of oil equivalent\nMMboe\nMillion barrels of oil equivalent\nMcf\nThousand cubic feet\nNet Production\nNet production represents the Company's working interest volumes, net of royalties and internal consumption\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/frontera-announces-three-percent-production-growth-and-100-exploration-success-in-the-first-quarter-of-2018-300646867.html\nSOURCE Frontera Energy Corporation",
