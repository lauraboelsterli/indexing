    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), an industry leader in automated, scalable and secure networks, today reported preliminary financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and provided its outlook for the three months ending June 30, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Performance\nNet revenues were $1,082.6 million, a decrease of 11% year-over-year and 13% sequentially.\nGAAP operating margin was 5.1%, a decrease from 12.8% in the first quarter of 2017, and a decrease from 16.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 12.3%, a decrease from 20.8% in the first quarter of 2017, and a decrease from 22.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net income was $34.4 million, a decrease of 68% year-over-year, resulting in diluted net income per share of $0.10.\nNon-GAAP net income was $99.5 million, a decrease of 44% year-over-year and 50% sequentially, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.28.\nThe reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results of operations is provided in a table immediately following the Preliminary Net Revenues by Geographic Region table below.\n“We hit the high-end of our guidance during the March quarter due to better than expected results from our cloud vertical and another quarter of growth in our enterprise business,\" said Rami Rahim, chief executive officer, Juniper Networks. \"We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in several areas of our business and remain confident in our expectation to deliver sequential growth through 2018 and a return to year-over-year growth by the December quarter.\"\n\"While our margins came in below historical levels during the March quarter, we met the profitability targets we set for the period, which enabled earnings to come in at the high-end of guidance,\" said Ken Miller, chief financial officer, Juniper Networks. \"We remain focused on capturing efficiencies and expect profitability levels to improve sequentially through the course of 2018.\"\nBalance Sheet and Other Financial Results\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of March 31, 2018 were $3,448.4 million, compared to $4,043.7 million as of March 31, 2017, and $4,021.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\nNet cash flows provided by operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $271.1 million, compared to $546.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, and $211.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDays sales outstanding in accounts receivable, or “DSO,” was 57 days in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 49 days in the first quarter of 2017, and 62 days in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCapital expenditures were $42.2 million and depreciation and amortization expense was $55.0 million during the first quarter of 2018.\nDuring the quarter, the company initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement and paid a $62 million quarterly dividend, or $0.18 per share.\nOutlook\nThese metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Earnings per share is on a fully diluted basis. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels.\nOur Q2 revenue outlook reflects a return to normal seasonality. While customer spending patterns remain dynamic and difficult to predict, we continue to expect sequential growth through the remainder of the year, with a return to year-over year growth during the December quarter.\nThe company expects gross margin to improve sequentially during the June quarter due to higher volumes and improvements in our cost structure. While better volumes and cost structure efficiencies should drive further gross margin improvement during the second half of 2018, the pace of improvement could be offset by mix and other factors.\nBased on our expected spending through the first half of the year, we now expect our annual operating expenditures to be approximately flat for the full year 2018 versus full year 2017.\nJuniper's guidance for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 is as follows:\nRevenues will be approximately $1,175 million, plus or minus $30 million.\nNon-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 59.0%, plus or minus 1.0%.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses will be approximately $490 million, plus or minus $5 million.\nNon-GAAP operating margin will be approximately 17.5% at the midpoint of revenue guidance.\nNon-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 21.0%.\nNon-GAAP net income per share will be approximately $0.44, plus or minus $0.03. This assumes a share count of approximately 351 million.\nThe guidance above is provided under ASC 606.\nAll forward-looking non-GAAP measures exclude estimates for amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related charges, restructuring benefits or charges, impairment charges, litigation settlement benefits or charges and resolution charges, supplier component remediation charges and recoveries, gain or loss on equity investments, retroactive impact of certain tax settlements, significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform, non-recurring income tax adjustments, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP exclusions, and do not include the impact of any future acquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures that may occur in the period. Juniper is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future hiring needs, the type and volume of equity awards necessary for such future hiring, and the price at which the Company’s stock will trade in those future periods. Amortization of intangible assets is significantly impacted by the timing and size of any future acquisitions. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results. Certain exclusions, such as amortization of intangible assets and share-based compensation expenses, are generally incurred each quarter, but the amounts have historically and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Commentary Available Online\nA CFO Commentary reviewing the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results, as well as second quarter 2018 financial outlook will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and published on the Company’s website at http://investor.juniper.net .

These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the table above should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, certain of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.\nWe utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures presented above to be helpful in assessing the performance of the continuing operation of our business. By continuing operation, we mean the ongoing revenue and expenses of the business, excluding certain items that render comparisons with prior periods or analysis of on-going operating trends more difficult, such as expenses not directly related to the actual cash costs of development, sale, delivery or support of our products and services, or expenses that are reflected in periods unrelated to when the actual amounts were incurred or paid. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In addition, we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community and believe that continuing to provide non-GAAP measures provides investors with a tool for comparing results over time. In assessing the overall health of our business for the periods covered by the table above and, in particular, in evaluating the financial line items presented in the table above, we have excluded items in the following three general categories, each of which are described below: Acquisition-Related Charges, Other Items, and Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We also provide additional detail below regarding the shares used to calculate our non-GAAP net income per share. Notes identified for line items in the table above correspond to the appropriate note description below. With respect to the items excluded from our forward-looking non-GAAP measures and reconciliation of such measures, please see the “Outlook” section above.\nNote A: Acquisition-Related Charges. We exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. The amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions results in our recording expenses in our GAAP financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash. Moreover, had we internally developed the products acquired, the amortization of intangible assets, and the expenses of uncompleted research and development would have been expensed in prior periods. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. In addition, acquisitions result in non-continuing operating expenses, which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP information for acquisition-related expense items in addition to the corresponding GAAP information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies.\nNote B: Other Items. We exclude certain other items that are the result of either unique or unplanned events, including the following, when applicable: (i) restructuring benefits or charges; (ii) litigation settlement benefits or charges; (iii) supplier component remediation recovery or charges; (iv) gain or loss on equity investments; (v) significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform; (vi) the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. Restructuring benefits or charges result from events that arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. These expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. In the case of legal settlements, these gains or losses are recorded in the period in which the matter is concluded or resolved even though the subject matter of the underlying dispute may relate to multiple or different periods. As such, we believe that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, supplier component remediation recovery and charges are directly related to an event that is distinct and does not reflect normal business operations. Whether we realize gains or losses on equity investments is based primarily on the performance and market value of those independent companies. Accordingly, we believe that these gains and losses do not reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations. Additionally, the impact of certain income tax reform, including the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings, are unique events that occur in periods that are generally unrelated to the level of business activity to which such tax reform or legislation applies. We believe this limits comparability with prior periods and that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance and future liquidity of our business. Because of these factors, we assess our operating performance with these amounts both included and excluded, and by providing this information, we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations.\nNote C: Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We provide non-GAAP information relative to our expense for share-based compensation and related payroll tax. Due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, which affect the calculations of share-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies and is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to our results of operations. Further, expense associated with granting share-based awards does not reflect any cash expenditures by the company as no cash is expended.\nNote D: Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share Items. We provide diluted non-GAAP net income per share. The diluted non-GAAP net income per share includes additional dilution from potential issuance of common stock, except when such issuances would be anti-dilutive.\nJuniper Networks, Inc.\nPreliminary Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in millions)\n(unaudited)\nMarch 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,614.2 $ 2,006.5 Short-term investments 317.7 1,026.1 Accounts receivable, net of allowances 679.9 852.0 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 308.9 299.9 Total current assets 3,920.7 4,184.5 Property and equipment, net 1,013.8 1,021.1 Long-term investments 516.5 988.4 Purchased intangible assets, net 123.8 128.1 Goodwill 3,096.2 3,096.2 Other long-term assets 407.5 415.5 Total assets $ 9,078.5 $ 9,833.8 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 189.2 $ 217.6 Accrued compensation 172.8 186.0 Deferred revenue 888.2 1,030.3 Short-term debt 349.3 — Other accrued liabilities 230.5 304.3 Total current liabilities 1,830.0 1,738.2 Long-term debt 1,787.7 2,136.3 Long-term deferred revenue 368.7 509.0 Long-term income taxes payable 649.5 650.6 Other long-term liabilities 117.9 118.8 Total liabilities 4,753.8 5,152.9 Total stockholders' equity 4,324.7 4,680.9 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 9,078.5 $ 9,833.8 Juniper Networks, Inc.\nPreliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(in millions)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (*) Cash flows from operating activities: Net income $ 34.4 $ 108.8 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Share-based compensation expense 70.4 62.0 Depreciation, amortization, and accretion 55.7 55.8 Other 1.7 (1.0 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects from acquisitions: Accounts receivable, net 170.8 383.0 Prepaid expenses and other assets (11.7 ) (3.5 ) Accounts payable (31.2 ) (18.4 ) Accrued compensation (14.1 ) (47.2 ) Income taxes payable (7.6 ) 4.1 Other accrued liabilities (51.1 ) (8.9 ) Deferred revenue 53.8 11.9 Net cash provided by operating activities 271.1 546.6 Cash flows from investing activities: Purchases of property and equipment (42.2 ) (32.1 ) Purchases of available-for-sale debt investments (8.1 ) (378.9 ) Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale debt investments 968.0 218.8 Proceeds from maturities and redemptions of available-for-sale debt investments 215.4 184.3 Purchases of trading investments — (1.8 ) Purchases of equity investments (2.0 ) — Proceeds from sales of equity investments 3.3 — Payment of escrow balance related to prior year acquisition (22.2 ) — Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 1,112.2 (9.7 ) Cash flows from financing activities: Repurchase and retirement of common stock, including prepayment under accelerated share repurchases program (754.2 ) (129.7 ) Proceeds from issuance of common stock 29.3 33.7 Payment of dividends (62.1 ) (38.0 ) Change in customer financing arrangement (16.6 ) — Net cash used in financing activities (803.6 ) (134.0 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 6.2 7.2 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 585.9 410.1 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 2,059.1 1,880.6 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 2,645.0 $ 2,290.7",
