    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 7:39 AM / Updated 16 minutes ago European shares rise as Italian stocks recover, Ocado soars Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - European stocks pushed higher in early trading on Thursday as Italian stocks recovered some lost ground and commodities-related sectors rallied, while shares in Ocado rocketed after the company signed a partnership deal. Traders work at their desks at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, November 22, 2017. REUTERS/Staff/Remote\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.1 percent by 0724 GMT, holding at 3-1/2 month highs as shares in energy stocks and miners rose, while Italy's benchmark .FTMIB climbed more than 1 percent as markets awaited the result of talks between two anti-system parties to form a coalition government.\nOn Wednesday, Italian stocks had tumbled more than 2 percent after a leaked draft coalition programme indicated that the parties planned to ask the European Central Bank to forgive 250 billion euros ($296 billion) of Italian debt.\nBritain's FTSE 100 .FTSE also pushed higher, shrugging off a rise in sterling following a report late on Wednesday that Britain will tell Brussels it is prepared to stay in the European Union's customs union beyond 2021. A source at Prime Minister May's office dismissed the report on Thursday.\nWhile indexes were relatively subdued, there were some big movers among individual stocks. Shares in online supermarket Ocado ( OCDO.L ) surged nearly 40 percent to an all-time high after the company signed a deal with U.S. retailer Kroger Co ( KR.N ) to use Ocado’s technology for grocery deliveries in the world’s biggest market.\nEarnings updates also spurred sizeable moves. Altice ( ATCA.AS ) jumped more than 10 percent after its French unit showed the first signs of recovery in the first quarter, while French waste and water group Suez ( SEVI.PA ) rose 3.4 percent after higher waste volumes boosted its first-quarter core earnings.\nShares in Maersk ( MAERSKb.CO ), broadcaster RTL ( RRTL.DE ) and Royal Mail ( RMG.L ) all fell between 3.9 and 9.5 percent after giving updates.\nShares in British bookmakers also came under pressure after the UK government cut the top stake on fixed-odds betting terminals to two pounds. William Hill ( WMH.L ), GVC ( GVC.L ) and Paddy Power Betfair ( PPB.L ) fell between 0.7 and 3.1 percent. Reporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Kevin Liffey",
