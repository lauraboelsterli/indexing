    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) announced Clarus Corporation (NASDAQ:CLAR), parent company of Black Diamond Equipment, will expand in Utah over the next eight years, adding up to 147 high-paying jobs, $8.9 million in new state revenue and $40 million in capital investment.\n“Clarus Corporation is a bedrock partner and an anchor of Utah’s outdoor industry. We couldn’t be more pleased with their decision to expand in the state of Utah,” said Val Hale, executive director of GOED. “We look forward to future partnership opportunities with Clarus Corporation as we help advance the state’s outdoor recreation economy.”\nWith a heritage dating back to 1957, Black Diamond Equipment relocated to Utah in 1991. This move allowed its employees to be closer to the activities that create its passion: climbing, skiing, and various mountain and canyon pursuits. Clarus Corporation and Black Diamond Equipment merged in May 2010, where a previous incentive agreement with GOED assisted the company in moving its headquarters to Utah. This is just one indication of long-term collaboration between Clarus Corporation, Black Diamond Equipment and the state to grow Utah’s outdoor industry.\nClarus Corporation also owns Austrian-based PIEPS, an innovator and technology leader in beacon technology and avalanche safety equipment. Clarus also recently acquired Missouri-based Sierra Bullets, an iconic American manufacturer of high performance bullets. Overall, Clarus boasts an increasing portfolio of outdoor equipment and lifestyle products for climbing, mountaineering, backpacking, skiing, and sporting activities. The company has more than 100 patents worldwide for its renowned products.\n“Salt Lake City has been home to Black Diamond Equipment, and now Clarus, for over 25 years,” said John Walbrecht, president of Clarus. “We are excited about the future of the outdoor industry in Utah, and expect to play an important role in its growth for years to come.”\nClarus Corporation will create up to 147 jobs over the next eight years. The total wages in aggregate are required to exceed 110 percent of the Salt Lake County average wage. The projected new state wages over the life of the agreement are expected to be approximately $91,067,138. Projected new state tax revenues, as a result of corporate, payroll and sales taxes, are estimated to be $8,936,826.9 over eight years.\n“When Black Diamond Equipment moved to Utah in the 1990’s it was a monumental event for the state’s outdoor products industry,” said Theresa Foxley, president and CEO of the Economic Development Corporation of Utah. “Today, as they, and its parent Clarus Corporation, announce their most recent Utah expansion, we look forward to our continued partnership as we support and grow Utah’s outdoor products industry.”\nClarus Corporation may earn up to 20 percent of the new state taxes they will pay over the eight-year life of the agreement in the form of a post-performance Economic Development Tax Increment Finance (EDTIF) tax credit rebate. As part of the contract with Clarus Corporation, the GOED Board of Directors has approved a post-performance tax credit rebate not to exceed $1.8 million. Each year as Clarus Corporation meets the criteria in its contract with the state, it will earn a portion of the total tax credit rebate.\nAbout the Utah Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED)\nbusiness.utah.gov\nThe Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) charter is based on Gov. Gary R. Herbert’s commitment to statewide economic development.
