    "text": "Loans and Deposits increase at double digit annualized growth rates\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMERICAN BUSINESS BANK (OTCBB: AMBZ) today reported net income of $2.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or $.31 per diluted share compared to net income of $3.6 million or $.46 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The results for 2018 reflect an additional provision for loan losses of $654,000 over first quarter 2017 related to strong loan growth during the first quarter of 2018. Furthermore, the increase in salaries and benefits of $3 million over last year is primarily due to the hiring of additional relationship managers, production support personnel and an SBA group.\nFor the quarter, total assets increased $59 million, or 13% annualized from year end December 31, 2017 to $1.9 billion. This was driven by an increase in deposits of $88 million, or 22% annualized growth from year end. Total loans increased $79 million to $1 billion, or 35% annualized growth from year end. This resulted in an increase in the loan to deposit ratio to 58% from 56% during the quarter. At March 31, 2018, non-interest bearing deposits represented 51% of total deposits. “This quarterly growth surpassed our expectations and reflects our commitment to and reception from small and medium size business customers who crave the value added service we provide,” said Leon Blankstein, ABB’s President, CEO and Director.\nFrom a year ago, total assets increased $114 million or 6%, from March 31, 2017. This was driven by an increase in deposits of $177 million, or 11% over the twelve months. Total loans increased $165 million, or 20% from a year ago. This resulted in an increase in the loan to deposit ratio to 58% from 54% a year ago.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Bank sold all of its treasury stock that it had at year end 2017; this generated an increase in capital of $1.6 million.\nAsset quality at the end of the first quarter remains excellent with non-performing assets to total assets of 0.06%, $1.2 million in non-performing loans, and no Other Real Estate Owned (OREO). At the end of the quarter, the allowance for loan losses stood at $14.5 million, or 1.45% of total loans. For 2018 year to date, the Bank had a recovery of ($16,000).\nNet Interest Income increased $1.4 million, or 11% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the organic loan growth the Bank achieved in that period coupled with an increase in the loan yield to 4.48% for 2018 year to date.\nNon-Interest Income decreased in 2018 year over year. During the first quarter of 2018, the Bank realized securities losses of ($195,000) compared to realized securities gains of $40,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The reduction of the securities portfolio during the period was related to continued restructuring and repositioning in response to the Tax Reform Act and heightened loan demand. However, during the quarter the Bank recorded a gain on sale of SBA loans of $105,000 generated by the new SBA group.\nNon-Interest Expense increased for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year with the hiring of new personnel in the fourth quarter of 2017. “This investment we believe will yield greater profitability in the future as the new hires combined with the existing relationship management team continue to grow good credit quality loans and low cost core deposits,” said Karen Schoenbaum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAdditionally, one of the Bank’s founders and its former Chief Credit Officer, Robin Paterson took early retirement effective March 15, 2018 after 20 years of contributions to the Bank. “He was not only my partner, but also an outstanding banker,” said Leon Blankstein, ABB’s President, CEO and Director. “We are fortunate that another original employee of the Bank who Robin mentored, Patti Vollmer, has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer from Deputy Chief Credit Officer. Patti has been trained by the best and will continue our strong credit culture.” The early retirement increased salaries and benefits by $979,000 in the quarter.\n“In this same quarter we have been thrilled to announce receipt of the Preferred Lenders Program (“PLP”) participant status with the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”),” said Stephen Pihl, Regional EVP and SBA Department Manager. “This is the highest bank designation granted by the SBA and is reserved only for top tier bank lenders.”\nAMERICAN BUSINESS BANK, headquartered in downtown Los Angeles, offers a wide range of financial services to the business marketplace.
