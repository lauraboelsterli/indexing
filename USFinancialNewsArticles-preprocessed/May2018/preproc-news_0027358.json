(NASDAQ:FGEN), a science-based biopharmaceutical company, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and provided an update on the company’s recent developments.\n“FibroGen and AstraZeneca are preparing to complete patient enrollment in five Phase 3 roxadustat CKD anemia trials this quarter. We look forward to reporting topline data in the fourth quarter of this year. With our partners, we are continuing to see positive data from our global roxadustat Phase 3 programs, most recently in Japan from Astellas,” said Thomas B. Neff, FibroGen’s Chief Executive Officer. “Pamrevlumab continues to reveal its potential in the treatment of fibrotic and fibro-proliferative diseases. We are working towards achieving regulatory alignment with the FDA on pivotal study designs for both IPF and pancreatic cancer. We will be presenting data at the ATS conference in May from our placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in IPF representing the first known significant attenuation of fibrosis progression as measured by quantitative HRCT, and we will report Phase 2 data at ASCO in June showing that a majority of unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with pamrevlumab and chemotherapy were assessed as resectable after six months of treatment. We will also report that there appears to be a survival benefit in this study for patients who have undergone tumor resection. Patients continue to be followed in this study for survival.”\nRecent Developments and Highlights\nRoxadustat for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the U.S. and ROW\nPhase 3 trial enrollment to complete in the second quarter of 2018 Topline Phase 3 clinical studies data expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 In its most recent review in March, the DSMB recommended Phase 3 clinical studies continue under current protocols with no changes\nRoxadustat for Anemia in CKD in China\nNDA review by the State Drug Administration, or SDA (formerly the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA) is ongoing; anticipate regulatory approval by year-end 2018\nRoxadustat for Anemia in CKD in Japan\nPositive topline data from two Phase 3 studies in dialysis-dependent CKD patients with anemia, a long-term ESA conversion study and an ESA-naïve correction study, were reported in April 2018 by our partner Astellas Astellas expects to submit a NDA for anemia associated with dialysis-dependent-CKD in Japan in 2018 Astellas expects data readout in one of the Japan Phase 3 studies in non-dialysis-dependent CKD anemia patients in the fourth quarter of 2018\nPamrevlumab for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)\nMultiple abstracts accepted for presentation at the 2018 American Thoracic Society (ATS) Conference in May\n° Results from our Phase 2 IPF clinical trial\n- HRCT quantitative imaging of lung fibrosis;\n- Health-related quality of life assessments; and\n- PK/PD modeling\n° Preclinical results from a highly predictive animal model of lung fibrosis.\nPamrevlumab for Pancreatic Cancer\nFast Track designation granted by the FDA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer in the first quarter of 2018 Phase 2 clinical trial results have been accepted for presentation at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting\nPamrevlumab for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy\nCompleted clinical trial enrollment in the first quarter of 2018\nCorporate and Financial\nNet loss for the first quarter was $41.4 million, or ($0.50) per share, compared to $30.6 million, or ($0.48) per share, for the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to ongoing investments in our research and development and general and administrative initiatives We recast our condensed consolidated statement of operations and condensed balance sheet from the amounts previously reported upon the adoption of the new revenue guidance under Accounting Standards Codification 606 as of January 1, 2018. The impact for the first quarter 2017 was a $2.6 million increase in revenue. The cumulative reduction in revenue of $34.7 million through 2017 for all years impacted on a fully retrospective basis, will be recognized over the future remaining development periods. At March 31, 2018, FibroGen had $730.4 million of cash, restricted time deposits, cash equivalents, investments, and receivables The weighted average number of common shares used to calculate net loss per share was 82.9 million shares and 64.0 million shares for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, reflecting equity offerings completed in 2017. Total shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018 were 83.4 million shares.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nFibroGen will host a conference call and webcast today, Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss financial results and provide a business update.

Roxadustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), promotes erythropoiesis, or the production of red blood cells, by increasing endogenous erythropoietin, improving iron regulation, and reducing hepcidin, including in the presence of inflammation and without need for supplemental intravenous iron.\nThe roxadustat Phase 3 program is the largest Phase 3 clinical program in anemia to date, and is supported by extensive Phase 2 results demonstrating correction and maintenance of hemoglobin levels in anemia in multiple subpopulations of CKD dialysis and non-dialysis patients. A New Drug Application (NDA) has been accepted for review by the State Drug Administration, or SDA (formerly the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA). In the U.S., data readout for the Phase 3 program is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018. Roxadustat is also in Phase 3 clinical development in the U.S. and Europe, and expected to shortly enter Phase 2/3 development in China, for anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). For information about roxadustat studies currently recruiting patients, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov .\nAbout Pamrevlumab\nPamrevlumab is a first-in-class antibody developed by FibroGen to inhibit the activity of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a common factor in fibrotic and proliferative disorders characterized by persistent and excessive scarring that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. Pamrevlumab is advancing towards Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pancreatic cancer, and is currently in a Phase 2 trial for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Pamrevlumab has been well tolerated in multiple Phase 2 clinical studies, with a good safety and tolerability profile. For information about pamrevlumab studies currently recruiting patients, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov .\nAbout FibroGen\nFibroGen, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, with subsidiary offices in Beijing and Shanghai, People’s Republic of China, is a leading science-based biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing a pipeline of first-in-class therapeutics. The company applies its pioneering expertise in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) biology, and clinical development to advance innovative medicines for the treatment of anemia, fibrotic disease, and cancer. Roxadustat, the company’s most advanced product candidate, is an oral small molecule inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylase activity in worldwide Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), except in China, where a New Drug Application is currently under review by the State Drug Administration, or SDA (formerly the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA). Roxadustat is in Phase 3 clinical development in the U.S. and Europe, and expected to shortly enter Phase 2/3 development in China, for anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Pamrevlumab, a human monoclonal anti-CTGF antibody, is advancing towards Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pancreatic cancer, and is currently in a Phase 2 trial for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
