    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: A) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Lausanne, Switzerland-based Genohm, a developer of highly differentiated, on-premise and cloud-based software solutions for laboratory management.\nGenohm’s main laboratory software automation suite, SLIMS, is a digital platform that provides laboratories with a rapidly deployable and seamless laboratory information management system (LIMS) and electronic lab notebook (ELN) environment that is used in biobanks, research labs and next gen sequencing facilities. This acquisition enhances Agilent’s current software portfolio, adding LIMS and workflow management, while expanding ELN capability. This combination will allow Agilent to bring greater context to analytical data, enabling scientists to generate results more efficiently.\n“We are pleased to complete our acquisition of Genohm,” said John Sadler, Vice President and General Manager of Agilent’s Software and Informatics Division. “Agilent and Genohm are both focused on customer-centric innovation and committed to helping our customers do more with their data. The addition of Genohm’s SLIMS platform is an outstanding strategic fit with our company, and together we look forward to accelerating development of the digital lab.”\nFinancial terms are not being disclosed.\nAbout Agilent Technologies\nAgilent Technologies Inc.
