Talend considers these non-IFRS financial measures to be important because they provide useful indicators of its performance and liquidity measures. These are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the performance of a company. Non-IFRS financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only for understanding the company’s operating performance. The non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, and may be different from non-IFRS financial measures presented by other companies. Please see the reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measure included in this release below.\nNon-IFRS gross profit is calculated by adjusting gross profit to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nNon-IFRS gross margin , expressed as a percentage, is calculated as non-IFRS gross profit divided by total revenue.\nNon-IFRS loss from operations is calculated by adjusting loss from operations to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, acquisition related expense and costs related to follow-on offering and shelf registration statement.\nNon-IFRS operating margin , expressed as a percentage, is calculated as non-IFRS loss from operations divided by total revenue.\nNon-IFRS net loss is calculated by adjusting net loss to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, acquisition related expense and costs related to follow-on offering and shelf registration statement.\nNon-IFRS cost of revenue is calculated by adjusting cost of revenue to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nNon-IFRS operating expenses is calculated by adjusting operating expenses to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, acquisition related expense and costs related to follow-on offering and shelf registration statement.\nNon-IFRS sales and marketing expense is calculated by adjusting sales and marketing expense to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nNon-IFRS research and development expense is calculated by adjusting research and development expense to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nNon-IFRS general and administrative expense is calculated by adjusting general and administrative expense to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, acquisition related expense and costs related to follow-on offering and shelf registration statement.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash from (used in) operating activities less cash used in investing activities for acquisition of property and equipment and intangible assets.\nSubscription revenue growth on a constant currency basis represents subscription revenue adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. Subscription revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated by applying the average monthly currency rates for each month in the comparative period to the corresponding month in the current period. We believe the disclosure of subscription revenue in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors considering potential significant fluctuations in currency rates.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
