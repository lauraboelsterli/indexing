Net revenues from our mobile audience solutions also experienced an increase of 70% from the first quarter of 2017. On top of our robust growth, we are also delighted to realize a positive adjusted EBITDA earlier than expected. Looking forward to the remaining quarters of 2018, we believe that our investment in enhancing our leadership in the mobile marketing market will bear fruit, as the whole industry shifts focus from PC-end to mobile-end. Building on our technology that empowers more cost-efficient marketing distribution as well as our unparalleled datasets, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous market opportunity that is unfolding before us.”\n1 For more details on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.\nFirst quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Updates:\nNet revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 36.1% to US$35.2 million from US$25.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in net revenues from mobile audience solutions and partially offset by a decrease in net revenues from other solutions.\nNet revenues from mobile audience solutions for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 70.0% to US$30.9 million from US$18.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of the Company’s strategic focus shifting to capture more market demand in mobile audience solutions.\nNet revenues from other solutions for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 43.7% to US$4.3 million from US$7.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of the Company’s continued strategic shift away from other solutions.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 27.8% to US$8.1 million from US$6.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in gross profit from mobile audience solutions and partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from other solutions.\nTotal operating expenses decreased by 8.5% to US$9.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 from US$10.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower headcount and a decrease in share-based compensation expenses from US$1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 to US$0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nOperating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was US$1.7 million, compared with US$4.4 million during the first quarter of 2017, as a result of the above.\nNet loss totaled US$0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, decreasing from US$12.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss attributable to the Company’s shareholders per diluted ADS was US$0.0021, compared with US$0.4635 in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross billing 2 reached US$91.9 million during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 96.0% from the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of significant growth in mobile audience solutions. Gross billing from mobile audience solutions was US$73.6 million during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 194.4% from the first quarter of 2017, as a result of clients generating larger mobile marketing spend. Gross billing from other solutions was US$18.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 16.3% from the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of the strategic focus shifting to mobile audience solutions.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was US$0.4 million, compared with a loss of US$1.9 million during the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of a substantial decrease of the operating loss. For a reconciliation of the Company’s adjusted EBITDA to net loss, its most comparable GAAP measure, please refer to “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”\nAdjusted net loss for the first quarter of 2018 attributable to the Company’s shareholders, which excludes share-based compensation expenses, fair value loss on derivative liabilities, and other losses/(gains), decreased to US$1.4 million from US$3.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.

The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss provide useful information about the Company’s operating results, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, and diluted adjusted net loss per ADS should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, and diluted adjusted net loss per ADS presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company’s data. The Company encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this press release.\nStatement Regarding Preliminary Unaudited Financial Information\nThe unaudited financial information set out in this press release is preliminary and subject to potential adjustments.
