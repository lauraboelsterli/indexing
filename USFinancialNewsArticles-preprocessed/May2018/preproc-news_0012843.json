His success with Townsquare Interactive played a meaningful role in the Company’s successful IPO in 2014.\nDuring his tenure as VP of local and national/franchise sales at Yodle, alongside a talented team, he helped build the sales channels from the ground up, growing revenue from less than 1 million to more than 80 million over four years.\n\"Selling to small and medium sized businesses often comes with high client churn, but Spectio's superb client retention rate reflects the quality of their products. I am excited to join a Company that is committed to providing fantastic value to its clients,” said Ron Merritt, CRO of Spectrio. “I look forward to building out the best digital savvy sales team in Charlotte. With Spectrio, our talented professionals will have an unmatched opportunity to grow their careers and income.”\nSpectrio is headquartered in Tampa, Fla., with its main sales and marketing office in Charlotte, N.C., and three additional locations nationwide. The Company plans to further expand the team throughout the country, continuing to build its talent pool while providing best in class solutions and support to customers.\nAbout Spectrio\nSpectrio is one of the nation's leading providers of in-store marketing solutions powered by content and technology.
