    "text": "PARIS, May 30 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron urged the world’s biggest economic powers to start talks to reform the World Trade Organization to prevent current tensions from spiralling into trade wars.\n“This is about a complete update of global competition rules,” Macron said in a speech on multilateralism at the OECD. “All sides always lose in a trade war.”\nHe said he would suggest starting talks with the EU, United States, China and Japan to reach a roadmap for the next G-20 meeting in Argentina at the end of the year.
