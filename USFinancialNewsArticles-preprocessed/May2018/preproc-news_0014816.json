Regarding inflation, though, he said: Im not ready yet to declare victory.\nDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan meanwhile, in an interview with CNBC, played down the lack of wage growth in Friday's jobs report.\n\"I think this may be just a one month aberration. Everything I see tells me there's more wage pressure out there,\" Kaplan said. \"For me I think the Fed should continue to gradually remove accommodation.\" (Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir in Washington; Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider in Stanford, California; Richard Leong in New York; Writing by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",
