    "text": "Santa Fe school shooter's family express shock over teen's rampage The family of Dmitrios Pagourtzis says what happened \"seems incompatible with the boy we love\" Ten people have died after a shooting at a Houston-area high school on Friday Local authorities have one suspect in custody and have detained another individual deemed a person of interest Published 20 Hours Ago The Associated Press\nThe family of the 17-year-old student who opened fire on his Texas high school, killing 10 people and wounding 13 others, says what happened \"seems incompatible with the boy we love.\"\nDmitrios Pagourtzis family said in a statement Saturday, \"We are as shocked and confused as anyone else by these events that occurred\" while offering prayers and condolences to the victims.\nThe family said it remained \"mostly in the dark about the specifics of yesterday's tragedy\" but \"what we have learned from media reports seems incompatible with the boy we love.\" It added, \"We share the public's hunger for answers as to why this happened, and will await the outcome of the investigation before speaking about these events.\"\nPagourtzis is being held on capital murder charges. Investigators say he admitted \"shooting multiple people.\"\nMeanwhile, authorities have released the names of the 10 people who were killed in the mass shooting at a Texas high school.\nThe Galveston County medical examiner's office and sheriff's office issued a statement Saturday listing those killed as: Glenda Perkins; Cynthia Tisdale; Kimberly Vaughan; Shana Fisher; Angelique Ramirez; Christian Riley Garcia; Jared Black; Sabika Sheikh; Christopher Jake Stone; and Aaron Kyle McLeod.\nPerkins and Tisdale were teachers. The others were students at Santa Fe High School.",
