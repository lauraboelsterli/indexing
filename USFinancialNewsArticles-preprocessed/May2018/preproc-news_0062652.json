There will inevitably be push-back from the industry but it cannot fail the customers who desperately need to be protected by this cap,” said Citizens Advice, a charity that helps people tackle money problems.\nGreg Stevens, chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, said caps would be counterproductive as they force borrowers to find alternatives that may not be regulated.\n“We’ll have to see where the review gets to, but we’re pleased the FCA will be undertaking a proper cost-benefit analysis,” Stevens said. FUNDAMENTAL REFORM\nThe way banks operate and charge for overdrafts also needs fundamental reform, the FCA said.\nBanks earned 2.3 billion pounds from overdrafts in 2016, with nearly a third from unarranged overdrafts, most of which are paid by just 1.5 percent of customers who pay about 450 pounds a year in fees and charges.\n“The FCA is putting forward some immediate proposals today for overdrafts that it believes will save customers up to 140 million pounds a year,” the watchdog said.\n“Beyond that, the FCA will consider more radical options to ban fixed fees and end the distinctions around unarranged overdraft prices.”\nIf appropriate, these options will be consulted on later this year as part of the watchdog’s separate ongoing review of retail banking.\nThe FCA proposed stronger protections for customers who take out credit from firms who collect repayments in the home, known as doorstep lending, with the aim of saving customers 34 million pounds a year, but stopped short of considering caps.\nConsultants PwC said the FCA’s overall package posed various challenges for firms.\n“As they factor in the additional processes required and restrictions on borrowing and costs, they will need to consider whether certain business models are sustainable in the long term,” said John Coley, PwC’s financial services risk and regulatory director. $1 = 0.7509 pounds Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Mark Potter and Susan Fenton",
