(“Badger”) is pleased to announce its May 2018 cash dividend.\nMay 2018 Cash Dividend\nBadger today announced that the directors of Badger declared a cash dividend for the month of May 2018 of $0.045 per share, which equates to $0.54 per share on an annualized basis. Payment will be made on or about June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 31, 2018.\nBadger expects that the dividend will be an “eligible dividend” for Canadian income tax purposes and thus qualify for the enhanced gross-up and tax credit regime for certain shareholders.\nAbout Badger Daylighting Ltd.\nBadger Daylighting Ltd.
