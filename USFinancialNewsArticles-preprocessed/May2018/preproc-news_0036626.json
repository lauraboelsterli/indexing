Soccer Football - Europa League Final - Olympique de Marseille vs Atletico Madrid - Groupama Stadium, Lyon, France - May 16, 2018 Marseille's Dimitri Payet is consoled by Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Morgan Sanson as he leaves the pitch in tears after sustaining an injury REUTERS/Vincent Kessler\nPayet was a fitness doubt for the final against Atletico Madrid after missing Friday’s 3-3 draw at Guingamp but declared himself ready to play the day before the showpiece game in Lyon.\nHe was crying as he left the pitch in the 32nd minute to be replaced by Maxime Lopez. Slideshow (2 Images)\nThe former West Ham United midfielder was a key figure in France’s run to the Euro 2016 final, although he has not featured for the national team since a 2-1 win over Belarus on Oct. 10.\nThe 30-year-old had made a strong bid for a recall by coach Didier Deschamps with an impressive run of form which included inspiring Marseille to the Europa League final, but his injury may have ended his chances of playing in the tournament.\nDeschamps is due to make name his squad on Thursday.
