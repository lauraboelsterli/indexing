We achieved 3.9% same-store RevPAR growth and expanded hotel EBITDA margins by 60 bps on our new investment platform hotels. Our differentiated investment thesis and our intensive asset management efforts are responsible for our favorable operating performance in the quarter.\nIn addition to our strong operating results, we also achieved notable portfolio accomplishments. In the first quarter, we sold two legacy hotel assets generating gross proceeds of $8.2 million and acquired two new investment platform hotels, located in Austin and Charleston, for $36.1 million. We now have only three legacy hotels remaining, one of which is under contract to be sold. Additionally, with the acquisition of the two new investment platform hotels, we have now assembled a portfolio of 15 high-quality, select-service assets in attractive growth markets with an average age of less than 4 years.”\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s total portfolio included 18 hotels, representing 2,215 rooms.\nTotal Company Financial Results\n($ in millions except per share amounts)\nThree months 2017 Change Revenue $ 16.7 $ 10.4 61.0% Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders $ 0.6 $ (14.0 ) N/A Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share $ 0.05 $ (4.75 ) N/A Funds from Operations (FFO)* $ 3.3 $ (0.7 ) N/A FFO per Diluted Share* $ 0.26 $ (4.19 ) N/A Adjusted FFO* $ 3.5 $ 0.3 994.4% Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share* $ 0.29 $ 0.10 190.0% Hotel EBITDA* $ 7.4 $ 4.0 83.8% Adjusted EBITDAre* $ 5.8 $ 2.5 135.7% *Please see the Reg.

We report Funds from Operations (“FFO”), Adjusted FFO (“AFFO”), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA for real estate (“EBITDAre”), Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA as non-GAAP measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating results and which management uses to facilitate a periodic evaluation of our operating results relative to those of our peers. Our non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to U.S. GAAP net earnings as an indication of financial performance or to U.S. GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, these measures are not indicative of funds available to fund cash needs or our ability to make cash distributions as they have not been adjusted to consider cash requirements for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, debt service obligations, or other commitments.\nFFO and AFFO\nThe following table reconciles net earnings (loss) to FFO and AFFO for the three months and 2017 (in thousands). All amounts presented include our portion of the results of our unconsolidated Atlanta JV.\nThree months ended March 31, Reconciliation of Net earnings (loss) to FFO and AFFO\n2018 2017 Net earnings (loss) $ 792 $ (2,400 ) Depreciation and amortization expense 2,259 1,051 Depreciation and amortization expense from JV 285 354 Net loss on disposition of assets 24 3 Net loss on disposition of assets from JV 7 1 Impairment loss (recovery), net (93 ) 271 FFO 3,274 (720 ) Dividends declared and in kind dividends deemed on preferred stock (144 ) (11,603 ) FFO attributable to common shares and common units 3,130 (12,323 ) Net gain on derivatives and convertible debt (447 ) (175 ) Acquisition and terminated transactions expense 19 502 Equity transactions expense - 343 Loss on debt extinguishment - 800 Stock-based compensation and LTIP expense 402 77 Amortization of deferred financing fees 353 136 Amortization of deferred financing fees from JV 45 57 Non-recurring dividends above stated rates declared and in kind dividends deemed on preferred stock - 10,903 AFFO attributable to common shares and common units $ 3,502 $ 320 FFO attributable to common shares and common units - Basic Shares $ 3,130 $ (12,323 ) Preferred dividends and fair value adjustments 111 - FFO attributable to common shares and common units - Diluted Shares $ 3,241 $ (12,323 ) FFO per common share and common unit - Basic $ 0.26 $ (4.19 ) FFO per common share and common unit - Diluted $ 0.26 $ (4.19 ) Weighted average common shares and common units - Basic FFO 11,835,279 3,089,987 Weighted average common shares and common units - Diluted FFO 12,536,203 3,089,987 AFFO attributable to common shares and common units - Basic Shares $ 3,502 $ 320 Convertible note interest 16 - Preferred dividends at stated rates 144 - AFFO attributable to common shares and common units - Diluted Shares $ 3,662 $ 320 AFFO per common share and common unit - Basic $ 0.30 $ 0.10 AFFO per common share and common unit - Diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.10 Weighted average common shares and common units - Basic 11,835,279 3,089,987 Weighted average common shares and common units - Diluted 12,633,472 3,106,961 We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), which defines FFO as net earnings or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate assets, impairment, and the depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. FFO is calculated both for the Company in total and as FFO attributable to common shares and common units, which is FFO reduced by preferred stock dividends. AFFO is FFO attributable to common shares and common units adjusted to exclude items we do not believe are representative of the results from our core operations, including non-cash gains or losses on derivatives and convertible debt, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of certain fees, losses on debt extinguishment, and in-kind dividends above stated rates, and cash charges for acquisition and equity transaction costs. All REITs do not calculate FFO and AFFO in the same manner; therefore, our calculation may not be the same as the calculation of FFO and AFFO for similar REITs.\nWe consider FFO to be a useful additional measure of performance for an equity REIT because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that FFO provides a meaningful indication of our performance. We believe that AFFO provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and FFO, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We present FFO and AFFO per common share and common unit because our common units are redeemable for common shares. We believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO and AFFO applicable to common shares and common units.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles net earnings (loss) to EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA for the three months and 2017 (in thousands). All amounts presented our portion of the results of our unconsolidated Atlanta JV.\nThree months ended March 31, Reconciliation of Net earnings (loss) to EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA\n2018 2017 Net earnings (loss) $ 792 $ (2,400 ) Interest expense 1,928 971 Interest expense from JV 492 662 Loss on debt extinguishment - 800 Income tax expense 129 - Depreciation and amortization expense 2,259 1,051 Depreciation and amortization expense from JV 285 354 EBITDA 5,885 1,438 Net loss on disposition of assets 24 3 Net loss on disposition of assets from JV 7 1 Impairment loss (recovery), net (93 ) 271 EBITDAre 5,823 1,713 Net gain on derivatives and convertible debt (447 ) (175 ) Stock-based compensation and LTIP expense 402 77 Acquisition and terminated transactions expense 19 502 Equity transactions expense - 343 Adjusted EBITDAre 5,797 2,460 General and administrative expense, excluding stock compensation and LTIP expense 1,467 1,415 Other expense, net 14 1 Unallocated hotel and property operations expense 89 132 Hotel EBITDA $ 7,367 $ 4,008 Revenue $ 16,679 $ 10,361 JV revenue 2,618 2,989 Condor and JV revenue $ 19,297 $ 13,350 Hotel EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 38.2 % 30.0 % We calculate EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre by adding back to net earnings or loss certain non-operating expenses and certain non-cash charges which are based on historical cost accounting that we believe may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance. We believe these adjustments can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and amortization and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods. In calculating EBITDA, we add back to net earnings or loss interest expense, loss on debt extinguishment, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. NAREIT adopted EBITDAre in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We adjust EBITDA by adding back net gain/loss on disposition of assets and impairment charges to calculate EBITDAre. To calculate Adjusted EBITDAre, we adjust EBITDAre to add back acquisition and terminated transactions expense and equity transactions expense, which are cash charges. We also add back stock –based compensation expense and gain/loss on derivatives and convertible debt, which are non-cash charges. EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe believe EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre to be useful additional measures of our operating performance, excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense), our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense), and other items we do not believe are representative of the results from our core operations.\nThe Company further excludes general and administrative expenses, other non-operating income or expense, and certain hotel and property operations expenses that are not allocated to individual properties in assessing hotel performance (primarily certain general liability and other insurance costs, land lease costs, and office and banking fees) from Adjusted EBITDAre to calculate Hotel EBITDA. Hotel EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nHotel EBITDA is intended to isolate property level operational performance over which the Company’s hotel operators have direct control. We believe Hotel EBITDA is helpful to investors as it better communicates the comparability of our hotels’ operating results for all of the Company’s hotel properties and is used by management to measure the performance of the Company’s hotels and the effectiveness of the operators of the hotels.\nSame-Store Revenue and Hotel EBITDA\nThe following tables present our same-store revenue, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA margin broken down by property type for the three months and 2017 (in thousands) and reconcile these same-store measures to total revenue and Hotel EBITDA as presented above. Same-store results include all our hotels owned at March 31, 2018, with the exception of the Austin TownePlace Suites, opened on January 3, 2017, and the Summerville Home2 Suites, opened on July 18, 2017 (no prior period results available) and reflect the performance of these hotels during the entire period, regardless of our ownership during the period presented. Results for the hotels for periods prior to our ownership were provided to us by prior owners and have not been adjusted by us or audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. All amounts presented operations as well as our portion of the results of our unconsolidated Atlanta Aloft JV. Results for periods prior to the Company’s ownership have not been included in the Company’s actual consolidated financial statements and are included here only for comparison purposes.\nRevenue - Reconciliation of Same-\nStore to Actual\nThree months 2017 Condor and JV Revenue – Actual* $ 19,297 $ 13,350 Revenue earned on properties owned at March 31, 2018 prior to the Company’s ownership, excluding the Austin TownePlace Suites and the Summerville Home2 Suites - 7,094 Revenue earned on properties disposed of prior to March 31, 2018 during the period of ownership (397 ) (2,818 ) Revenue earned on Austin TownePlace Suites and Summerville Home2 Suites subsequent to ownership (1,413 ) - Total Revenue – Same-Store* $ 17,487 $ 17,626 Revenue – Same-Store by Type Three months 2017 New investment platform* $ 16,015 $ 16,119 Legacy held for use 265 379 Legacy held for sale 1,207 1,128 Total Revenue – Same-Store* $ 17,487 $ 17,626 Hotel EBITDA – Reconciliation of\nSame-Store to Actual\nThree months 2017 Condor and JV Hotel EBITDA – Actual* $ 7,367 $ 4,008 Hotel EBITDA earned on properties owned at March 31, 2018 prior to the Company’s ownership, excluding the Austin TownePlace Suites and the Summerville Home2 Suites - 2,993 Hotel EBITDA earned on properties disposed of prior to March 31, 2018 during the period of ownership (42 ) (436 ) Hotel EBITDA earned on Austin TownePlace Suites and Summerville Home2 Suites subsequent to ownership (707 ) - Total Hotel EBITDA – Same-Store* $ 6,618 $ 6,565 Hotel EBITDA – Same-Store by Type Three months 2017 New investment platform* $ 6,237 $ 6,177 Legacy held for use 43 77 Legacy held for sale 338 311 Total Hotel EBITDA – Same-Store* $ 6,618 $ 6,565 Hotel EBITDA Margin by Property Type Three months 2017 New investment platform 38.9 % 38.3 % Legacy held for use 16.2 % 20.3 % Legacy held for sale 28.0 % 27.6 % Total Portfolio – Same-Store 37.8 % 37.2 % * Due to differences in the allocation of JV preferred returns, JV activity was 100% attributed to Condor in the first quarter of 2017 and 80% attributed to Condor in the first quarter of 2018\nNon-GAAP Measures Included in 2018 Guidance and Outlook\nThe following tables reconcile forecast net earnings to forecast FFO and AFFO and forecast EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2018 (in millions, except per share amounts) using the definitions of these non-GAAP measures as discussed above.\n2018 Outlook ($ in millions except per share amounts) Low High RevPAR growth (13 new investment platform hotels owned as of December 31, 2017) 3.0 % 4.5 % 2018 Outlook for 17-Hotel Portfolio Forecast hotel revenue $ 74.0 $ 75.4 Forecast net earnings $ 1.7 $ 2.5 Forecast earnings per share - Diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.16 Forecast Hotel EBITDA* $ 28.8 $ 29.7 Forecast AFFO per common share and common unit - Diluted* $ 1.13 $ 1.19 Low High Forecast net earnings $ 1.7 $ 2.5 Interest expense 8.5 8.5 Depreciation and amortization expense 11.4 11.4 Forecast EBITDA 21.5 22.4 Net gain on disposition of assets - - Forecast EBITDAre 21.5 22.4 Acquisitions and terminated transactions expense - - Stock-based compensation and LTIP expense 1.0 1.0 Forecast Adjusted EBITDAre 22.5 23.4 Cash general and administrative expense and other expenses 6.3 6.3 Forecast Hotel EBITDA (17 Hotels) $ 28.8 $ 29.7 Low High Forecast net earnings $ 1.7 $ 2.5 Depreciation and amortization expense 11.4 11.4 Net gain on disposition of assets - - Forecast FFO 13.1 13.9 Preferred dividends (0.6 ) (0.6 ) Forecast FFO attributable to common shares and common units 12.5 13.3 Acquisitions and terminated transactions expense - - Stock-based compensation and LTIP expense 1.0 1.0 Amortization of deferred financing fees 0.2 0.2 Forecast AFFO attributable to common shares and common units - Basic $ 13.7 $ 14.5 Forecast AFFO attributable to common shares and common units - Diluted $ 14.3 $ 15.1 Forecast AFFO per common share and common unit - Diluted $ 1.13 $ 1.19 Diluted common shares and common units 12.7 12.7 Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc.
