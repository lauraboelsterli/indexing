    "text": "Nolan Arenado, Chris Iannetta and David Dahl had two RBIs apiece Monday night as the Colorado Rockies never trailed in beating the visiting San Francisco Giants, 11-4, at Coors Field.\nThe Rockies have won the first two games of the three-game series and their last three games overall.\nThe Giants have lost three straight and likely absorbed another loss to their decimated pitching staff Tuesday when starter Jeff Samardzija left after one inning due to tightness in his right shoulder. San Francisco is already without top starters Johnny Cueto (elbow) and Madison Bumgarner (finger) and closer Mark Melancon (elbow), though Bumgarner is expected to return to the rotation next week.\nArenado opened the scoring in the first with an RBI groundout. Trevor Story extended the lead to 2-0 two batters later with a run-scoring triple.\nThe Rockies scored the final runs they’d need in the fourth, when winning pitcher Kyle Freeland scored on an error by second baseman Kelby Tomlinson and Gerardo Parra and Arenado hit back-to-back RBI doubles.\nIannetta lofted a sacrifice fly in the fifth and delivered an RBI single during a four-run seventh in which Ian Desmond had a run-scoring double and Dahl hit a pinch-hit two-run homer. Carlos Gonzalez accounted for the Rockies’ final run with an RBI single in the eighth.\nParra, Arenado, Gonzalez, Desmond and Iannetta all had two hits apiece for the Rockies, who finished with 15 hits.\nFreeland (5-5) allowed three runs on eight hits and no walks while striking out three over 5 1/3 innings.\nEvan Longoria homered in the sixth and eighth for the Giants. It was the 18th multi-homer game of Longoria’s career and his first for San Francisco, which acquired him from the Tampa Bay Rays last December.\nPitcher Dereck Rodriguez made his major league debut in relief and collected his first hit, an RBI double in the fifth inning, and Buster Posey homered in the sixth. Andrew McCutchen, Brandon Belt and Mac Williamson had two hits each.\nSamardzija (1-4) allowed two runs on three hits and no walks while striking out one.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
