They’re looking for a lot more things like analytics,” Chief Executive Sipho Maseko said at Telkom’s results presentation on Monday.\nSuch services include the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), cyber security solutions and big data analytics, which targets large and medium enterprises as well as the government.\nUnder Maseko, Telkom has also been expanding its mobile business to offset declines in traditional voice services.\n“Despite their lower margin compared to traditional revenue streams, the new-generation revenue streams (mobile and data) will ensure Telkom’s long-term sustainability,” Maseko said.\nTelkom is investing on migrating customers away from copper based technology to faster technologies such as fibre, LTE and VDSL as customers seek faster internet for richer content.\nHigh speed broadband customers increased 36.4 percent in the year to end-March while overall subscriber growth rose by 30.2 percent and mobile service revenue surged 47.2 percent.\nTelkom said headline earnings per share fell to 597 cents from 731.4 cents the previous year, hit by a higher tax rate and labour costs. But it reported better than expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), which fell by 3.6 percent, while profit after tax declined by 19.2 percent to 3.2 billion rand ($257 million).\nMaseko said he was not sure whether the South African government is still going ahead with plans to sell part of its 39 percent stake in Telkom, adding it may not be top of the list as the government may have found other means of supporting struggling state-owned entities.\nTelkom declared an annual dividend of 355 cents per share, down 16.3 percent.
