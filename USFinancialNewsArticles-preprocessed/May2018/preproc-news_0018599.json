    "text": "TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSE: OSG) (the “Company” or “OSG”) a provider of energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products in the U.S. Flag markets, today reported results for the first quarter 2018.\nHighlights\nNet income for the first quarter was $3.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared with net income of $5.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2017. Shipping revenues for the first quarter 2018 were $101.0 million, down 6.6% compared with the same period in 2017. Time charter equivalent (TCE) revenues (A) , a non-GAAP measure, for the first quarter 2018 were $88.8 million, down 13.2% compared with the first quarter 2017. Sequentially, shipping revenues and TCE revenues increased 8.9% and 7.3%, respectively, over the fourth quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA (B) , a non-GAAP measure, was $26.3 million, down 27.3% from $36.2 million in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.6% from the 2017 fourth quarter. Total cash (C) was $111.7 million as of March 31, 2018. Prepayments of $75.2 million were made during the first quarter 2018 for the Company’s OBS Term Loan.\nMr. Sam Norton, CEO, stated, “We saw marked improvement in our financial performance during the just completed quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Rising spot market rates, higher utilization rates, a renewal of time charter activity, and a rebound in our niche market businesses to historical norms all contributed to the improved results. We now have greater confidence that we have seen the bottom of the market for spot and time charter rates and that a sustained recovery in our conventional Jones Act trades is now well underway.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nShipping revenues were $101.0 million for the quarter, down 6.6% compared with the first quarter of 2017. TCE revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $88.8 million, a decrease of $13.5 million, or 13.2%, compared with the first quarter of 2017. This decrease reflected weakened market conditions, reduction of two vessels in operation in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the 2017 first quarter and a growing proportion of the Company's fleet becoming exposed to the spot markets.\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $13.6 million, compared to operating income of $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income for the first quarter was $3.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared with net income of $5.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $26.3 million for the first quarter, a decrease of $9.9 million compared with the first quarter of 2017, driven primarily by the decline in TCE revenues.\nA, B, C Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are included in the financial tables attached to this press release starting on Page 7. During the first quarter of 2018, market conditions firmed in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in higher TCE day rates for our product tankers operating in the spot market. Similar conditions occurred in spot market rates for ATBs; however, the benefit was reduced as utilization remains a challenge. These factors resulted in a 7.3% increase in TCE revenues and an increase in operating income to $13.6 million from $3.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA during the current quarter increased $3.6 million or 15.6% when compared to fourth quarter of 2017.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (“ET”) on Wednesday, May 9, 2018.\nTo access the call, participants should dial (844) 850-0546 for domestic callers and (412) 317-5203 for international callers.

The other components of net benefit cost would be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of income from operations. The Company adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2018 and has applied the guidance retrospectively.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets ($ in thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 (unaudited) ASSETS Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 111,467 $ 165,994 Restricted cash 58 58 Voyage receivables, including unbilled of $6,243 and $9,919 24,345 24,209 Income tax receivable 1,413 1,122 Receivable from INSW 34 372 Other receivables 1,944 2,184 Inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets 13,168 13,356 Total Current Assets 152,429 207,295 Vessels and other property, less accumulated depreciation 624,123 632,509 Deferred drydock expenditures, net 22,966 23,914 Total Vessels, Other Property and Deferred Drydock 647,089 656,423 Restricted cash - non current 191 217 Investments in and advances to affiliated companies 38 3,785 Intangible assets, less accumulated amortization 39,867 41,017 Other assets 21,348 23,150 Total Assets $ 860,962 $ 931,887 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current Liabilities: Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 34,029 $ 34,371 Current installments of long-term debt — 28,160 Total Current Liabilities 34,029 62,531 Reserve for uncertain tax positions 3,224 3,205 Long-term debt 375,762 420,776 Deferred income taxes, net 85,104 83,671 Other liabilities 45,584 48,466 Total Liabilities 543,703 618,649 Equity: Common stock - Class A ($0.01 par value; 166,666,666 shares authorized; 78,733,688 and 78,277,669 shares issued and outstanding) 787 783 Paid-in additional capital 586,043 584,675 Accumulated deficit (263,324 ) (265,758 ) 323,506 319,700 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (6,247 ) (6,462 ) Total Equity 317,259 313,238 Total Liabilities and Equity $ 860,962 $ 931,887 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows ($ in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net income $ 3,662 $ 5,429 Items included in net income not affecting cash flows: Depreciation and amortization 12,372 16,625 Amortization of debt discount and other deferred financing costs 1,106 1,334 Compensation relating to restricted stock awards and stock option grants 793 541 Deferred income tax provision 1,492 1,178 Reorganization items, non-cash — 214 Other – net 645 616 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 981 937 Distributed earnings of affiliated companies 3,747 3,657 Payments for drydocking (2,037 ) (730 ) SEC, Bankruptcy and IRS claim payments — (5,000 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities (1,789 ) (11,066 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 20,972 13,735 Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Payments on debt (28,166 ) — Extinguishment of debt (47,000 ) (15,225 ) Tax withholding on share-based awards (359 ) (1,060 ) Net cash used in financing activities (75,525 ) (16,285 ) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (54,553 ) (2,550 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 166,269 206,933 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 111,716 $ 204,383 The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC 230), Restricted Cash, which requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2018. The prior period has been adjusted to conform to current period presentation, which resulted in a decrease of $9,542 in net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017, related to changes in restricted cash amounts.\nSpot and Fixed TCE Rates Achieved and Revenue Days\nThe following tables provides a breakdown of TCE rates achieved for spot and fixed charters and the related revenue days for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the comparable period of 2017. Revenue days in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled 1,932 compared with 2,125 in the prior year quarter. A summary fleet list by vessel class can be found later in this press release.\n2018 2017 Three Months Ended March 31, Spot\nEarnings\nFixed\nEarnings\nSpot\nEarnings\nFixed\nEarnings\nJones Act Handysize Product Carriers: Average rate $ 41,227 $ 64,947 $ 45,061 $ 63,136 Revenue days 337 720 72 989 Non-Jones Act Handysize Product Carriers: Average rate $ 35,900 $ 62,542 $ 32,132 $ 15,543 Revenue days 172 8 112 68 ATBs: Average rate $ 12,230 $ 22,979 $ 17,057 $ 29,433 Revenue days 261 261 180 524 Lightering: Average rate $ 70,925 $ — $ 75,124 $ — Revenue days 173 — 180 — Fleet Information\nAs of March 31, 2018, OSG’s operating fleet consisted of 23 vessels, 13 of which were owned, with the remaining vessels chartered-in.

Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the following non-GAAP measures may provide certain investors with additional information that will better enable them to evaluate the Company’s performance. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures are intended to provide supplemental information, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared with GAAP.\n(A) Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) Revenues\nConsistent with general practice in the shipping industry, the Company uses TCE revenues, which represents shipping revenues less voyage expenses, as a measure to compare revenue generated from a voyage charter to revenue generated from a time charter. Time charter equivalent revenues, a non-GAAP measure, provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with shipping revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because it assists Company management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of its vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. Reconciliation of TCE revenues of the segments to shipping revenues as reported in the consolidated statements of operations follow:\nThree Months Ended ($ in thousands) March 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 Time charter equivalent revenues $ 88,778 $ 102,324 $ 82,754 Add: Voyage expenses 12,252 5,792 10,061 Shipping revenues $ 101,030 $ 108,116 $ 92,815 Vessel Operating Contribution\nVessel operating contribution, a non-GAAP measure, is TCE revenues minus vessel expenses and charter hire expenses.\nOur “niche market activities,” which includes Delaware Bay lightering, MSP vessels and shuttle tankers, continue to provide a stable operating platform underlying our total U.S. Flag operations. These vessels’ operations are insulated from the forces affecting the broader Jones Act market.\nThe following table sets forth the contribution of our vessels:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n($ in thousands) 2018 2017 Niche Market Activities $ 27,905 $ 25,467 Jones Act Handysize Tankers 2,306 8,050 ATBs 2,507 10,675 Vessel Operating Contribution $ 32,718 $ 44,192 (B) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net (loss)/income from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net (loss)/income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and (iii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used as a measure of operating results and performance, neither of them is necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. The following table reconciles net income/(loss) from continuing operations as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended ($ in thousands) March 31,\n2018 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 Net income $ 3,662 $ 5,429 $ 53,645 Income tax provision/(benefit) 1,202 3,569 (59,679 ) Interest expense 8,076 9,357 9,125 Depreciation and amortization 12,372 16,625 12,573 EBITDA 25,312 34,980 15,664 Severance costs — 16 — Loss on disposal of vessels and other property, including impairments — — 5,847 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 981 937 1,238 Reorganization items, net — 235 (8 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 26,293 $ 36,168 $ 22,741 (C) Total Cash\n($ in thousands) March 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nCash and cash equivalents $ 111,467 $ 165,994 Restricted cash - current 58 58 Restricted cash – non-current 191 217 Total Cash $ 111,716 $ 166,269\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509005329/en/\nInvestor Relations & Media:\nOverseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nSusan Allan, 813-209-0620\nsallan@osg.com\nSource: Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.",
