    "text": "LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - Britain’s competition regulator submitted its view on Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to buy all of Sky to the government on Tuesday, giving minister Matt Hancock 30 working days to deliver his final ruling on the deal.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating whether the deal, announced in December 2016, will give Murdoch too much influence in Britain’s news media.\nIf it receives the green light, Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox will go head-to-head with U.S. cable company Comcast, which made a rival $31 billion offer for the European pay-TV group on Wednesday.\nReporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton\n ",
