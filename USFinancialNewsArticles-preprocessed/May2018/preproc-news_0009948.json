Operating profit for 2017 was 12.22 billion yuan, up from 3.79 billion yuan a year ago.\nIt made a net loss of 43.89 billion yuan versus a profit of 491.6 million yuan in 2016, though this was impacted by the fair value changes of convertible redeemable preference shares.\nAlongside smartphones, Xiaomi makes dozens of internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, including scooters, air purifiers and rice cookers, although it derives most of its profits from internet services.\nIts relatively cheap handsets pose a rising challenge to market leaders Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc .\nXiaomi doubled its shipments in 2017 to become the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker, according to Counterpoint Research, defying a global slowdown in smartphone sales.\nIt is also making a big push outside China's borders, with 28 percent of its sales derived from overseas markets last year, up from 6.1 percent in 2015.\nYet margins on its smartphones are razor-thin. Xiaomi posted a gross profit margin of just 8.8 percent for its smartphone business in 2017 compared to 60 percent for its internet services business.\nAccording to some analyst estimates, Apple's flagship iPhone X and iPhone 8 have gross margins of around 60 percent.\nThe company makes the lion's share of its profit - 60 percent - from internet services, including gaming and advertising linked to its homegrown user interface, MIUI, which had 190 million monthly active users as of March 2018.\nDUAL-CLASS SHARES\nXiaomi's listing plans come as the company and its investors look to capitalise on a bull run for the Hong Kong market, which has seen the benchmark Hang Seng Index rise about 27 percent over the past year.\nArmed with the new rules allowing the listing of companies with dual-class structures, Hong Kong is eyeing several tech listings that are expected in the coming two years from Chinese firms with a combined market cap of $500 billion.\nXiaomi said in its IPO application the company would have a weighted voting rights (WVR) structure, or dual-class shares. The WVR give greater power to founding shareholders even with minority shareholding.\nThe structure would allow the company to benefit from the \"continuing vision and leadership\" of the dual-class share beneficiaries, who would control the company for its \"long-term prospects and strategy\", it said.\nDual-class shares have been a contentious topic in Hong Kong since the city's strict adherence to a one-share-one-vote principle cost it the float of Alibaba, which instead listed in New York.\nXiaomi is also likely to be among the first Chinese tech firms seeking a secondary listing in its home market, using the planned China depositary receipts route, two people with knowledge of the matter said.\nCLSA, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are sponsoring Xiaomi's IPO.\n($1 = 6.3610 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Cate Cadell in Beijing, Julie Zhu in Hong Kong and Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Writing by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing Stephen Coates)",
