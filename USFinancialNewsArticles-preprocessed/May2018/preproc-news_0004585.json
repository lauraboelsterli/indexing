    "text": "Reblog Deliveries likely slipped more than 5% during the month compared with the same period in 2017, according analyst estimates, partially because there were two fewer selling days this April. Rising oil prices and tougher credit conditions are also creating concern for auto executives hoping to maintain a selling pace near the record levels set in recent years. Sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks continue to perform well amid relatively low fuel prices.",
