    "text": "IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Power Equipment Group Inc. (OTC: GLPW) (“Global Power” or the “Company”) announced today that it intends to file a Form 12b-25, Notification of Late Filing, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for its first quarter 2018. The Company intends to remain current with its SEC filings by completing the Form 10-Q filing on May 21, 2018. Financial results are planned to be released after the markets close on Monday, May 21, 2018.\nGlobal Power will host a conference call to review financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018, on Tuesday, May 22, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

Additional information about Global Power can be found on its website: www.globalpower.com .\nForward-looking Statement Disclaimer\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the term set forth in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements include statements or expectations regarding the Company’s ability to meet its filing obligation in a timely manner and related matters. These statements reflect our current views of future events and financial performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the ability for the auditors to complete their review of the first quarter of 2018 financials in sufficient time. Our actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including our ability to prepare and finalize our first quarter of 2018 financial statements, the ability of our auditors to complete their review and audit of those financial statements in the expected timeframe and the Company’s ability to prepare and file the First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q. For example, additional information may arise during the course of the Company’s accounting review that would require the Company to make unanticipated additional adjustments or revisions, or the Company’s auditors may take longer to complete their work than anticipated, either of which could prevent the Company from being able to prepare and file the First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q during the extension period provided by the Form 12b-25 filing.\nOther important factors that may cause actual results or timing of events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in our filings with the SEC, including the section of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors.” Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this press release. Except as may be required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, and we caution you not to rely upon them unduly.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006158/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nKei Advisors LLC\nDeborah K.
