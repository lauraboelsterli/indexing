    "text": "KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A Japanese climber, who lost nine fingertips to frostbite in a previous expedition, died on Monday during an attempt to climb Mount Everest, an official said, the second person to die on the world’s highest mountain during the current climbing season.\nJapanese climber Kuriki Nobukazu speaks during an interview in Kathmandu, August 22, 2015. A Japanese climber will be the first to attempt to scale Mount Everest since a massive earthquake in April triggered avalanches that killed 18 climbers, shutting an industry that feeds thousands of people across Nepal. Picture taken on August 22, 2015. REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar - GF10000180380 Nobukazu Kuriki, 36, was found dead while sleeping in a camp 2 tent at 7,400 meters (24,278 feet) on the 8,850-metre (29,035-feet) mountain, tourism department official Gyanendra Shrestha said from base camp.\n“Sherpas found his body inside the tent,” Shrestha told Reuters. Details of the incident are not immediately available due to poor communication with the higher camp, he said.\nKuriki had made seven unsuccessful attempts to scale Everest.\nJapanese climber Kuriki Nobukazu speaks during an interview in Kathmandu, August 22, 2015.

That was when he had to have his fingertips amputated.\nMacedonian Gjeorgi Petkov, 63, died at the weekend climbing Everest, hiking officials said without giving details.\nScores of climbers have successfully made it to the top of Everest this month taking the benefit of good weather, officials said.\nNepal has allowed more than 340 foreign climbers to ascend the peak during the current season which started in March and continues through this month.\nReporting by Gopal Sharma; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Michael Perry\n ",
