    "text": "Company Reports Record First Quarter Earnings with Strong EPS Growth of 67%\nThe Company’s Newest and Most Incredible Ship, Norwegian Bliss, Joins the Fleet\nNew $1 Billion, Three-year Share Repurchase Program Authorization Announced\nMIAMI, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH) (together with NCL Corporation Ltd., “Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings”, “Norwegian” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, as well as provided guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018.\nHighlights\nThe Company generated GAAP net income of $103.2 million or EPS of $0.45 compared to $61.9 million or $0.27 in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income was $137.8 million or Adjusted EPS of $0.60 compared to $91.2 million or $0.40 in the prior year. Total revenue increased 12.4% to $1.3 billion. Gross Yield increased 1.4%. Net Yield increased 1.0% on a Constant Currency basis. The Company expects to generate record earnings for full year 2018 and has increased its outlook, with Adjusted EPS now expected to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.70. 2018 full year Net Yield growth guidance on a Constant Currency basis increased 50 basis points from prior guidance to approximately 2.5%.\n“The year is off to an impressive start with yet another record quarter of earnings, which exceeded expectations,\" said Frank Del Rio, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “The 2018 Wave Season was stellar and has further strengthened our overall future booked position with load factor and pricing continuing to be well ahead of prior year for the remaining quarters of 2018 and throughout 2019.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nGAAP net income was $103.2 million or EPS of $0.45 compared to $61.9 million or $0.27 in the prior year. The Company generated Adjusted Net Income of $137.8 million or Adjusted EPS of $0.60 compared to $91.2 million or $0.40 in the prior year.\nRevenue increased 12.4% to $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2017. Net Revenue increased 13.1% to $1.0 billion compared to $0.9 billion in 2017. These increases were primarily attributed to strong organic pricing growth across all core markets along with an increase in Capacity Days due to the addition of Norwegian Joy to the fleet. Gross Yield increased 1.4% and Net Yield increased 1.0% on a Constant Currency basis and 2.0% on an as reported basis.\nTotal cruise operating expense increased 6.7% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in Capacity Days. Gross Cruise Costs per Capacity Day decreased 1.5% due to a decrease in maintenance and repairs including Dry-dock expenses partially offset by an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day decreased 2.7% on a Constant Currency basis and 2.1% on an as reported basis.\nFuel price per metric ton, net of hedges decreased to $448 from $453 in 2017. The Company reported fuel expense of $93.4 million in the period.\nInterest expense, net was $59.7 million in 2018 compared to $53.0 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense reflects additional debt in connection with the delivery of Norwegian Joy in April 2017, Project Leonardo financing, as well as higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR, partially offset by the benefit from the full redemption in October 2017 of our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2020.\nOther income (expense), net was an expense of $1.7 million in 2018 compared to an expense of $2.8 million in 2017. In 2018, the expense was primarily related to losses on foreign currency exchange. In 2017, the expense was primarily related to losses on foreign currency exchange and unrealized and realized losses on derivatives.\nCompany Outlook\n“The strong global demand for our portfolio of brands which we experienced during 2017 has continued, as demonstrated by the successful, record-breaking launch of Norwegian Bliss, which entered the fleet as the best booked Norwegian Cruise Line newbuild in the history of our company,” said Mark Kempa, interim chief financial officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “While our primary focus continues to be to delever to the low 3 times by year-end 2018, our recently announced $1 billion share repurchase program reflects our ongoing confidence in our financial position and the long-term strength of our business as well as our commitment to provide meaningful capital returns to our shareholders.”\n2018 Guidance and Sensitivities\nIn addition to announcing the results for the first quarter, the Company also provided guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018, along with accompanying sensitivities. The Company does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of certain gains and charges. These items are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company has not provided reconciliations between the Company’s 2018 guidance and the most directly comparable GAAP measures because it would be too difficult to prepare a reliable U.S. GAAP quantitative reconciliation without unreasonable effort.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Full Year 2018 As Reported Constant Currency As Reported Constant\nCurrency Net Yield Approx. 2.75% Approx. 2.0% Approx. 3.0% Approx. 2.5% Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day Approx. 9.0% 7.5% to 8.0% 0.5% to 1.5% Flat to 1.0% Adjusted EPS Approx. $1.02 $4.55 to $4.70 Adjusted Depreciation and Amortization (1) Approx. $135 million Approx. $552 million Adjusted Interest Expense, net Approx. $70 million Approx. $274 million Effect on Adjusted EPS of a 1% change in Net Yield (2) $0.05 $0.16 (3) Effect on Adjusted EPS of a 1% change in Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day (2) $0.03 $0.08 (3) (1) Excludes $6.2 million and $24.9 million of amortization of intangible assets related to the Acquisition of Prestige in the second quarter and full year 2018, respectively.\n(2) Based on midpoint of guidance.\n(3) For the remaining quarters of 2018.\nThe following reflects the Company’s expectations regarding fuel consumption and pricing, along with accompanying sensitivities.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Full Year 2018\nFuel consumption in metric tons 205,000 840,000 Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges $470 $470 Effect on Adjusted EPS of a 10% change in fuel prices, net of hedges $0.02 $0.07 (1) (1) For the remaining quarters of 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had hedged approximately 64%, 48%, and 26% of its total projected metric tons of fuel consumption for the remainder of 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. The following table provides amounts hedged and price per barrel of heavy fuel oil (“HFO”) and marine gas oil (“MGO”) which are hedged utilizing U.S. Gulf Coast 3% (“USGC”) and Brent, respectively.\nRemainder of 2018 2019 2020 % of HFO Consumption Hedged 83% 57% 52% Average USGC Price / Barrel $53.02 $47.82 $39.50 % of MGO Consumption Hedged 17% 20% 11% Average Brent Price / Barrel $46.50 $49.25 $51.85\nThe following reflects the foreign currency exchange rates the Company used in its second quarter and full year 2018 guidance.\nCurrent Guidance - May Prior Guidance – February Euro $1.21 $1.24 British pound $1.38 $1.42 Australian Dollar $0.75 $0.81 Canadian Dollar $0.78 $0.81\nFuture capital commitments consist of contracted commitments, including ship construction contracts, and future expected capital expenditures necessary for operations as well as our ship refurbishment projects. As of March 31, 2018, anticipated capital expenditures were $1.4 billion for the remainder of 2018, $1.3 billion and $0.9 billion for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We have export credit financing in place for the expenditures related to ship construction contracts of $0.7 billion for the remainder of 2018, $0.6 billion and $0.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nCompany Updates and Other Business Highlights\n$1 Billion, Three-year Share Repurchase Program Authorized\nIn April 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board\") authorized a three-year, $1 billion share repurchase program. This authorization reflects the Company’s ongoing confidence in its financial strength and the long-term outlook of its business. The Company may repurchase its ordinary shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices and at such times as it deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. The Company may make repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in accelerated repurchase programs or in structured share repurchase programs, and any repurchases may be made pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans. The program will be conducted in compliance with applicable legal requirements and will be subject to market conditions and other factors.\nCompany Announces New Dedicated Terminal at PortMiami\nRecently, the Company unveiled the design of the new and dedicated Norwegian Cruise Line terminal at PortMiami. The new terminal will set the standard for passenger comfort and experience and will become an iconic building on Miami’s waterfront, and once complete, it will be the new “pearl” of Miami, redefining the landscape of the city’s skyline. At nearly 166,500 square feet, the debuting terminal will accommodate ships of up to 5,000 passengers. On April 26, the Company celebrated the groundbreaking of the terminal, marking the start of construction. The project is scheduled for completion by fall of 2019, as Norwegian Encore, the newest ship of the Breakaway Plus Class, makes her debut in Miami with seasonal cruises to the Caribbean.\nDelivery of Norwegian Bliss\nOn April 19, Norwegian Cruise Line took delivery of the 168,028-gross-ton Norwegian Bliss from Meyer Werft during a ceremony in Bremerhaven, Germany, marking the conclusion of an 18-month building period. Norwegian Bliss, the third ship in the line’s Breakaway Plus Class Ships, the most successful class in the Company’s history, is the first cruise ship specifically designed with features and amenities for the ultimate Alaska cruising experience. Before cruising to Southampton, England to begin her transatlantic journey on April 21, Norwegian Bliss will showcase all she has to offer to her first guests during a two-day European inaugural preview cruise. Upon her arrival to the U.S. on May 3, the festivities for her U.S. inaugural tour will commence with two-night preview events in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles, and will conclude with a grand christening ceremony and sailing from her first homeport at Pier 66 in Seattle, Washington and will then embark on her first seven-day voyage to Alaska.\nCompany Appoints Pamela Thomas-Graham to Its Board of Directors\nOn April 24, the Company announced it expanded its Board with the appointment of Ms. Pamela Thomas-Graham as a new independent member, effective April 23, 2018. Ms. Thomas-Graham’s appointment increased the Board from nine to 10 members, seven of whom are independent. She will also serve as a member of the Company’s Audit Committee.\nRegent Seven Seas Mariner Revitalization\nIn the final phase of Regent Seven Seas Cruises’ $125 million refurbishment program, the Company completed its bow-to-stern upgrade of Seven Seas Mariner, elevating the ship to the level of elegance set by Seven Seas Explorer® and providing a consistent look and feel to the entire fleet. Seven Seas Mariner completed a 20-day Dry-dock at Chantier Naval de Marseille, and has re-emerged with dramatic new culinary experiences, elegant new suite designs, and completely renewed elegant guest spaces.\nRegent Seven Seas Cruises Cut Steel for Seven Seas Splendor and Reveals Ship Details\nRegent Seven Seas Cruises cut the first plate of steel for Seven Seas Splendor, marking a significant construction milestone for the ship that will elevate the standard for all-inclusive luxury experiences. The new 750-guest ship will join the fleet in early 2020, in pursuit of the ultimate achievement – perfection. The inaugural season for the all-suite, all-balcony ship went on sale in early April. Seven Seas Splendor will join Regent’s most luxurious fleet in the world, comprising Seven Seas Explorer, Seven Seas Voyager, Seven Seas Mariner, and Seven Seas Navigator.

An unfunded defined benefit pension plan for certain crew members which computes benefits based on years of service, subject to certain requirements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Net Revenue, Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost, Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, to enable us to analyze our performance. See “Terminology” for the definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Net Revenue and Net Yield to manage our business on a day-to-day basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.\nAs our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar, which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on a Constant Currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net income and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA may not be indicative of future adjustments or results.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
