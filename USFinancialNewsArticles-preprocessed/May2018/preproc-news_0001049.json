REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi/File Photo\nThe Saudi government is working on a pipeline of privatisations as part of economic reforms aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil.\nSpeaking at a business conference in Riyadh, Samir Assaf, HSBC’s chief executive of global banking and markets, said HSBC was “very much contributing to the privatisation programme”.\nHe also said Saudi Arabia had “huge potential” in further developing a trade corridor with Asia.
