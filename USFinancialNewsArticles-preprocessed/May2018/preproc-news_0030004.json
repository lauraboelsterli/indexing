    "text": "Total revenues of $6.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $14.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income attributable to SWK Stockholders of $3.6 million, or $0.28 per share, and non-GAAP adjusted net income of $4.4 million, or $0.34 per share for the first quarter of 2018.\nClosed two financings deploying $25.0 million with additional $4.3 million deployed through existing portfolio company milestones and add-ons.\nBook value of $16.21 per share as of March 31, 2018 vs. $15.93 per share as of December 31, 2017.\nDALLAS, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SWK Holdings Corporation (OTC:SWKH.OB) (“SWK” or the “Company”), a life science focused specialty finance company, announced its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nReported total revenues of $6.8 million for the quarter, compared to $14.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Reported adjusted net income of $4.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the quarter, as compared to $9.4 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal income producing assets (defined as finance receivables, marketable securities and investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries; less non-controlling interests) were $167.6 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $153.9 million as of December 31, 2017.\n“As previously announced, we closed two new transactions and advanced additional capital to current partners during the first quarter,” stated Winston Black, Chief Executive Officer of SWK. \"Our pipeline of opportunities remains full, and we continue to make progress on securing additional, non-dilutive balance sheet capital.\"\nNote:\nAll references to growth rate percentages and shares compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period.\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing the Company’s ongoing performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP net income and its components and basic and diluted EPS. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that these are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components (unlike GAAP net income and its components) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies.\nPortfolio Overview\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's total income producing assets were $167.6 million as compared to $153.9 million as of December 31, 2017.\n(in thousands) March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 Finance receivables $ 165,843 $ 151,995 Marketable investments 1,713 1,856 Total income producing assets $ 167,556 $ 153,851 Warrant Assets 1,519 987 Total Portfolio Balance $ 169,075 $ 154,838 During the quarter, the Company deployed $25.0 million into two new term loan financings. One of the Company’s existing royalty transactions achieved a revenue-based milestone, triggering a $15.1 million payment, which includes the quarter’s royalty. SWK also supported existing portfolio companies' working capital needs through aggregate $4.3 million add-on term loan funding.\nAs of May 10, 2018, the Company and its partners have executed transactions with 28 different parties under its specialty finance strategy, funding an aggregate $405 million since 2012 in various financial products across the life science sector. At the end of the first quarter, the weighted average projected effective yield of the finance receivables portfolio was 14.6%. The projected effective yield is the rate at which income is expected to be recognized pursuant to the Company’s revenue recognition policies, if all payments are received pursuant to the terms of the finance receivables.\nTotal portfolio investment activity as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Beginning portfolio $ 154,838 $ 136,983 Early pay-offs — — Impairment expense and provision for loan credit losses (1,179 ) — Interest paid-in-kind 47 383 Investment in finance receivables 29,250 3,638 Loan discount amortization and fee accretion 907 669 Changes in unconsolidated entity investment, net of noncontrolling interest — (6,985 ) Net unrealized gain (loss) on marketable investments and derivatives 151 1,347 Principal payments received on investments (716 ) (24 ) Proceeds/realized gains from sale of investments — (101 ) Royalty paydowns (14,222 ) (232 ) Warrant investments, net of cancellations 258 — Ending portfolio $ 169,075 $ 135,678 Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generated revenues of $6.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, driven primarily by $6.8 million in interest and fees earned on our finance receivables. We generated revenues of $14.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, driven primarily by $4.7 million in interest and fees earned on our finance receivables and $10.2 million in income related to our investment in an unconsolidated partnership. The decrease in revenue is primarily due to a $10.2 million decrease in income from our investment in an unconsolidated entity, which on February 23, 2017 sold its U.S. marketing rights to its underlying intellectual property (please refer to Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 5 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 for further information on the Holmdel transaction). This was offset by a $2.2 million increase in interest and fees earned on new and existing finance receivables, including a $0.7 million increase in royalty revenue on our Narcan® investment. Royalty revenue from our Narcan® investment will be substantially less going forward, as we reached the 1.5x cash on cash royalty cap during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nWe recognized an allowance for credit loss on a royalty purchase of $1.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as we reduced expectations for future royalty receipts with respect to sales of Cambia®. We did not recognize an allowance for credit losses during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nPlease refer to Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 3 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 for further information regarding the provision for credit loss recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, stock-based compensation and related costs for management, staff, Board of Directors, legal and audit expenses, and corporate governance. General and administrative expenses increased to $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was primarily due to an increase in the performance-based bonus accrual.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net for the three months ended March 31, 2018 reflected a net fair market value gain of $0.3 million on our warrant derivatives and a net fair market value loss of $(0.1) million on our equity securities.\nOther income (expense), net for the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflected a net fair market value loss of $(0.5) million on our warrant derivatives and a $0.2 million realized gain on the sale of equity securities.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe recognized $1.0 million of deferred income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018. We recognized $3.7 million deferred income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in deferred income tax expense was primarily due to a reduction in net income, coupled with a change in the federal statutory tax rate signed into law on December 22, 2017. The new legislation decreased the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had $21.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $30.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017. The primary driver of the net decrease in our cash balance was new and add-on investment funding of $29.3 million, offset by interest and fee payments of $15.0 million earned on our finance receivables, including $13.7 million of royalty-related receipts from our Narcan® investment.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had $14.0 million of unfunded commitments outstanding.\nAdjusted Net Income\nNet income in accordance with GAAP for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, was $3.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. The following tables provide a reconciliation of SWK’s reported (GAAP) consolidated net income to SWK’s adjusted net income attributable to SWK Holdings Corporation Stockholders (non-GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017:\n(in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Consolidated net income $ 3,644 $ 10,268 Plus: income tax expense 954 3,706 Plus: loss on fair market value of equity securities 124 — Subtract: gain on fair market value of warrant assets (300 ) 472 Adjusted income before provision for income tax 4,298 14,446 Adjusted provision for income tax — — Non-GAAP consolidated net income 4,422 14,446 Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to non-controlling interest — 5,032 Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to SWK Holdings Corporation Stockholders $ 4,422 $ 9,414 Non-GAAP adjusted basic income per share $ 0.34 $ 0.72 Non-GAAP adjusted diluted income per share $ 0.34 $ 0.72 Weighted average shares - Basic 13,053 13,144 Weighted average shares - Diluted 13,057 13,147 In the presentation above, management has made adjustments for the following non-cash items: (i) fair-market value of warrants and equity securities as mark to market changes are non-cash, and (ii) income taxes as the Company has substantial net operating losses to offset against future income.\nAbout SWK Holdings Corporation\nSWK Holdings Corporation is a specialized finance company with a focus on the global healthcare sector.
