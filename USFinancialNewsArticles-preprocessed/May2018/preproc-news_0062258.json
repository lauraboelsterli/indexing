    "text": "9 COMMENTS AOL co-founder Steve Case has sold Merrywood, the Northern Virginia estate that was also a childhood home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, for $43 million to the government of Saudi Arabia.\nThe sale, which closed last week, is the most expensive residential sale on record in the Washington, D.C., area, according to Monica Boyd of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, who represented the buyer.\nAccording to a Saudi spokeswoman, the government plans to use the residence when Saudi-delegation dignitaries visit the United States. “The Saudi government understands the historical significance of the Merrywood home and has tremendous respect for its place in American history,” the spokeswoman said in a written statement.\nMr. Case and his wife, Jean, purchased the home on Chain Bridge Road in 2005 for $24.5 million, according to public records. They listed the home last year for $49.5 million with Mark C. Lowham of TTR Sotheby’s International Realty and Juliana E. May of JLL.\n“We enjoyed living at Merrywood for the past 13 years, and we hope the new owner will appreciate the property as much as we did,” the couple said in a statement. Mr. Case, who resigned his post as chairman of AOL Time Warner in 2003, is currently chief executive of investment firm Revolution. Ms. Case is chairman of the National Geographic Society and CEO of the Case Foundation.\nMore from Mansion\nNorthern California Ranch of the Late Dean Witter Asks $31 Million May 30, 2018 Ben Affleck Lists Private Georgia Compound for $8.9 Million May 30, 2018 A New York Socialite’s Extravagant Estate on Sale for $30 Million May 24, 2018 Located on the banks of the Potomac River, the estate sits on about 7 acres. The Georgian-style house measures about 23,000 square feet with nine bedrooms. Merrywood was renovated but a number of original details remain, such as elaborate plaster moldings. On the second floor, the master suite includes his-and-hers dressing rooms, a study and a gym.\nThe grounds include a swimming pool, a tennis court and a pavilion containing an indoor lap pool, kitchen, gym and changing rooms. A carriage house provides parking for four cars, a security office and staff quarters.\nAccording to the book “Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: A Life,” Merrywood became the home of the young Jacqueline Bouvier in the 1940s, when her mother married the property’s owner, Standard Oil heir Hugh D. Auchincloss.\nDown the road, the riverfront estate of another AOL co-founder, the late James V. Kimsey, recently went on the market for $62.95 million.\nThe Saudi ambassador’s residence is also located on Chain Bridge Road, and the country has been involved in multiple real-estate transactions there over the years. It bought one nearby house in 1993 for $4.65 million, according to public records, and another one in 1992 for $2 million.\nWrite to Candace Taylor at Candace.Taylor@wsj.com",
