The long-end of those contracts are turning upwards,” Hersvik said. DISPUTE WITH STATOIL\nAker BP expects to resolve its dispute with majority state-owned Statoil over development of the so-called North of Alvheim and Askja-Krafla (NOAKA) area in the North Sea by the end of 2018.\nAker BP wants to develop a group of discoveries containing about 500 million boe by using a manned processing platform, combined with offshore wind turbines to provide power, while Statoil wants to have two unmanned processing platforms.\nThe companies have to get an approval from the government for the project, which could be the largest development off Norway after Statoil’s Johan Castberg Arctic oilfield.\nConsultancy Wood Mackenzie said in March it expected start-up of the NOAKA project to be delayed by one year until 2023 due to the dispute.
