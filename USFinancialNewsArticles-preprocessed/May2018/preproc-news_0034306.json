May 13, 2018; Detroit, MI, USA; Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Cano (22) talks to designated hitter Nelson Cruz (23) with a cast on his hand in the dugout during the fifth inning against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\nCano was hit on the back of the hand near the pinky finger by an inside fastball from Tigers left-hander starter Blaine Hardy.\nHe was attended to by a trainer and left the game, replaced in the lineup by Andrew Romine.\nIt was not immediately known how much time Cano will miss. Slideshow (2 Images)\nCano has appeared in an MLB-best 2,035 games since his major-league debut in May 2005. He went on the 10-day disabled list in May 2017 due to a strained right quad muscle.\nCano is batting .287 with four home runs and 23 RBIs this season. He hit a three-run home run Saturday in the second game of the doubleheader against the Tigers.\nâ€”Field Level Media",
