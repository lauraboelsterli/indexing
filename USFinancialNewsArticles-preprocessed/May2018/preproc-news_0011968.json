    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 2:50 PM / Updated 3 minutes ago U.S. clamps down on kid-friendly packaging for e-cigarette liquids Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - U.S. regulators issued warnings to 13 companies selling e-cigarette liquids for using child-friendly images in their packaging, in the latest crackdown aimed at preventing tobacco sales to minors. Bottles of flavor packets for e-cigarettes stand displayed in a tobacco shop in New York, June 23, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/Files\nThe packaging resembles that of products such as juice boxes, candy or cookies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday, and sent warning letters sent to manufacturers, distributors and retailers.\n“No tobacco products should be marketed in a way that endangers kids – especially by using imagery that misleads them into thinking the products are things they’d eat or drink,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.\nThe FDA cited examples including “One Mad Hit Juice Box,” which resembles children’s apple juice boxes, “V’Nilla Cookies & Milk,” which looks like Nilla Wafer and Golden Oreo cookies and “Twirly Pop,” which not only resembles a Unicorn Pop lollipop, but comes with one.\nThe latest warnings come one week after the FDA sent forty warning letters to companies on the sale of tobacco products to minors, particularly those made by Juul Labs Inc.\nJuul, in response, said it was spending $30 million to support initiatives that aim to raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products to over 21.\nE-cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that vaporize a fluid typically including nicotine and a flavor component. They have been grabbing market share away from traditional tobacco companies, and are available in different flavors.\nSeveral of the companies that received the latest warning letters were also found to be selling the products to minors illegally, the FDA said.\nThe agency and the FTC have asked for responses from each of the companies within 15 working days.
