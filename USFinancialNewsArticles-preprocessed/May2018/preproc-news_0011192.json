    "text": "ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NCR Corporation (NYSE: NCR) reported financial results today for the three months ended March 31, 2018. First quarter highlights include:\nRevenue of $1.52 billion, up 3% as reported, above previously provided guidance Software revenue up 2% driven by cloud revenue growth of 9% GAAP diluted EPS of $0.35; Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.56, above previously provided guidance Services revenue up 8% and gross margin expansion of 230 basis points $165 million of share repurchases completed in Q1 of the previously announced $300 million 2018 guidance reaffirmed\n“I am honored to be the CEO of this great company,” said Michael Hayford, whose appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer was announced on April 30, 2018. “NCR is a global leader in providing software-led technology solutions for the financial services, retail and hospitality markets, and has a long history of driving innovation. We are well positioned to extend our leadership position by further evolving into a software-led technology company, and I am excited to capture the growth opportunities that we have ahead of us.”\n“The first quarter marked a solid start to the year, with results that place us on track to achieve our full year financial and operating targets,” said COO Paul Langenbahn. “Cloud revenue increased 9% and we generated healthy net ACV, which demonstrates our global software leadership and our market-leading innovation. We also maintained our focus on driving continuous improvement in our business model and accelerating our operational transformation by recently initiating a process to restructure our Hardware business by simplifying our manufacturing network to best position the business for improved profitability in the years ahead. At the same time, we are focused on capturing efficiencies across our organization, including in Services where our transformation initiatives continue to improve top-line growth and drive strong margin expansion.”\nIn this release, we use certain performance metrics as well as certain non-GAAP measures, including presenting certain measures on a constant currency basis. The performance metrics include net annual contract value (or Net ACV) and the non-GAAP measures include free cash flow and others with the words “non-GAAP,” or “constant currency” in their titles. The performance metrics are listed and described, and the non-GAAP measures are listed, described, and reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, under the heading “Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results\nRevenue\nFirst quarter revenue of $1.52 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Foreign currency fluctuations had a favorable impact on the revenue comparison of 3%.\nThe following table shows the revenue by segment for the first quarter:\n$ in millions 2018 2017 % Change % Change\nConstant\nCurrency\nSoftware License $ 70 $ 85 (18 %) (19 %) Software Maintenance 91 92 (1 %) (3 %) Cloud 155 142 9 % 9 % Professional Services 144 133 8 % 4 % Software Revenue $ 460 $ 452 2 % — % Services Revenue $ 601 $ 557 8 % 4 % ATM $ 195 $ 209 (7 %) (11 %) SCO 77 101 (24 %) (24 %) POS 184 154 19 % 15 % IPS — 5 (100 %) (100 %) Hardware Revenue $ 456 $ 469 (3 %) (6 %) Total Revenue $ 1,517 $ 1,478 3 % — % Software revenue was up 2% driven by cloud revenue growth of 9% and professional services revenue growth of 8%. Software license revenue declined 18% due to lower Hardware revenue, the timing of large software transactions in the prior year and the beginning of a shift from software license revenue to cloud revenue. Net ACV was $18 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nServices revenue was up 8% driven by hardware maintenance and implementation services growth as a result of continued momentum in managed service offerings and channel transformation trends.\nHardware revenue was down 3%. ATM revenue declined 7% as expected and reflected the lower backlog starting the quarter. SCO revenue declined 24% due to the timing of customer rollouts. POS revenue continued its momentum and increased 19% in the quarter due to store transformation trends.\nGross Margin\nFirst quarter gross margin of $420 million was up from $412 million. Gross margin rate was 27.7%, down from 27.9%. First quarter gross margin (non-GAAP) of $431 million was flat with the prior year. Gross margin rate (non-GAAP) was 28.4%, down from 29.2%. The decrease in gross margin rate (non-GAAP) was primarily due to lower software license revenue and lower Hardware margins, which were partially offset by continued focus on productivity improvements in our Services segment.\nExpenses\nFirst quarter operating expenses of $311 million increased from $297 million. First quarter operating expenses (non-GAAP) of $283 million increased from $273 million. The increases in expenses were due to increased sales investment as we expand our strategic offers and go-to-market strategy.\nOperating Income\nFirst quarter operating income of $109 million decreased 5% from $115 million. Operating margin rate was 7.2%, down from 7.8%. First quarter operating income (non-GAAP) of $148 million decreased 6% from $158 million. Operating margin rate (non-GAAP) was 9.8%, down from 10.7%. Operating margin rates reflected lower software license revenue, lower Hardware margins and increased sales investment, and were partially offset by continued Services margin expansion.\nOther (Expense)\nFirst quarter other (expense) and other (expense) (non-GAAP) of $46 million increased 5% from $44 million compared to the prior year.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFirst quarter income tax expense of $7 million decreased from $14 million. The first quarter effective income tax rate was 11% compared to 20% in the prior year. First quarter income tax expense (non-GAAP) of $16 million decreased from $27 million in the prior year. The first quarter effective income tax rate (non-GAAP) was 16% compared to 24% in the prior year. Income tax expenses decreased due to lower income before taxes in the quarter, favorable audit settlements and the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. Income tax expense included a favorable audit settlement that was previously anticipated in the second quarter which provided an $0.08 benefit to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 versus our previous guidance.\nNet Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR\nFirst quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to NCR of $55 million decreased from $57 million in the prior year. First quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to NCR (non-GAAP) of $85 million decreased from $87 million in the prior year.\nCash Flow\nFirst quarter cash used in operating activities of $24 million decreased from cash provided by operating activities of $39 million in the prior year. Free cash outflow was $99 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to free cash outflow of $16 million in the first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of cash collections and higher inventory. Inventory balances increased to support higher Hardware revenue in the back half of the year and to transition to our new manufacturing strategy.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2018, NCR plans to repurchase up to $300 million of its common stock under its previously authorized share repurchase programs, and repurchased shares of its common stock for approximately $165 million during the first quarter.\nOther Items\nFollowing a March 2018 court decision in the previously reported litigation concerning alleged environmental contamination at the Kalamazoo River, the Company has recorded a charge of approximately $35 million, net of tax, included as discontinued operations. The Company will appeal an interim 2013 decision as well as the 2018 decision; if the appeal of the 2013 decision is successful the Company’s liability would be eliminated and the charge will be reversed. Significant cash expenditures on Kalamazoo River remediation are not expected to be incurred until the early to mid-2020s, as remedies have not yet been determined for much of the remediation project.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nWe are reaffirming our full year 2018 guidance. Our revenue growth is expected to be 0% to 3%. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $2.08 to $2.48, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $3.30 to $3.45. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 24% for 2018 compared to 25% in 2017. The decrease is due to the expected impact of U.S. Tax Reform. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 90% of non-GAAP net income.\nTo accelerate our transformation journey, we are evaluating and beginning to implement programs to prioritize driving sustainable margin improvement in our Hardware and Services segments targeted at driving higher productivity, process efficiency, and the use of technology as an enabler. As we finalize and execute on these programs, NCR expects to incur a related pre-tax charge over the next two years in the range of approximately $200 million to $250 million, with $100 million to $150 million in 2018, that will be included in income from operations. The cash impact of these transformation initiatives is expected to be approximately $150 million to $200 million over the next two years, with $100 million in 2018. We plan to achieve run-rate savings of approximately $150 million per year by 2020. The estimate of the pre-tax charges and cash impact has been included in our 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. In the first quarter of 2018, we incurred a $16 million pre-tax charge and $14 million of cash payments relating to these initiatives.\nQ2 2018 Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, revenue growth is expected to be down 1% to up 1%, GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.12 to $0.30, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.60 to $0.65. Income from operations includes an estimated pre-tax charge of $40 million to $60 million in the second quarter of 2018 related to the transformation initiatives described above.\nNCR will provide additional information regarding its second quarter and full year 2018 guidance during its first quarter earnings conference call and webcast.\n2018 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nA conference call is scheduled for today at 4:30 p.m. (EDT) to discuss the first quarter 2018 results and guidance for second quarter and full year 2018.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8- K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nPerformance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nPerformance Metrics. The term “net annual contract value” or “net ACV” for any particular period means NCR’s net bookings for cloud revenue during the period, and is calculated as twelve months of expected subscription revenues under new cloud contracts during such period less twelve months of subscription revenues under cloud contracts that expired or were terminated during such period, adjusted for twelve months of expected pricing discounts or price increases from renewals of existing contracts. Net ACV is a forward-looking measure that NCR tracks and discloses as an indicator of potential cloud revenue growth in future periods.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures. While NCR reports its results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States, or GAAP, in this release NCR also uses the non-GAAP measures listed and described below.\nNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS), Gross Margin (non-GAAP), Gross Margin Rate (non-GAAP), Operating Expenses (non-GAAP), Operating Income (non-GAAP), Operating Margin Rate (non-GAAP), Other (Expense) (non-GAAP), Income Tax Expense (non-GAAP), Effective Income Tax Rate (non-GAAP), and Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (non-GAAP). NCR’s non-GAAP diluted EPS, gross margin (non-GAAP), gross margin rate (non-GAAP), operating expenses (non-GAAP), operating income (non-GAAP), operating margin rate (non-GAAP), other (expense) (non-GAAP), income tax expense (non-GAAP), effective income tax rate (non-GAAP), and net income from continuing operations attributable to NCR (non-GAAP) are determined by excluding, as applicable, pension mark-to-market adjustments, pension settlements, pension curtailments and pension special termination benefits and other special items, including amortization of acquisition related intangibles, from NCR’s GAAP earnings per share, gross margin, gross margin rate, expenses, income from operations, operating margin rate, other (expense), income tax expense, effective income tax rate and net income from continuing operations attributable to NCR, respectively. Due to the non-operational nature of these pension and other special items, NCR's management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate year-over-year operating performance. NCR also uses operating income (non-GAAP) and diluted EPS (non-GAAP), to manage and determine the effectiveness of its business managers and as a basis for incentive compensation. NCR believes these measures are useful for investors because they provide a more complete understanding of NCR's underlying operational performance, as well as consistency and comparability with NCR's past reports of financial results.\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Non-GAAP Net Income (or Free Cash Flow Conversion Rate). NCR defines free cash flow as net cash provided by/used in operating activities and cash flow provided by/used in discontinued operations less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, additions to capitalized software, discretionary pension contributions and pension settlements. NCR’s management uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the Company and believes it is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the Company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures which can be used for, among other things, investment in the Company’s existing businesses, strategic acquisitions, strengthening the Company’s balance sheet, repurchase of Company stock and repayment of the Company’s debt obligations. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. NCR also describes the ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income (or free cash flow conversion rate), which is calculated as free cash flow divided by non-GAAP net income. NCR’s management targets an annual free cash flow conversion rate at or above the range described in this release because management believes that a conversion rate at or above that range represents the efficient conversion of non-GAAP net income to free cash flow for its business. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate do not have uniform definitions under GAAP and, therefore, NCR’s definitions may differ from other companies’ definitions of these measures.\nConstant Currency. NCR presents certain financial measures, such as period-over-period revenue growth, on a constant currency basis, which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation by translating prior period results at current period monthly average exchange rates. Due to the overall variability of foreign exchange rates from period to period, NCR’s management uses constant currency measures to evaluate period-over-period operating performance on a more consistent and comparable basis. NCR’s management believes that presentation of financial measures without this result is more representative of the company’s period-over-period operating performance, and provides additional insight into historical and/or future performance, which may be helpful for investors.\nNCR’s definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures reported by other companies and cannot, therefore, be compared with similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables below.\nReconciliation of Gross Margin (GAAP) to Gross Margin (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Gross Margin (GAAP) $ 420 $ 412 Transformation costs 4 6 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 7 13 Gross Margin (Non-GAAP) $ 431 $ 431 Reconciliation of Gross Margin Rate (GAAP) to Gross Margin Rate (non-GAAP)\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 Gross Margin Rate (GAAP) 27.7 % 27.9 % Transformation costs 0.2 % 0.4 % Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 0.5 % 0.9 % Gross Margin Rate (Non-GAAP) 28.4 % 29.2 % Reconciliation of Operating Expenses (GAAP) to Operating Expenses (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Operating Expenses (GAAP) $ 311 $ 297 Transformation costs (12 ) (7 ) Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles (16 ) (16 ) Acquisition-related costs — (1 ) Operating Expenses (Non-GAAP) $ 283 $ 273 Reconciliation of Income from Operations (GAAP) to Operating Income (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Income from Operations (GAAP) $ 109 $ 115 Transformation costs 16 13 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 23 29 Acquisition-related costs — 1 Operating Income (Non-GAAP) $ 148 $ 158 Reconciliation of Operating Margin rate (GAAP) to Operating Margin rate (non-GAAP)\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 Operating Margin rate (GAAP) 7.2 % 7.8 % Transformation costs 1.1 % 0.9 % Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 1.5 % 1.9 % Acquisition-related costs — % 0.1 % Operating Margin rate (Non-GAAP) 9.8 % 10.7 % Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense (GAAP) to Income Tax Expense (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Income Tax Expense (GAAP) $ 7 $ 14 Transformation costs 4 4 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 5 9 Income Tax Expense (Non-GAAP) $ 16 $ 27 Reconciliation of Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (GAAP) to\nNet Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (GAAP) $ 55 $ 57 Transformation costs 12 9 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 18 20 Acquisition-related costs — 1 Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (Non-GAAP) $ 85 $ 87 Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings Per Share (GAAP) to Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (non-GAAP)\nQ1 2018\nActual\nQ1 2017\nActual\nQ2 2018\nGuidance (2)\n2018\nGuidance (2)\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (GAAP) (1) $ 0.35 $ (0.14 ) $ 0.12 - $0.30 $ 2.08 - $2.48 Transformation costs 0.08 0.06 0.19 - 0.28 0.50 - 0.75 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 0.12 0.13 0.10 0.42 Acquisition-related costs — 0.01 0.01 0.05 Deemed dividends related to Blackstone transaction — 0.39 — — Diluted Earnings Per Share (non-GAAP) (1) $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.60 - $0.65 $ 3.30 - $3.45 (1) Non-GAAP diluted EPS is determined using the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock in the calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding. GAAP EPS is determined using the most dilutive measure, either including the impact of dividends or deemed dividends on the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in the calculation of net income or loss available to common stockholders or including the impact of the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock in the calculation of the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Therefore, GAAP diluted EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS may not mathematically reconcile.\n(2) Except for the adjustments noted herein, this guidance does not include the effects of any future acquisitions/divestitures, restructuring activities, pension mark-to-market adjustments, taxes or other events, which are difficult to predict and which may or may not be significant.\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) to Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q1 2018 QTD Q1 2017 QTD Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (24 ) $ 39 Total capital expenditures (71 ) (52 ) Net cash used in discontinued operations (4 ) (3 ) Free cash outflow $ (99 ) $ (16 ) * Note: Capital expenditures in Q1 2018 and Q1 2017 included $20 million and $1 million, respectively related to our new world headquarters.
