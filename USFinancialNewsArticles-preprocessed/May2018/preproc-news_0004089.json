Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, adjusted (a) to exclude the impact of provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition and transaction expenses, losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments, asset impairment charges, incentive allocations, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, (b) to include the impact of cash income tax payments, and our pro-rata share of the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) from unconsolidated entities, and (c) to exclude the impact of the non-controlling share of Adjusted Net Income (Loss). We evaluate investment performance for each reportable segment primarily based on Adjusted Net Income (Loss). We believe that net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, as defined by GAAP, is the most comparable earnings measurement with which to reconcile Adjusted Net Income (Loss).\nThe following table presents our consolidated reconciliation of net loss attributable to shareholders to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for 2018 and March 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Net loss attributable to shareholders $ (572 ) $ (4,414 ) Add: Provision for income taxes 495 212 Add: Equity-based compensation expense 208 87 Add: Acquisition and transaction expenses 1,766 1,452 Add: Losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations — 2,456 Add: Changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments 624 — Add: Asset impairment charges — — Add: Pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) from unconsolidated entities (1) 95 (1,266 ) Add: Incentive allocations — — Less: Cash payments for income taxes 9 (3 ) Less: Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated entities (95 ) 1,266 Less: Non-controlling share of Adjusted Net Loss (Income) (2) 198 (39 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (non-GAAP) $ 2,728 $ (249 )\n(1) Pro-rata share of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) from unconsolidated entities includes the Company’s proportionate share of the unconsolidated entities’ net income adjusted for the excluded and included items detailed in the table above.\n(2) Non-controlling share of Adjusted Net (Loss) Income is comprised of the following for 2018 and 2017: (i) equity-based compensation of $37 and $25, (ii) provision for income tax of $4 and $15, and (iii) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $(244) and $0, less (iv) cash tax payments of $(5) and $1, respectively.\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA as a secondary measurement to Adjusted Net Income (Loss), which we believe serves as a useful supplement to investors, analysts and management to measure economic performance of deployed revenue generating assets between periods on a consistent basis, and which we believe measures our financial performance and helps identify operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely our cost structure and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other entities may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, adjusted (a) to exclude the impact of provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition and transaction expenses, losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments, asset impairment charges, incentive allocations, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense, (b) to include the impact of our pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities, and (c) to exclude the impact of equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and the non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net loss attributable to shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 and March 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Net loss attributable to shareholders $ (572 ) $ (4,414 ) Add: Provision for income taxes 495 212 Add: Equity-based compensation expense 208 87 Add: Acquisition and transaction expenses 1,766 1,452 Add: Losses on the modification or extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations — 2,456 Add: Changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments 624 — Add: Asset impairment charges — — Add: Incentive allocations — — Add: Depreciation & amortization expense (3) 36,814 19,306 Add: Interest expense 11,871 4,694 Add: Pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities (4) 175 (680 ) Less: Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated entities (95 ) 1,266 Less: Non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA (5) (3,165 ) (2,242 ) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 48,121 $ 22,137\n(3) Depreciation and amortization expense includes the following items for 2018 and 2017: (i) depreciation and amortization expense of $29,587 and $17,377, (ii) lease intangible amortization of $1,992 and $1,283, and (iii) amortization for lease incentives of $5,235 and $646, respectively.\n(4) Pro-rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities includes the following items for 2018 and 2017: (i) net income (loss) of $48 and $(1,309), (ii) interest expense of $112 and $251, and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of $15 and $378, respectively.\n(5) Non-controlling share of Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of the following items for 2018 and 2017: (i) equity based compensation of $37 and $24, (ii) provision for income taxes of $4 and $15, (iii) interest expense of $1,292 and $529, (iv) depreciation and amortization expense of $2,076 and $1,674, and (v) changes in fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments of $(244) and $0, respectively.\nWe use Funds Available for Distribution (“FAD”) in evaluating our ability to meet our stated dividend policy. FAD is not a financial measure in accordance with GAAP. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FAD is net cash provided by operating activities. We believe FAD is a useful metric for investors and analysts for similar purposes.\nWe define FAD as: net cash provided by operating activities plus principal collections on finance leases, proceeds from sale of assets, and return of capital distributions from unconsolidated entities, less required payments on debt obligations and capital distributions to non-controlling interest, and excluding changes in working capital.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of FAD to Cash from Operating Activities for 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 11,470 $ 17,680 Add: Principal Collections on Finance Leases 129 110 Add: Proceeds from sale of assets 6,174 9,885 Add: Return of Capital Distributions from Unconsolidated Entities — — Less: Required Payments on Debt Obligations (1) (1,562 ) (1,562 ) Less: Capital Distributions to Non-Controlling Interest — — Exclude: Changes in Working Capital 18,226 (4,365 ) Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) $ 34,437 $ 21,748",
