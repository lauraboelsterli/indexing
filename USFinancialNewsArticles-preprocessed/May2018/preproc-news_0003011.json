    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Donnelley Financial Solutions (NYSE: DFIN) today reported financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nHighlights:\nFirst-quarter net sales of $255.2 million declined 4.5% from the first quarter of 2017 First-quarter GAAP net earnings of $7.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net earnings in the first quarter of 2017 of $9.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share First-quarter non-GAAP net earnings (1) of $15.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net earnings in the first quarter of 2017 of $13.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (1) in the quarter was $40.3 million, or 15.8% of net sales, compared to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017 of $44.2 million, or 16.5% of net sales Company reaffirms full-year 2018 guidance\n(1) Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of items noted in the reconciliation tables below. See the tables below for amounts and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. “I am pleased with our first-quarter results, which were in line with our expectations,” said Daniel N. Leib, Donnelley Financial’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We continued to see double-digit growth in our SaaS revenue, driven by Venue and ActiveDisclosure, and remain excited about the future growth opportunities in our SaaS offerings. The growth in these areas partially offset declines in the transactional portion of U.S. Capital Markets and the funds portion of U.S. Investment Markets, against our most challenging quarter from a year-over-year comparison perspective. Given our first-quarter performance and outlook for the balance of the year, our full-year 2018 guidance remains unchanged.”\nLeib continued, “Capital spending in the first quarter was slightly lower than we expected. We continue to be excited about growth-oriented investment opportunities, but at the same time remain committed to our disciplined approach toward capital deployment, as well as to our targeted gross leverage range of 2.25x to 2.75x.”\nNet Sales\nNet sales in the first quarter of 2018 were $255.2 million, a decrease of $12.1 million, or 4.5%, from the first quarter of 2017. After adjusting for changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (2) , organic sales decreased 6.0% from the first quarter of 2017. This decline was primarily due to the non-recurring special proxy volume that positively impacted U.S. Investment Markets in the first quarter of 2017, as well as lower transactional and compliance volume within U.S. Capital Markets, which was partially offset by growth in our SaaS and global Language Solutions offerings.\n(2) On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" (\"the new revenue recognition standard\") using the modified retrospective approach applied to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. GAAP Earnings\nFirst-quarter 2018 net earnings were $7.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $9.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. The first-quarter net earnings included after-tax charges of $7.5 million and $4.6 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Net Earnings\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 was $40.3 million, compared to $44.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 15.8%, 70 basis points lower than in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by lower mutual funds proxy volume and lower capital markets transactional volume as well as higher investments, partially offset by company-wide cost reductions and higher volume in International.\nNon-GAAP net earnings totaled $15.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to non-GAAP net earnings of $13.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Reconciliations of net earnings to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net earnings, as well as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin, are presented in the attached schedules.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company reaffirms its previous full-year guidance for 2018:\n2018 Guidance\nNet sales Approximately $1 billion, representing organic growth in the\nrange of 1% to 2%\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (1) $165 to $175 million Depreciation and amortization Approximately $50 million Interest expense Approximately $37 million Non-GAAP effective tax rate 29% to 31% Diluted share count Approximately 34 million Capital expenditures $40 to $45 million Free cash flow (2) $55 to $60 million (1) Pension income excluded from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA beginning in 2018; prior periods have also been restated in the tables below (2) Defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. 2018 free cash flow guidance includes approximately $15 million for spinoff-related transition expenses. Certain components of the guidance given above are provided on a non-GAAP basis only, without providing a reconciliation to guidance provided on a GAAP basis. Information is presented in this manner, consistent with SEC rules, because the preparation of such a reconciliation could not be accomplished without “unreasonable efforts.” The Company does not have access to certain information that would be necessary to provide such a reconciliation, including non-recurring items that are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, impairment charges, spinoff-related transaction expenses, acquisition-related expenses, gains or losses on investments and business disposals and other similar gains or losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company does not believe that this information is likely to be significant to an assessment of the Company’s ongoing operations, given that it is not an indicator of business performance.\nConference Call\nDonnelley Financial and simultaneous webcast to discuss its first-quarter results today, Wednesday, May 2, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Central Time).

The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, provide useful information about the Company’s operating results and liquidity and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company’s financial performance. The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business.\nOur non-GAAP statement of operations measures, non-GAAP SG&A, non-GAAP SG&A as % of total net sales, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operations. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of expenses associated with the Company’s acquisition activities, spin-off related expenses, share-based compensation and eliminate potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historic cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures, taxation positions or regimes, restructuring, impairment and other charges and gain or loss on certain equity investments and asset sales.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. By adjusting for the level of capital investment in operations, the Company believes that free cash flow can provide useful additional basis for understanding the Company’s ability to generate cash after capital investment and provides a comparison to peers with differing capital intensity.\nOrganic net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as reported net sales adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and acquired and disposed businesses.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these measures are defined differently by different companies in our industry and, accordingly, such measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nUse of Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release includes certain \" \" within the meaning of, and subject to the safe harbor created by, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the business, strategy and plans of Donnelley Financial and its expectations relating to future financial condition and performance.

Prior period net pension income was also reclassified. The Company believes that certain non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful because that information is an appropriate measure for evaluating the Company’s operating performance. Internally, the Company uses this non-GAAP information as an indicator of business performance, and evaluates management’s effectiveness with specific reference to this indicator. These measures should be considered in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nDonnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.
