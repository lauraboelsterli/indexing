    "text": "May 18 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc's $44 billion deal to buy Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV is looking \"more optimistic now\", the Wall Street Journal Quote: d here #61;nwsrl_capital_account&cx_refModule&61;nwsrl a Beijing official as saying.\nShares of NXP were up 5.5 percent at $112.52 and Qualcomm was up 1.6 percent at $57.86 in late morning trade.\nThe deal has been approved by eight of the nine required global regulators, with only the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) continually stalling the takeover amid U.S.-China trade tensions.\nSources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that the proposed takeover had yet to see any concrete breakthrough in China.\nHowever, Chinese regulators this week have cleared two big deals - Toshiba Corp’s $18 billion sale of its chip unit to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, and Microchip’s $8.35 billion deal to buy Microsemi.\nQualcomm, NXP and the Mofcom were not immediately available for comment.
