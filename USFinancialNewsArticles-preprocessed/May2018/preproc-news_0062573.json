    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official, gave up his mandate to form a cabinet of technocrats on Thursday, opening the way for law professor Giuseppe Conte to head an anti-establishment coalition government.\nFormer senior International Monetary Fund (IMF) official Carlo Cottarelli arrives to talk to the media after a meeting with Italy's President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy, May 28, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile Conte’s first effort to put together a government, after being nominated eight days ago, was thwarted at the weekend by Italian President Sergio Mattarella, who rejected his eurosceptic candidate for the economy ministry.\nThe new government will include a different choice for the pivotal ministry, economics professor Giovanni Tria, 5-Star and League sources said.\n“A political government is by far the best solution for the country,” Cottarelli said after giving up his mandate.\nReporting by Steve Scherer\n ",
