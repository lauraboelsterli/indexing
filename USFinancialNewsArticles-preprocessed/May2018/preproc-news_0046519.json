    "text": "0 COMMENTS The dollar rose against a raft of emerging-market currencies Friday, driven by expectations that U.S. yields will continue marching higher.\nThe U.S. currency was recently up 1.2% against the Brazilian real to 3.7419, its highest level since March 2016. It also rose 0.9% against the South African rand and strengthened to a fresh all-time high against the Turkish lira.\nYields on U.S. government bonds have climbed this week and the gap between shorter- and longer-term yields has widened, with investors remaining optimistic about the pace of U.S. growth. The difference between two- and 10-year yields increased to about 0.53 percentage point from about 0.43 percentage point a week ago.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged lower Friday , a day after closing at its highest level since 2011 . Rising U.S. yields tend to diminish the attractiveness of emerging markets, where investors often assume higher risk in the hopes of richer returns.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently up 0.1% at 87.13.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com",
