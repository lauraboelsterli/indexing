    "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ascent Capital Group, Inc. (“Ascent” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:ASCMA) has reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Ascent is a holding company that owns MONI, one of the nation’s largest home security alarm monitoring companies.\nHeadquartered in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, MONI provides security alarm monitoring services to over 950,000 residential and commercial customers as of March 31, 2018. MONI’s long-term monitoring contracts provide high margin recurring revenue that results in predictable and stable cash flow.\nHighlights 1 :\nAscent’s net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $133.8 million. Ascent’s net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $30.8 million. MONI’s net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $26.2 million. Ascent’s Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $68.9 million. MONI’s Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $70.0 million. The Company expects to formally launch the Brinks Home Security™ brand in May 2018. The Company’s partnership with Nest is off to a solid start with approximately 3,000 accounts activated since the launch of professional monitoring on December 5, 2017. The Company’s Direct Channel grew 21% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Consolidated creation costs totaled 34.6 times in the three months ended March 31, 2018, down 1.0 times year-over-year and down 1.4 times sequentially, due to improved efficiency in the Company’s Direct Channel.\nAscent Chief Executive Officer, Bill Niles stated, “The MONI team continues to remain focused on improving key operating metrics. MONI delivered significant year over year growth in the direct to consumer sales channel and they have positioned the business to launch all of its operations, marketing and sales efforts under the Brinks Home Security™ brand in the second quarter. We are pleased with the progress.”\nJeffery Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer of MONI said, “In the first quarter we made solid progress against several of our operational initiatives, including improvements in account growth and creation multiples. On a sequential basis, we delivered a 17% and 16% improvement in customer additions in our Dealer and Direct Channels, respectively, in the quarter. Our largest dealer, Skyline, improved performance in each month of the quarter since launching with MONI on January 1 st . Our partnership with Nest is also ramping up with approximately 3,000 accounts activated since the launch of professional monitoring on December 5, 2017. Further, consolidated creation costs dropped in the first quarter to 34.6 times. While we saw some sequential improvement in RMR attrition, we still have more work to do on both unit and RMR attrition, leveraging pricing strategies while taking a balanced approach to contract extensions.”\n“Our efforts around the BRINKS rebrand are also progressing. We are on track to officially launch the full rebranding in May. We are excited for this new chapter in the Company’s evolution and look forward to the opportunities ahead.”\nResults for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Ascent reported net revenue of $133.8 million, a decrease of 5.3%. The reduction in revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is due to the lower average number of subscribers in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of lower production in the dealer channel leading to fewer subscriber additions than cancellations. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in average recurring monthly revenue (“RMR”) per subscriber to $44.76 due to certain price increases enacted during the past twelve months.\nAscent’s total cost of services for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 9.1% to $32.7 million. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to expensing subscriber moves costs of $2.4 million, which were previously capitalized on the balance sheet in periods prior to January 1, 2018. This was principally the result of adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, Topic 606. An increase in subscriber acquisition costs, which include certain equipment costs and MONI labor expenditures associated with the creation of new subscribers, also contributed to the increase in total cost of services. Subscriber acquisition costs recognized in cost of services were $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAscent’s selling, general & administrative (\"SG&A\") costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased 3.2% to $37.4 million. The increase is attributable to $3.0 million in severance and related costs in conjunction with transitioning executive leadership at Ascent and increases in direct marketing and other SG&A subscriber acquisition costs associated with the creation of new subscribers. Subscriber acquisition costs in SG&A increased to $8.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. These increases were offset by decreases in stock based compensation expense and LiveWatch acquisition contingent bonus charges due to recent settlements or renegotiations of certain key agreements governing these costs. Furthermore, there was $713,000 and $641,000 of software impairment charges and consulting fees on integration and implementation of company initiatives, respectively, that were recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2017 with no corresponding costs being incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nAscent reported a net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $30.8 million, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $18.9 million in the prior year period.\nMONI reported a net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $26.2 million, as compared to a net loss of $21.0 million in the prior year period.\nAscent’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased 13.9% to $68.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $80 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. MONI’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased 14.8% to $70.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $82.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily the result of lower revenues, the expensing of subscriber moves costs, and an increase in total subscriber acquisition costs, net of related revenue. Total subscriber acquisition costs, net of related revenue, increased to $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase is primarily the result of increased production in our direct-to-consumer sales channel year over year. MONI's Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 52.4%, compared to 58.2% in the prior year period.\nFor a reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA, please see the Appendix of this release.\nTwelve Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Beginning balance of accounts 1,036,794 1,080,726 Accounts acquired 87,957 125,457 Accounts canceled (b) (159,845 ) (162,086 ) Canceled accounts guaranteed by dealer and other adjustments (a) (b) (6,187 ) (7,303 ) Ending balance of accounts 958,719 1,036,794 Monthly weighted average accounts 998,137 1,059,526 Attrition rate – Unit (b) 16.0 % 15.3 % Attrition rate - RMR (b) (c) 13.9 % 13.4 % (a) Includes canceled accounts that are contractually guaranteed to be refunded from holdback. (b) Accounts canceled for the twelve months ending March 31, 2017 were recast to include an estimated 9,522 accounts included in MONI’s Radio Conversion Program that canceled in excess of their expected attrition. (c) The Recurring Monthly Revenue (“RMR”) of canceled accounts follows the same definition as subscriber unit attrition as noted above. RMR attrition is defined as the RMR of canceled accounts in a given period, adjusted for the impact of price increases or decreases in that period, divided by the weighted average of RMR for that period. Unit attrition increased from 15.3% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 to 16.0% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018. Contributing to the increase in unit attrition was the number of subscriber accounts with 5-year contracts reaching the end of their initial contract term in the period, the relative proportion of the number of new customers under contract or in the dealer guarantee period and the Company’s more aggressive price increase strategy. There was also a modest increase to attrition attributed to subscriber losses related to the impacts of Hurricane Maria on MONI’s Puerto Rico customer base.\nRMR attrition for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 increased to 13.9% from 13.4% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting price decreases related to the Company’s efforts to secure contract extensions from existing customers.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, MONI acquired 21,547 and 29,376 subscriber accounts, respectively.\nAscent Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2018, on a consolidated basis, Ascent had $137.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. A portion of these assets may be used to decrease debt obligations or fund stock repurchases, strategic acquisitions or investment opportunities.\nAt March 31, 2018, the existing long-term debt includes the principal balance of $1.8 billion under the MONI Senior Notes, Credit Facility term loan, Credit Facility revolver and Ascent’s Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes have an outstanding principal balance of $96.8 million as of March 31, 2018 and mature July 15, 2020. The Senior Notes have an outstanding principal balance of $585.0 million as of March 31, 2018 and mature on April 1, 2020. The Credit Facility term loan has an outstanding principal balance of $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2018 and requires principal payments of approximately $2.8 million per quarter with the remaining amount becoming due on September 30, 2022. As of March 31, 2018, the Credit Facility revolver has an outstanding balance of $73.5 million and becomes due on September 30, 2021. The maturity date for both the Credit Facility term loan and the Credit Facility revolver are subject to a springing maturity 181 days prior to the scheduled maturity date of the Senior Notes. Accordingly, if MONI is unable to refinance the Senior Notes by October 3, 2019, both the Credit Facility term loan and the Credit Facility revolver would become due and payable.\nConference Call\nAscent will host a call today, Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 5:00 pm ET.

Ascent Capital believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its business, including the business' ability to fund its ongoing acquisition of subscriber accounts, its capital expenditures and to service its debt. In addition, this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate the financial performance of companies in the security alarm monitoring industry and is one of the financial measures, subject to certain adjustments, by which MONI's covenants are calculated under the agreements governing its debt obligations. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss and is indicative neither of our results of operations nor of cash flows available to fund all of our cash needs. It is, however, a measurement that Ascent Capital believes is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. As companies often define non-GAAP financial measures differently, Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by Ascent Capital should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Ascent's Net loss from continuing operations to total Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net loss from continuing operations $ (30,838 ) (18,945 ) Amortization of subscriber accounts, deferred contract acquisition costs and other intangible assets 54,411 59,547 Depreciation 2,621 2,127 Stock-based compensation 285 1,576 Radio conversion costs — 232 Severance expense (a) 2,955 27 LiveWatch acquisition contingent bonus charges 62 968 Rebranding marketing program 892 847 Integration / implementation of company initiatives — 641 Impairment of capitalized software — 713 Gain on disposal of operating assets — (6,638 ) Interest income (481 ) (395 ) Interest expense 38,652 37,486 Reversal of other-than-temporary impairment losses on sale of marketable securities (1,036 ) — Income tax expense from continuing operations 1,346 1,814 Adjusted EBITDA $ 68,869 80,000 Expensed subscriber acquisition costs, net Gross subscriber acquisition costs $ 11,690 9,033 Revenue associated with subscriber acquisition costs (1,512 ) (1,392 ) Expensed Subscriber acquisition costs, net 10,178 7,641 (a) Severance expense related to transitioning executive leadership at Ascent in 2018 and MONI in 2017.

Any significant impact to results of operations is discussed here.\nSource:Ascent Capital Group",
