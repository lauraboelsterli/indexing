They have won four of five after losing 11 of 12.\nLogan Morrison had a two-run double to cap a three-run seventh inning for a 3-2 lead and the Twins scored an unearned run on Max Kepler’s groundout in the eighth inning after Leury Garcia tied the game at 3 with a single in the last of the seventh.\nShields retired the first 16 he faced before walking Ehire Adrianza in the sixth inning. Eduardo Escobar broke up the no-hitter with a one-out single in the seventh after Brian Dozier walked to open the inning,\nRosario followed with an RBI single that sent Dozier to third, and Rosario stole second before Morrison’s two-run double made it 3-2.\nRosario had four hits, including a homer, in a 8-4 victory Saturday and has five homers and 14 RBIs in his last 10 games.\nShields gave up two hits and three runs in 6 2/3 innings, with five strikeouts and two walks.\nMinnesota starter Kyle Gibson gave up four hits and three runs in 6 2/3 innings, with eight strikeouts and two walks. He has given up five runs with 24 strikeouts in his three starts covering 17 2/3 innings but has not received a decision in any of them.\nFernando Rodney pitched the ninth for his fifth save.\nAdam Engle scored in the third inning when he doubled, took third on Garcia’s sacrifice bunt and scored on Gibson’s two-out wild pitch.\nYolmer Sanchez doubled to open the sixth inning, took third on Jose Abreu’s fly to right and scored on Matt Davidson’s sacrifice fly to right for a 2-0 lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
