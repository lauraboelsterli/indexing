O'Brien & Associates (RJO), the oldest and largest independent futures brokerage and clearing firm in the United States, announced that its London-based affiliate, R.J. O'Brien Limited (RJO Limited), has moved into new office space in the centre of the City of London. The move to the 100 Cheapside building brings together staff from two distant locations for the first time since the company's acquisition of The Kyte Group in 2015.\nThomas Texier, Managing Director of RJO Limited, said: \"This terrific new space at a signature modern building in the heart of London's business district not only accommodates our current staff of 90 but gives us room to grow significantly.

RJO's UK affiliate also won the Editor's Choice Award at the 2015 FOW International Awards, based on factors including growth prospects, company achievements and successful collaborations and acquisitions.\nAbout R.J.
