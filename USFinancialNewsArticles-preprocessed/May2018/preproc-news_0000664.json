Data emerging from this open-label, pivotal trial continue to support Incyte’s intention to submit an sNDA in the second half of 2018, seeking approval of ruxolitinib in this indication.\nInitial data from the trial evaluating INCB54828 in patients with cholangiocarcinoma are expected in second half of 2018.\nAs previously announced, the external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) review of the pivotal Phase 3 ECHO-301 study evaluating epacadostat in combination pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma determined that the study did not meet the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in the overall population compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy. The study’s second primary endpoint of overall survival also was not expected to reach statistical significance. Based on these results, and at the recommendation of the eDMC, the study has been stopped to enable patients and their physicians to consider alternative therapeutic options, and Incyte is also significantly downsizing the epacadostat development program.\nIn consultation with Incyte’s collaboration partners, and after the results of ECHO-301, the two pivotal trials of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab in lung cancer (ECHO-305 and ECHO-306) will be converted into randomized phase 2 trials. Enrollment will be discontinued in the four additional pivotal trials of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab, and in the two pivotal trials of epacadostat in combination with nivolumab; each of these studies will be amended to enable patients and their physicians to consider alternative therapeutic options. The pivotal trial in combination with durvalumab in Stage 3 lung cancer will not be initiated.\nIncyte intends to continue to investigate epacadostat’s potential as a component of combination immunotherapy in proof-of-concept trials, which will include hypotheses distinct from combinations with PD-1 and PD-L1 antagonists.\nStatus updates for Incyte’s most advanced clinical programs are provided below.\nIndication\nStatus Update\nRuxolitinib\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nSteroid-refractory acute GVHD Pivotal Phase 2 (REACH1); Phase 3 (REACH2) Ruxolitinib\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nSteroid-refractory chronic GVHD Phase 3 (REACH3) Ruxolitinib\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nEssential thrombocythemia Phase 2 (RESET) Itacitinib\n(JAK1)\nTreatment-naïve acute GVHD Phase 3 (GRAVITAS-301) Itacitinib\n(JAK1)\nNSCLC Phase 1/2 in combination with osimertinib (EGFR) Epacadostat\n(IDO1)\nLung cancer Phase 2 (ECHO-305; ECHO-306) in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1) INCMGA0012\n(PD-1) 1\nSolid tumors Phase 1 dose-escalation completed, monotherapy expansion cohorts ongoing INCB50465\n(PI3Kδ)\nDLBCL Phase 2 (CITADEL-202) INCB50465\n(PI3Kδ)\nFollicular lymphoma Phase 2 (CITADEL-203) INCB50465\n(PI3Kδ)\nMarginal zone lymphoma Phase 2 (CITADEL-204) INCB50465\n(PI3Kδ)\nMantle cell lymphoma Phase 2 (CITADEL-205) INCB54828\n(FGFR1/2/3)\nBladder cancer Phase 2 (FIGHT-201) INCB54828\n(FGFR1/2/3)\nCholangiocarcinoma Phase 2 (FIGHT-202) Notes: 1) INCMGA0012 licensed from MacroGenics A brief status update for Incyte’s earlier-stage clinical candidates is provided below.\nStatus Update\nINCB57643\n(BRD)\nFirst-in-man data presented at ASH 2017, showing optimized PK profile for combination therapy INCB53914\n(PIM)\nFirst-in-man data at ASH 2017; development expected to focus on combination therapy, including with JAK and PI3Kδ inhibition in hematological malignancies INCB52793\n(JAK1)\nDevelopment in AML to be discontinued due to lack of efficacy INCB59872\n(LSD1)\nEpigenetic mechanism targeting cell differentiation; evaluating both oncology indications and sickle-cell disease INCB62079\n(FGFR4)\n250x greater selectivity for FGFR4 over FGFR1/2/3; initial development expected to focus on hepatocellular carcinoma INCB81776\n(AXL/MER)\nExpected to enter clinical trials in 2018 INCB01158\n(ARG) 1\nNovel mechanism targeting myeloid cells; development expected to focus on combination therapy INCAGN1876\n(GITR) 2\nDose escalation completed; development expected to focus on combination therapy INCAGN1949\n(OX40) 2\nDose escalation completed; development expected to focus on combination therapy INCAGN2390\n(TIM-3) 2\nExpected to enter clinical trials in 2018 INCAGN2385\n(LAG-3) 2\nExpected to enter clinical trials in 2018 Notes: 1) INCB01158 co-developed with Calithera 2) INCAGN1876, INCAGN1949, INCAGN2390 and INCAGN2385 from discovery alliance with Agenus Non-oncology\nData from the randomized Phase 2 trial of topical ruxolitinib versus vehicle and triamcinolone creams in adult patients with atopic dermatitis are expected in the second half of 2018.\nIndication\nStatus Update\nTopical ruxolitinib\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nAtopic dermatitis Phase 2 Topical ruxolitinib\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nVitiligo Phase 2 Partnered – key highlights\nIn April 2018, the US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convened its Arthritis Advisory Committee to discuss the resubmission of the baricitinib NDA, which recommended approval of the 2mg dose of baricitinib as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis for adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. While the Advisory Committee unanimously supported the efficacy of the 4mg dose of baricitinib, it did not recommend approval of the 4mg dose of baricitinib for the proposed indication based on the adequacy of the safety and benefit-risk profiles. The FDA action date for baricitinib is in June 2018.\nIndication\nStatus Update\nBaricitinib (JAK1/JAK2) 1\nRheumatoid arthritis Approved in Europe and Japan at 2mg and 4mg doses; NDA resubmitted to FDA Baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2) 1\nAtopic dermatitis Phase 3 Baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2) 1\nPsoriatic arthritis Lilly expects the Phase 3 program to begin in 2018 Baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2) 1\nSystemic lupus erythematosus Phase 2 Capmatinib (MET) 2\nNon-small cell lung cancer, liver cancer Phase 2 in EGFR wild-type, ALK negative NSCLC patients with MET amplification and mutation Notes: 1) Baricitinib licensed to Lilly 2) Capmatinib licensed to Novartis Corporate Update\nIn April 2018, Maria E. Pasquale joined the Incyte Executive Management team as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Maria joined Incyte from Celgene Corporation, where for 17 years she held positions of increasing responsibility including Chief Counsel and Senior Vice President, Legal & Deputy General Counsel, where she led the legal department through Celgene’s global expansion.

Management believes that Non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Incyte’s GAAP disclosures. Management uses such information internally and externally for establishing budgets, operating goals and financial planning purposes. These metrics are also used to manage the Company’s business and monitor performance. The Company adjusts, where appropriate, for both revenues and expenses in order to reflect the Company’s core operations. The Company believes these adjustments are useful to investors by providing an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company’s core operations. The metrics have been adopted to align the Company with disclosures provided by industry peers. Reconciliations of GAAP net loss to Non-GAAP net income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 have been included at the end of this press release.\nGuidance related to research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses does not include estimates associated with any potential future strategic transactions.\nNon-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used in conjunction with and to supplement Incyte’s operating results as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in our industry.\nRevenues For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, GAAP net product revenues of Jakafi were $314 million as compared to $251 million for the same period in 2017, representing 25 percent growth.

Decreased GAAP research and development expenses were driven primarily by upfront and milestone expenses of $209 million related to our collaborative agreements recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2017 partially offset by an overall increase in development costs to advance our clinical pipeline.
