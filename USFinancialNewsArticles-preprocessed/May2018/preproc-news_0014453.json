    "text": "BEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - China’s foreign exchange reserves fell more than expected in April as the U.S. dollar rebounded and on growing signs that Chinese regulators are less worried about capital flight.\nReserves fell $17.97 billion in April to $3.125 trillion, compared with a rise of $8.34 billion in March, central bank data showed on Monday.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to drop around $10 billion in April to $3.133 trillion.\nCapital flight was seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy.\nIn recent weeks, authorities have announced a series of moves which suggest they are less worried about capital outflows, including allowing Chinese investors to put more money into global financial markets.\nAt the same time, China has moved to give foreign investors more access to its equity, bond and commodity futures markets, which will help support the yuan.\nThe value of China’s gold reserves fell to $77.788 billion at the end of April, from $78.419 billion at the end of March.
