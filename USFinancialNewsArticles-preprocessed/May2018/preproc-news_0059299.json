    "text": "(Reuters) - American Eagle Outfitters Inc ( AEO.N ) reported record-high first-quarter comparable sales on Thursday, helped again by strong demand for its Aerie line of lingerie. The Pittsburgh-based company’s comparable sales rose 9 percent in the quarter ended May 5, beating analysts’ average estimate of a 5.8 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFILE PHOTO - Jeans are seen for sale in an American Eagle Outfitters retail store in Manhattan, New York, U.S., May 13, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo The company forecast earnings per share of 27 to 29 cents for the second quarter, higher than analyst estimates of 25 cents.\nAmerican Eagle’s Aerie brand of lingerie has become extremely popular in recent years, especially with young adults, and has been successful in taking market share from L Brands’ ( LB.N ) Victoria’s Secret.\n“After starting a Body Positivity movement, Aerie is nothing short of spectacular, delivering record growth rates and gaining market shares in the intimate space,” CEO Jay Schottenstein told investors on a call on Thursday.\nThe retailer’s jeans business and investment in e-commerce also contributed to its success in the quarter, Schottenstein added.\nAerie first-quarter comparable sales gained 38 percent, the retailer’s highest growth rate to date.\nBut seasonal goods such as shorts suffered from a cooler-than-expected spring, the company said.\nNet income rose to $39.9 million, or 22 cents per share, in the quarter, from $25.2 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier.\nNet revenue rose 8 percent to $823 million.\nShares were trading at $22.29 in morning trading after climbing to $22.76 earlier in the session, from $22.61 at Wednesday’s close.\nReporting by Melissa Fares in New York; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Dan Grebler\n ",
