    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s media regulator said on Monday it had opened a further three investigations into Russian news channel RT to see whether it had breached impartiality rules.\nOfcom has previously warned that RT producer TV Novosti could lose its right to broadcast in Britain if it fails its “fit and proper” test.\nOfcom has said it saw a significant increase in the number of programs on the RT service that required investigation following a nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in March.\n“We have opened three further investigations into the due impartiality of news and current affairs programs broadcast on RT,” an Ofcom spokeswoman said.\nReporting by Kate Holton; editing by Michael Holden\n ",
