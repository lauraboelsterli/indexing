    "text": "LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland will not review the size of its branch network in Scotland again until at least 2020, its Chief Executive told lawmakers questioning the bank’s sweeping closures in the country.\nSpeaking to the Scottish Affairs Committee, Ross McEwan said that the bank, which has closed hundreds of branches across Britain in the past year alone, had to respond to changing consumer behaviours but is now “comfortable” with the size of its network in Scotland.\n“I want to be clear, our branches do remain a core part of our service and we will not look at the size of the network again in Scotland until at least 2020,” he told the committee.
