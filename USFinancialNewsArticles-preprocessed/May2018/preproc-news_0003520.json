    "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nIRIDEX Corporation (Nasdaq:IRIX) today reported the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nCyclo G6™ product revenue increased approximately 50% year-over-year Shipped a record 11,600 G6 probes Shipped 99 G6 laser systems Presence at American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) and Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) meetings included presentation of 10 papers and posters reviewing the treatment of over 550 eyes with MicroPulse® technology for glaucoma Total revenue of $9.5 million Appointed Maria Sainz and David Bruce to Board of Directors, adding extensive and relevant expertise in medical device product development and commercialization to leadership team\n“We’re off to a solid start in 2018 and are making progress in our shift towards a glaucoma, disposables-oriented business model. Revenues in the first quarter were driven by new G6 system placements and increased probe utilization worldwide,” said William M. Moore, President and CEO. “I’m pleased with the strides our commercial team is making with both new and existing customers, as well as the impact our marketing organization is having on raising awareness on the benefits of our MicroPulse technology in treating all stages of glaucoma. I am also pleased that we have made significant progress regarding the voluntary recall of our TrueFocus LIO Premiere™ laser accessory and have developed an action plan to return this product to the market.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 9% to $9.5 million from $10.5 million during the same period of the prior year. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower retina product revenues related to the Company’s voluntary LIO recall. The decrease was partially offset by growth from G6 product revenues and the reversal of a portion of the reserves related to the LIO recall.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.9 million, or 41.2% gross margin, compared to $4.5 million, or 42.6% gross margin, in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin was primarily impacted by unfavorable geographic mix and less efficient overhead absorption, partially offset by the benefit of higher margin G6 revenues and the reversal of a portion of the reserves related to the LIO recall.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $7.5 million compared to $6.3 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase is attributable to investments to support the Company’s commercial infrastructure, including increased sales and marketing expenses.\nLoss from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.6 million, compared to loss from operations of $1.9 million for the same period of the prior year.\nCash and cash equivalents were $18.5 million as of March 31, 2018.\nGuidance for Full Year 2018\nIRIDEX reiterated its guidance for 2018 of G6 probe shipments of 40,000 to 45,000, representing growth of approximately 32% year-over-year at the midpoint and shipments of 350 to 400 G6 systems. Total revenue for the full year is expected to be $37 million to $41 million.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nIRIDEX’s management team will host a conference call today beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.
