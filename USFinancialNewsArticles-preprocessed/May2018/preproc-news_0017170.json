According to reports, the tech giant will sell its entire stake to Walmart as part of the deal.\nHomegrown internet retailer Flipkart has a user base of 100 million, according to the company's website. India, which has a population of more than 1.3 billion, is seeing rapid growth in its digital economy with the emergence of e-commerce start-ups like Snapdeal and Paytm.\nThe investment sees Walmart take on U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon in a key growth market for the company. In 2016, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced that his firm would invest $3 billion in India. Amazon reportedly made its own bid for a majority stake in Flipkart.\nWalmart's deal with Flipkart marks the retailer's latest move to up its international presence. In late April, Walmart's U.K. supermarket brand Asda merged with rival Sainsbury's , a tie-up that presented a significant competitive challenge to Britain's dominant grocer Tesco .",
