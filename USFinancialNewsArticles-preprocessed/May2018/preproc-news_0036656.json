    "text": "Innovative immuno-therapy company welcomes proven leaders in pharma and therapeutics\nAUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Triumvira Immunologics , a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing a novel platform for engineering T cells to attack cancers, today announced the formal appointments of Sabine Chlosta, MD, PhD, as Chief Medical Officer, and Jon Irvin as Vice President of Finance.\n“We are delighted to expand our executive management team with Dr. Chlosta and Mr. Irvin,” said Paul Lammers, MD, MSc., President and CEO of Triumvira Immunologics. “We look forward to leveraging Sabine’s extensive experience in immuno-oncology and clinical trial oversight as we work to develop and commercialize innovative therapies that will empower a patient’s own immune system to tackle serious and life-threatening diseases.”\n“In addition, Jon’s finance expertise in the pharmaceutical and technology industries will be a strong asset to Triumvira as we build our company to bring new treatments to patients in need,” Lammers added.\nPrior to Triumvira, Sabine Chlosta consulted for Aurora BioPharma, a start-up company developing CAR-T cells in solid tumors and was previously a Senior Medical Director at Merck & Co. where she played a key role in the development of its PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda ® in Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and oversaw trials in other indications, as well. Earlier in her career, Dr. Chlosta was a medical director at Glycomimetics where she helped launch the company’s first trial in cancer. She began her industry career as a Fellow in Oncology Drug Development at Novartis overseeing clinical pharmacology trials with a small molecule and helped launch their CAR-T lymphoma program with Kymriah ® . Dr. Chlosta is a board-certified pediatric hematologist oncologist out of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Cornell Medical College.\n\"Triumvira is poised for growth and success in T cell therapy, and I am thrilled to be part of the team to take our innovative TAC technology into the clinic,\" said Dr. Chlosta.\nJon Irvin was the Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance at Mirna Therapeutics, a publicly traded biotechnology company, before joining Triumvira. He also served in executive financial positions for Voxpath Networks, Inc., a telecommunications and intellectual property company, Reddwerks Corporation, a software company, Esoterix, Inc., a medical laboratory company, Topaz Technologies, a pharmaceutical software company, and BioNumerik Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company. Mr. Irvin previously worked with Ernst & Young’s life science practice in Palo Alto, California.\nIrvin commented, \"It's exciting to be a part of this growing team as we develop our novel platform to treat patients’ unmet medical needs.\"\nAbout Triumvira Immunologics\nTriumvira Immunologics, Inc. (“Triumvira”) is an immunotherapy company co-founded in 2015 by Dr. Jonathan Bramson at McMaster University and Bloom Burton & Co., with the vision of developing novel T cell therapies that are safer and more efficacious than current gene therapy cancer treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and engineered T cell receptor (TCR) therapies. Our proprietary T cell Antigen Coupler (TAC) technology recruits the entire natural T cell receptor and is independent of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), allowing for the development of better therapies for a broader range of patients with solid or liquid malignancies and with diseases other than cancer. With operations spanning North America, our corporate offices are located in Austin, Texas, with our research facilities in Hamilton, Ontario.
