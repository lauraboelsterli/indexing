Then, at a meeting later that day, the board voted 11 to 3 to dilute Redstone's voting stake to roughly 20 percent from nearly 80 percent. nyti.ms/2Is2tT4\n- The U.S. FDA took a new tack and began posting a list of makers of brand-name drugs that have been the target of complaints, to persuade them to \"end the shenanigans,\" in the commissioner's words. nyti.ms/2wPqGxh\n- Toshiba Corp said it had received \"all required antitrust approvals\" for the deal with a consortium led by the U.S. investment firm Bain Capital.
