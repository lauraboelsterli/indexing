    "text": "MONTREAL, May 15 (Reuters) - Taiwan’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday it was asking Air Canada for a “speedy correction” following the airline’s decision to list Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, as a part of China on its booking website.\nIt was not clear when the change was made, but as recently as last week the site’s entries for Taiwan did not mention China, according to checks made by Reuters.\nAir Canada spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur said the carrier’s “policy is to comply with all requirements in all worldwide jurisdictions to which we fly.”\nSelf-ruled Taiwan is claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory, and has become one of China’s most sensitive issues and a potential military flashpoint. China has been pressuring airlines to refer to Taiwan as part of China.\nTaiwan’s foreign ministry said in a statement it was “deeply concerned” about Air Canada’s move to refer to Taiwan as part of China on the booking website.
