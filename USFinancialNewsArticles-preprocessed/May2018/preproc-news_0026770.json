Formula One F1 - Spanish Grand Prix - Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain - May 12, 2018 Toro Rosso's Brendon Hartley leaves the medical centre after a crash during practice REUTERS/Albert Gea\nHartley was taken to the Circuit de Catalunya medical centre for checks but was passed fit to continue even if his presence in later qualifying looked unlikely due to the extent of the damage.\nThe rear of his Honda-powered car almost broke away from the rest of the chassis when picked up by a crane to remove it from the barriers.\nThe accident, right at the end of the session and after Hartley had gone wide onto the grass run-off and lost control at the right-handed turn nine, brought out red flags to halt the action.\nHamilton topped the timesheets with a best lap of one minute 17.281 seconds, a mere 0.013 quicker than Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas, on supersoft tyres and under overcast skies. Formula One F1 - Spanish Grand Prix - Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain - May 10, 2018 Toro Rosso's Brendon Hartley during a press conference ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix REUTERS/Albert Gea\nFerrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who won the first two races of the season and will be chasing his fourth successive pole position, was third fastest but 0.269 slower than his title rival.\nHamilton leads the German by four points ahead of Sunday’s race, the first of the European season, with some rain forecast before qualifying.\nKimi Raikkonen, with a new engine in the back of his Ferrari, was fourth fastest ahead of Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo and the two Ferrari-powered Haas cars of Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean.\nSpain’s two drivers, Renault’s Carlos Sainz and McLaren’s Fernando Alonso, were eighth and ninth respectively.\nThe Williams nightmare continued, with Canadian Lance Stroll 19th and Russian Sergey Sirotkin 20th.
