Analysts said expectations for higher interest rates continued to drive bond yields higher, overshadowing any fallout from the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal for now.\nWalmart fell 2 percent after it acquired a controlling stake in Indian homegrown e-commerce firm Flipkart for about $16 billion, the U.S. retailer’s biggest foreign investment.\nAt 7:12 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 128 points, or 0.53 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 11.75 points, or 0.44 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 22.75 points, or 0.33 percent.\nAfter a recent inflation reading crossed the Federal Reserve’s target level, investors are awaiting for data on U.S. producer and consumer prices.\nThe Labor Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, will likely show that the producer price index rose 0.2 percent in April after a 0.3 percent rise in March. Consumer prices data is due on Thursday.\nMatch Group rose 5.6 percent after the Tinder-owner beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue and profit as it attracted more subscribers to its dating apps and websites.\nWalt Disney dipped 0.5 percent, despite beating profit estimates.
