    "text": "BERLIN, May 16 (Reuters) - Lufthansa said it had cancelled 23 flights, affecting 2,600 passengers, after a system failure at the operator of Frankfurt airport, its main hub.\nLufthansa said the system failure at Fraport lasted more than 8 hours and meant arrivals at the airport had to be reduced. Passengers also missed connecting flights and flights were delayed as a result.\nThe affected system contains information on aircraft positions, which is used to send ground staff to planes.\n“All this had to be carried out manually during the failure,” Lufthansa said, adding that it had to ask flight crews to use radios or telephones to state their position.\nFraport was not immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan Additional reporting by Ilona Wissenbach Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ",
