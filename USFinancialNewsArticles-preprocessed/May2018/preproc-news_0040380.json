    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 8:01 AM / Updated 34 minutes ago Currency trading volumes jump 17.2 pct in April - CLS Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Currency trading volumes jumped 17.2 percent in April from the same month a year earlier, data from CLS showed on Wednesday, extending a strong start to the year for foreign exchange trading platforms.\nCLS, a major settler of trades in the foreign exchange market, said in a statement that average daily traded volume submitted to it topped $1.777 trillion in April, up from $1.516 trillion in 2017.\nVolumes, however, fell 4.2 percent from March of this year as a rise in currency price volatility reversed.\nForeign exchange trading platforms are reporting record volumes in 2018 after an increase in volatility and as regulatory changes drive more investors onto their platforms.
