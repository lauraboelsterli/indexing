    "text": "IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Endologix, Inc. (Nasdaq: ELGX), a developer and marketer of innovative treatments for aortic disorders, today announced that it has appointed John Onopchenko as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.\nDan Lemaitre, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Endologix, Inc., commented, “We are very pleased to welcome John as our Chief Executive Officer. Over the course of the past seven months in the COO role, John has shown the Board first hand that he is an exceptional operator with significant manufacturing, clinical, and regulatory experience. His proven skills in scaling and improving productivity in global commercial organizations at Johnson & Johnson and GE Medical and as a medical device venture capitalist give us confidence in his ability to lead Endologix on an exciting path forward. Separately, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank John McDermott for his invaluable contributions to Endologix and for making this transition as smooth as possible.”\nJohn Onopchenko, Chief Executive Officer of Endologix, Inc., said, “I am honored to be named Chief Executive Officer of Endologix. Since joining the Company as COO, I have been deeply involved in the operations of the organization, and I’m excited about the bright future that Endologix has ahead of it. I am looking forward to further advancing the Company’s innovative portfolio, enhancing its credibility and reputation with our physicians and customers, and building a culture of accountability, with the ultimate goal of delivering value to our stakeholders around the globe.”\nMr. Onopchenko, who brings to Endologix almost thirty years of executive leadership experience in medical devices, has served as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer since October 2017. Before joining Endologix, Mr. Onopchenko was Executive Vice President for Acutus Medical, where he was responsible for program management/product development, quality, marketing, and sales. Prior to that, he served on the Board of Directors of Volcano Corporation (“Volcano”) and later became the company’s Executive Vice President / Chief Operating Officer. While at Volcano, he was responsible for its peripheral business unit, regulatory affairs, quality assurance, program management/product development, clinical affairs, business development, and the Axsun business unit. Following Volcano’s acquisition by Philips, John was retained as Senior Vice President and Head of Therapy Strategy. Before joining Volcano, Mr. Onopchenko spent approximately 10 years at Johnson & Johnson, where he led medical device investments with Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation and was responsible for worldwide operations for Advanced Sterilization Products.\nMr. Onopchenko earned his MBA from the University of Chicago and a Bachelor of Science from Ursinus College in Collegeville, Pennsylvania.\nAbout Endologix, Inc.\nEndologix, Inc. develops and manufactures minimally invasive treatments for aortic disorders. The Company's focus is endovascular stent grafts for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). AAA is a weakening of the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in the body, resulting in a balloon-like enlargement. Once AAA develops, it continues to enlarge and, if left untreated, becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture. The overall patient mortality rate for ruptured AAA is approximately 80%, making it a leading cause of death in the United States.
