The broker said the broadcaster’s valuation was attractive and its viewing share was growing.\nUtilities stocks fell to the bottom of the FTSE after Bernstein cut Severn Trent to “underperform” and reduced its target price on United Utilities.\n“Regulatory headwinds have intensified in recent months, with two developments of particular concern including dividend caps and mandatory sharing of financing outperformance for companies with high gearing,” wrote Bernstein utilities analysts.\nSevern Trent and United Utilities declined 2.2 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.\nRandgold Resources led the mining sector up, gaining 3.8 percent. Miners were the biggest boost to the FTSE despite metals prices slipping back slightly. (Reporting by Helen Reid and Danilo Masoni; Editing by Keith Weir)",
