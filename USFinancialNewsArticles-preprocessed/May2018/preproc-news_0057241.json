Soccer Football - Real Madrid celebrate winning the Champions League Final - Madrid, Spain - May 27, 2018 Real Madrid players and fans celebrate during victory celebrations REUTERS/Sergio Perez\nMadrid, who beat Liverpool 3-1 in Saturday’s final in Kiev to win a record-extending 13th European Cup, began their celebrations with a service at the Almudena cathedral before visiting the city chambers and later the city hall, addressing gathered fans in the Plaza del Sol.\n“Fortunately, this is turning into a routine for us,” said Real captain Sergio Ramos of his team, who became the first side since Bayern Munich in 1976 to win the competition three years in a row.

Now we have to think about winning number 14, because that’s what this club obliges us to do.”\nWith the shiny trophy at the front of the bus, the team advanced towards the Cibeles fountain where they traditionally celebrate trophy wins.\nThe parade will come to a climax at the club’s Santiago Bernabeu stadium where the players will continue their celebrations with supporters.
