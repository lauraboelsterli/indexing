    "text": "Injured forward Andre Iguodala is out for a fifth consecutive playoff game with a leg injury, the Golden State Warriors announced on the eve of Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\nMay 14, 2018; Houston, TX, USA; Golden State Warriors forward Andre Iguodala (9) dunks against Houston Rockets guard Gerald Green (14) during the third quarter in game one of the Western conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Erik Williams-USA TODAY Sports Iguodala will not play Thursday when the Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers meet in the first game of the NBA Finals at Oracle Arena.\nAccording to the Warriors, Iguodala was evaluated this week and is making progress.\n“However, the pain that accompanies the bone bruise persists, as does the inflammation of the nerve surrounding the left knee,” the team said Wednesday in a statement, adding Iguodala would be “re-evaluated again before Game 2.”\nHead coach Steve Kerr said the injury, originally described as a bone bruise, had no defined timetable for recovery and is typically a matter of an individual’s pain threshold.\nIguodala was missing for the final four games of the Western Conference finals as the Warriors outlasted the Houston Rockets on Monday night in the finale of a seven-game series.\n“He’s frustrated,” Kerr said Wednesday. “His body has not responded at this point.”\nWithout Iguodala, the Warriors are squeezing more minutes out of Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney. Bell, in particular, is helping the Warriors defensively and bringing energy at both ends of the court, Kerr said Monday.\n“We’re thrilled with the way he’s played,” Kerr said.\nIguodala received a second opinion on the injury, which the Warriors are now classifying as a lateral (left) leg contusion. He was injured in Game 3 of the series with the Rockets when he bumped knees with Houston Rockets guard James Harden.\nThe MVP of the 2015 Finals, Iguodala and Klay Thompson shared the responsibility of defending LeBron James in the 2017 meeting between the teams. Golden State won the series last summer four games to one.\nAccording to ESPN, Iguodala is actively seeking any remedy to the knee discomfort.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
