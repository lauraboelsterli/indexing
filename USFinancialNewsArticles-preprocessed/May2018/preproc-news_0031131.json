    "text": "BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalan pro-independence parties failed on Saturday for a fourth time to elect a regional leader, 10 days before the deadline to form a government or hold a new election.\nCiudadanos Catalan leader Ines Arrimadas votes during an investiture debate of Quim Torra, the candidate proposed by former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to head the regional Catalan government, at the regional parliament in Barcelona, Spain, May 12, 2018. REUTERS/Juan Medina Quim Torra, a close ally of former leader Carles Puigdemont, needed 68 votes to be elected but obtained only 66. However, Torra could still be elected in a second round of voting to beheld on Monday in which only a simple majority in the 135-seat regional parliament is needed, provided the far-left CUP party can be persuaded not to vote against his candidacy.\nThe CUP, whose four parlementarians abstained in the vote on Saturday, will meet on Sunday to decide how it will vote in the second round.\nBacking unilateral independence over the negotiated exit favoured by larger separatist parties, the CUP has previously broken ranks with the pro-independence block.\nCatalonia has been in political limbo since December last year when pro-independence parties won early elections called by the central government.\nLeftist CUP party spokeman Carles Riera delivers his speech during the investiture debate of Quim Torra, the candidate proposed by former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to head the regional Catalan government, at the regional parliament in Barcelona, Spain, May 12, 2018. REUTERS/Juan Medina Madrid invoked special powers to take direct control of Catalonia in October after the region declared independence. The wealthy, populous region has been administered by the central government ever since.\nCatalan lawmakers must pick a leader to form a government by May 22 to avert further elections, following a standoff during which separatist politicians put forward candidates who were blocked by the courts for being either abroad or in jail, among them Puigdemont.\nAddressing the Catalan parliament on Saturday, Torra, a staunch supporter of secession, vowed to work towards a Catalan republic and referred to Puigdemont as the legitimate leader of the region.\nQuim Torra, the candidate proposed by former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to head the regional Catalan government, is applauded by his fellow party deputies after delivering his speech during an investiture debate at the regional parliament in Barcelona, Spain, May 12, 2018. REUTERS/Juan Medina Torra also reiterated his openness to dialogue with Madrid, as well as calling on the EU to oversee negotiations.\nThe Spanish government said Torra’s speech was “confrontational”. “Any illegality will be corrected and any violation of our constitutional framework will be responded to,” it said in a statement.\nReporting by Sam Edwards, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ",
