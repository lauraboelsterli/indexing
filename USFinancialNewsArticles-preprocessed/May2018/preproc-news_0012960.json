    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy’s far-right League, Matteo Salvini, said on Monday he had asked the president to give him a mandate to try to form a government to end two months of deadlock following an inconclusive election.\nLeague party leader Matteo Salvini (C) speaks next to President of Fratelli d'Italia party (Brothers of Italy) Giorgia Meloni (L) and Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi following a talk with Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale palace in Rome, Italy, May 7, 2018. Italian Presidential Press Office/Handout via REUTERS “We trust that the president will give us the chance to find a majority in parliament,” Salvini told reporters after meeting President Sergio Mattarella at the head of a center-right alliance of parties.\nThe March 4 ballot produced a hung parliament, with the center-right bloc taking the most seats, and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerging as the biggest single party. It was far from clear if Salvini could muster enough votes in parliament to form a government.\nReporting by Gavin Jones; Editing by Crispian Balmer\n ",
