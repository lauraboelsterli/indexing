Net revenue for the period was 150.6 million pounds, it said in a statement on Tuesday.\nDespite a period of market volatility at the start of the year, Hargreaves said it took on a net 60,000 new clients, with many keen to make the most of their yearly tax-free savings limit, which is reset at the end of April.\n“Hargreaves Lansdown had another good tax year end, delivering strong net new business of 3.3 billion pounds over the busiest time of our year,” Chief Executive Chris Hill said.\n“We have continued to invest in our helpdesk, operations and technology teams and I’m pleased that the consequence of this is that we are able to support stronger volumes of client activity.”\nKBW analyst Jonathan Richards said the growth in assets was “significantly better” than his expectations for 2.2 billion pounds, while the market losses were less than the WMA Balanced Index, an index representing a wealth management portfolio.\nThe asset growth meant that revenues also beat expectations and should see analyst consensus forecasts move up as a result, he added, maintaining a ‘Market Perform’ rating.\nAt 0715 GMT, shares in Hargreaves were up 1.8 percent at 1,908 pence a share, among the best-performing stocks in the blue-chip FTSE 100.
