Officials in predominantly Shi’ite Muslim Iran often refer to Sunni Muslim radicals as “takfiris”.\nHatami said Iran would continue to develop its missile programme. U.S. president Donald Trump cited the lack of any provisions in the Iran nuclear deal to rein in the Islamic Republic’s missile development as one of the reasons why he decided to pull out of the deal.\n“We will increase our defensive strength day by day and we will upgrade our missile strength per our schedule to blind the eye of those who wish ill for these people,” Hatami said, according to Fars News.
