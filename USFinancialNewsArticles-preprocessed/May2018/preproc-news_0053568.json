Slideshow (2 Images)\nAttendances have grown an average of 38 percent each year since 2013, the study added.\nMore than 4 million people watched soccer’s Euro 2017 semi-final between England and the Netherlands, while 1.94 million people tuned in to the Women’s Rugby World Cup 2017 final on ITV, according to market research firm Nielsen.\nThe Women’s Cricket World Cup, won by England, was watched by more than 1.1 million, according to data collected by Sky.\n“These all prove that the appetite is there,” Parlour said.\n“The aim of the #ShowUp campaign is to build on this momentum so that we get packed audiences throughout the sporting year from a local level through to those major competitions.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
