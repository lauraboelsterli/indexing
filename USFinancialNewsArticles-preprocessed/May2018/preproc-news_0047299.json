These forward-looking statements relate to future events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"seek,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential\" or \"continue,\" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.\nOther factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements can be found in MSCI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on February 26, 2018 and in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed or furnished with the SEC. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what MSCI projected. Any forward-looking statement in this press release reflects MSCI's current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to MSCI's operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity. MSCI assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180524005180/en/\nMSCI Inc.\nMedia Inquiries\nKaitlyn Downing, + 1 646 465 6695\nPR@msci.com\nor\nMSCI Global Client Service\nEMEA Client Service , +44 20 7618.2222\nAmericas Client Service, +1 888 588 4567\nAsia Pacific Client Service, +852 2844 9333\nSource: MSCI Inc.",
