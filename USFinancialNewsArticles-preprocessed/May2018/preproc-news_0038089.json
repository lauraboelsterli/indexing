    "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky., Ramaco Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:METC) today reported net income of $5.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018, compared with a net loss of $2.6 million, or $(0.07) per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-operating expenses (“adjusted EBITDA”) was $9.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $328 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRandall Atkins, Ramaco Resources’ Executive Chairman remarked, “We are very pleased to report our first positive financial results since inception. These results reflect more than a doubling of our revenues since the prior quarter to $56 million. Today, we have forward sales commitments for more than 1.7 million tons of our planned 2018 production. As we reported previously, 1.1 million tons of domestic sales were committed and priced last year. We have sold 249 thousand tons into export markets at fixed prices averaging $109 per ton (FOB mine) and have export commitments for an additional 400 thousand tons at index prices. At current market prices, these index sales would exceed the fixed prices contracted to date. For the balance of the year, we expect to demonstrate even stronger earnings and cash flows than in the first quarter.”\nThe Company ended the quarter with $7.3 million of cash on hand and $23.5 million of accounts receivable.\nOperational Results\nRevenues totaled $55.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up 133% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Total production for the first quarter was 380 thousand tons as compared with 275 thousand tons for 2017’s fourth quarter.\nThe Company’s total cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $65 for produced coal, up from about $58 in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was due to the impact of weather-related issues at the Company’s mines and lower than anticipated surface mining production volumes caused by unexpected geological challenges.\nMichael Bauersachs, Ramaco Resources’ President and CEO commented, “Although strong, our export sales in the first quarter were somewhat curtailed by the rail transportation challenges reported by many others in our industry. Our deep mines at Elk Creek continue to achieve their projected production and cost expectations in the upper $50 per ton range. At our surface mine, however, we encountered a number of areas that were previously mined. These were old auger works which pre-dated present reporting laws. This unmapped mining was not evident in our advanced planning. The positive news is that these headwinds on surface production and rail issues were partially offset by both increased export price realizations and demand.”\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded income tax expense of $743 thousand based on an expected effective tax rate of approximately 12% for 2018. Cash taxes payable for 2018 are expected to be less than $400 thousand.\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $12.8 million during the first quarter of 2018. The Company expects to spend $29 million to $34 million of capital expenditures in 2018, including newly planned capital projects designed to reduce the impact of adverse weather on transportation within its Elk Creek Mining Complex.\nThe exhibit below summarizes some of the key metrics for the sequential periods:\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 Sales Volume (a) Company 403 163 Purchased 119 102 Total 522 265 Company Production (a) Elk Creek Mining Complex 360 273 Berwind Mine 20 2 Total 380 275 Company Financial Metrics (b) Average revenue per ton $ 91.37 $ 69.76 Average cash costs of coal sold 65.02 58.04 Average cash margin per ton $ 26.35 $ 11.72 Purchased Coal Financial Metrics (b) Average revenue per ton $ 99.62 $ 93.97 Average cash costs of coal sold 88.57 86.82 Average cash margin per ton $ 11.05 $ 7.15 Capital Expenditures (a) $ 12,769 $ 21,758\nNotes: (a) In thousands. (b) Excludes transportation. 2018 Guidance\nUpdated sales guidance for 2018 is presented in the following table:\nCommitted 2018 Sales Volume (a) Volume Avg Price Company: Domestic, fixed priced 1,077 $ 78 Export, fixed priced 249 $ 109 Export, indexed 392 Total Committed Company Tons 1,718 Purchased: Domestic, fixed priced 418 $ 100 Export, fixed priced 21 $ 132 Total Purchased Tons 439 Total Committed Sales Volume 2,157\nNotes: (a) Volumes in thousands. As result of the newly discovered geological conditions at its Elk Creek surface mine, the Company is lowering its annual guidance for Company produced tons to 1.8 to 2 million tons from a previous production guidance of 2 to 2.2 million tons. This reduction solely reflects anticipated lower surface mine production, which the Company anticipates may be partially offset by better production results from its deep mines.\nAbout Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nRamaco Resources is an operator and developer of high-quality, low cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania.

The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, equity-based compensation, depreciation, amortization and non-operating expenses. A reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income taxes to Adjusted EBITDA is included below. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA: Net income (loss) $ 5,266,277 $ (2,599,891 ) $ (3,093,143 ) Add (Subtract): Depreciation and amortization 2,437,500 1,819,089 156,127 Interest and dividend income, net 99,922 (3,284 ) (93,821 ) Income taxes 743,307 — — EBITDA 8,547,006 (784,086 ) (3,030,837 ) Add: Equity-based compensation 550,805 354,873 2,145,333 Accretion of asset retirement obligation 123,468 101,277 101,277 Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,221,279 $ (327,936 ) $ (784,227 ) POINT OF CONTACT:\nMichael P.
