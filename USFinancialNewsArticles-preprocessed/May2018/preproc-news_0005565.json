    "text": "HOUSTON, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Archrock, Inc. (NYSE:AROC) today reported net income of $2.1 million of 2018, compared to net income of $49.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $14.0 million of 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 included an income tax benefit of $53.4 million from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nEBITDA, as adjusted (as defined below), was $78.7 million 2018, compared to $71.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $65.4 million of 2017.\n(in thousands, except percentages and ratios) 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Net income (loss) $2,069 $49,142 ($14,013 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Archrock stockholders ($3,816 ) $47,560 ($11,685 ) EBITDA, as adjusted $78,745 $71,934 $65,356 Contract operations revenue $161,197 $156,299 $149,984 Contract operations gross margin $96,602 $91,585 $85,887 Contract operations gross margin percentage 60% 59% 57% Aftermarket services revenue $50,843 $52,636 $39,901 Aftermarket services gross margin $8,506 $8,546 $6,169 Aftermarket services gross margin percentage 17% 16% 15% Selling, general, and administrative $27,508 $29,660 $27,553 Cash available for dividend (1) $45,137 N/A N/A Cash available for dividend coverage 2.90x N/A N/A March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Total available horsepower (at period end) 3,862 3,847 3,795 Total operating horsepower (at period end) 3,314 3,253 3,079 Horsepower utilization spot (at period end) 86% 85% 81% (1) Concurrent with the closing of the merger of Archrock, Inc. and Archrock Partners, L.P., the definition of cash available for dividend was changed. As such, historical periods are not presented.\n“In the first quarter, Archrock posted solid operating performance in both product lines, grew operating horsepower by 60,000 and booked new orders at historically high levels and at higher prices than in previous quarters,” said Brad Childers, Archrock’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our contract operations backlog hit a new record level in the quarter, with commitments from customers well into 2019.”\n“In addition, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding common units of Archrock Partners in April. The merger of Archrock and Archrock Partners simplifies our structure, accelerates deleveraging and improves our cost of capital,” continued Childers. “With the merger behind us, we are focused on leveraging our strong operating platform and financial position to profitably expand the business. Demand for compression services remains robust, creating opportunities for us to put existing fleet units back into operation as well as to invest in new larger horsepower units that provide attractive returns to our company and investors. As a result, we plan to invest $230-$250 million of growth capital this year.”\n“We are excited about the expected increase of U.S. natural gas production and its implications for Archrock,” continued Childers. “Natural gas production is the primary growth driver of our contract compression business. The Energy Information Administration forecasts 7.5 bcf/d of growth in U.S. natural gas production in 2018, with additional growth into the next decade. We are well positioned to capitalize on this growth, win profitable business, grow our operating fleet and increase our cash flow and our earnings,” concluded Childers.\nNet loss attributable to Archrock stockholders of 2018 was $3.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share. Net income attributable to Archrock stockholders, excluding the items listed in the following sentence, of 2018 was $1.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share.
