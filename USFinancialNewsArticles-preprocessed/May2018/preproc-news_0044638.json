    "text": "NEW HAVEN, Conn., May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MLNT), a commercial-stage company discovering, developing and commercializing novel antibiotics to treat serious bacterial infections, today announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock to raise aggregate proceeds of approximately $75,000,000. All of the shares of the common stock to be sold in the offering are to be sold by Melinta.\nCertain of Melinta’s principal and other shareholders and their respective affiliates and associates, as well as certain of Melinta’s directors and executive officers, have indicated an interest in purchasing shares of our common stock in the offering at the public offering price with an aggregate value of up to $50,000,000. However, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, the underwriters may determine to sell more, fewer or no shares in the offering to any of these potential investors, or any of these potential investors may determine to purchase more, fewer or no shares in the offering.\nMelinta intends to use the net proceeds from the proposed sale of its shares of common stock for general corporate purposes, including to invest in our industry leading portfolio of antibiotics, including potential expansion of our field sales force to drive growth; invest in our supply chain to optimize manufacturing processes and improve cost of goods; fund future milestone obligations primarily related to receipt of approval of Vabomere ™ (meropenem and vaborbactam) for European commercialization and payments to The Medicines Company as part of the infectious disease business acquisition; capitalize on potential business development opportunities; and fund working capital.\nJ.P. Morgan and Jefferies are acting as joint bookrunners for the offering. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is acting as lead manager for the offering.\nIn addition, Melinta intends to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $11,250,000 of shares on the same terms and conditions. The offering is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering.\nThe shares are being offered pursuant to an effective registration statement (including a prospectus) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The offering will be made only by means of the prospectus and prospectus supplement that form part of the registration statement.
