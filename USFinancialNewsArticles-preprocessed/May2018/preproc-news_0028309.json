    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s UACJ Corp said on Wednesday it is suspending aluminum buying from Russia’s United Company Rusal because of U.S. economic sanctions on the producer, but the company has found alternative supplies from others.\nFILE PHOTO: The company logo of United Company RUSAL is displayed during a news conference in Hong Kong January 11, 2010. REUTERS/Bobby Yip UACJ, Japan’s major manufacturer of rolled aluminum products, expects its units in the United States to benefit from higher prices of the metal after U.S. imposed import duties on aluminum, a senior company executive said at a press briefing.\n“But we are closely watching where Chinese and other aluminum products that were shut from the U.S. market will be headed,” the executive said, citing a risk of them coming to Japan or elsewhere in Asia.\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ",
