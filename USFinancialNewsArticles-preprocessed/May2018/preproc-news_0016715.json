The name “SolutionHealth” recognizes the challenges and opportunities in creating a regional, New Hampshire-based solution for the unique and complex challenges facing healthcare providers here. My commitment, working with our excellent Board of Trustees, senior leadership teams, doctors and employees, is to collaboratively develop SolutionHealth into a highly-coordinated community based regional health care network that will enhance access to affordable care while ensuring quality of care delivered throughout southern New Hampshire. My family and I are excited about this new opportunity, and we look forward to moving to New Hampshire very soon and becoming active members of the community here.”\nAbout Sherry Hausmann\nWith the final closing that formally establishes SolutionHealth as a newly formed integrated health system, Solution Health’s Board of Trustees is pleased to welcome Sherry Hausmann as the system’s inaugural President and CEO.\nSherry will be joining SolutionHealth in July after serving as Regional Hospital President for Via Christi Health, the largest integrated health delivery system in Kansas and a member of Ascension Health.
