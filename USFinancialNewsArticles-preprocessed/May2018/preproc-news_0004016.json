    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jones Energy, Inc. (NYSE:JONE) (“Jones Energy” or “the Company”) today announced financial and operating results for the 2018.\nHighlights\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 of $28.9 million, or a loss of $0.30 per share, non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $30.3 million, or $0.32 per share, and EBITDAX of $29.8 million. 1 Management and the Board of Directors are reevaluating the Company’s financial, operating and drilling plans for 2018 and beyond.\nFinancial Results\nTotal operating revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $57.5 million as compared to $41.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Total revenues including the impact of current period settlements of matured derivative contracts were $48.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $67.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $66.2 million as compared to $54.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of $28.9 million, or a loss of $0.30 per share attributable to common shareholders as compared to net loss of $3.5 million, or $0.05 per share attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Excluding, on a tax-adjusted basis, certain items that the Company does not view as indicative of its ongoing financial performance, and adjusting for non-controlling interest, the Company had adjusted net loss for three months ended March 31, 2018 of $30.3 million, or adjusted net loss of $0.32 per share, as compared to adjusted net income of $3.9 million, or of $0.01 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nEarnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and exploration expense (“EBITDAX”) for the first quarter 2018 was $29.8 million. This compares to first quarter 2017 EBITDAX of $53.3 million and fourth quarter 2017 EBITDAX of $37.7 million.\nFirst quarter 2018 lease operating expense (“LOE”) was $10.2 million as compared to first quarter 2017 LOE of $8.8 million. On a dollar per boe basis, first quarter 2018 LOE was $5.12 per boe, compared to first quarter 2017 LOE which was $5.18 per boe.\nDue to newly adopted revenue recognition accounting standards, the Company will present certain oil and gas transportation costs as a separate expense item in its operating costs on a go forward basis. Historically, these costs were netted against revenue. For the first 2018 the Company had $0.7 million of related oil and gas transportation costs.\nPreferred Dividend Update\nOn April 17, 2018 the Company’s Board of Directors declared a contingent dividend on the Company’s 8.0% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”), payable on May 15, 2017 to holders of record as of May 1, 2018. As a reminder, the Company is currently prohibited from paying cash dividends on the Preferred Stock under the terms of its indebtedness; however, it may choose to issue dividends in Class A Common Stock, which it has done for the past several payment periods. In order for the Company to pay the dividend in full, the price per share of Class A Common Stock, as determined and adjusted pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, must be at or above $0.76 (the “Floor Price”) 2 . The Board of Directors has determined that the dividend on the Preferred Stock payable May 15, 2018 will not be paid if the price per share of Class A Common Stock is below the Floor Price, and the right to receive those dividends will accrue for holders of Preferred Stock.\nOperating Results\nDuring the first quarter of 2018 Jones Energy produced 1,998 MBoe, or 2,198 Boe/d. Merge production represented approximately 30% of total Company production for the first quarter of 2018. A breakout of first quarter production is shown in the table below.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018: Oil\n(MBbls) Natural Gas\n(MMcf) NGLs\n(MBbls) Total\n(MBoe) % of\nTotal Cleveland 373 3,117 399 1,292 65 % Merge 221 1,412 152 608 30 % Other 7 378 28 98 5 % Total 601 4,907 579 1,998 100 % Eastern Anadarko (Merge)\nDuring the first quarter, the Company spud eight wells and completed nine wells in the Merge, of which four completed wells were Woodford and five completed wells were Meramec targets. Merge production for the first quarter 2018 of 6.8 MBoe/d grew 36% over fourth quarter 2017 production of 5.0 Mboe/d.\nAt the end of the first quarter, the Company dropped one of its two rigs in the Merge. The Company currently plans to drill all nine wells remaining on the 2018 drilling schedule with the one remaining rig in the Merge.\nWestern Anadarko (Cleveland)\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company activated a rig in the Western Anadarko, spudding and completing one well, in order to satisfy the Company’s drilling obligations. Average daily net production in the Cleveland was 14.4 MBoe/d, which represented 65% of total production in the first quarter of 2018.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company made $63.4 million in capital expenditures, of which $11.6 million was related to spending on non-op wells spud in both the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter 2018. Operated drilling and completion capital accounted for $49.7 million, 94% of which was spent in the Company’s operated Merge program. Maintenance and leasing capital expenditures for the first quarter 2018 totaled $2.1 million.\nUpdated Operating Plan\nJones Energy is reevaluating its financial, drilling and operating plan for 2018 and beyond. At this time, there are no changes to the previously announced 2018 capital plan. Jones Energy continues to budget $150 million in full year 2018 capital expenditures, but now expects to drill 17 gross (11 net) wells in the Merge, down from the 20 gross (13 net) wells previously announced, two-thirds of which will now be single section laterals and the remainder a mix of 10,000’ and 7,500’ laterals. Jones Energy expects to complete the HBP program of its operated Merge position in November 2018.\nThe Company is suspending guidance until the review of its operating and financial plan is complete.\nLiquidity and Hedging\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $231 million of cash and $25 million outstanding on its revolver.

EBITDAX is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management believes EBITDAX is useful because it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. EBITDAX has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets. Our presentation of EBITDAX should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP. Our computations of EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to EBITDAX for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2018 2017 Reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDAX Net income (loss) $ (28,920 ) $ (3,515 ) Interest expense 21,862 12,887 Exploration expense 3,299 2,944 Income taxes (2,992 ) 21 Depreciation and depletion 41,441 35,654 Accretion of ARO liability 251 201 Change in TRA liability (3,482 ) (668 ) Other non-cash charges 351 41 Stock compensation expense 1,330 1,972 Deferred and other non-cash compensation expense 77 136 Net (gain) loss on derivative contracts 9,022 (22,320 ) Current period settlements of matured derivative contracts (8,940 ) 26,332 Amortization of deferred revenue (374 ) (458 ) (Gain) loss on sale of assets (3,124 ) 64 Financing expenses and other loan fees 25 24 EBITDAX $ 29,826 $ 53,315\nJones Energy, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations\nAdjusted net income (loss) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We define adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss) excluding the impact of certain non-cash items including gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments not yet settled, impairment of oil and gas properties, non-cash compensation expense, and the other items described below. We believe adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings per share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items for which the timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We define Adjusted earnings per share as earnings per share plus that portion of the components of adjusted net income (loss) allocated to the controlling interests divided by weighted average shares outstanding. We believe adjusted earnings per share is useful to investors because it provides readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items for which the timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined.
