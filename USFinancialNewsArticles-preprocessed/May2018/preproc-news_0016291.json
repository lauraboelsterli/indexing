REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\nBritish house prices were up 2.2 percent last month compared with the same period a year ago, compared with 2.7 percent in March and undercutting all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 3.3 percent.\nOn the month, prices fell 3.1 percent after a 1.6 percent rise in March, again weaker than all forecasts.\n“Housing demand has softened in the early months of 2018, with both mortgage approvals and completed home sales edging down,” Halifax managing director Russell Galley said.
