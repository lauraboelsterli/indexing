    "text": "89 COMMENTS SANTA FE, Texas—As this grieving town searches for answers about a mass shooting by a 17-year-old student, an emotional and divisive debate has emerged over bullying at the high school where the rampage took place.\nThe alleged shooter’s father, Antonios Pagourtzis, said his son—a quiet former football player known for wearing a trench coat to school— had faced bullying and said he believed that was part of the trigger for the May 18 attack, which left 10 dead and 13 wounded.\nWith students returning to school Tuesday for the first time after the shooting, some here say bullying has long been a problem at this rural Texas town’s lone high school, but others don’t recall the suspected shooter, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, being picked on by his peers at all.\nRelated\nDaughter Studying Abroad Killed at Texas School How the Texas School Shooting Unfolded Victims Remembered at Church Service Santa Fe High Takes the Field, and Takes a Bow Lives Lost in Three Decades of School Shootings Shooting Victims: Girl Scout, Substitute Teachers Grace Johnson, an 18-year-old Santa Fe High senior who sat next to Mr. Pagourtzis in class each day and hid with several others during the shooting, recalled him as always joking and “ a pretty normal student .” Ms. Johnson said she doesn’t think bullying is pervasive at Santa Fe High School, which she added has the sorts of social cliques commonly found in American high schools.\n“I guess there was just normal bullying,” she said. “I don’t think it was bullying like you’ll see in a movie or anything with people being thrown into lockers. I didn’t see that. It was very, very minor.”\nIn many mass school-shooting cases in which the accused is a student, allegations have surfaced that the shooter was bullied, but whether there is a clear link between the two issues is the subject of contention.\nRelated Video A shooting at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, in mid-May left at least 10 dead and others injured.

An analysis by The Wall Street Journal found that in 17 of 33 school-shooting cases since 1990 that resulted in at least three victims dead or injured, the accused shooters had a history of being bullied, according to court documents and news reports.\nDr. Nadine Connell, director of the Center for Crime and Justice Studies at the University of Texas at Dallas, who studies bullying and youth criminal behavior, said her research hasn’t shown any connection between bullying and mass school shootings. And some experts noted that kids are bullied without ever resorting to extreme violence like a mass shooting.\n“There were certainly situations where they were shunned by classmates, but they weren’t bullied,” she said of the school shooters she has looked at. “Their peers were afraid of them or not interested in interacting with them.”\nThe shooting has left the small Texas community struggling with claims that bullying played a role in the alleged shooter’s decision to attack. Photo: Godofredo A. Vasquez/Associated Press John Nicoletti, a police psychologist who also works with schools and helped respond to the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado and other mass shootings, said that school shooters often feel a “perceived injustice” or feel victimized in some way. But Dr. Nicoletti said that simply because a student feels that way doesn’t necessarily mean they were bullied.\nAt Santa Fe High School, the local school district reported zero bullying incidents in four reporting cycles from 2009 to 2016, according to a Journal analysis of U.S. Education Department data. It isn’t alone in reporting zero bullying in the 2015-16 school year when roughly 72% out of about 24,250 public high schools also reported no bullying incidents.\nThe federal government’s definition of bullying includes actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally and purposely excluding someone from a group. The types of bullying include verbal, social and physical.\nThe Education Department requires school districts to report such information biannually to ensure compliance with civil rights laws.\nOfficials with the Santa Fe school district didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nExperts said it is unlikely that any high school wouldn’t have a single bullying incident over a seven-year span. But some schools track only the most serious cases, while others may intervene early in a case and not report every incident out of fear of federal or state intervention.\n“They are supposed to report and they should, but many times they don’t,” said Ross Ellis, founder and chief executive of Stomp Out Bullying, a national antibullying group. “Some schools are not trained to properly deal with bullying, other times they may not consider it bullying, or they may just not want to deal with the problem.”\nThe day after the shooting, the Santa Fe district released a statement denying that Mr. Pagourtzis was bullied by coaches, following news reports where at least one student said that he was picked on by coaches and other students, including while on the football team.\nThat swift denial prompted a heated and varied reaction from current and former students, as well as parents.\nBeretta Colt said she dropped out of Santa Fe High her senior year partly because she was being taunted by other students over family problems she was having and teased because she had dated another female student at the school.\nAt one point, Ms. Colt—who said her father named her after two gun makers —said she started an antibullying club at the school, which she said had the support of some teachers.\nBut she added that the smallness and homogeneity of Santa Fe made it difficult to be different. Ms. Colt, 20, described the town as conservative and largely white, a place where if you were “a kid who played football and went hunting” or a girl who was “pretty” you were popular.\n“You can get singled out because basically everybody knows everything about you,” she said.\nA parent whose child graduated last year said his son was picked on by fellow students and football coaches to the point where he quit the football team.\n“It was a terrible situation,” said the parent, who still has ties to the school. “I was glad he graduated and got out of there.”\nOther disputed the notion that the school was troubled by bullying.\nDebbie Bowman, whose daughter attends Santa Fe High, said there is “absolutely” not a bullying problem at the school. Kids may pick on each other, she said, but it isn’t a place “where kids come home from school every day crying because kids are being mean to them.”\n“We’re a really small community and everybody looks out for everybody, builds each other up,” she said.\nStill, the mass shooting has left the community searching for answers. A teacher who works in the school district interacted with Mr. Pagourtzis several times this past school year. She described him as polite, “always yes ma’am, no ma’am,” and doing the work he was asked to do. She said he kept to himself but saw no evidence of him being picked on by other kids.\n“I don’t think we’ll ever know why he did it,” said the teacher. “I’m not sure he knows.”\n—Erin Ailworth, Jim Oberman and Tom McGinty contributed to this article.\nWrite to Tawnell D.
