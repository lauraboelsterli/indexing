    "text": "3 COMMENTS I met Graham Kerr in the late 1980s. Tall, animated, bearded, kilted and ever-charming, Mr. Kerr told me the story of his conversion to healthier eating and a simpler lifestyle. He had been hired to cook on a luxury yacht in the Mediterranean and, in a lightning-strike moment, had reimagined his life, which he would now devote to helping others—including his wife, who had survived a heart attack. He referred to his new style of cooking as “minimax”—minimal animal fats and maximum flavor.\nThe reissue of his classic “The Graham Kerr Cookbook” predates his conversion to the vegetable kingdom; the book, originally published in 1966, is red in tooth and claw. And—let’s get this out of the way quickly—the recipes are time capsules, but not necessarily the type one exults in opening. Think tinned clams for spaghetti vongole, white sauces, shrimp cocktail made from store-bought cooked shrimp, suet pudding, silverbelly eels, lamb hearts, big roasts. He recommends whipping egg whites in stock to clarify them and using arrowroot for thickening. One hoary chestnut is a recipe for “Angels in Orbit”: sauté slices of salami until they curl into cups and fill them with raw oysters. Another curiosity is “Iced Rice Hawke’s Bay,” a rice pudding with halved gooseberries, filled with crème de menthe. The ingredient lists in this cookbook are themselves throwbacks: The author includes imperial measurements along with American and metric conversions.\nGraham Kerr was born in London in 1934, but his first television gig was in New Zealand in 1959, with a show called “Entertaining With Kerr,” for which he dressed in military uniform. (At the time, Mr. Kerr was the catering adviser for the Royal New Zealand Air Force.) In 1964, he moved to Sydney and started a new show with the same name, which caught on quickly. He moved to Canada and launched “The Galloping Gourmet” with an American producer; this show ran from 1969 to 1971 and made him a household name. The moniker “The Galloping Gourmet” stemmed from a 1967 book that Mr. Kerr co-authored with wine expert Len Evans, titled “The Galloping Gourmets,” based on a 35-day world-wide trek to the planet’s best restaurants. The “Galloping Gourmet” television program was a huge hit, and in 1969 the first American edition of “The Graham Kerr Cookbook” was published.\nPhoto: Bob Peterson The Graham Kerr Cookbook By Graham Kerr\nRizzoli, 319 pages, $32.50\nAlthough James Beard and other culinary elites were unimpressed with the cooking, it was difficult not to be charmed by Mr. Kerr’s offhand enthusiasm and his strength of character. The opening of his eponymous show featured Mr. Kerr jumping over a chair (a stunt conceived by his wife, Treena). And is there not something enchanting about a cook who wears French cuffs and an ascot?\nWhen he was offered a highly lucrative deal to promote a brand of plastic wrap, he turned it down. And later in life, after his conversion to Christianity, he insisted that the closing credits of his Canadian show, “Take Kerr,” include a passage from the Bible. Some stations and sponsors were opposed to the idea, but he refused to compromise.\nThe recipes in “The Graham Kerr Cookbook,” to my mind, reflect the nadir of the culinary 20th century, a time when good, fresh ingredients were hard to find and when the British Empire had laid low local cuisines from India to the Caribbean. The 1970s were an especially cruel time in the culinary world: Anglophone diners had run the gamut on continental cuisine and were about to be reborn into a new American kitchen, one without the avocado-colored appliances but with fresh local ingredients and an emphasis on pure, natural flavors.\nYet the book does succeed on two levels. First, Mr. Kerr’s writing style mimics his show’s opening gimmick, marrying charm to an outsize persona. The opening page of the egg chapter offers this observation: “A chicken needs grit and determination to produce an egg—with a shell, that is. Yet what do you care—familiarity breeds contempt.” The author admits to two great but telling ambitions in life: The first was to be the Brigade of the Guards officer who troops the Colour at the Horse Guards Parade in London (the perfect stage for Mr. Kerr’s bespoke personality) and the other was to eat two boiled eggs each morning out of a silver cup.\nIn the chapter on “Graduate Recipes” (Roast Wild Duck, Shoulder of Lamb Wellington, Back Sticks Venison Stew and so on), Mr. Kerr notes that a reader should proceed only if “you are an excellent cook” or that “you can afford to run the risk of failure.” And his historical note regarding the “Miller’s Wife” method of shallow-frying fish is pure Kerr: The story features a fresh-caught trout and a miller’s wife, who clasped the fish to her amply floured bosom before throwing it into a hot buttered skillet.\nBuried in the weeds, one also finds a handful of culinary techniques worth pursuing. We are told that lobsters die at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and so a warm-water bath in the sink is more humane than a splash into boiling water. Mr. Kerr excoriates the home cook for using vinegar when poaching eggs. Instead, he advises, dunk in-the-shell eggs into boiling water for 10 seconds before poaching; this produces a cohesive shape. A final splash of chilled cream prevents scrambled eggs from overcooking. Steam a chicken for 10 minutes before roasting if it is older and tougher. And the best chips—French fries to the rest of us—are made by soaking perfectly sized batons of potatoes in warm water with lemon: This helps convert some of the surface starch to sugar, which results in crispier fries.\nRetro cookbooks, it seems, are the latest trend in book publishing, from “The Graham Kerr Cookbook” to “The Vintage Baker” to Tamar Adler’s “Something Old, Something New.” I have a large collection of old cookbooks dating all the way back to Fannie Farmer and Mrs. Beeton, and let it be said that few stand the test of culinary time. Recipes are born of changing cultures and tastes and rarely appeal to the next generation, much less the next century.\nThese recipes are a snapshot of a North American culinary culture in flux, stuck between our deep-rooted immigrant past and the brave new world of Chez Panisse and its spawn. But though they may be outdated, Mr. Kerr evolved, pursued his passions and devoted his life to helping others. Happily, this cookbook reflects that man. Graham Kerr is always welcome in my kitchen, even though both of us have moved well past our culinary beginnings.\n—Mr. Kimball is the founder of Milk Street, a magazine and multimedia company dedicated to home cooking.",
