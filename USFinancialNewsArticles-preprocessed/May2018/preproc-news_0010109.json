(Reuters) - Facebook Inc will offer its first dating service, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday, signaling the entry of the world’s largest social network into a growing market that sent shares of established dating site operators tumbling. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks about a dating feature at Facebook Inc's annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S. May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Stephen Lam\nShares of Match Group Inc, the owner of popular dating app Tinder, fell more than 18 percent on the news. IAC, Match Group’s parent company, dropped almost 14 percent.\nZuckerberg told software developers at Facebook’s annual F8 conference that a dating service would be a natural fit for a company that specializes in connecting people online.\n“There are 200 million people on Facebook that list themselves as single, so clearly there’s something to do here,” Zuckerberg said.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam\nA prototype displayed on screens at the F8 conference showed a heart shape at the top-right corner of the Facebook app. Pressing on it will take people to their dating profile if they have set one up.\nThe prototype was built around local, in-person events, allowing people to browse other attendees and send them messages.\nThe feature will be for finding long-term relationships, “not just hook-ups,” Zuckerberg said. It will be optional and will launch soon, he added, without giving a specific day.\nFacebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said in a separate presentation that the company would share more over the next few months.
