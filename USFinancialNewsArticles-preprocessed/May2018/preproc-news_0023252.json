(Nasdaq: GTIM), operator of Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard, a regional quick service restaurant chain focused on fresh, high quality, all-natural products, and Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar, a full-service, upscale concept, today announced its preliminary unaudited financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 27, 2018.\nKey highlights of the Company’s financial results include:\nSame store sales for company-owned Good Times restaurants increased 7.1% for the quarter Same store sales for company-owned Bad Daddy’s restaurants increased 0.2% for the quarter on top of last year’s increase of 3.2% Total revenues increased 29% to $23,509,000 for the quarter from the prior year The Company opened one new Bad Daddy’s restaurant during the quarter, the fourth of the year Restaurant Sales for the Bad Daddy’s restaurants for the quarter increased 42.6% to $15,953,000 from the prior year with Bad Daddy’s Restaurant Level Operating Profit* (a non-GAAP measure) increasing to 16.9% of sales for the quarter Adjusted EBITDA* (a non-GAAP measure) for the quarter increased 88.5% to $1,167,000 from $619,000 for the same quarter last year and increased 89.8% year to date over the prior year The Company ended the quarter with $3.9 million in cash and $5.1 million drawn against its senior credit facility, with approximately $6.9MM of availability on the facility\nBoyd Hoback, President & CEO, said, “Good Times’ sales were quite impressive during the quarter as we continue to see a general overall increase due to the better burger initiatives implemented a year ago. We were only on television media for 3 weeks out of the quarter and we had comparable weather to last year, so we believe there is a renewed underlying strength in the brand as we are seeing traffic growth along with taking price increases.” Regarding Bad Daddy’s, Hoback added, “We saw some near-term cannibalization of a couple of existing stores in Charlotte and one in Raleigh from the opening of new, very high-volume stores earlier this year in each market, which impacted the same store sales percentage growth on our very small base of stores in the index, but even with that we posted our twelfth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth. What is particularly gratifying is the continued sales performance of our class of 2017 and 2018 new stores versus our system average. We opened our Chattanooga store during the quarter and are opening our second Atlanta store in early June with two additional North Carolina stores, one South Carolina store and the third Atlanta store to open this summer.”\nCommenting on the Company’s guidance for fiscal 2018, Ryan Zink, Chief Financial Officer, stated, “Strong same-store sales at our Good Times brand and our recently-opened Bad Daddy’s restaurants, coupled with easing of commodity costs and improving controls around labor scheduling, have enabled us to generally reaffirm our guidance for fiscal 2018, despite being slightly under our guidance for Bad Daddy’s same-store sales for the second quarter. We continue to project 2018 revenues of approximately $100 million, and are slightly raising the lower end of our Adjusted EBITDA guidance, which is now between $5.2 and $5.5 million. We are maintaining our comparable sales guidance for Good Times at approximately 3.0% - 3.5% and 0.5% - 1.0% for Bad Daddy’s through the end of fiscal 2018. We anticipate an annualized Adjusted EBITDA run rate as of the end of the fiscal year of approximately $7 million.”\nFiscal 2018 Outlook:\nThe Company updated its guidance for fiscal 2018:\nTotal revenues of approximately $99 million to $101 million with a year-end revenue run rate of approximately $108 million to $110 million Total revenue estimates assume same store sales of approximately +3.5% for Good Times for the balance of the year, and approximately 5.0% for FY2018 in total. We expect same store sales of 0.5% - 1.0% in the remaining two quarters of the year for Bad Daddy’s, excluding the impact of the two and a half weeks closure of the original Bad Daddy’s for building renovations. General and administrative expenses of approximately $7.7 million to $7.9 million, including approximately $600,000 of non-cash equity compensation expense The opening of 6 new Bad Daddy’s restaurants during Q3 and Q4 (one being a joint venture unit) Total Adjusted EBITDA* of approximately $5.2 million to $5.5 million Restaurant pre-opening expenses of approximately $2.6 – $2.7 million Capital expenditures (net of tenant improvement allowances) of approximately $9.0 – $9.5 million including approximately $1.2 million related to fiscal 2019 development Fiscal year end long term debt of approximately $10.0 to $10.5 million\n*For a reconciliation of restaurant level operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of why the Company considers them useful, see the financial information schedules accompanying this release.\nConference Call: Management will host a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2018 financial results on Thursday, May 10 th at 3:00 p.m. MDT/5:00 p.m. EDT.

The Company defines restaurant-level operating profit to be restaurant revenues minus restaurant-level operating costs, excluding restaurant closures and impairment costs. The measure includes restaurant level occupancy costs, which include fixed rents, percentage rents, common area maintenance charges, real estate and personal property taxes, general liability insurance and other property costs, but excludes depreciation. The measure excludes depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the restaurants. The measure also excludes selling, general and administrative costs, and therefore excludes occupancy costs associated with selling, general and administrative functions, and pre-opening costs. The Company excludes restaurant closure costs as they do not represent a component of the efficiency of continuing operations. Restaurant impairment costs are excluded, because, similar to depreciation and amortization, they represent a non-cash charge for the Company’s investment in its restaurants and not a component of the efficiency of restaurant operations. Restaurant-level operating profit is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income from operations or net income as indicators of financial performance. Restaurant-level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The tables above set forth certain unaudited information for the fiscal first quarters for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, expressed as a percentage of total revenues, except for the components of restaurant operating costs, which are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (In thousands)\nGood Times Restaurants Inc. Thirteen-Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended Mar 27,\n2018 Mar 28,\n2017 Mar 27,\n2018 Mar 28,\n2017 Net loss as reported $ (431 ) $ (711 ) $ (1,014 ) $ (1,344 ) Adjustments to net loss: Depreciation and amortization 845 672 1,653 1,274 Interest expense 91 37 175 57 EBITDA $ 505 $ (2 ) $ 814 $ (13 ) Preopening costs 491 431 976 713 Non-cash stock based compensation 97 205 215 404 GAAP rent in excess of cash rent 11 (11 ) (16 ) (16 ) Non-cash disposal of assets (9 ) (4 ) (17 ) (11 ) Asset impairment charge 72 0 72 0 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,167 $ 619 $ 2,044 $ 1,077 Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of operating performance that does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP, and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. This measure is presented because we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable basis for evaluating our ongoing results of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization and further adjustments to reflect the additions and eliminations presented in the table above.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented because: (i) we believe it is a useful measure for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization expenses and asset disposals, closure costs and restaurant impairments and (ii) we use adjusted EBITDA internally as a benchmark for certain of our cash incentive plans and to evaluate our operating performance or compare our performance to that of our competitors. The use of adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. Companies within our industry exhibit significant variations with respect to capital structures and cost of capital (which affect interest expense and income tax rates) and differences in book depreciation of property, plant and equipment (which affect relative depreciation expense), including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies. Our management believes that adjusted EBITDA facilitates company-to-company comparisons within our industry by eliminating some of these foregoing variations. Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies, and our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by excluded or unusual items.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006089/en/\nGood Times Restaurants Inc.\nInvestor Relations Contacts:\nBoyd E.
