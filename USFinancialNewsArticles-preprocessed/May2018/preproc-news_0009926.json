All information provided in this release and in the conference call is as of the date hereof and Tableau undertakes no duty to update this information except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTableau believes that the use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share and free cash flow is helpful to its investors. These measures, which are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense and expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, each to the extent attributable to the cost of revenues, from gross profit. Non-GAAP gross margin is the ratio calculated by dividing non-GAAP gross profit by total revenues. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense and expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets from operating income (loss). Non-GAAP operating margin is the ratio calculated by dividing non-GAAP operating income (loss) by total revenues. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense, expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-GAAP income tax adjustments from net income (loss). Non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income (loss) by the basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding includes the effect of dilutive shares in periods of non-GAAP net income.\nNon-GAAP financial information is adjusted for a tax rate equal to Tableau's estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income over a three-year financial projection. This long-term rate is based on Tableau's estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures. To determine this long-term non-GAAP tax rate, Tableau evaluates a three-year financial projection that excludes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets. The long-term non-GAAP tax rate takes into account other factors including Tableau's current operating structure, its existing tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where Tableau operates. The long-term non-GAAP tax rates applied to the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were 20% and 30%, respectively. Tableau applied these same non-GAAP tax rates to its financial results presented in accordance with each of ASC 606 and ASC 605. The long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 assumes the Company's deferred income tax assets will be realized based upon projected future taxable income excluding stock-based compensation expense. The Company anticipates using the long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to the three months ended March 31, 2018 in future periods and may provide updates to this rate on an annual basis, or more frequently if material changes occur.\nBecause of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash expenses, Tableau believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between its operating results from period to period. The expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets is dependent upon estimates and assumptions, which can vary significantly and are unique to each asset acquired; therefore, Tableau believes non-GAAP measures that adjust for the amortization of acquired intangible assets provides investors a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. All of these non-GAAP financial measures are important tools for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating Tableau's own operating results over different periods of time.\nTableau calculates free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment. Tableau considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by Tableau's business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in Tableau's business, making strategic acquisitions, repurchasing Tableau's common stock and strengthening Tableau's balance sheet. All of Tableau's non-GAAP financial measures are important tools for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating Tableau's operating results over different periods of time.\nNon-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in Tableau's industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on Tableau's reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Tableau's business and an important part of the compensation provided to its employees. Because of the significant impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on the Company's results of operations, non-GAAP financial measures for the first quarter of 2018 (computed in accordance with ASC 606) are not as comparable to non-GAAP financial measures for the first quarter of 2017 (computed in accordance with ASC 605). The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Tableau's business.\nTableau Software, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March

Customer accounts are typically organizations. In some cases, organizations will have multiple groups purchasing Tableau software, which count as discrete customer accounts.\n(2) These operating metrics are based on Tableau's definition of bookings, which is defined as the first year of contracted revenue only and does not include additional years beyond the first year unless a customer pays for those years up front. Bookings includes both new sales and renewals. Tableau's bookings may not be comparable to similarly named measures disclosed by other companies in the software industry. Bookings is not a measure of revenue or an indication of actual revenue results. Revenues ultimately recognized could be affected by a number of factors. License bookings include sales of software licenses and subscriptions to Tableau Online. Ratable bookings are sales transactions that result in revenues, which will be amortized over a period of time.\n(3) Tableau defines total annual recurring revenue (\"Total ARR\") as the annualized recurring value of all active contracts at the end of a reporting period. Total ARR includes subscription annual recurring revenue (\"Subscription ARR\") and the annualized value of all maintenance contracts related to perpetual licenses active at the end of a reporting period.\n(4) Tableau defines Subscription ARR as the annualized recurring value of all active subscription contracts at the end of a reporting period. Subscription ARR includes term licenses and renewals, subscription enterprise license agreements and Tableau Online subscriptions and renewals, and excludes distribution original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") license agreements and perpetual-style enterprise license agreements.\n(5) Remaining performance obligations represent amounts from contracts with customers allocated to performance obligations that will be satisfied at a later date. These amounts include additional performance obligations that are not yet recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Remaining performance obligations presented under FY 2017 represents the balance as of January 1, 2018 upon adoption of ASC 606. These amounts do not include deferred revenue, which is already included within the consolidated balance sheets.\n(6) Ratable revenues were amortized during the respective periods. For example, sales of Tableau Online, as well as maintenance and support, are recognized ratably. Excluding the impacts of adopting the new revenue recognition standard, enterprise license agreements, on-premises term licenses and OEM license arrangements are also recognized ratably.\n(7) Ratable license revenues were amortized during the respective periods. For example, sales of Tableau Online are recognized ratably. Excluding the impacts of adopting the new revenue recognition standard, enterprise license agreements, on-premises term licenses and OEM license arrangements are also recognized ratably.\n(8) Services revenues were recognized upon delivery of professional services and training.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tableau-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300641425.html\nSOURCE Tableau Software",
