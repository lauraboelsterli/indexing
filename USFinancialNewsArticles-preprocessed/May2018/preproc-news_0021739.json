    "text": "Bryce Harper homered in each of the first two innings, and Matt Adams added another homer as the Washington Nationals stretched their winning streak to six with a 7-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday night in Washington.\nManager Dave Martinez shifted Harper to the leadoff spot earlier this week, and that move has worked well. Harper led off with a homer in the first — his second leadoff homer in three days — and added a two-run shot in the second.\nThe right fielder has now homered four times in the four games since shifting to the top spot. He finished 2-for-5 with those three RBIs.\nStarter Gio Gonzalez (4-2) returned after a 39-minute rain delay in the fourth and left after five with the Nationals holding a 7-0 lead. He gave up only two hits and struck out five with two walks.\nPhillies starter Nick Pivetta (1-2) lasted just one inning plus three batters and allowed six runs on five hits, including the Harper homers.\nThe Harper first-inning homer plus RBI singles from Ryan Zimmerman and Matt Wieters gave Washington a 3-0 lead in that frame.\nIn the second, Harper belted his two-run blast to make it 5-0 before Adams hit a two-run homer later in the inning on the first pitch from Drew Hutchison. Adams — who also homered Thursday — helped Gonzalez on defense in the fourth with a leaping catch of a Maikel Franco fly ball at the wall in left.\nThe Phillies scored three against Trevor Gott in the sixth thanks to back-to-back homers from Carlos Santana (two-run) and Franco (solo). Gott then left with what appeared to be an injury.\nAnthony Rendon played third base in his rehab assignment at Class A Potomac, and The Washington Post reported that he went 3-for-4 and could return Saturday. The Post also said that Rendon “reluctantly” said he’s had a hairline fracture of his left big toe. The team had been calling it a bruise/contusion.\nShawn Kelley (ulnar nerve irritation) will do a rehab assignment at Potomac Sunday and also could be back soon after that, according to The Post.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
