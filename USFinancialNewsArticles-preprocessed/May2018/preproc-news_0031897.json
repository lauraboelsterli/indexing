    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Tuesday signaled the possibility of allowing long-term interest rates to rise above zero before his 2 percent inflation target is met.\nFILE PHOTO: Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda attends a news conference at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, in this photo taken by Kyodo April 27, 2018. Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS “It’s not as if we will defend the 10-year yield target of around zero percent at all costs,” Kuroda told parliament, when asked whether the BOJ would keep the yield target at that level until inflation hits 2 percent.\nBut Kuroda added he had “absolutely no plan” to raise the yield target for the time being with inflation still distant from 2 percent.\nReporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim\n ",
