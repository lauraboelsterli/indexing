    "text": "Move Supports Technology-Centric Vision as Boston Emerges as a Digital Hub\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Duck Creek Technologies today announced the new location for its corporate headquarters within South Boston’s Innovation District. The move, which is now complete, reaffirms Duck Creek’s commitment to transforming the insurance industry and attracting top talent from Boston’s renowned educational institutions.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently ranked Boston as the city best positioned to lead the “shift to a digital economy.” Duck Creek’s relocation, which includes 175 employees, improves the company’s access to Boston’s vibrant technology community, including current and potential customers, analyst firms, and IT and business talent.\n“The insurance industry is undergoing a technology-driven transformation,” said Michael Jackowski, Duck Creek CEO. “The move to the Innovation District directly supports our efforts to design, create, implement, and market Duck Creek’s technology. As insurance companies look to invest in solutions to better serve their customers, Duck Creek is deploying highly-advanced, configurable end-to-end platforms that align specifically with their needs.”\nDesigned by SGA Architects, the 30,000-square-foot office is located at 22 Boston Wharf Road. The move will accommodate the addition of many new hires, as the company anticipates significant growth in 2018 and beyond.\n“Duck Creek is a technology company at its core – and our goal is to pave the way for the future of the insurance industry,” said Matt Foster, Duck Creek’s chief operations officer. “The decision to relocate our headquarters to the Innovation District is further supported by our continuing growth, access to highly- skilled, educated and motivated job candidates, and the collaborative spirit that we’re seeing in Boston.”\nAbout Duck Creek Technologies\nDuck Creek Technologies paves a genuine path to the future for P&C insurance companies. Decades of insurance experience underpin advanced technologies specifically designed to accommodate change – allowing carriers to navigate uncertainty and capture market opportunities faster than their competitors.
