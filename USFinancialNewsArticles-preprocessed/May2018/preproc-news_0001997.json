    "text": "DENVER, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PDC Energy, Inc. (\"PDC\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:PDCE) today reported its 2018 first quarter operating and financial results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nYear-over-year total production increase of 34 percent to 8.9 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe) or approximately 99,000 Boe per day.\nYear-over-year oil production increase of 51 percent to 3.8 million barrels (MMBbls), representing 43 percent of total production.\nTotal crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales of approximately $305 million, a 61 percent increase compared to first quarter 2017 sales of approximately $190 million.\nNet cash from operating activities of approximately $205 million, a 47 percent increase compared to first quarter 2017 levels of approximately $140 million.\nCompleted the previously disclosed sale of Utica Shale assets and amendment to an existing Wattenberg oil gathering agreement for total proceeds of approximately $65 million.\nThe Company recently executed a firm, long-term sales agreement beginning in June 2018 that provides takeaway capacity for the majority of its 2018 and 2019 Delaware basin oil production and diversifies price exposure towards a Brent-based index.\nCEO Commentary\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Bart Brookman commented, “Our operating and financial results were slightly ahead of internal expectations thanks to smooth execution and stronger commodity pricing. Today, we are a few short months away from the much anticipated midstream expansions in Wattenberg, which should greatly enhance operational and financial performance in the second half of 2018. In the Delaware, our operating results continue to improve and our newly executed firm sales agreement is a big step towards ensuring PDC’s production in the area has a reliable and price-competitive outlet. For the balance of 2018, look for PDC to remain committed to executing our cash flow neutral capital program while exiting the year with an undrawn revolver.”\nOperations Update\nProduction 2018 was 8.9 MMBoe, or approximately 99,000 Boe per day, an increase of 34 percent from the first quarter of 2017. Oil production of 3.8 MMBbls in the first quarter of 2018 represents 43 percent of total production and was an increase of 51 percent compared to first quarter of 2017 volumes and two percent from the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company's capital investment in the development of oil and natural gas properties and other capital expenditures, before the change in accounts payable, was approximately $250 million in the quarter and includes several Wattenberg wells being turned-in-line approximately two weeks ahead of schedule.\nIn the Wattenberg, the Company spud 35 and turned-in-line 29 gross operated wells in the first quarter while continuing to employ one full-time completions crew. In the Delaware Basin, the Company spud eight and turned-in-line seven wells in the first quarter, including five in the North Central area delivering positive early production results. The wells, which include a mixture of Wolfcamp A and B, standard- and mid-reach laterals, have yet to reach peak production, and are currently averaging approximately 1,150 Boe per day with 55 percent crude oil. These results are slightly ahead of internal expectations through early flowback.\nMarketing and Midstream Update\nIn April 2018, PDC entered into a firm oil transportation agreement with Tallgrass Energy to transport 12,500 gross operated Wattenberg barrels per day via pipeline to Cushing, OK and area refineries. The Company continues to work closely with its primary third-party gathering and processing midstream provider in the basin to plan for expected midstream expansions coming online in 2018, 2019 and over the long-term.\nIn May 2018, the Company successfully executed a firm sales agreement beginning in June for a significant portion of its Delaware Basin oil production with the marketing division of a large international energy company. As a result of this five and a half year agreement, PDC has ensured firm physical takeaway for approximately 85 percent of its forecasted 2018 and 2019 Delaware Basin oil volumes. The agreement is expected to provide price diversification through realization of export market pricing and exposure to Brent-weighted prices from volumes sold at a Corpus Christi terminal. The Company expects to realize between 88 and 92 percent of NYMEX pricing on all its Delaware Basin 2018 and 2019 projected oil volumes. When combined with the Company’s existing 10,000 barrel per day agreement for in-field gathering with Oryx Midstream Services and planned investment of approximately $20 million in its own oil gathering system in 2018, PDC believes this agreement ensures its ability to successfully produce and deliver volumes in accordance with its current development plan.\nOil and Gas Production, Sales and Operating Cost Data\nCrude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales, excluding net settlements on derivatives, increased 61% to $305.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $189.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in sales was due to a 34% increase in total production and an increase in the sales price per Boe, excluding net settlements on derivatives, of 20% to $34.26 in the first quarter of 2018 from $28.53 in the comparable 2017 period. Including the impact of net settlements on derivatives, combined revenues increased 47 percent to $279.2 million from $190.2 million between periods.\nThe following table provides production and weighted-average sales price, by area, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, excluding net settlements on derivatives and TGP:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Percent Change Crude oil (MBbls) Wattenberg Field 2,881 2,142 34.5 % Delaware Basin 871 275 * Utica Shale 46 91 (49.5 )% Total 3,798 2,508 51.4 % Weighted-Average Sales Price $ 59.62 $ 49.04 21.6 % Natural gas (MMcf) Wattenberg Field 15,524 13,714 13.2 % Delaware Basin 3,649 1,246 * Utica Shale 414 624 (33.7 )% Total 19,587 15,584 25.7 % Weighted-Average Sales Price $ 1.97 $ 2.37 (16.9 )% NGLs (MBbls) Wattenberg Field 1,428 1,358 5.2 % Delaware Basin 383 131 * Utica Shale 35 54 (35.2 )% Total 1,846 1,543 19.6 % Weighted-Average Sales Price $ 21.80 $ 19.29 13.0 % Crude oil equivalent (MBoe) Wattenberg Field 6,896 5,786 19.2 % Delaware Basin 1,862 613 * Utica Shale 150 249 (39.8 )% Total 8,908 6,648 34.0 % Weighted-Average Sales Price $ 34.26 $ 28.53 20.1 % Production costs of 2018, which include lease operating expenses (“LOE”), production taxes and transportation, gathering and processing expenses (“TGP”), were $57.1 million, or $6.41 per Boe, compared to $38.1 million, or $5.74 per Boe, for the comparable 2017 period. Wattenberg LOE per Boe in the first quarter of 2018 was $3.02 compared to $2.66 in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in LOE per Boe between periods is primarily due to high line pressures, gathering line freezing issues and unexpected gathering system facility downtime as well as increased costs associated with air regulations. Delaware Basin LOE per Boe decreased between periods to $4.44 from $6.48, primarily as a result of increased production volumes. The Company expects total LOE per Boe for the year to be within its previously released guidance range.\nThe following table provides the components of production costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Lease operating expenses $ 29.6 $ 19.8 Production taxes 20.2 12.4 Transportation, gathering and processing expenses 7.3 5.9 Total $ 57.1 $ 38.1\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Lease operating expenses per Boe $ 3.33 $ 2.98 Production taxes per Boe 2.26 1.87 Transportation, gathering and processing expenses per Boe 0.82 0.89 Total per Boe $ 6.41 $ 5.74 Financial Results and Liquidity\nNet loss of 2018 was $13.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to net income of $46.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the comparable 2017 period. The year-over-year difference was primarily attributable to a $47.2 million loss on net commodity price risk management activity in 2018, as well as first quarter 2018 impairments totaling $33.2 million. Adjusted net income in the first quarter, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, was $3.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in 2018 compared to an adjusted net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share in 2017.\nNet cash from operating activities was $205.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $139.5 million in the comparable 2017 period. Adjusted cash flows from operations, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, were $174.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $113.7 million in the comparable 2017 period. The increase in cash flows in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily a result of increased sales.\n2018 Guidance\nThe following table provides projected 2018 financial guidance, which remains unchanged from previous disclosure:\nLow High Production (MMBoe) 38.0 42.0 Capital Expenditures (millions) $ 850 $ 920 Operating Expenses Lease operating expenses ($/Boe) $ 2.75 $ 3.00 Transportation, gathering & processing expenses ($/Boe) $ 0.60 $ 0.80 Production taxes (% of Crude oil, natural gas & NGLs sales) 6 % 8 % General and administrative expense ($/Boe) $ 3.40 $ 3.70 Estimated Price Realizations (% of NYMEX) (excludes TGP) Crude Oil\n91 % 95 % Natural Gas 55 % 60 % NGLs 30 % 35 % Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nPDC uses \"adjusted cash flows from operations,\" \"adjusted net income (loss)\" and \"adjusted EBITDAX,\" non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, for internal management reporting, when evaluating period-to-period changes and, in some cases, providing public guidance on possible future results. These measures are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) or cash flows from operations, investing or financing activities, and should not be viewed as liquidity measures or indicators of cash flows reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Also, in the future, PDC may disclose different non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in order to help investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare future results of operations to previously reported results of operations. PDC strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of adjusted cash flows from operations, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDAX to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures (in millions, except per share data):\nAdjusted Cash Flows from Operations Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Adjusted cash flows from operations: Net cash from operating activities $ 205.1 $ 139.5 Changes in assets and liabilities (30.2 ) (25.8 ) Adjusted cash flows from operations $ 174.9 $ 113.7\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Adjusted net income (loss): Net income (loss) $ (13.1 ) $ 46.1 (Gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments 47.2 (80.7 ) Net settlements on commodity derivative instruments (26.0 ) 0.5 Tax effect of above adjustments (5.1 ) 30.0 Adjusted net income (loss) $ 3.0 $ (4.1 ) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 66.0 66.1 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 0.05 $ (0.06 )\nAdjusted EBITDAX Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDAX: Net income (loss) $ (13.1 ) $ 46.1 (Gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments 47.2 (80.7 ) Net settlements on commodity derivative instruments (26.0 ) 0.5 Non-cash stock-based compensation 5.3 4.5 Interest expense, net 17.4 19.2 Income tax expense (benefit) (4.6 ) 26.3 Impairment of properties and equipment 33.2 2.2 Exploration, geologic, and geophysical expense 2.6 1.0 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 126.8 109.3 Accretion of asset retirement obligations 1.3 1.8 Adjusted EBITDAX $ 190.1 $ 130.2 Cash from operating activities to adjusted EBITDAX: Net cash from operating activities $ 205.1 $ 139.5 Interest expense, net 17.4 19.2 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs (3.2 ) (3.2 ) Gain (loss) on sale of properties and equipment (1.4 ) 0.2 Exploration, geologic, and geophysical expense 2.6 1.0 Other (0.2 ) (0.7 ) Changes in assets and liabilities (30.2 ) (25.8 ) Adjusted EBITDAX $ 190.1 $ 130.2\nPDC ENERGY, INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(unaudited, in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Revenues Crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales $ 305,225 $ 189,692 Commodity price risk management gain (loss), net (47,240 ) 80,704 Other income 2,615 3,311 Total revenues 260,600 273,707 Costs, expenses and other Lease operating expenses 29,636 19,789 Production taxes 20,169 12,399 Transportation, gathering, and processing expenses 7,313 5,902 Exploration, geologic, and geophysical expense 2,646 954 Impairment of properties and equipment 33,188 2,193 General and administrative expense 35,696 26,315 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 126,788 109,316 Accretion of asset retirement obligations 1,288 1,768 (Gain) loss on sale of properties and equipment 1,432 (160 ) Other expenses 2,768 3,528 Total costs, expenses and other 260,924 182,004 Income (loss) from operations (324 ) 91,703 Interest expense (17,529 ) (19,467 ) Interest income 148 240 Income (loss) before income taxes (17,705 ) 72,476 Income tax (expense) benefit 4,566 (26,330 ) Net income (loss) $ (13,139 ) $ 46,146 Earnings per share: Basic $ (0.20 ) $ 0.70 Diluted $ (0.20 ) $ 0.70 Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic 65,957 65,749 Diluted 65,957 66,117\nPDC ENERGY, INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(unaudited, in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 45,923 $ 180,675 Accounts receivable, net 181,025 197,598 Fair value of derivatives 28,610 14,338 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 8,897 8,613 Total current assets 264,455 401,224 Properties and equipment, net 4,231,257 3,933,467 Assets held-for-sale, net 1,647 40,084 Other assets 24,798 45,116 Total Assets $ 4,522,157 $ 4,419,891 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Liabilities Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 195,703 $ 150,067 Production tax liability 36,650 37,654 Fair value of derivatives 110,683 79,302 Funds held for distribution 97,611 95,811 Accrued interest payable 13,760 11,815 Other accrued expenses 33,777 42,987 Total current liabilities 488,184 417,636 Long-term debt 1,154,528 1,151,932 Deferred income taxes 187,183 191,992 Asset retirement obligations 73,905 71,006 Fair value of derivatives 26,426 22,343 Other liabilities 94,557 57,333 Total liabilities 2,024,783 1,912,242 Commitments and contingent liabilities Stockholders' equity Common shares -
