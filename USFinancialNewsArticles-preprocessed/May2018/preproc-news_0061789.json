    "text": "Fourth Quarter Total Revenue Increased 10.8%; Michael Kors Comparable Sales Grew 2.3%\nEarnings per Share were $0.29 Compared to Loss per Share of $0.17 Last Year\nExceeds Expectations for Revenue, Operating Margin and Earnings\nLONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Michael Kors Holdings Limited (NYSE:KORS) (the “Company”), a global fashion luxury group, today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. For the fourth quarter, earnings per diluted share were $0.29, a $0.46 increase compared to last year. On an adjusted basis, earnings per diluted share were $0.63 compared to $0.73 in the prior year.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nDelivered better than anticipated revenue, operating margin and earnings results Began investments in the Jimmy Choo brand to lay the foundation for accelerated long term growth Made significant progress on the Michael Kors Runway 2020 strategic plan Comparable sales increased 2.3%, driven by strong response to innovative and elevated fashion luxury offering across accessories, footwear, ready-to-wear and men’s categories Launched KORSVIP loyalty program, with enrollment well ahead of initial expectations Transitioned additional store locations to new luxury concept and are pleased with the recent results at renovated stores, which are outperforming the balance of the chain\nJohn D. Idol, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Fiscal 2018 was an exciting year for our Company as we established a foundation to support long term growth. We created a global fashion luxury group with the acquisition of Jimmy Choo and completed the first year of our Runway 2020 strategic plan for the Michael Kors brand, ending the year significantly ahead of our expectations.”\nMr. Idol continued, “Looking to fiscal 2019, we have a number of initiatives planned to drive growth in both of our luxury brands. For Michael Kors, we expect growth to be led by our retail business, as we remain focused on executing initiatives across fashion luxury product, brand engagement and customer experience. For Jimmy Choo, we will continue to make strategic investments to expand our retail fleet globally, capitalize on the significant opportunity to grow our accessories business and increase brand engagement through glamorous red-carpet marketing communications. Additionally, we will continue to explore acquisitions to complement our existing luxury portfolio. Overall, we are well-positioned to deliver long-term growth and enhance shareholder value by executing on the strategies in place for both Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.\"\nFinancial Results\nThe Company’s results are reported in this press release on both a GAAP and an adjusted, non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information is provided at the end of this press release.\nFor the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nTotal revenue increased 10.8% to $1.18 billion, including a $107.9 million contribution from Jimmy Choo. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 7.2%. MK Retail revenue increased 4.4% to $600.6 million. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the Company opened 50 stores, primarily in Asia, and closed 48 stores. Comparable sales increased 2.3%, driven by growth in the accessories, footwear, ready-to-wear and men's categories. On a constant currency basis, retail revenue increased 0.1%, and comparable sales decreased 1.7%. MK Wholesale revenue decreased 3.2% to $441.3 million and on a constant currency basis decreased 6.1%, driven by the Company's strategic reduction in inventory levels in the channel to drive higher full price sell through and elevate brand positioning. MK Licensing revenue decreased 11.1% to $29.7 million. Gross profit increased 14.5% to $709.8 million and as a percentage of total revenue was 60.2%. Adjusted gross profit increased 14.9% to $712.3 million, and as a percentage of total revenue was 60.4%. This compares to 58.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This increase was the result of favorable channel mix due to a higher proportion of retail sales, expanded MK Retail and MK Wholesale gross margins, and the inclusion of Jimmy Choo, which contributed 80 basis points to the increase. Income from operations was $87.1 million, or 7.4% as a percentage of total revenue. Loss from operations was $42.6 million, or (4.0)% as a percentage of total revenue, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted income from operations increased 2.0% to $154.2 million, or 13.1% as a percentage of total revenue. This compares to $151.2 million, or 14.2% as a percentage of total revenue, for the same period in fiscal 2017. These results reflect higher income from operations for the Michael Kors brand, partially offset by accelerated investments related to Jimmy Choo in marketing, ecommerce and store openings during a seasonally low revenue period. Net income attributable to MKHL was $44.1 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, based on 154.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Net loss attributable to MKHL for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $26.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, based on 161.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to MKHL was $96.5 million, or $0.63 per diluted share. This compares to $118.0 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. At March 31, 2018, Michael Kors operated 829 retail stores, including concessions, and an additional 151 retail stores, including concessions, were operated through licensing partners. Including licensed locations, there were 980 Michael Kors stores worldwide at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. At March 31, 2018, Jimmy Choo operated 182 retail stores, including concessions, and an additional 61 retail stores, including concessions, were operated through licensing partners. Including licensed locations, there were 243 Jimmy Choo stores worldwide at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018:\nTotal revenue increased 5.0% to $4.72 billion from $4.49 billion, including a $222.6 million contribution from Jimmy Choo. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 3.6%. MK Retail revenue increased 5.4% to $2.71 billion. Comparable sales decreased 2.2%. On a constant currency basis, retail revenue increased 3.9%, and comparable sales decreased 3.7% MK Wholesale revenue decreased 7.7% to $1.64 billion and on a constant currency basis decreased 9.1%, driven by the Company's strategic reduction in inventory levels to drive higher full price sell through and elevate brand positioning. MK Licensing revenue decreased 0.6% to $144.9 million. Gross profit increased 7.4% to $2.86 billion, and as a percentage of total revenue was 60.6%, or 60.7% on an adjusted basis. This compares to 59.2% in the same period of fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to improved MK Retail gross margin and a 20 basis points contribution from the inclusion of Jimmy Choo, partially offset by the expected decline in the MK Wholesale gross margin. Income from operations was $749.1 million and as a percentage of total revenue was 15.9%. Income from operations was $689.9 million, or 15.4% as a percentage of total revenue, for the full fiscal year 2017. Adjusted income from operations was $888.0 million, or 18.8% as a percentage of total revenue. This compares to $900.4 million, or 20.0% as a percentage of total revenue, for the same period in fiscal 2017. Net income attributable to MKHL was $591.9 million, or $3.82 per diluted share, based on 155.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Net income attributable to MKHL for the full year fiscal 2017 was $552.5 million, or $3.29 per diluted share, based on 168.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to MKHL was $701.0 million, or $4.52 per diluted share. This compares to $712.1 million, or $4.24 per diluted share, for the same period of fiscal 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, debt on the balance sheet totaled $874.4 million after repaying $320.2 million of debt in the fourth quarter. Currently, the Company has approximately $804.7 available for future borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. Inventory at March 31, 2018, was $660.7 million, including $128.3 million for Jimmy Choo and $532.4 for Michael Kors. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $549.3 million. Inventory for Michael Kors was down 3.1% as compared to the prior year.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 3,157,459 of the Company's ordinary shares for approximately $200.0 million in open market transactions.

Share repurchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, trading restrictions under the Company’s insider trading policy, and other relevant factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nOutlook\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company expects total revenue to be approximately $1.135 billion, including between $140 million and $145 million of incremental Jimmy Choo revenue. Comparable sales for Michael Kors are expected to be approximately flat. The Company expects operating margin to be approximately 15.2%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.95, including anticipated benefit from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.01 to $0.03. This assumes approximately 153 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding and a tax rate of approximately 14.0%.\nFor fiscal 2019, the Company expects total revenue to be approximately $5.10 billion, including between $570 million and $580 million of incremental Jimmy Choo revenue. Comparable sales for Michael Kors are expected to be approximately flat. The Company expects operating margin to be approximately 17.7%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.75, including dilution from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.05 to $0.10.

Because we are a global Company, foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant effect on our reported results. We calculate constant currency measures and the related foreign currency impacts by translating the current-year’s reported amounts into comparable amounts using prior year’s foreign exchange rates for each currency. All constant currency performance measures discussed below should be considered a supplement to and not in lieu of our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAdditionally, this earnings release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures relating to certain one-time costs associated with the Jimmy Choo acquisition, the acquisition of the Greater China licensee and restructuring and non-cash impairment charges primarily associated with underperforming retail stores. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, among other things, to evaluate its operating performance and in order to represent the manner in which the Company conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding non-recurring items helps its management and investors compare operating performance based on its ongoing operations. While the Company considers the non-GAAP measures to be useful supplemental measures in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, nor act as a substitute for, any amounts presented in its consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies.\nAbout Michael Kors Holdings Limited\nMichael Kors Holdings Limited is a global fashion luxury group, consisting of iconic brands that are industry leaders in design, style and craftsmanship.
