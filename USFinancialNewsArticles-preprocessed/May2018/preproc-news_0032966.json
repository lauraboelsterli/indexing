    "text": "2 COMMENTS Oil prices were mixed Tuesday, with the U.S. benchmark pulling back after hitting multiyear highs, even as turmoil in the Middle East continued to boost the global benchmark.\nU.S. crude futures recently fell 4 cents to $70.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 44 cents, or 0.56%, to $78.67 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.\nThe U.S. dollar surged Tuesday, weighing on oil prices. Oil and the dollar often move in opposite directions, since a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for buyers using foreign currencies, reducing demand.\nEquity markets were also weaker Tuesday amid mixed data from key global economies and ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.\nOil prices have run up rapidly amid turmoil in the Middle East and the prospect of trade sanctions against Iran, and some investors have been looking for opportunities to take profits. U.S. crude futures approached $72 a barrel in earlier trading Tuesday.\n“We’re very overextended,” said Donald Morton, senior vice president at Herbert J. Sims & Co.\nAt the same time, rising output in the U.S. is looming, which has weighed on U.S. oil prices more than prices abroad. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Monday that production from key shale producing regions is on track to jump by 144,000 barrels a day next month.\nA Statoil platform near the Stavanger, Norway. Turmoil in the Middle East and U.S. trade sanctions against major oil producer Iran have also supported crude. Photo: nerijus adomaitis/Reuters Newsletter Sign-up “The crude complex has seen prices stall a bit near recent highs as the market weighs whether a rising tide of geopolitical risk and strong demand is enough to continue overshadowing U.S. production growth to force prices steadily higher,” analysts at Schneider Electric said.\nStill, more oil from the U.S. may be needed to fill the gap from the potential loss of Iranian crude exports when renewed sanctions take effect. Analysts project that oil exports from Iran could be reduced by about 0.5 million barrels a day as South Korea and Japan trim their imports, said analysts for J.P. Morgan in a recent report.\nAnd the oil market has already tightened following more than a year of restraint by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, global economic growth that boosted demand, and rapidly declining output from Venezuela.\nThat means oil’s declines may be limited.\n“The downside will be difficult to sustain because I suspect there are still a lot of buyers that may swoop in on a dip,” said Ric Navy, senior vice president for energy futures at R.J. O’Brien.\nOPEC reduced its forecast for global oil production in its most recent report Monday, which investors interpreted as a sign of the group’s continued commitment to rebalancing the market, especially from its de facto leader Saudi Arabia.\n“The Saudi’s are signaling that they would be relaxed with the scenario in which they temporarily over tighten the market,” said Paul Horsnell, the head of commodity research at Standard Chartered . “Coupled with no signs of new supply coming on, demand remaining strong as well as the geopolitical turmoil in Iran and you have the conditions for this push up towards $80” a barrel.\nGasoline futures rose 0.28% to $2.2064 a gallon. Diesel futures rose 0.19% to $2.2538 a gallon.\nWrite to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com and Neanda Salvaterra at neanda.salvaterra@wsj.com",
