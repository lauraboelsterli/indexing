Coffins containing the remains of the bodies of Egyptian Copts killed by Islamic State militants in Sirte are loaded to the plane to be transferred to Egypt, in Misrata, Libya May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Ismail Zitouny\nThe victims had been among the many poor Egyptians who risked their lives to find work in the lawless chaos of Libya following the downfall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and civil war.\nThe Coptic Christians were beheaded on a beach in Islamic State’s former Libyan stronghold of Sirte, wearing orange jumpsuits, according to a video posted by Islamic State.\nTheir bodies were recovered in October after the area where they were buried was recaptured from the militant Islamist group. Slideshow (3 Images)\nIslamic State took control of Sirte in 2015 and lost the city late last year to local forces backed by U.S. air strikes.\nA total of 21 people were beheaded in the incident. The body of a Ghanaian killed was not on board the plane that brought the Egyptian bodies from Misrata in western Libya to Cairo.\nThe head of the Coptic Church in Egypt, Pope Tawadros II, was at the airport to receive the remains, brought in coffins aboard an aircraft from Misrata, a local television station, which broadcast live from the airport, said.\nThe bodies are expected to be taken back for burial in Egypt’s Minya province.
