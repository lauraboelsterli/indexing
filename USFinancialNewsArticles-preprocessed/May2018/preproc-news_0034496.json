    "text": "CALABASAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Unico American Corporation (NASDAQ – “UNAM”) (“Unico,” the “Company”) announced today its consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, revenues were $8.8 million and net loss was $2.2 million ($0.42 diluted loss per share) compared with revenues of $9.0 million and net loss of $2.1 million ($0.40 diluted loss per share) for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nStockholders’ equity was $56.8 million as of March 31, 2018, or $10.71 per common share including unrealized after-tax investment losses of $1.1 million, compared to stockholders’ equity of $59.9 million as of December 31, 2017, or $11.30 per common share including unrealized after-tax investment losses of $0.2 million.\n“We continued to improve our foundation for future success during the first quarter of 2018,” said Cary L. Cheldin, Unico’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “While our losses for the quarter were unacceptably high, our investment yields improved and we took steps to contain our costs by reducing our workforce and implementing a rate increase and underwriting restrictions.”\nAbout Unico\nHeadquartered in Calabasas, California, Unico is an insurance holding company that underwrites property and casualty insurance through its insurance company subsidiary; provides property, casualty and health insurance through its agency subsidiaries; and through its other subsidiaries provides insurance premium financing and membership association services.

In this context, forward-looking statements are not historical facts and include statements about the Company plans, objectives, beliefs and expectations.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions involving judgments about, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the Company’s control. These predictions are also affected by known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company’s actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, failure to meet minimum capital and surplus requirements; vulnerability to significant catastrophic property loss; a change in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board; ability to adjust claims accurately; insufficiency of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves to cover future losses; changes in federal or state tax laws; ability to realize deferred tax assets; ability to accurately underwrite risks and charge adequate premium; ability to obtain reinsurance or collect from reinsurers and or losses in excess of reinsurance limits; extensive regulation and legislative changes; reliance on subsidiaries to satisfy obligations; downgrade in financial strength rating by A.M. Best; changes in interest rates; investments subject to credit, prepayment and other risks; geographic concentration; reliance on independent insurance agents and brokers; insufficient reserve for doubtful accounts; litigation; enforceability of exclusions and limitations in policies; reliance on information technology systems; ability to prevent or detect acts of fraud with disclosure controls and procedures; change in general economic conditions; dependence on key personnel; ability to attract, develop and retain employees and maintain appropriate staffing levels; insolvency, financial difficulties, or default in performance of obligations by parties with significant contracts or relationships; ability to effectively compete; maximization of long-term value and no focus on short-term earnings expectations; control by a small number of shareholders; failure to maintain effective system of internal controls; and difficulty in effecting a change of control or sale of any subsidiaries.\nPlease see Part I - Item 1A – “Risk Factors” in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as well as other documents the Company files with the SEC from time-to-time, for other important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from its current expectations and from the forward-looking statements discussed herein. Because of these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
