Cynthia (Cindy) Collins, is a recognized leader in diagnostics, life sciences, and therapeutics. Prior to her most recent position as CEO of Human Longevity Inc., she served as the CEO/GM of General Electric’s Healthcare Cell Therapy Business, Lab Businesses and Clarient Diagnostics. Prior to GE, Ms. Collins served as President and CEO of GenVec, a publicly-traded therapeutics company and before that, she served as Group Vice President, Cellular Analysis Business of Beckman Coulter with responsibility for its Hematology, Flow Cytometry, and Hemostasis businesses. Prior to Beckman Coulter, she served as President and CEO of Sequoia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a venture-capital funded company developing antiviral drugs for HIV and HCV. Earlier, Ms. Collins served as President of Clinical Micro Sensors, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola, where she directed the development and commercialization of molecular diagnostic products. Ms. Collins received her BS degree in Microbiology from the University of Illinois, Urbana and her MBA, from The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n“Cindy will add significant operational and commercial expertise to DermTech as we expand and scale our sales and marketing effort around the PLA test for melanoma skin cancer, and work to launch our Carcinome test for basal and squamous cell skin cancer in the fourth quarter of this year,” said John Dobak, DermTech’s CEO.\n“I am pleased to be part of DermTech's efforts in bringing valuable new molecular tests to the market that more effectively detect early melanoma and other dermatologic conditions, avoid unnecessary biopsies, and provide better patient outcomes,” said Collins.\nAbout DermTech\nDermTech is the global leader in molecular dermatology, bringing precision medicine to the diagnosis and treatment of skin disease. We market and develop products that facilitate the early detection of skin cancers, assess inflammatory diseases, and customize drug treatments. DermTech analyzes skin biopsy samples collected non-invasively using an adhesive patch rather than a scalpel. Our mission is to transform dermatology by delivering highly accurate and objective information to the clinician to improve care and reduce costs and to pharma partners to support the development of targeted therapeutics.
