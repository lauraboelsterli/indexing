    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Italy’s 10-year government bond yields currently do not adequately compensate investors for country risk, a senior official at the world’s biggest bond investor said on Wednesday.\nPIMCO chief investment officer for fixed income Andrew Balls said that while the risk that Italy leaves the euro zone is low, the current yield on government bonds does not match the risk.\n“At the moment the easy thing to say is that the compensation you get for risk is not very high,” Balls told reporters at a briefing in London.\n“There is a high probability Italy remains in the euro zone, and there is a low risk of actual default, you need to make sure you have the required compensation. It’s not obvious to me that at 3 percent (yield) that is there.”\nPIMCO is underweight Italy, Balls said.\nItaly’s 10-year yield was trading at 2.95 percent on Wednesday IT10YT=RR.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
