    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 7:46 AM / Updated an hour ago O'Donovan gets 10-match ban for A-League final kung fu kick Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Irish striker Roy Oâ€™Donovan was handed a 10-match ban on Friday for kicking the opposing goalkeeper in the head during stoppage time in the A-League final in Newcastle earlier this month.\nThe Newcastle Jets forward received a straight red card for his desperate lunge at the head of Melbourne Victory goalkeeper Lawrence Thomas as he sought an equaliser in the Australian championship match.\nVictory held on to claim the title for a record fourth time courtesy of a goal from Kosta Barbarouses in the ninth minute, with Thomas named Man of the Match for a string of fine saves.\nThe A-League later admitted that a TV feed had broken down when the only goal was scored, leaving the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) unable to rule on what looked like a clear offside in the run-up.
