    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D., May 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Raven Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAVN) today reported financial results for the first quarter that ended April 30, 2018.\nNoteworthy Items:\nConsolidated net sales increased 19 percent year-over-year and all three divisions increased division profit margin year-over-year; Launched Applied Technology's new Latin American headquarters in Brazil, aggressively pursuing organic growth opportunities in this key region; Applied Technology sustained the strong sales performance achieved in the prior year despite persistently low commodity prices and increased division profit margin; Engineered Films' strong financial performance continued with organic growth and profit margin expansion; Aerostar doubled division operating income year-over-year, from $1.4 million to $2.8 benefiting from a narrowed focus and generating higher sales; Recognized a $5.8 million non-operating gain on the sale of the Company's ownership interest in Site-Specific Technology Development Group, Inc. (SST); Commitment to support South Dakota State University with a financial gift for the expansion of its precision agriculture program and the establishment of a new precision agriculture facility resulted in a $4.5 million operating expense during the first quarter.\nFirst Quarter Results:\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $111.1 million, up 18.8 percent versus the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Engineered Films and Aerostar achieved double-digit growth in sales year-over-year during the first quarter, and Applied Technology sustained the strong growth achieved in the prior year. Delivery of hurricane recovery film contributed sales of $8.9 million during this year's first quarter.\nOperating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $21.5 million versus operating income of $18.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, increasing 18.2 percent year-over-year on a reported basis. All three divisions achieved growth year-over-year in operating income during the first quarter. Included in this year's first quarter operating income was an expense of $4.5 million related to the previously announced gift to South Dakota State University and $900 thousand of expenses related to Project Atlas. Excluding these items, operating income increased significantly more than reported results year-over-year.\nNet income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $22.1 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, versus net income of $12.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in last year's first quarter. Included in this year's first quarter results on a pre-tax basis were: a non-operating gain on the sale of the Company's ownership interest in SST of $5.8 million ($4.7 million after-tax, or $0.13 per diluted share); an expense associated with the previously announced gift to South Dakota State University of $4.5 million ($3.7 million after-tax, or $0.10 per diluted share); and Project Atlas related expenses of $0.9 million ($0.7 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share). Additionally, the 12.8 percentage point reduction in the Company's effective tax rate year-over-year resulted in a tax benefit relative to the prior year of $3.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow:\nAt the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, cash and cash equivalents totaled $51.3 million, up $10.8 million versus the prior year-end. Cash proceeds from the sale of SST and continued strength in operating cash flows principally drove the increase in cash versus the prior quarter.\nNet working capital 1 as a percentage of annualized net sales increased slightly year-over-year, from 23.4 percent in the first quarter of last year to 24.1 percent in this year’s first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in receivables within Engineered Films as a result of the acquisition of Colorado Lining International, Inc. (CLI).\nWe expect cash outflows for capital expenditures to be approximately $22 million in fiscal 2019. The increase over fiscal 2018 will primarily be driven by the installation of a new extrusion line for Engineered Films (Line 15).\nApplied Technology Division:\nNet sales for Applied Technology in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $40.4 million, essentially flat versus the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The division sustained the strong growth achieved in the prior year despite persistently low commodity prices. Geographically, domestic sales were down 2.4 percent year-over-year, while international sales were up 6.6 percent year-over-year.\nDivision operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $15.9 million, up $2.5 million or 18.5 percent versus the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Division operating margin increased 620 basis points year-over-year, driven mostly by lower warranty expense and favorable legal recoveries.\nEngineered Films Division:\nNet sales for Engineered Films were $60.0 million, up 37.7 percent year-over-year. The increase in net sales was driven by organic growth, the sale of hurricane recovery film and the acquisition of CLI. The delivery of Hurricane recovery film and the acquisition of CLI contributed sales in this year's first quarter of $8.9 million and $7.7 million, respectively. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the division generated $2.3 million in sales to CLI.\nOperating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $13.2 million, up $4.5 million or 51.3 percent versus the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Division operating margin increased 200 basis points year-over-year, from 20.0 percent to 22.0 percent, driven by strong operational execution and higher sales volume.\nAerostar Division:\nNet sales for Aerostar during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $10.9 million, up $1.3 million or 13.5 percent versus the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This increase in net sales was driven by improved sales volume across core product lines. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the division sold its client private business in alignment with its strategy to focus on its core business. Aerostar's client private business generated sales of $0.3 million and $1.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDivision operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $2.8 million, up $1.4 million versus the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales volume and favorable sales mix. The sale of the client private business generated a small gain on sale during the first quarter of fiscal 2019; however, the change in division profit year-over-year was not significantly impacted by the client private business.\nFiscal 2019 Outlook:\n“All three divisions continued to achieve strong operating results during the first quarter of fiscal 2019,” said Dan Rykhus, President and CEO. “Investments in growth are leading to increased demand, and operational execution is resulting in higher sales volume and improved financial performance.\n“Applied Technology continues to drive results through innovation and investments to grow internationally. During the quarter, the division established its new Latin American headquarters in Brazil to drive sales in this key geographic market.\n“Engineered Films continued to achieve expected sales growth and profitability. The division is leveraging past investments to capitalize on strategic opportunities and is investing in additional capabilities to capture increased demand from existing customers. The underlying fundamentals remain strong and the division's operational execution is delivering impressive financial results.\n“Aerostar's financial performance progressed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Confidence is strong within the division and Aerostar further sharpened its focus as evidenced by the divestiture of its client private business during the quarter. Stratospheric balloon systems continue to build positive momentum and achieve key milestones.\n“The Company is off to a strong start to the year. Underlying organic growth in consolidated net sales and operating income were approximately 5 percent and 20 percent, respectively, when excluding unusual items. Each of the divisions is well positioned in its markets and we expect our positive momentum to continue,\" concluded Rykhus.\nRegulation G:\nThe information presented in this earnings release regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.
