ANZ and Commonwealth Bank rose 0.4 percent and 0.2 percent.\nTelstra extended losses and finished the session near seven-year lows, down 5.6 percent.\nThe company issued a profit warning on Monday and said it expect conditions to remain challenging in 2019 with increased competition stemming from the National Broadband Network roll-out.\nMiners BHP and Rio Tinto reversed course during the day and ended lower, in line with the downturn in copper, aluminium and oil prices.\nAutomotive Holdings Group was the worst performer on the index, down 8.8 percent to its lowest since June last year.\nThe company said below-expected margin gains in the second half from its franchised dealerships and used car businesses will hit profits.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index closed marginally lower by 4.45 points to 8,708.78, snapping nine straight days of gains after hitting all-time highs in multiple sessions.\nDairy company A2 Milk and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare were the biggest drags, down over 1.5 percent each.
