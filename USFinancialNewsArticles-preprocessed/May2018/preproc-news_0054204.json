FILE PHOTO: South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa speaks after his meeting with Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May in Downing Street, London, April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\nThe decision is the latest by Ramaphosa to tackle alleged corruption and misgoverance in the administration of his predecessor Jacob Zuma, who was forced from office in February by the ruling African National Congress.\nThe presidency said in a statement that the proclamations authorise investigations of “allegations of serious irregularities in relation to procurement of goods” and “improper or unlawful conduct by employees or officials.”\nThe targeted institutions include The National Department of Public Works and several departments and municipalities in the provincial Eastern Cape government.\nThe probes will be conducted by the Special Investigation Unit, which has a broad remit to look into “serious malpractices or maladministration in the administration of the state.” Reporting by Ed Stoddard; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",
