    "text": "Getty Images Exterior view of Cambridge Analytica’s offices in London.\nCambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, is shutting down following the disclosure of its misuse of Facebook data.\nIn March, the company suspended its chief executive , Alexander Nix, and said it was launching an independent investigation to determine if the company engaged in any wrongdoing in its work on political campaigns.\nNigel Oakes, the founder of SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica’s British affiliate, confirmed that both companies were closing down.\nThe company decided to close its doors because it was losing clients and facing mounting legal fees in the Facebook FB, +2.29% investigation, a person familiar with the matter said. The firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers.",
