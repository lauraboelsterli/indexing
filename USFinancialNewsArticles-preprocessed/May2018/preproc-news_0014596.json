    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- LandFund Partners, a farmland investment and management firm, has announced the successful purchase of the first property in its fourth fund. Fund IV, a value-add strategic fund, accepted over $12 million of investor commitments in its first closing.\n\"We are very pleased with the first property in Fund IV. It is a property with tremendous upside potential. We will now execute our plan to improve the irrigation infrastructure and value of the first property,\" said John Farris, Founder & President.\nFund IV builds on the firm's regional presence in the lower Mississippi River Valley, and will remain open to investors until hitting its $30 million equity raise hard cap.\nChris Morris, Managing Director, added, \"Investor demand for Fund IV has exceeded our expectations â€“ we have raised over one-third of our total target in less than 60 days.
