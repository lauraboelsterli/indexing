    "text": "ALLENTOWN, Pa., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) announced today the pricing of a registered underwritten offering of 55 million shares of its common stock at a price per share of $27.00 in connection with the forward sale agreements described below. J.P. Morgan, Barclays and Citigroup are acting as joint book-running managers for this offering.\nIn connection with the offering, PPL entered into forward sale agreements with affiliates of each of J.P. Morgan and Barclays (the \"forward counterparties\") under which PPL agreed to issue and sell to the forward counterparties 55 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward sale price per share equal to the price per share at which the underwriters agreed to purchase the shares in the offering, subject to certain adjustments, upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements. The underwriters of the offering have been granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 8.25 million shares of PPL's common stock upon the same terms, solely to cover any over-allotments. The offering is expected to close on May 11, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, PPL expects to enter into additional forward sale agreements with the forward counterparties with respect to the additional shares.\nSettlement of the forward sale agreements is expected to occur on or prior to November 8, 2019. PPL may, subject to certain conditions, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of its rights or obligations under the forward sale agreements.\nIf PPL elects physical settlement of the forward sale agreements, it expects to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nThe offering is being made pursuant to PPL's effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus related to the offering will be available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . Copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained from the joint-book running managers for the offering as follows:\nJ.P.
