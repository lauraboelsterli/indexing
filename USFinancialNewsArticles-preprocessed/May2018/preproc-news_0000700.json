    "text": "CARDIFF, Wales (Reuters) - Qatar Airways would back partially-owned IAG ( ICAG.L ) if the British Airways-owner decides to proceed with a takeover of Norwegian Air Shuttle ( NWC.OL ), Qatar’s CEO said, while declining to give further details of his plans to set up a new airline.\nA Qatar Airways Airbus A350-1000 is pictured at the Eurasia Airshow in the Mediterranean resort city of Antalya, Turkey April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Murad Sezer Qatar Airways is IAG’s biggest shareholder with a 21 percent stake, theoretically giving it some sway over IAG’s strategy, which could involve the acquisition of Norwegian.\nAs for Qatar Airway’s own strategy, Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker was tight-lipped over plans revealed in April to set up a new airline, other than to repeat that he was interested in establishing an Indian domestic carrier.\nWhen asked if he was interested in setting up a new airline in a country other than India he replied: “Maybe”, declining to give further details or say whether it would be a low-cost airline.\nRelated Coverage Qatar Airways CEO says 777X behind schedule but sees Boeing catching up IAG, which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, bought a 4.6 percent stake in low-cost player Norwegian in April, with a view to starting takeover discussions in a deal which would give it a leading position in the budget long-haul trans-Atlantic market. “Qatar Airways will always support IAG in anything they do,” Baker told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday.\n“Whatever they do to expand their business it has been thought after well and we will support them.”\nNorwegian has said a number of groups have approached it since IAG took its stake.\nBut Qatar, which also owns stakes in Cathay Pacific and Italy’s Meridiana, said it has no plans to take a stake in Norwegian.\n“We leave that relationship to IAG,” Baker told Reuters.\nThe CEO was speaking in Cardiff, where Qatar Airways was launching a new route between the Welsh capital and Doha, which from June will be a daily service.\nBaker said that Qatar Airways wanted to keep expanding in Britain. It already flies to four UK destinations, and in May will add London Gatwick as a fifth, and would like to launch a new route between Doha and Belfast, Northern Ireland, in future.\nReporting by Sarah Young, Editing by Paul Sandle and Adrian Croft\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
