    "text": "Hanley Ramirez hit a two-run homer, David Price pitched into the sixth inning and the visiting Boston Red Sox defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 5-2 on Saturday.\nPrice (3-4) allowed two runs, five hits and three walks and struck out six in 5 1/3 innings for his first win since April 17, a span of three winless starts.\nPrice had missed his scheduled start on Wednesday with a mild case of carpal tunnel syndrome.\nCraig Kimbrel pitched a perfect ninth for his 11th save of the season.\nToronto’s Marco Estrada (2-3) allowed four runs, seven hits and one walk while striking out five in six innings in his fourth straight start without a win.\nJustin Smoak homered for the Blue Jays, who won the opener of the three-game series in 12 innings Friday.\nThe Red Sox led 3-0 in the third on doubles by Mookie Betts, his first of three hits, and Andrew Benintendi, who also had three hits, and the sixth homer of the season by Ramirez.\nThe Blue Jays scored once in the fourth. Smoak and Russell Martin walked, and Anthony Alford stroked an RBI single.\nEstrada retired nine batters in a row before Xander Bogaerts doubled with one out in the sixth and scored on a single by Rafael Devers.\nSmoak led off the sixth with his fifth home run of the season.\nAfter Kevin Pillar fouled out, Price was replaced by Carson Smith.\nToronto’s Jake Petricka allowed singles to Christian Vazquez and Betts in the seventh and was replaced by Aaron Loup. Vazquez was out at third on an attempted double steal with Betts reaching second. Loup struck out Benintendi and was replaced by Seunghwan Oh, who finished the inning and pitched a scoreless eighth.\nBoston’s Hector Velazquez pitched around a single in the seventh, and Joe Kelly survived a single and had three strikeouts in the eighth.\nBetts doubled and Benintendi had an RBI single in the ninth against Ryan Tepera.\nBefore the game, the Blue Jays added infielder Gio Urshela to the 25-man roster. Obtained for cash or a player to be named from the Cleveland Indians on Wednesday, he started at shortstop and singled in his first at-bat and finished 1-for-2. Outfielder Dalton Pompey was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
