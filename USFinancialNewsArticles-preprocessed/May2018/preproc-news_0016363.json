    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. (NYSE American: NES) (\"Nuverra,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nFirst quarter revenue was $49.7 million, an increase of approximately 26.6%, or $10.5 million, when compared with revenue of $39.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss for the first quarter was $32.2 million, an improvement of $3.8 million, or approximately 10.6%, when compared with a net loss of $36.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss, adjusted for special items, for the first quarter was $13.6 million, compared with $27.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $2.4 million, an increase of $3.1 million compared with $(0.8) million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 670 basis points from the first quarter of 2017. Total liquidity as of March 31, 2018 was $16.1 million\n\"Despite the effects of difficult winter weather in the first quarter in our main operating regions, Nuverra posted increased revenue and EBITDA when compared to the same period last year,\" said Charlie Thompson, Interim Chief Executive Officer.\n\"We have been extremely focused, and will continue to be, on improving operating margins and utilizing our assets efficiently. Our recent announcement regarding the closure of our Eagle Ford operations and other equipment sales supports this strategy. We believe that actions like these will allow us to generate better returns, grow our business, serve our customers and make Nuverra a desirable place for our employees.\"\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS\nFirst quarter revenue was $49.7 million, an increase of $10.5 million, or 26.6%, from $39.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Of this 26.6% increase, approximately 8.0% is attributable to pricing increases, while 18.6% is a result of increases in activities.\nAs a result of increased activity, reliance on higher cost contract drivers and costs related to severe winter weather in our Northeast division, total costs and expenses, adjusted for special items, were $62.1 million, a 17.1% increase compared with $53.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Primarily as a result of price increases, gross profit adjusted for special items improved 62.5% to $8.1 million and gross margin improved 360 basis points to 16.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018.\nNet loss for the first quarter was $32.2 million, an improvement of $3.8 million when compared with a net loss of $36.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported a net loss, adjusted for special items, of $13.6 million. Special items in the first quarter primarily included severance costs related to the departure of our former CEO and $4.1 million in long-lived asset impairment charges for assets held for sale primarily in the Southern division. This compares with a net loss, adjusted for special items, of $27.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $2.4 million, an increase of $3.1 million compared with $(0.8) million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.7%, compared with (2.0)% in the first quarter of 2017.\nCASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY\nNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $7.3 million, while asset sales net of capital expenditures provided proceeds of $8.5 million. Free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less net cash capital expenditures totaled $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $(7.9) million in the first quarter of 2017. Asset sales were related to unused or underutilized assets, the proceeds of which are expected to be reinvested in returns-driven growth projects in 2018. We expect additional asset sales in 2018, particularly in the second quarter, related to the closure of our operations in the Eagle Ford Basin.\nTotal liquidity as of March 31, 2018, consisting of cash and available borrowings, was $16.1 million. Not included in the $16.1 million of liquidity, was an additional $7.1 million of borrowings available under our revolving facility that could be spent only on capital expenditures. As of March 31, 2018, total debt outstanding was $37.9 million, consisting of $13.7 million under our senior secured term loan facility, $20.9 million under our second lien term loan facility, and $3.3 million of capital leases for vehicle financings.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nAs previously disclosed, the Company emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 7, 2017, or the \"Effective Date,\" and elected to apply fresh start accounting as of July 31, 2017 to coincide with the timing of the normal accounting period close. References to \"Successor\" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to July 31, 2017, while references to \"Predecessor\" refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company on and prior to July 31, 2017. The Successor and Predecessor GAAP results for the applicable periods are presented in the tables following this release. As a result of various adjustments to the condensed consolidated financial statements in connection with the application of fresh start accounting, the results of operations for the Successor period are not comparable to those of the Predecessor period.\nAbout Nuverra\nNuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. is among the largest companies in the United States dedicated to providing comprehensive, full-cycle environmental solutions to customers in the energy market.

the availability of less favorable credit and payment terms due to the downturn in our industry, our financial condition, and the chapter 11 proceeding, including more stringent or costly payment terms from our vendors, which may constrain our liquidity and reduce availability under our revolving credit facility; risks associated with our ability to collect outstanding receivables as a result of liquidity constraints on our customers resulting from low oil and/or natural gas prices; difficulties in identifying and completing acquisitions and divestitures, and differences in the type and availability of consideration or financing for such acquisitions and divestitures;

changes in customer drilling, completion and production activities, operating methods and capital expenditure plans, including impacts due to low oil and/or natural gas prices or the economic or regulatory environment;

the effects of competition in the markets in which we operate, including the adverse impact of competitive product announcements or new entrants into our markets and transfers of resources by competitors into our markets; changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or in the world generally, including as a result of political uncertainty; reduced demand for our services due to regulatory or other influences related to extraction methods such as hydraulic fracturing, shifts in production among shale areas in which we operate or into shale areas in which we do not currently have operations; the impact of changes in laws and regulation on waste management and disposal activities, including those impacting the delivery, storage, collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste products, as well as the use or reuse of recycled or treated products or byproducts; natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, or acts of terrorism, or extreme weather conditions, that may impact our business locations, assets, including wells or pipelines, distribution channels, or which otherwise disrupt our or our customers' operations or the markets we serve;

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of operations or balance sheets of the Company; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the attached financial tables.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided because management of the Company uses these financial measures in maintaining and evaluating the Company's ongoing financial results and trends. Management uses this non-GAAP information as an indicator of business results, and evaluates overall performance with respect to such indicators. Management believes that excluding items such as acquisition expenses, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, restructuring charges, expenses related to litigation and resolution of lawsuits, and other charges, which may or may not be non-recurring, among other items that are inconsistent in amount and frequency (as with acquisition expenses), or determined pursuant to complex formulas that incorporate factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control (as with stock-based compensation), for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of the Company's current operating performance and comparisons to the past and future operating performance. The Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per share, in addition to related GAAP financial measures, provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by the Company's management. These non-GAAP financial measures are not substitutes for measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not necessarily be indicative of the Company's liquidity or ability to fund cash needs. Not all companies calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner, and our presentation may not be comparable to the presentations of other companies.\nNUVERRA ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS, INC.
