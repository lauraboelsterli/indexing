    "text": "* Speculative 2-year T-note net shorts lowest in nearly a year * Speculators' net shorts in ultra bonds hit record high * Speculative Eurodollar net shorts post biggest drop in 11 months (Adds details, background) May 18 (Reuters) - Speculators' net bearish bets on U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures fell to a one-month low earlier this week, as the 10-year yield began setting a series of seven-year highs, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 381,922 contracts on May 15, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. A week earlier, speculators held 408,629 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures. On Tuesday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes broke above 3.05 percent, which was last seen in July 2011, as traders sold longer-dated government debt on concerns about rising inflation and government debt. The 10-year yield climbed to 3.128 percent early Friday before slipping to 3.063 percent, 9 basis points higher on the week, Reuters data showed. Speculators raised their net bullish positions in Treasury bond futures to 11,854 contracts, while they increased net short bets in ultra bond futures, which hit a record high at 187,904 contracts. Among other T-note futures, speculative net shorts in five-year T-notes retreated from their record high to 643,081 contracts earlier this week. Speculators scaled back their net shorts in two-year T-notes for a fourth straight week to 31,029 contracts, the lowest in nearly a year. Among interest rates contracts, speculative net shorts in Eurodollar futures recorded their biggest weekly drop in 11 months to 3.80 million contracts.
