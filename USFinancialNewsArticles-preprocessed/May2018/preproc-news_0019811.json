    "text": "LYON, France, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ERYTECH Pharma (Euronext Paris:ERYP) (Nasdaq:ERYP) , a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies by encapsulating therapeutic drug substances inside red blood cells, today announced that it will host its 2018 first quarter conference call and webcast on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 2:30 PM CEST/8:30 AM EST to discuss operational highlights.\nThe call is accessible via the below teleconferencing numbers, followed by the Conference ID#: 3498017#:\nUSA/Canada : +1 409 350 3501 United-Kingdom : +44 2031070289 Switzerland : +41 445802606 Germany : +49 6922224728 France :+33 176748988 Belgium : +32 24003547 Sweden : +46 856619361 Finland : +358 972519310 Netherlands : +31 207075547 Spain : +34 914142503 The webcast can be followed live online via the link: https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/wq3dzxoy .\nAn archived replay of the call will be available for 7 days by dialing + 1 800 585 8367, Conference ID: 3498017#. An archive of the webcast will be available on ERYTECH’s website, under the “Investors” section at http://investors.erytech.com .\nAbout ERYTECH and eryaspase (GRASPA®): www.erytech.com\nFounded in Lyon, France in 2004, ERYTECH is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for rare forms of cancer and orphan diseases. Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS platform, which uses a novel technology to encapsulate therapeutic drug substances inside red blood cells, ERYTECH has developed a pipeline of product candidates targeting markets with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s initial focus is on the development of products that target the altered amino acid metabolism of cancer cells, depriving them of nutrients necessary for their survival.\nThe Company’s lead product, eryaspase, also known under the trade name GRASPA®, consists of an enzyme, L-asparaginase, encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells. L-asparaginase depletes asparagine, a naturally occurring amino acid essential for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. L-asparaginase has been a standard component of multi-agent chemotherapy for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but side effects limit treatment compliance, especially in adults and patients with weak performance status.\nEryaspase demonstrated positive efficacy and safety results in various clinical trials in ALL, including in a Phase 2 study in patients over 55 years of age and in a Phase 2/3 trial in relapsed or refractory ALL patients, as well as in pancreatic cancer, where it achieved positive results in a Phase 2b trial of second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. ERYTECH is preparing for the launch of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in second line pancreatic cancer and Phase 2 trials in first line pancreatic cancer and triple-negative breast cancer.\nERYTECH produces eryaspase at its own GMP-approved and operational manufacturing site in Lyon (France), and at a site for clinical production in Philadelphia (USA). ERYTECH has entered into licensing and distribution partnership agreements for eryaspase for ALL and AML in Europe with Orphan Europe (Recordati Group), and for ALL in Israel with TEVA, which will market the product under the GRASPA® brand name. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have granted orphan drug designations for eryaspase for the treatment of ALL, AML and pancreatic cancer.\nIn addition to eryaspase, ERYTECH is developing erymethionase, methionine-γ-lyase encapsulated in red blood cells, to target cancer cells’ amino acid metabolism and induce tumor starvation. ERYTECH is also exploring the use of its ERYCAPS platform for developing cancer immunotherapies (ERYMMUNE) and enzyme replacement therapies (ERYZYME).\nERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135, ticker: ERYP). ERYTECH is part of the CAC Healthcare, CAC Pharma & Bio, CAC Mid & Small, CAC All Tradable, EnterNext PEA-PME 150 and Next Biotech indexes.\nCONTACTS ERYTECH NewCap Naomi Eichenbaum Julien Perez Director of Investor Relations Investor relations Nicolas Merigeau Media relations +33 4 78 74 44 38 +33 1 44 71 98 52 +1 917 312 5151 erytech@newcap.eu naomi.eichenbaum@erytech.com\nSource:Erytech Pharma S.A.",
