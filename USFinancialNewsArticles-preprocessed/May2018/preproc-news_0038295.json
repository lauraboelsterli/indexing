    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The United States needs to show more understanding about the causes of Israeli-Palestinian conflict after the opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem triggered violence in Gaza, Britain’s junior foreign office minister Alistair Burt said.\nIsraeli troops shot dead dozens of Palestinian protesters on Monday on the Gaza border in the bloodiest single day for Palestinians since 2014.\n“The U.S. will remain a central part of what needs to happen in Israel, but it does need to give a greater sense of understanding of some of the underlying issues,” Burt said in parliament.\nReporting by Estelle Shirbon and Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
