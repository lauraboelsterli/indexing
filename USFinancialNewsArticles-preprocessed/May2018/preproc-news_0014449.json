    "text": "IRVING, Texas, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:DFRG), the owner and operator of the Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse, Del Frisco’s Grille, and Sullivan’s Steakhouse restaurant concepts, reported financial results today for the first quarter ended March 27, 2018.\nIn a separate press release issued this morning, we also announced a definitive agreement to acquire Barteca Restaurant Group for $325 million in cash. Barteca consists of two highly differentiated concepts, Barcelona Wine Bar and bartaco, with 31 restaurants operating across 10 states and Washington DC. Additional details regarding Barteca and the transaction are contained in the separate press release issued today.\nKey highlights from the 13-week first quarter 2018 compared to the 12-week first quarter 2017 include:\nConsolidated revenues increased 6.5% to $89.3 million from $83.9 million primarily due to the additional calendar week in 2018 compared to 2017. Total comparable restaurant sales decreased 3.6%, consisting of a 9.3% decrease in customer counts, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in average check.\nComparable restaurant sales decreased 2.8% at Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse, consisting of a 6.7% decrease in customer counts, partially offset by a 3.9% increase in average check. Sales were impacted by adverse weather conditions in the first quarter 2018 compared to the first quarter 2017, by rolling over the Presidential Inauguration in Washington DC, and the shift of the Super Bowl from Houston to Minneapolis, where we do not operate any restaurants. Excluding the weather and event rollover impacts, comparable restaurant sales would have been slightly positive. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.4% at Del Frisco’s Grille, consisting of a 7.1% decrease in customer counts, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in average check. Excluding the weather and event rollover impacts, comparable restaurant sales would have been slightly positive. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 10.3% at Sullivan’s Steakhouse, consisting of a 20.7% decrease in customer counts, partially offset by a 10.4% increase in average check. The decrease in comparable restaurant sales was partially due to eliminating lunch at selected Sullivan's restaurants, beginning during the second quarter of 2017. Cost of sales, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, increased to 29.3% from 28.3%. GAAP net income of $0.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $3.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. Adjusted net income* of $2.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted net income* of $4.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. Restaurant-level EBITDA* decreased 5.8% to $16.9 million from $18.0 million.\n* Adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS, and Restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of Adjusted net income and Restaurant-level EBITDA to GAAP net income and Operating (loss)/income, respectively, and a discussion of why we consider them useful, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures accompanying this release.\nNorman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer of Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc., said, \"The first quarter was greatly hindered by severe winter weather in January and March affecting some of our highest volume locations in the Northeast along with one-off events in 2017 such as rolling over the Presidential Inauguration in Washington DC and the Super Bowl in Houston. These factors resulted in approximately $3 million in decreased revenues along with associated cost deleveraging that we estimate negatively impacted net income and adjusted net income by approximately $0.08 each per diluted share.”\nAbdallah added, “Cost of sales rose due to menu enhancements and beef price inflation, although our labor line benefitted from the implementation of Hot Schedules which is enabling our restaurant managers to better schedule hours relative to expected volumes. Additionally, our results were affected by different timing of marketing cost spend compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted net income and adjusted net income by approximately $0.03 each per diluted share compared to the first quarter 2017. We expect this timing difference to reverse over the next three quarters and for our full year marketing to fall within our 2018 guidance ranges. Without the severe weather impact and event timing rollovers, and different timing of marketing costs, we would have posted net income of $0.13 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $0.21 per diluted share.”\nAbdallah continued, “With the onset of spring and winter now firmly behind us, we are encouraged that sales trends have improved in all three Brands during the first five weeks of the second quarter on a sequential basis. We believe that this improving momentum, coupled with the timing of the marketing expenses that weighed down the first quarter, positions us within our 2018 guidance range for adjusted net income, exclusive of the impact of the potential divestiture of Sullivan’s and the proposed acquisition of Barteca.”\nAbdallah continued, “While 2017 was a year of transition as we made significant investments, put Brand infrastructure in place, and implemented major menu enhancements and cost saving initiatives, 2018 is shaping up to be a year of growth, portfolio optimization, and value creation. We are accelerating development of our Double Eagle brand based upon expected cash on cash returns of 35%+ and we are opening two new Grille restaurants in the second half of 2018 based upon research from our targeted consumers, while also pursuing the divestiture of Sullivan’s and closing underperforming Grille locations. These decisions reflect our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and asset management that will enable us to focus our attention and resources on more promising opportunities, such as acquiring Barteca Restaurants.”\nAbdallah concluded, “Barteca is highly-complementary to our own vision of celebrating life in restaurants through our multi-brand ‘best in class’ concept strategy, and will mitigate the risk of seasonality and economic downturns to our current restaurant portfolio. Barcelona Wine Bar and bartaco have attractive growth stories with strong and consistent sales trends, compelling unit economics, and exciting development expansion potential, and we believe these brands will also provide us with mutually beneficial value creation opportunities.”\nReview of First Quarter 2018 Operating Results\nConsolidated revenues increased $5.4 million, or 6.5%, to $89.3 million in the 13-week first quarter of 2018 from $83.9 million in the 12-week first quarter of 2017. The increase reflects 52 additional operating weeks to a total of 680, primarily due to the additional calendar week in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of our change in fiscal quarter calendar, which provided an additional $6.6 million in revenues, and strong performances from our more recent Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse and Del Frisco’s Grille restaurant openings in Plano, TX, New York City and Westwood, MA, respectively. This was partially offset by the closure of our Austin, TX Sullivan’s Steakhouse, the temporary closure of several restaurants in the Northeast due to three severe winter storms during the first quarter, and lapping two “one-time” events from the prior-year quarter. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 3.6%, comprised of a 9.3% decrease in customer counts, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in average check.\nGeneral and administrative costs increased to $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, general and administrative costs increased to 9.3% from 7.5%. This increase was due to an additional calendar week in the first quarter of 2018, $0.2 million of one-time legal costs, and investments in the restaurant support center and regional management to support recent and anticipated growth.\nGAAP net income was $0.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to GAAP net income of $3.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net income* was $2.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to Adjusted net income* of $4.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nRestaurant level EBITDA* decreased $1.0 million, or 5.8%, to $16.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. $0.5 million of this decrease was due to rolling over a rent accounting adjustment related to the closure of Seattle Sullivan’s Steakhouse in the first quarter 2017. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, restaurant level EBITDA* decreased to 18.9% from 21.4\nStrategic Alternatives Process for Sullivan’s Steakhouse\nAs part of our strategic alternatives process for Sullivan’s Steakhouse, we have received several bids from interested parties to purchase the concept and are in the process of negotiating terms. We anticipate having a signed agreement in place within the next 60-90 days, but can give no assurances this will be the case.\nOutlook\nThe following statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to the statement below regarding Forward-Looking Statements and our recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition.\nBased upon current information, except as otherwise noted below, we are reiterating the following guidance for the 52-week fiscal year 2018, which ends on December 25, 2018. This guidance makes no assumptions regarding the potential sale of Sullivan’s Steakhouse and the proposed acquisition of Barteca Restaurant Group.\nTotal comparable restaurant sales growth of 0% to 2%. Six (previously five) to seven restaurant openings consisting of up to four Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouses and up to three Del Frisco’s Grilles. Four Del Frisco’s Grille and two Sullivan’s Steakhouse closures, including the Austin, TX Sullivan’s Steakhouse which has already closed. Restaurant-level EBITDA* of 20.0% to 21.0% of consolidated revenues. General and administrative costs of approximately $30 million to $33 million. Reduction of effective tax rate guidance to 0% to 5% from 10% to 15% Gross capital expenditures (before tenant allowances) of $55 million to $60 million. Pre-opening costs of $7.5 million to $8.5 million. Annual adjusted net income* per diluted share of $0.66 to $0.76.\nExcluding significant year over year changes such as the reduced tax rate, the lower depreciation on impaired restaurants, and the increased pre-opening costs, the guidance midpoint represents a 15% annual growth in adjusted net income.\nWe have not reconciled guidance for annual Adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS, and Restaurant-level EBITDA to the corresponding GAAP financial measures because we do not provide guidance for the various reconciling items. We are unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because we cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted since these items could vary significantly from period to period (i.e. impairments, restaurant closure costs and stock repurchases.) Accordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.\nWe currently intend to revisit our annual outlook upon closing the potential sale of Sullivan’s Steakhouse and proposed acquisition of Barteca Restaurant Group.\nDevelopment\nDel Frisco’s Double Eagle Steak House\nWe expect to open Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouses in Atlanta, GA and Boston, MA during the third quarter and in San Diego and Century City, CA during the fourth quarter. All sites are currently under construction.\nWe recently announced two lease signings for Pittsburgh, PA and Santa Clara, CA with projected openings in 2019.\nDel Frisco’s Grille\nWe opened a Del Frisco’s Grille in Westwood, MA during the first quarter. We expect to open in Philadelphia, PA and Fort Lauderdale, FL during the fourth quarter. Both sites are currently under construction.\nConference Call\nWe will host a conference call to discuss financial results for the first quarter ended March 27, 2018 and the proposed Barteca Restaurant Group acquisition today at 7:30 AM Central Time. Hosting the conference call will be Norman Abdallah, Chief Executive Officer and Neil Thomson, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing (323) 794-2551. A replay will be available afterwards and can be accessed by dialing (412) 317-6671; the passcode is 8239374.

The presentation can be found at our corporate website at www.DFRG.com under the Investor Relations section “Events & Presentations”.\nThe conference call will also be webcast live from our corporate website at www.DFRG.com under the Investor Relations section “Events & Presentations”. An archive of the webcast and the investor presentation on the acquisition will also be available through the corporate website shortly after the conference call has concluded.\nAbout Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc.\nBased in Irving, Texas, near Dallas, Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, Inc. is a collection of 53 restaurants across 23 states and Washington, D.C., including Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse, Del Frisco's Grille, and Sullivan's Steakhouse.

Previously, the first three quarters of our fiscal year consisted of 12 weeks each and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks or 17 weeks in a 53-week year. The fiscal quarter ended March 27, 2018 contained 13 weeks and quarter ended March 21, 2017 contained 12 weeks. See Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 27, 2018.\nDEL FRISCO'S RESTAURANT GROUP, INC.

Within our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP Adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS and Restaurant-level EBITDA. Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income plus the sum of GAAP income tax expense (benefit), lease termination and closing costs, consulting project costs, acquisition and disposition costs, reorganization severance, non-recurring legal expenses, donations, non-recurring corporate expenses, and impairment charges minus income tax expense related to the foregoing adjustments at an effective tax rate of 4% during 2018, and 29% during 2017. We believe that this non-GAAP operating measure represents a useful measure of performance internally and for investors as it excludes certain non-operating related expenditures. Restaurant-level EBITDA is calculated by adding back to operating income, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening costs, general and administrative costs, donations, consulting project costs, acquisition and disposition costs, reorganization severance and lease termination and closing costs. We believe that this operating measure also represents a useful internal measure of performance. Accordingly, we include these non-GAAP measures so that investors have the same financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing our underlying performance on a quarter-over-quarter basis. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, these measures as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are presented as supplemental information and not as alternatives to any GAAP measurements. The following tables include a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and operating income to restaurant-level EBITDA.\nAdjusted Net Income Reconciliation - Unaudited 13 Weeks Ended 12 Weeks Ended (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) March 27, 2018 March 21, 2017 Adjusted Net Income: GAAP Net Income $ 400 $ 3,310 GAAP Income Tax Expense 59 1,086 Lease termination and closing costs 366 — Consulting project costs 232 2,036 Acquisition and disposition costs 657 — Reorganization severance 113 — Non-recurring legal expenses 159 — Donations 42 — Non-recurring corporate expenses 8 — Impairment charges 84 — Adjusted Pre-tax Income 2,120 6,432 Income tax expense 85 1,865 Adjusted Net Income $ 2,035 $ 4,567 Adjusted net income per basic share $ 0.10 $ 0.20 Adjusted Net Income per diluted share $ 0.10 $ 0.20\nRestaurant-Level EBITDA Reconciliation - Unaudited 13 Weeks Ended 12 Weeks Ended (Amounts in thousands) March 27, 2018 March 21, 2017 Operating income $ 761 $ 4,408 Add: Pre-opening costs 1,146 389 General and administrative costs 8,332 6,311 Donations 42 — Consulting project costs 232 2,036 Acquisition and disposition costs 657 — Reorganization severance 113 — Lease termination and closing costs 366 (2 ) Depreciation and amortization 5,182 4,816 Non-cash impairment charges 84 — Restaurant-level EBITDA $ 16,915 $ 17,958 Recast 2017 Financial Information\nBeginning in fiscal 2018, we changed to a fiscal quarter calendar where each quarter contains 13 weeks, other than in a 53-week year where the last quarter of the year will contain 14 weeks. Previously, the first three quarters of our fiscal year consisted of 12 weeks each and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks or 17 weeks in a 53-week year. The overall fiscal year remains the same with a 52- or 53-week year ending on the last Tuesday in December. We have not restated and do not plan to restate historical quarterly financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. See Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation , in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 27, 2018 (“First Quarter 10-Q”) for additional information regarding the change in our fiscal quarters.\nDue to the difference in the reporting period between the first quarter of 2018, which was 13 weeks, and the first quarter of 2017, which was 12 weeks, our 2018 results of operations as presented in accordance with GAAP are not comparable to the prior year. Therefore, we are presenting recast quarterly financial results for the fiscal 2017 period because management uses this information in evaluating performance and believes it provides investors with additional information to consider along with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP and the discussion thereof included in the First Quarter 10-Q. However, the presentation of this recast financial information does not comply with GAAP and should not be considered independent of our unaudited combined financial statements and the related notes included in the First Quarter 10-Q.\nThe consolidated and segment revenues reflected in the recast 2017 financial information are derived from our historical books and records and no adjustments were made thereto other than to account for the additional operating week. The amount of certain recurring expense items on a consolidated basis and at the segment level, including costs of sales, restaurant operating expenses and the other items identified as such below, were calculated based on a presumed proportionate increase over the reported 2017 amount reflecting the additional week in recast 2017 consolidated or segment revenues, as applicable, over reported 2017 consolidated or segment revenues, as applicable, because such items are typically a function of and move in correlation to revenues during a given period. No changes were made to the reported 2017 results for certain other expense items such as consulting project costs and the other items identified as such below because they are generally not recurring, but incurred at distinct moments within a period as a result of their more unique nature.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted EPS and restaurant-level EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. See the discussion above under Non-GAAP Information regarding how we define these measures and why we believe they are useful for investors.\nStatements of Income Information - Unaudited 13 Weeks Ended 13 Weeks Ended (recast) (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) March 27, 2018 March 28, 2017 Revenues $ 89,303 100.0 % $ 90,465 100.0 % Costs and expenses: Costs of sales 26,154 29.3 % 25,645 (1 ) 28.3 % Restaurant operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown separately below) 44,215 49.5 % 44,053 (1 ) 48.7 % Marketing and advertising costs 2,019 2.3 % 1,402 (1 ) 1.5 % Pre-opening costs 1,146 1.3 % 419 (1 ) 0.5 % General and administrative costs 8,332 9.3 % 6,806 (1 ) 7.5 % Donations 42 — % — — % Consulting project costs 232 0.3 % 2,036 (2 ) 2.3 % Acquisition and disposition costs 657 0.7 % — — % Reorganization severance 113 0.1 % — — % Lease termination and closing costs 366 0.4 % (2 ) (2 ) — % Impairment charges 84 0.1 % — — % Depreciation and amortization 5,182 5.8 % 5,193 (1 ) 5.7 % Total costs and expenses 88,542 99.1 % 85,552 94.6 % Operating loss income 761 0.9 % 4,913 5.4 % Other income expense, net: Interest expense (303 ) (0.3 )% (10 ) (2 ) — % Other 1 — % (2 ) (2 ) — % Income before income taxes 459 0.5 % 4,901 5.4 % Income tax expense 59 0.1 % 1,211 (3 ) 1.3 % Net income $ 400 0.4 % $ 3,690 4.1 % Net loss income per average common share: Basic: $ 0.02 $ 0.16 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding: Basic: 20,317 22,962 Recast 2017 amount reflects a presumed proportionate increase over the reported 2017 amount reflecting the additional week in recast 2017 revenues over reported 2017 revenues, which was determined based on the revenues recorded in the company’s historical books and records for the additional operating week included in the recast 2017 period.
