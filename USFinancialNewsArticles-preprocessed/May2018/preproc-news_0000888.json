The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is due to announce its decision at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday.\nCore euro zone bonds have picked up demand in recent days since a European Central Bank meeting on expectations that policymakers will adopt a relatively cautious stance.\n“Higher U.S. core PCE inflation and Wednesday’s FOMC meeting should pave the way for a June hike (from the Fed),” Commerzbank analysts said in a note. However, subdued inflation on the other side of the Atlantic, along with redemptions and other technical factors, should stabilise European government bonds, they added.\nThe gap between 10-year German and U.S. bond yields was at 240 basis points, less than a basis point off the widest level since March 1989 touched last week.\nThough this spread does not account for the different valuations of the currencies of either region, it still indicates how differently investors view the two regions in terms of how far central banks have to go in removing post-crisis stimulus.\nThe ECB still buys 30 billion euros of bonds a month as part of its stimulus programme and rate hikes are still far away by investors’ reckoning, whereas the Fed is already running down its quantitative easing scheme.\nIn addition, the gap between British and U.S. 10-year government bond yields hit its widest since 1984 on Tuesday, reflecting sharp shifts in interest rate expectations in the two countries in recent days.\nMost euro zone bonds were roughly unchanged on the day, Italian yields rose a touch, having jumped 3-5 basis points across the curve on Monday on political jitters.\nOn Tuesday, the Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread reached its widest in two weeks at 122 basis points following Monday’s headlines that raised the possibility of an early election.\n5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio called for new elections in June, saying efforts to form a coalition after March’s inconclusive vote had gone nowhere.\nElsewhere, Greek government bond yields stuck to the 2-1/2 months lows hit after OECD chief Angel Gurria said on Monday that Athens has made enormous reform efforts since its debt crisis broke out and deserved debt relief.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, additional reporting by Fanny Potkin.
