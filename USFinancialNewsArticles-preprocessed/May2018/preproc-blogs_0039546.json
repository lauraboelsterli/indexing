    "text": "Cuomo: Finger Lakes trash incinerator should be rejected Published 5 Hours Ago The Associated Press\nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) â€” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he opposes plans for a massive trash incinerator in the Finger Lakes region.\nThe Democrat announced his opposition to the project on Tuesday as opponents rallied in Albany.\nCuomo says the proposal is inappropriate for one of the state's most environmentally sensitive areas. He says he's confident a state siting board will reject the proposal.\nWine makers, farmers, residents and local officials have long called on Cuomo's administration to disallow the incinerator, which is proposed for the town of Romulus.\nThey say the facility would undermine efforts to make the Finger Lakes a destination for tourism and sustainable agriculture.\nThe Rochester-based company behind the proposal, Circular enerG LLC, has said the incinerator would create clean energy by burning trash that otherwise would be landfilled.",
