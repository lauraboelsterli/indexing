    "text": " 15 minutes ago Gaza Palestinians fear a bleak Ramadan lies ahead, amid poverty and killings Emily Wither 2 Min Read\nGAZA (Reuters) - On the eve of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, many Gazans on Wednesday were worried about how they will put food on the table. Palestinians walk as they shop ahead of the holy month of Ramadan, in the old city of Hebron, in the occupied West Bank May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Mussa Qawasma\nWith dozens of Palestinian protesters killed in recent weeks during a border face-off between demonstrators and Israeli troops, and with 80 percent of Gaza’s 2 million population dependent on aid, the mood is bleak.\n“It is sad and depressing. In every home there is an injured person, in every home there is a martyr. All the mothers are sad, there is no nice Ramadan atmosphere at all,” said Sabreen al-Turk.
