    "text": "30 COMMENTS “MERLOT IS ONE of the great grapes,” said winemaker Aaron Pott as we stood in the living room of his Napa Valley home. On the table in front of us were bottles of Merlot-dominant Blackbird Vineyards “Illustration” he’d produced. The selection included vintages that were almost entirely Merlot—though the front labels omitted this fact. As Mr. Pott later noted, the wine was launched when “Merlot bashing” was on the rise, some 10 years ago.\nAmerican Merlot remains a hard sell today and especially in Napa, where Cabernet Sauvignon is the undisputed and most profitable star. Indeed, Napa growers have been pulling up their Merlot vines at a rapid clip and replanting them with Cabernet. According to Napa Valley Vintners, in 2007 there were 6,828 acres of Merlot in Napa; 10 years later, Merlot acreage is down to 4,583.\n“When you go to pour Merlot for people in the tasting room they will actually put their hand over the glass,” said Jim Duane, winemaker at Seavey Vineyard, who makes a small amount of Merlot in addition to Cabernet with consulting winemaker Philippe Melka. Mr. Duane is a Merlot fan. “Cabernet is powerful but Merlot is the one that allows me to express elegance,” he said.\nNapa Valley winemaker Steve Matthiasson believes that the best wine in his diverse portfolio is his Red Hen Vineyard Merlot, produced from a vineyard in the Oak Knoll district in the southern end of the Valley. The vineyard was once Merlot-dominant but has since been replanted mostly to Cabernet by its owner. Mr. Matthiasson is the only winemaker who still buys Merlot grapes from Red Hen Vineyard, and he has to work to convince drinkers, even professionals, to try the wine. “When we do a line-up of our wines, our Merlot is more expressive than our Cabernet, and that raises a lot of eyebrows,” he said.\nAnti-Merlot sentiment surfaced around the time of the movie “Sideways” (2004), though the grape’s waning popularity likely had less to do with the character Miles’s avowed distaste for the grape than it did with all the lousy American Merlot on the market back then. There was too much Merlot grown in all the wrong places. “Back in the 1990s people just put Merlot in everywhere,” said Mr. Matthiasson. “There was tons of Merlot.”\nMuch of the Merlot planted in unsuitable locations failed to get ripe—or turned out far too ripe—resulting in wines that were either green and weedy or soft, sweet, boring fruit bombs. A far cry, in other words, from the “lush complex wines that smell like violets” that Mr. Pott described as his ideal.\nRichie Allen, winemaker at Rombauer Vineyards, noted that Merlot needs the right conditions (humidity) and soil (preferably clay) to thrive. Merlot is a pretty temperamental grape “with a lot more in common with Pinot Noir than Cabernet,” he said. Rombauer is in the middle of the Valley, but Mr. Allen sources much of his Merlot in the southern end of Napa, in the cool, humid Napa Carneros region, which he said “has a lot of clay soil.”\nI confessed to the easygoing, Australian-born Mr. Allen that I was surprised to discover that a Rombauer Merlot even existed. The winery is synonymous with the big, oaky (and wildly popular) Rombauer Chardonnay sometimes called “cougar juice” or “housewife heroin” by both fans and detractors. Mr. Allen laughed. “The Rombauer Merlot drinker is not the Rombauer Chardonnay drinker,” he said. And his 2014 Rombauer Merlot was no oak bomb, but an attractive, bright-red, cherry-inflected red with good acidity and soft tannins. “Of all the wines I make, this is the one my wife likes to drink,” said Mr. Allen.\n‘ When you go to pour Merlot, people will put their hand over the glass. ’\nDuckhorn Vineyards may be the only winery in Napa more famous for its Merlots than its Cabernets. Duckhorn’s iconic Three Palms Vineyard Merlot debuted in 1978 to almost-immediate acclaim. Winemaker Renée Ary acknowledged her winery’s unusual status in the Valley but noted that she, too, has trouble sourcing good Merlot for the winery’s other Merlot bottlings. “We can buy all the Cabernet we want but it’s hard to find good Merlot,” she said.\nI met Ms. Ary and Duckhorn president and CEO Alex Ryan in a vineyard that’s home to three very tall, very spindly palm trees. Quite far north of most Napa Merlot vineyards, its 83 acres are very flat and not particularly impressive or picturesque, though quite rocky. “It’s some of the rockiest vineyard soil in Napa,” said Ms. Ary.\nMs. Ary had brought along several of the Duckhorn Merlots, which we tasted at a picnic table in the vineyard. The wines ranged from a good if rather straightforward 2014 Napa Valley Merlot to the bigger, more tannic and structured 2014 Stout Vineyard Merlot, an intense and powerful wine made from hillside fruit that would clearly need time to unwind. “Growing Merlot in the mountains is hit or miss,” said Ms. Ary. The 2014 vintage was clearly a good one.\nFinally, we tasted both the 2014 and 2015 vintages of the Three Palms Vineyard Merlot. The former, a lush, rich, layered wine, was Wine Spectator’s 2017 Wine of the Year. “We have to limit people to buying one bottle,” said Mr. Ryan. The 2015 was a much tighter, more focused, less openly inviting wine.\nShafer Vineyards has long produced one of the most consistently sought after and well made Merlots in Napa. (They also turn out some famously good Cabernets.) But the 2014 vintage was the last Shafer Merlot vintage, said president Doug Shafer. With longtime winemaker Elias Fernandez, Mr. Shafer decided to stop making a varietally labeled wine and make what they called TD-9, a Merlot-dominant blend.\nThey had a lighter crop for the 2014 vintage, and they realized they could add other grapes (Cabernet and Malbec) and meet both quality and quantity demands. “’We’re taking Merlot and making it better,” Mr. Shafer said.\nI was sad to hear this news: The Shafer had always been one of my favorite Napa Merlots. I found out I was far from alone when I spoke to Tony Gonzalez, a senior vice president portfolio manager at the Winebow Group, a distributor for Shafer wines. The company sold out their inventory of the 2014 Merlot, 102 cases, in three weeks. I went looking for a bottle and found one left in my local store. “A woman called looking for nine bottles,” said the salesperson I spoke with, who seemed surprised by this fact.\nPerhaps all those drinkers in search of the Shafer wine would do well to try some of the other remaining Napa Merlots listed below. Who knows? They might even spark a pro-Merlot trend.\nOENOFILE // Merlots and Merlot-Dominant Blends that Rate High\nPhoto: F. Martin Ramin/ The Wall Street Journal 1. 2013 Blackbird Vineyards “Arise” $55\nThis Merlot-dominant blend from winemaker Aaron Pott—who also produces the more pricey “Illustration” containing even more Merlot—is a beautiful, well balanced wine marked by fine tannins and aromas of black fruit and spice.\n2. 2014 Seavey Vineyard Napa Valley Merlot $65\nBased at the foot of Howell Mountain, Seavey Vineyard produces a small amount of Merlot in addition to Cabernet Sauvignon. Their 2014 is an intense and tightly wound wine that needs decanting or, better yet, cellaring a few years.\n3. 2014 Rombauer Vineyards Napa Valley Merlot $45\nThe Rombauer Chardonnay is more famous (some might say infamous), but the Merlot deserves more attention. Sourced from the cool Napa Carneros region, this soft red has a lively acidity that lends a juicy edge.\n4. 2014 Duckhorn Vineyards Three Palms Vineyard Napa Valley Merlot $98\nThe most famous single-vineyard Merlot from the iconic Three Palms Vineyard does not disappoint. This lush, full-bodied wine, deliciously accessible now, will reward cellaring for several years as well.\n5. 2014 Shafer Vineyards Napa Valley Merlot $55\nThis is the last vintage of the much-loved Shafer Merlot—as of 2015, the winery produces a blend (TD-9) instead. This is a big, bold and relatively high-octane (15.3% ABV) Merlot that delivers both pleasure and power.\nEmail Lettie at wine@wsj.com.\nMore in Food & Drink\nThe Surprising Truth About the Price of Rosé May 24, 2018 Can You Judge a Wine By the Shape of Its Bottle?
