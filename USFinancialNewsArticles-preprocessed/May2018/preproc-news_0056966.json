    "text": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain’s prime minister promised an action plan to tackle the injustices LGBT people face on Thursday, as activists said the community still suffered abuse and discrimination.\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street in London, Britain, May 23, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville Theresa May said the transgender community faced “indignities and prejudice”, as she announced the LGBT Action Plan, which she said would ensure no one faced persecution for who they love.\n“It will set out concrete steps the government will take to improve lives for LGBT people in this country and address some of the injustices the community has faced,” May wrote in a letter published in the Gay Times magazine.\n“Trans people still face indignities and prejudice when they deserve understanding and respect.”\nAbout 41 percent of transgender people in Britain experienced a hate crime in 2017, according to the charity Stonewall, which advocates for LGBT rights.\nMay did not say what steps the plan would include, but it is expected to address areas including healthcare, education and personal safety.\nBritain recognized the gender identity of trans people in the 2004 Gender Recognition Act and May’s government has since proposed changes to the law to allow gender reassignment surgery without a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.\nThe British leader last month called for Commonwealth nations to reform outdated anti-gay legislation in an effort to stop widespread persecution and discrimination of LGBT people.\nAbout 37 of the 53 mostly former British colonies still have colonial-era laws that criminalize LGBT identities.\nStonewall’s director of campaigns, policy and research Paul Twocock welcomed the announcement.\n“LGBT people still face many inequalities and abuse in their everyday life in Britain,” Twocock told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“Both the Action Plan and reform of the Gender Recognition Act should allow us to make important steps forward towards building a society where LGBT people are truly accepted, everywhere and by everyone.”\nReporting by Serena Chaudhry, Editing by Claire Cozens.
