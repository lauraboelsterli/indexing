The Symantec logo is pictured on a screen June 13, 2016. REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo\nThe Norton anti-virus maker said the investigation, which commenced following “concerns” raised by a former employee, will also look into stock trading plans and the company’s public disclosures including commentary on historical financial results.\nChief Executive Officer Gregory Clark on an investor call said the company has put on hold all discretionary and performance-based compensation for named executive officers until the investigation concludes.\nWhen asked for more details, Clark said he “can’t answer any questions about the investigation.”\nThe company said its audit committee had hired an independent counsel and other advisers to assist in the investigation.\nThe Norton anti-virus maker’s shares, which closed up about 10 percent in regular trading, rose marginally in extended trading.\nAbout $6 billion in market value was wiped out on Friday, a day after the company disclosed the whistleblower probe in its quarterly earnings report without providing further details.
