    "text": "North Korea responded on Friday with measured tones to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to call off a historic summit with leader Kim Jong Un scheduled for next month, saying Pyongyang hoped for a \"Trump-style solution\" to resolve the standoff over its nuclear weapons programme.\n\"We had hoped a 'Trump-style solution' would be a wise way to relieve worries from both sides, meet our demands and realistically resolve problems,\" North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a Korean language statement carried by state media, without elaborating.\nHe said the North is open to resolving issues with the United States whenever and however.\n\"We had set in high regards President Trump's efforts, unprecedented by any other president, to create a historic North Korea-U.S. summit,\" he said.\n\"We tell the United States once more that we are open to resolving problems at any time in any way,\" he said.\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote a letter to Kim to announce his withdrawal from what would have been the first-ever meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12.\n\"Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it would be inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,\" Trump wrote.\nSeparately, the foreign ministers of the United States and South Korea agreed to continue working towards creating the right conditions for the United States and North Korea to talk, the South's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday.\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held a phone call and made the remarks after U.S. President Donald Trump called off a June summit with North Korea, the statement said.\nTrump's announcement came after repeated threats by North Korea to pull out of the summit over what it saw as confrontational remarks by U.S. officials.\nNorth Korea has sharply criticised suggestions by senior U.S. officials — including Vice President Mike Pence — that it could share the fate of Libya if it did not swiftly surrender its nuclear arsenal.\nLibyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and murdered by NATO-backed militants after halting his nascent nuclear programme.\nKim Kye Gwan said such criticisms had only been a \"protest\" against American rhetoric, and that it showed the need for talks with Washington.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who worked hard to help set up the summit and urged Trump at a White House meeting on Tuesday not to let a rare opportunity slip away, said he was \"perplexed\" by the cancellation. He urged Trump and Kim to talk directly.\nJapanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said Tokyo understands Trump's decision to cancel the Singapore summit, Kyodo News reported.\n\"It's meaningless to have talks that don't achieve results,\" Kono told reporters on a visit to Mexico City, the news agency said.\nJapanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera also played down the significance of the cancelled meeting.\n\"The important thing is not the U.S.-North Korea meeting itself, but that the meeting becomes an opportunity to move forward in the issues of denuclearization and abductions,\" he told reporters in Tokyo.",
