    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said his lawyer Michael Cohen did not use presidential campaign funds to pay Stormy Daniels as part of a contract that he said was aimed at stopping the adult-film star from making “false and extortionist accusations” about an affair.\n“Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction,” Trump wrote in one of a series of early morning tweets.
