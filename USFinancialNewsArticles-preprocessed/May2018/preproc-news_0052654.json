This adds another dimension to our business, by adding product lines which serve a larger audience, with a more robust asset base,\" said Everett M. Dickson, CEO of UHLN.\n“This acquisition adds significant strength to the balance sheet and acts as a new arena in the Company’s aggressive growth strategy. This addition dramatically increases our footprint, brings additional management and is accretive to our bottom line as well containing a well-developed catering and wholesale supplies business. The latest transaction strengthens our cashflow, diversifies our asset base and allows us to begin to consider the economy of scale through integration, not only when purchasing products and supplies but in the general administration and management of running several locations, diverse food styles and local produce menus,” said Mr. Dickson.\nExpanding across the Southeast, and now in parts north whilst headquartered in Atlanta GA, UHLN’s new brands are focused in the burgeoning fast-casual restaurant space, offering consumers healthy diverse menus made with fresh organic ingredients every day.
