    "text": "May 21, 2018 / 7:55 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago German foreign minister says to meet with Pompeo over Iran deal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Monday he will travel to Washington to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Washington’s stance on an international nuclear deal with Iran. Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas speaks during a news conference at the G20 Meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers in Buenos Aires, Argentina, May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci\nThe United States earlier in the day demanded Iran make sweeping changes - from dropping its nuclear programme to pulling out of the Syrian civil war - or face sanctions as the Trump administration hardened its approach to Tehran.\n“From here I will actually travel to Washington to have a meeting with Secretary Pompeo, and take advantage of that meeting to talk about this,” Maas said in response to a question from a journalist about the Iran deal.\nMaas spoke to reporters in Buenos Aires at the end of a G20 meeting in the Argentine capital.
