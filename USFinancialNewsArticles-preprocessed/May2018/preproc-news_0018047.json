    "text": "Meg Sloan has struggled with migraines for as long as she can remember. But as a mother of two and a partner at a venture capital firm, she doesn’t have time to let the pain get her down. Over the years, Meg has learned that she can manage her migraines through over-the-counter medications, exercise and by keeping a consistent schedule. Today, she’s living more and missing out less. For that, her children, her team, and Meg herself are all grateful.\nexcedrin-23\n“My team knows that I do what I can to minimize triggers, but it doesn’t always help. When a migraine sets in, I take Excedrin Migraine and then break for a minute – that helps.” (Meg)\n“Meg wears a lot of hats at our business. As her business partner, I count on her every day to make important decisions and help steer us in the right direction. I do what I can to help out when her migraines set in, and she’s there for me when I need it, too. Taking care of one another is a priority at our office. It’s part of our culture.” (Steve Vassallo)\n“Running helps keep my migraines at bay, and it makes me feel strong and ready to take on the world. It’s also a chance to catch up with my friend and running partner, Amy.” (Meg)\n“I’ve never been one of those 9-to-5 kind of people. I take my work home with me frequently, and that’s ok. Since I never know when the next migraine will set in, I’m determined to get work done when I’m feeling my best.” (Meg)\n“I love it when Mom’s feeling good. Whenever she can, she comes to watch me dance.” (Lindy Sloan)\n“When she has a migraine, it’s hard to get my mom to help me with my homework. (Lindy Sloan)\n“It’s the little things in life that matter. Making dinner with my kids. Laughing about our days. I want to be there for those experiences, now and in the future. Pain may knock me down, but I’ll keep getting back up. I am more than my migraines.” (Meg)\n0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
