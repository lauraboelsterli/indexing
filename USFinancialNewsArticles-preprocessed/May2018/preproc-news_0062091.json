    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 10:12 AM / Updated 25 minutes ago Sembcorp Industries to buy UK Power Reserve for $288 mln Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Integrated energy group Sembcorp Industries ( SCIL.SI ) has agreed to buy UK Power Reserve, Britainâ€™s largest flexible power generator, for 216 million pounds.\nThe Singapore-listed company said on Thursday it was buying UK Power Reserve, which was founded in 2010 to meet growing demand for flexible reserve power capacity, from investment firm Equistone Partners Europe and Inflexion Private Equity.\nIn Britain, demand for more flexible power generation capacity has grown due to the closure of ageing thermal plants, the rise of variable renewable energy and electric vehicles.\nUK Power Reserve has 32 rapid-response power stations with a total capacity of 533 megawatts (MW) in operation, enough to power 375,000 homes.\nA further 480 MW of capacity, included 120 MW of battery storage assets, is under construction and development and expected to come online by 2019.\nSembcorp Industries has an energy portfolio of more than 12 gigawatts (GW) worldwide, including thermal power plants and renewable energy assets.\nSembcorp UK, which has 210 MW of combined heat and power, steam power and renewable generation capacity at its Wilton International industrial site in Teesside, northeast England, is also seeking planning approval to develop two combined-cycle gas turbine units of up to 1.7 GW at that site.
