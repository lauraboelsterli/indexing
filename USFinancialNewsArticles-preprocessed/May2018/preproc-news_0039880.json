    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, May 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenway Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: GWTI), today announced changes to its management team and Board of Directors, effective May 10, 2018, including the election of a new Chairman of the Board, current Director Raymond Wright; the appointment of a new independent director, Peter Hauser; the resignation of Patrick Six as President and Chief Financial Officer; the appointment of John Olynick as the new President, and the appointment of Ransom Jones as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer.\nBoard member and President of wholly-owned subsidiary Greenway Innovative Energy (“GIE”), Raymond Wright succeeds Patrick Six as Chairman of the Board. Mr Wright has served as the President of GIE since August 2012. Prior to Greenway, Mr. Wright was the co-founder of DFW Genesis in 2009, where he began working on a novel approach to natural Gas-to-Liquid (“GTL”) syngas conversion processes. In 2012, he and the late Dr. Conrad Greer formed Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc. to continue working on their proprietary GTL process, which was subsequently acquired by the Company in August of that year. Previously, Mr. Wright worked with Dallas-based Texas Instruments managing operations and opening up new markets for its European division.\nA former consultant to GIE and the Company, Peter Hauser, was appointed as a director to fill an opening created by the recent increase in the number of directors. Mr. Hauser’s appointment expands the Board to seven directors. Mr. Hauser joins six current directors, Raymond Wright, Patrick Six, Craig Takacs, Kent Harer, Kevin Jones and Ransom Jones. Mr. Hauser has over 40 years of business experience and has been working with the Company since April 2017. Mr. Hauser has spent most of his career in the information technology industry, with specific expertise supporting government agencies in management and sales positions at EMC Corporation, Storage Technology Corporation, among others.\nAfter accepting Mr. Six’s resignation, the Board appointed John Olynick as the new President and chief executive of Greenway. Mr. Olynick brings over 40 years of experience in senior management positions at industry leading technology corporations including Digital Equipment Corp, CISCO Systems, Inc. and Philips Electronics. Over his career, John has helped build businesses and has led turnarounds including serving as CEO and Chairman of the Board of an Arizona-based public company that grew both organically and through acquisition under his leadership. Since July 2017, he has been assisting the Company as a business development consultant with a focus on securing operational funding and developing joint venture partnerships. He is a graduate of the New York University School of Engineering and the Harvard Business School Professional Development program.\nThe Board of Directors also appointed Ransom Jones to the position of Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. Mr. Jones has over 40 years of diverse financial management and business experience, including as a former partner of KPMG Peat Marwick and Chief Financial Officer for two publicly traded corporations, Western Preferred Corporation and El Paso Refining, Inc. Mr. Jones has also served as an officer for some of the largest and most prestigious global financial institutions including, Goldman Sachs, Citicorp, ABN-AMRO Bank and AIG. More recently, Mr. Jones previously served as President and Chief Financial Officer of UMED Holdings, now Greenway through April 2017. He graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso with a BBA in Accounting.\nCommenting on the announcement, Greenway Technologies Chairman, Ray Wright stated, “The changes announced today are consistent with our ongoing evolution since the recent completion of our first-of-its-kind G-Reformer® unit, a critical component to our unique syngas conversion process. The addition of John Olynick, an experienced public company chief executive and business builder, brings another dimension of business insight and experience to the Company and this Board. Peter Hauser has been supporting our mission to bring our innovative GTL solution to market by assisting with public relations, marketing, sales and finance. His thought leadership in these areas has been invaluable to us thus far, and we look forward to his continued service on our Board of Directors. Last, but certainly not least, Ransom Jones rejoining us as CFO will be of invaluable importance as we seek new investment and financial relationships, business and operational partnerships. I’m thankful that this team has stepped forward at this critical time in the Company’s history to lead the way forward and develop our GTL technology commercialization and go-to-market strategy. I look forward to an exciting year ahead.”\nAbout Greenway Technologies, Inc.\nBased in Fort Worth, Texas, Greenway Technologies through its wholly owned subsidiary, Greenway Innovative Energy is engaged in the research and development of small-scale gas-to-liquids (GTL) syngas conversion systems that can be scaled to meet individual field requirements.
