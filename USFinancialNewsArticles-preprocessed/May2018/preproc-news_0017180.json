    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 3:37 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago UPDATE 1-AIG shareholders approve $43 mln pay package for CEO Reuters Staff\n(Recasts for vote)\nBy Suzanne Barlyn\nNEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc said shareholders approved a $43.1 million pay package for Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault during the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday.\nA nonbinding resolution to endorse the executive compensation passed with a majority of votes cast, Chairman Doug Steenland announced, adding that further details would be released later in the day.\nInfluential proxy advisory firms International Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis had advised shareholders to reject the resolution, saying the pay package did not align with AIG’s performance.\nAIG’s stock has dropped 13 percent since Duperreault took charge of the company last May.\nThe company’s pay arrangements include $24.2 million for former CEO Peter Hancock, who stepped down last year under pressure, with a $5 million cash award “for his service through the transition” to Duperreault, according to its annual proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March.\nIt is unusual for both advisory firms to recommend voting against pay measures for the same company. ISS recommended votes against pay only about 12 percent of the time for companies listed on the broad-based Russell 3000 stock index, an ISS spokesman said.
