REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\nTechnology shares will now be included in the midcap index MDAX and the smallcap index SDAX, Deutsche Boerse said. Previously, medium and small technology stocks were only included in the TecDAX index.\nAlso, bluechip technology stocks in the benchmark DAX index will also be included in the TecDAX index.\nThe change, which was announced late on Friday and is effective Sept. 24, also increases the number of companies in the MDAX to 60 from 50 and in the SDAX to 70 from 50.
