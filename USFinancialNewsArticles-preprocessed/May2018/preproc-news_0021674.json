    "text": "Nick Pivetta pitched five shutout innings, Maikel Franco homered and the Philadelphia Phillies handily defeated the San Francisco Giants 11-3 Wednesday night at Citizens Bank Park.\nPivetta allowed only four hits while striking out seven and walking none.\nCarlos Santana had three hits and a career-high tying five RBIs while Franco added three hits as the Phillies won for the third straight game over the Giants. The series finale is Thursday afternoon.\nThe Phillies managed 10 hits and left only six runners on base.\nGiants starter Chris Stratton struggled mightily, allowing five hits, five earned runs and four walks in 4 2/3 innings.\nEvan Longoria and Brandon Crawford each had a pair of hits for the Giants.\nSantana doubled in the first, scoring Odubel Herrera for a quick 1-0 lead.\nFranco stayed hot with an RBI single in the first and a solo home run in the fourth for a 3-0 Phillies advantage.\nThe Giants had a runner on first with two outs in the fifth but Alen Hanson’s swinging bunt didn’t materialize into a hit and they still trailed by three runs.\nSantana struck again in the fifth with a two-run single, extending the Philadelphia lead to 5-0. After Stratton walked the bases loaded, Santana singled to center, scoring Andrew Knapp and Aaron Altherr.\nThe Giants got on the board in the sixth when Longoria ripped a double down the left field line, scoring Brandon Belt and slicing the lead to 5-1.\nRhys Hoskins hit a sacrifice fly in the sixth off Giants reliever Pierce Johnson, scoring Nick Williams. Knapp followed with an RBI single and the lead ballooned to 7-1.\nThe Phillies scored two more runs on wild pitches by Johnson and Derek Law.\nSantana then recorded his third hit of the game, a two-run single off Law for a commanding 11-1 lead. Santana’s five RBI tied his career-high originally set with the Cleveland Indians in 2012.\nThe Phillies sent 11 batters to the plate in the sixth to score six runs.\nSan Francisco picked up a pair of runs in the ninth to close out the scoring.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
