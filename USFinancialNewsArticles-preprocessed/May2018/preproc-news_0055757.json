    "text": "Cleveland Cavaliers big man Kevin Love remains in the NBA’s concussion protocol, and his status for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday against the Golden State Warriors is uncertain.\nMay 25, 2018; Cleveland, OH, USA; Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (0) shoots the ball against Cleveland Cavaliers center Kevin Love (0) during the first quarter in game six of the Eastern conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Quicken Loans Arena. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue told reporters Tuesday before the team flew to Oakland that he was “not sure” if Love would be able to play.\nLove missed almost all of Games 6 and 7 of the Eastern Conference finals following a head-to-head collision with Boston Celtics rookie Jayson Tatum in the first quarter on Friday. Love was re-evaluated Saturday before the decision to hold him out of Sunday’s Game 7, though he traveled with the team to Boston and attended the game.\nJeff Green started in Love’s place and totaled 19 points and eight rebounds in Game 7.\nLove, 29, is averaging 13.9 points and 10.0 rebounds per game in the postseason.\nThree years ago, he missed the entirety of the Cavaliers’ NBA Finals series with the Warriors due to a separated shoulder. Golden State won in six games.\nThis year’s Finals, the fourth straight meeting between the two teams, tips off Thursday at 9 p.m. ET at Oracle Arena in Oakland.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
