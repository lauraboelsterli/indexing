    "text": "MILPITAS, Calif., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nanometrics Incorporated (NASDAQ:NANO), a leading provider of advanced process control systems, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nRecord Financial Results. Strong positions with key customers and a continued positive business environment, particularly for memory, helped drive record revenues, gross margin, and earnings per share. Revenues of $82.3 million were up 39% from the first quarter of 2017, and up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Record gross margin was higher than forecast, due to the greater revenue volume and an increased contribution of high-margin upgrades, as well as a favorable accrual adjustment.\nSignificant Competitive Wins and Increasing Market Share. The company recently announced two significant competitive wins: the selection of the IMPULSE ® + integrated metrology platform by a leading-edge DRAM manufacturer, and the adoption of Nanometrics’ broad portfolio of fab-wide process control solutions by a domestic China 3D-NAND manufacturer. Both of these new positions resulted in increased market share, stronger revenues for the first quarter, and are also contributing to the company’s strengthened outlook for the full year 2018.\nStrong Free Cash Flow Generation. The company reported $32.7 million in cash flow from operating activities, and after capital expenditures of $1.3 million, generated a record $31.4 million in free cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased $6.9 million quarter-over-quarter, after $23.0 million of stock repurchases, to end the quarter with a balance of $123.9 million.\nCompletion of $50 Million Stock Repurchase Program. Nanometrics completed the $50 million stock repurchase program announced last November, buying back just under two million shares over the last two quarters at an average price of $25.48 per share.\nGAAP Results Q1 2018 Q4 2017 QoQ Q1 2017 YoY Revenues (Millions) $ 82.3 $ 78.2 5% $ 59.3 39% Gross Margin 57.7% 56.2% 150 bps 48.0% 970 bps Operating Margin 25.0% 24.5% 50 bps 9.3% 1570 bps Net Income (Millions) $ 16.4 $ 10.8 52% $ 5.4 206% Earnings per Diluted Share $ 0.67 $ 0.42 60% $ 0.21 223% Non-GAAP Results Q1 2018 Q4 2017 QoQ Q1 2017 YoY Gross Margin 57.8% 56.4% 140 bps 48.3% 950 bps Operating Margin 25.6% 25.3% 30 bps 9.9% 1570 bps Net Income (Millions) $ 16.5 $ 13.6 22% $ 4.8 245% Earnings per Diluted Share $ 0.67 $ 0.53 28% $ 0.19 264% A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release and on the investor page of Nanometrics' website. Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, severance costs, executive transition and search costs and certain discrete tax items.\n“We are very pleased to report stronger-than-expected financial results for the first quarter, in which we achieved new records in revenue, gross margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow,” commented Dr. Pierre-Yves Lesaicherre, president and chief executive officer of Nanometrics. “Our first-quarter revenues reflected both the strength of the capital spending environment for memory devices, as well as our recently-announced significant market share wins, which were immediately impactful to our product sales. Customer demand from both the NAND and DRAM market segments is reflecting that our customers’ ramp in investments is both faster and stronger than we previously forecast, improving our results for the first quarter as well as our outlook for the full year. Further, our results demonstrate that we are executing well toward our financial model targets. While there were a couple of key factors driving our gross margin outperformance that were unique to the first quarter, normalized margins of approximately 56% for the period indicate the company is ahead of schedule in achieving its gross margin targets.\n“Our outlook for 2018 has strengthened since last quarter, both in terms of revenue growth and profitability. Our greater market share, higher revenue volume, and increased gross margin are enabling us to make investments in R&D and our global sales organization in support of future growth, while delivering strong profits and cash flows.” Dr. Lesaicherre concluded, “2018 is off to a very strong start, and we are looking forward to delivering a fifth straight year of double-digit revenue growth, with expanding gross and operating margins, increased earnings per share, and significant free cash flow generation. As we invest in new technologies, we are also excited to deliver on our R&D investments, and introduce new products to drive continued growth and outperformance in the years to come.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $82.3 million, up 5.3% from $78.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and up 38.8% from $59.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 57.7%, compared to 56.2% in the prior quarter and 48.0% in the year-ago period. Operating income was $20.6 million, compared to $19.2 million in the prior quarter and $5.5 million in the year-ago period. Net income was $16.4 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to $10.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $5.4 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets and severance included in cost of revenues, gross margin was 57.8%, compared to 56.4% in the prior quarter and 48.3% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating income also excludes severance included in operating expenses, and executive search and transition costs, and was $21.0 million, compared to $19.8 million in the prior quarter and $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income also adjusts for certain discrete tax items and the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and was $16.5 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to $13.6 million or $0.53 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $4.8 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nManagement expects second quarter 2018 revenues in the range of $82 to $90 million. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 56%, plus or minus 1%, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management expects second-quarter operating expenses to range between $27.0 million and $28.0 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and earnings in the range of $0.57 to $0.74 per diluted share on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The earnings per share guidance reflects an improved tax rate of 22% to 23%, compared to the 25% estimate previously in guidance.\nConference Call Details\nA conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results will be held today at 4:30 p.m. EDT (1:30 p.m. PDT). To participate in the conference call, the dial-in numbers are (877) 374-4041 for domestic callers and (253) 237-1156 for international callers. The conference ID is 4785405. A live and recorded webcast and supplemental financial information will be made available on the investor page of the Nanometrics website at www.nanometrics.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, operating income, operating income margin, net income, net income per share, which exclude certain expenses, charges and special items, and free cash flow, were not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management uses non-GAAP financial results, which exclude amortization of acquired intangibles assets, severance costs, executive transition and search costs, and certain discrete tax items, to evaluate the company’s ongoing performance and to enable comparison to other periods that did not include these items. The company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends, comparing performance to prior periods, and enhancing the investor’s ability to view the company’s results from management’s perspective; however, investors are cautioned that other companies may calculate these measures differently than Nanometrics does, which would limit the usefulness of these financial measures. A table presenting a reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included at the end of this press release and is available on the investor page of the Nanometrics website at www.nanometrics.com .\nAbout Nanometrics\nNanometrics is a leading provider of advanced, high-performance process control metrology and inspection systems used primarily in the fabrication of semiconductors and other solid-state devices, including sensors, optoelectronic devices, high-brightness LEDs, discretes and data storage components.
