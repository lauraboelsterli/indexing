    "text": "NORWALK, Conn., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Diageo, a global leader in beverage alcohol, today announced changes to the leadership team of its North American business.\nEd Pilkington, currently Chief Marketing Officer, Diageo Europe, is to be appointed Chief Marketing and Innovation Officer, Diageo North America. Claudia Schubert, currently General Manager, Diageo Continental Europe and Russia, is to be appointed President U.S. Spirits & Canada.\n\"We are delighted to welcome two of Diageo's most talented and experienced senior leaders to North America,\" said Deirdre Mahlan, President, Diageo North America. \"Claudia and Ed have both played critical leadership roles in the recent transformation of our Europe business, and both bring world-class multi-market experience that will help drive their respective functions forward.\"\nPilkington takes the helm of marketing and innovation from James Thompson. During his tenure Thompson has established a strong platform for growth in North America. He has recruited and developed top talent, overseen a step-up in creativity and successfully implemented our refreshed consumer-choice framework. Thompson has decided to return to the U.K. for personal reasons and currently, with no suitable openings within Diageo, has decided to pursue opportunities outside the company.\nPilkington has a long history with Diageo over the course of a 24 year career with the company that has seen him lead its marketing and innovation business in Australia, Latin America and the Caribbean and, prior to his current role, as leader of the company's global vodka, rum and gin category.\nSchubert takes on U.S. Spirits and Canada from Tom Looney. After a 30 year career with the business, Looney has decided to retire. During his time with the business, Looney has been a key contributor to the company's strategy, performance, and navigation of distributor alignment. His work has created stronger execution and focus across the U.S. Spirits commercial function.\nThis marks a return to North America for Schubert, who has spent time in the U.S. and Canada in a number of senior commercial roles, including President, U.S. Control States & Canada. Schubert has most recently led Diageo Continental Europe to strong growth.\n\"Together Thompson and Looney have a combined 53 years with the business, and we are grateful for the significant impact and legacy they leave with us,\" continued Mahlan. \"Their leadership and passion will be missed, and we wish them the very best for the future.\"\nPilkington and Schubert will transition to the North America market over the summer, reporting to Mahlan. Thompson will remain through July 31, 2018, and Looney will remain to support the transition through September 30, 2018.\nAbout Diageo\nDiageo is a global leader in beverage alcohol with an outstanding collection of brands including Johnnie Walker, Crown Royal, Bulleit and Buchanan's whiskies, Smirnoff, Cîroc and Ketel One vodkas, Captain Morgan, Baileys, Don Julio, Tanqueray and Guinness.\nDiageo is listed on both the New York Stock Exchange (DEO) and the London Stock Exchange (DGE) and our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world.
