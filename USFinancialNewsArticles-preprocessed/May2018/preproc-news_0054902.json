(NYSE:APB) (the “Fund”) announced today that the Board of Directors (‘Board’) of the Fund will submit a proposal to stockholders to liquidate the Fund at the Fund’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, unless the Board identifies a viable merger partner by its next Board meeting. The Board has decided to submit the liquidation proposal to stockholders at the request of institutional stockholders.\nThe Board believes that the Asia Pacific region remains a favorable investment opportunity for stockholders. In addition, the Board notes that as of March 31, 2018 (according to information provided by the Fund’s investment adviser and Thomson Reuters), the Fund’s price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples and its yield compared very favorably to its benchmark index, which is the MSCI AC Asia ex-Japan Index:\nFund Benchmark Price to earnings 8.9x 12.5x Price to book 1.2x 1.7x Yield 4.2% 2.2% Accordingly, the Board will recommend that stockholders vote against the liquidation.\nIn the event that Fund stockholders do not vote to liquidate the Fund at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Board commits to re-submit the liquidation proposal at subsequent annual meetings thereafter, to continually give Fund stockholders the opportunity to consider and decide upon the Fund’s future existence.\nFor more information, contact:\nP r i s ti ne Advisers – 1- 888-4-ASIA-PAC (1-888-427-4272) or\nv i a email at at pbaronowski@pristineadvisers.com\nThe Asia Pacific Fund, Inc. is a diversified, closed-end management investment company, organized as a Maryland corporation and is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.\nThe investment objective of the Fund is to achieve long-term capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity securities in the Asia Pacific countries (excluding Japan).
