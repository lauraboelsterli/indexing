    "text": "TOKYO, May 8 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices dipped on Tuesday, weighed by stronger equities, although steady investor demand for new 10-year debt managed to curb the losses.\nThe five-year JGB yield rose 1 basis point to minus 0.105 percent.\nThe 10-year yield was half a basis point higher at 0.045 percent and the 30-year yield climbed 1 basis point to 0.735 percent.\nTuesday’s 2.2 trillion yen ($20.17 billion) 10-year JGB auction attracted demand from investors, with the Bank of Japan expected to conduct a regular debt-purchasing operation on Wednesday focusing on bonds of longer-dated maturities.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, at the 10-year sale rose to 4.20 from 4.16 at the last sale in April.\nJapan’s Nikkei rose 0.4 percent as tech shares rallied.\n$1 = 109.0600 yen Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ",
