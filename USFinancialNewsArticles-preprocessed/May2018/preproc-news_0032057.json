    "text": "EditorsNote: adds “in the bottom of the eighth” in next-to-last graf\nNiko Goodrum hit two homers and drove in five runs, carrying the host Detroit Tigers to a 6-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Monday night.\nGoodrum, a rookie utility player, hit a two-run shot off Cleveland starter Carlos Carrasco and added a three-run blast. Goodrum doubled his homer total for the season.\nJose Iglesias had two hits and a run, and John Hicks scored twice for Detroit, which has won three of its past four. The Tigers had lost their past 11 games to their division rival.\nMike Fiers (4-2) held the Indians to one run on three hits with five strikeouts in six innings.\nThe Tigers placed third baseman Jeimer Candelario on the 10-day disabled list earlier in the day due to left wrist tendinitis. Right fielder Nicholas Castellanos missed his second consecutive game with a finger contusion after being hit by a pitch Saturday.\nCarrasco (5-2), who was 7-1 over the past three seasons against Detroit, allowed three runs on six hits in 6 2/3 innings. Jose Ramirez homered and scored twice for the Indians.\nCleveland center fielder Bradley Zimmer sat for the fourth straight game with a chest injury.\nRamirez put the Indians on the board in the first with his two-out homer to right, his 13th of the year.\nThe first two Tigers batters in the third reached on singles, and Pete Kozma’s one-out grounder brought home Iglesias.\nHicks led off the bottom of the fourth with a double. After a flyout, Goodrum smoked his first long ball of the game over the right-center-field wall.\nCleveland scored an unearned run against Joe Jimenez in the eighth. Ramirez reached on a Dixon Machado error with two outs, and Edwin Encarnacion brought him home with a double to right. Daniel Stumpf came in and retired Yonder Alonso on a short fly to keep the score 3-2.\nGoodrum put the game away with his second homer in the bottom of the eighth. Evan Marshall issued walks to James McCann and Hicks. Following a strikeout, Goodrum crushed a 3-2 pitch from Zach McAllister over the right field fence.\nFrancisco Lindor’s RBI single in the ninth completed the scoring.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
