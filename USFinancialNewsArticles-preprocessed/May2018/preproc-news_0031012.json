Kyle Seager had three hits, scored two runs and knocked in two more, while Nelson Cruz supplied three hits, a run scored and an RBI.\nFelix Hernandez (5-3) lasted the minimum five innings to gain the victory. He allowed five runs on eight hits and struck out seven. Four relievers finished up for Seattle.\nThe Tigers won Game 1 of the doubleheader 4-3. The teams played a straight doubleheader after Friday’s game was postponed.\nJohn Hicks led the Detroit attack with three hits, including a two-run homer. Pete Kozma had two hits, a run scored and two RBIs, while JaCoby Jones scored two runs, including a first-to-home scamper on a single.\nMichael Fulmer (1-3) took the loss. He gave up six runs on five hits in 4 1/3 innings.\nTigers right fielder Nicholas Castellanos was hit in the hand by a pitch in the opening inning and departed the following inning. Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire was ejected in the bottom of the fifth after a dispute with home plate umpire Carlos Torres.\nSeattle took a 1-0 lead in the first on Cruz’s RBI single. The Tigers scored twice in the second on Kozma’s RBI double and Dixon Machado’s run-scoring single.\nHealy put the Mariners in front to stay in the fourth with a two-run shot to left-center. Cano ended Fulmer’s night when he drilled his homer over the right field wall one inning later.\nThe Tigers pulled within a run at 6-5 by scoring three runs in the bottom of the fifth. Hicks crushed his two-run shot, and Kozma added an RBI single.\nSeattle got some breathing room with three runs in the seventh. Seager smoked a double to deep right, plating Cano and Cruz. Healy added an RBI double for the final run of the game.\nThe teams complete the three-game weekend series on Sunday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
