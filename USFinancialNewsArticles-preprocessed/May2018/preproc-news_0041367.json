These statements may be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “forecast,” “estimated” and “intend” or other similar terms or expressions that concern Cesca’s expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. These forward-looking statements are based on Cesca’s current expectations and actual results could differ materially. There are a number of factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, market conditions; the expected use of the net proceeds from the offering; our need for additional financing; our ability to continue as a going concern; uncertainties of government or third party payer reimbursement; dependence on key personnel; substantial competition; uncertainties of patent protection and litigation; dependence upon third parties; regulatory, financial and business risks related to our international expansion and risks related to failure to obtain FDA clearances or approvals and noncompliance with FDA regulations.
