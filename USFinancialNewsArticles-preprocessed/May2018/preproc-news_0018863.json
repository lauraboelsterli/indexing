    "text": "RESTON, Va., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NII Holdings, Inc. [NASDAQ: NIHD] today announced its financial results of 2018. For the quarter, the Company generated consolidated operating revenues of $181 million, a consolidated operating loss of $14 million and consolidated adjusted OIBDA loss of $8 million. The Company's consolidated adjusted OIBDA excludes the impact of non-cash asset impairments, restructuring charges and other unusual items. Capital expenditures were $8 million for the quarter.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Nextel Brazil reported a significant improvement in its 3G/4G subscriber results, with 92,900 net subscriber additions, a 66,100 subscriber increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and the highest level of 3G/4G net adds in over two years. In addition, 3G/4G churn was 2.37%, a 110-basis point decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and the lowest level of 3G/4G churn in over three years. Subscriber migrations from its iDEN network to its 3G/4G network were 34,800, an 11,300 subscriber increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\"We were pleased with our subscriber results this quarter. Through our continuing efforts to provide the best experience to our customers, we were able to further reduce 3G/4G churn to 2.37%, resulting in 93 thousand 3G/4G net adds for the quarter,\" said Roberto Rittes, Chief Executive Officer of Nextel Brazil. \"Many of our key performance indicators continued to improve, including our net promoter score, which, according to our own research, increased to 33 points as of April, tied for the highest level among mobile operators in Brazil. In terms of our financial results, we managed to limit our adjusted OIBDA loss to $8 million . Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on generating healthy subscriber growth on our 3G/4G platform. We expect the shutdown of our iDEN network in the second quarter will have some impact on our results, but we remain on track to meet our guidance for the year.\"\nFor the first quarter, Nextel Brazil's average monthly service revenue per subscriber (ARPU) was $17, cost per gross addition (CPGA) was $77 and cash cost per user (CCPU) was $16.\nAt quarter-end, NII Holdings' sources of funding totaled $297 million, including $187 million of unrestricted cash and short-term investments and $110 million of cash held in escrow to secure indemnification obligations in connection with the sale of Nextel Mexico.\n\"Our first quarter results marked a turning point for us in several ways. We returned to total subscriber growth for the first time in over two years and grew 3G/4G revenues for the first time in four quarters,\" said Dan Freiman, Chief Financial Officer of NII Holdings. \"While growth is important, we are continuing to looks for ways to reduce costs across the Company without impacting our ability to deliver high quality customer service.\"\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company implemented Accounting Standards Codification No. 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which reduced the Company's operating revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses of 2018 by $4 million and $6 million, respectively.\nAdditional details regarding the Company's results, including a more detailed explanation on local currency operating metrics, are included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018 that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.

Consolidated adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization, or adjusted OIBDA, represents consolidated operating income before depreciation expense, amortization expense, material asset impairments, severance costs associated with publicly announced restructuring plans and other material non-recurring or unusual charges. Consolidated OIBDA and consolidated adjusted OIBDA are not measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, may not be similar to consolidated OIBDA and consolidated adjusted OIBDA measures of other companies and should be considered in addition to, but not as substitutes for, the information contained in our statements of operations. We believe that consolidated OIBDA and consolidated adjusted OIBDA provide useful information to investors because they are indicators of our operating performance, especially in a capital intensive industry such as ours, since they exclude items that are not directly attributable to ongoing business operations. Consolidated OIBDA and consolidated adjusted OIBDA can be reconciled to our consolidated statements of operations as follows (in millions):\nNII Holdings, Inc\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nConsolidated operating loss\n$\n(14.5)\n$\n(79.8)\nConsolidated depreciation\n4.8\n8.9\nConsolidated amortization\n3.6\n4.1\nConsolidated operating loss before depreciation\nand amortization\n(6.1)\n(66.8)\nAsset impairment charges\n0.7\n68.3\nRestructuring (benefits) charges\n(2.5)\n3.6\nConsolidated adjusted operating (loss) income\nbefore depreciation and amortization\n$\n(7.9)\n$\n5.1\nAverage Monthly Revenue Per Handset/Unit in Service (ARPU)\nAverage monthly revenue per subscriber unit in service, or ARPU, is an industry term that measures service revenues, which we refer to as subscriber revenues, per period from our customers divided by the weighted average number of subscriber units in commercial service during that period. ARPU is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, may not be similar to ARPU measures of other companies and should be considered in addition, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our statements of operations. We believe that ARPU provides useful information concerning the appeal of our rate plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting and retaining high value customers. Other revenue includes revenues for such services as roaming, handset maintenance, cancellation fees, analog and other. ARPU can be calculated as follows (in millions, except ARPU):\nNextel Brazil\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nUS$\nService and other revenues\n$\n176.0\n$\n243.5\nLess: other revenues\n(6.5)\n(20.4)\nTotal subscriber revenues\n$\n169.5\n$\n223.1\nARPU calculated with subscriber revenues\n$\n17\n$\n21\nARPU calculated with service and other revenues\n$\n18\n$\n22\nNextel Brazil\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nBRL R$\nService and other revenues\n$\n570.4\n$\n765.2\nLess: other revenues\n(20.6)\n(64.2)\nTotal subscriber revenues\n$\n549.8\n$\n701.0\nARPU calculated with subscriber revenues\n$\n56\n$\n65\nARPU calculated with service and other revenues\n$\n59\n$\n71\nCost per Gross Add (CPGA)\nCost per gross add, or CPGA, is an industry term that is calculated by dividing our selling, marketing and handset and accessory subsidy costs, excluding costs unrelated to initial customer acquisition, by our new subscribers during the period, or gross adds. CPGA is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, may not be similar to CPGA measures of other companies and should be considered in addition, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our statements of operations. We believe CPGA is a measure of the relative cost of customer acquisition.

CCPU is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, may not be similar to CCPU measures of other companies and should not be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our statements of operations. We believe CCPU is a measure of the recurring costs we incur on a monthly basis to provide service to our subscribers. The CCPU calculation excludes material asset impairments, severance costs associated with publicly announced restructuring plans and other material non-recurring or unusual charges and is calculated as follows (in thousands, except CCPU):\nNextel Brazil\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nUS$\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n86.6\n$\n127.2\nLess: selling and marketing expenses *\n(21.2)\n(27.2)\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n65.4\n100.0\nCost of service\n88.9\n102.7\nCustomer retention costs and other\n1.9\n1.2\nTotal\n$\n156.2\n$\n203.9\nCash Cost per User\n$\n16\n$\n19\nNextel Brazil\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nBRL R$\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n281.0\n$\n399.6\nLess: selling and marketing expenses *\n(69.0)\n(85.4)\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n212.0\n314.2\nCost of service\n288.4\n322.7\nCustomer retention costs and other\n6.4\n3.7\nTotal\n$\n506.8\n$\n640.6\nCash Cost per User\n$\n52\n$\n59\n* The adoption of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, No. 606, resulted in the capitalization of both direct and indirect commissions beginning on January 1, 2018 compared to the expensing of these types of commissions during the first quarter of 2017, which resulted in a decrease in selling and marketing expenses from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018\nImpact of Foreign Currency Fluctuations\nThe following table shows the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2018 by (i) adjusting the relevant measures for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to levels that would have resulted if the average foreign currency exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were the same as the average foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the three months ended March 31, 2018; and (ii) comparing the actual and adjusted financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the similar financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 to show the percentage change in those measures before and after taking those adjustments into account. The amounts reflected in the following table for operating income before depreciation and amortization on a consolidated basis and segment earnings for Nextel Brazil, before the adjustments for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are based on the calculations contained elsewhere in these non-GAAP reconciliations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The average foreign currency exchange rates for each of the relevant currencies during each of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in the notes to the table below. The information reflected in the following table is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our statements of operations. We believe that these calculations provide useful information concerning our relative performance for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 by removing the impact of the significant difference in the average foreign currency exchange rates in effect for those periods\nNII Holdings, Inc\n(dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n1Q 2017\nActual\n1Q 2017\nAdjustment\n(1)\n1Q 2017\nNormalized\n(1)\n1Q 2018\nActual\n1Q 2017\nto 1Q 2018\nActual B(W)\nGrowth (2)\n1Q 2017\nto 1Q 2018\nNormalized\nB(W) Growth\n(3)\nConsolidated:\nOperating revenues\n$\n250,955\n$\n(8,519)\n$\n242,436\n$\n181,013\n(28)%\n(25)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss)\nbefore depreciation and\namortization\n5,115\n(420)\n4,695\n(7,862)\n(254)%\n(267)%\nNextel Brazil:\nOperating revenues\n$\n250,925\n$\n(8,519)\n$\n242,406\n$\n180,992\n(28)%\n(25)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss)\nbefore depreciation and\namortization\n12,373\n(420)\n11,953\n(3,600)\n(129)%\n(130)%\n(1)\nThe \"1Q 2017 Normalized\" amounts reflect the impact of applying the average foreign currency exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the operating revenues earned in foreign currencies and to the other components of each of the actual financial measures shown above for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
