    "text": "Andrew Evers | @andevers6 Published 12:01 AM ET Sun, 6 May 2018\nIt's time to start planning your vacation to space. Orion Span unveiled plans to launch the first hotel in orbit, called the Aurora Station.\nThe plan is for guests stay 12 days. They can spend their time using VR and live-streaming to friends back on Earth. Guests will be able to experiment with growing food and plants can be taken home as souvenirs.\nThe company says the space hotel is slated to launch in 2021 and will be ready for guests in 2022.\nYou can reserve your spot now for $80,000. The full trip, including the launch, will start at $9.5 million. ",
