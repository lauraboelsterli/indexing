    "text": " A moderate earthquake struck southwestern Mexico on Sunday night, triggering a seismic alarm in Mexico City and sending concerned residents out into the streets.\nThe quake registered 5.6 magnitude, according to a preliminary reading by Mexico’s seismological service, while the U.S. Geological Service later measured it at 5.2 magnitude.\nThere were no immediate reports of damage, according to Mexico’s civil protection agency.\nMexico has suffered a series of more powerful earthquakes in recent months, including two in September that together killed hundreds of people and brought buildings crashing down.\nReporting by Mexico City newsroom; Writing by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Dave Graham\n ",
