Google is set to be featured on CBS News’ “60 minutes” this weekend.\nApplied Materials dropped 8.4 percent after the chip gear maker’s disappointing forecast renewed concerns over slowing smartphone demand.\nThe warning dragged down Philadelphia chipmaker index by 0.9 percent. Intel’s 1.8 percent fall weighed on the market’s three major indexes.\nThe financial index was off 0.44 percent.\nAt 11:21 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 42.81 points, or 0.17 percent, at 24,756.79, kept afloat by Boeing and other industrial stocks.\nThe S&P 500 was down 1.80 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,718.33 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 5.96 points, or 0.08 percent, at 7,376.51.\nCampbell Soup fell 11.1 percent after the company cut its full-year profit forecast and said its chief executive officer decided to step down. Shares of a host of other food companies also declined.\nNordstrom declined 8.9 percent after the upscale department store operator reported same-store sales that missed analysts’ expectations.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.03-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.12-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 3 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 119 new highs and 20 new lows.
