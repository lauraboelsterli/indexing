    "text": "DUBLIN, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Fly Leasing Limited (NYSE: FLY) (\"FLY\"), a global leader in aircraft leasing, today announced its financial results of 2018.\nHighlights\nGrew operating lease rental revenue by more than 12% Net income of $9.6 million, $0.34 per share Adjusted Net Income of $12.4 million, $0.44 per share Acquired one new aircraft on a long-term lease Signed agreements to acquire 55 aircraft\n\"FLY is reporting a solid first quarter based on a substantial increase in operating lease rental revenue,\" said Colm Barrington, FLY's Chief Executive Officer. \"Our quarterly net income of $9.6 million – despite minimal end of lease income and no benefit from aircraft sales – represents the strong growth in our core leasing business. Our earnings of $0.34 per share are more than double the result from the same quarter last year.\"\n\"The acquisition that we announced on February 28 th is proceeding as planned, with AirAsia's extraordinary general meeting scheduled for later this month,\" added Barrington. \"We expect that the initial stage of the transaction will be completed in the second and third quarters of this year. As we acquire these aircraft and deploy our capital over the course of the year, we expect to see FLY generate strong shareholder returns.\"\nFinancial Results\nFLY is reporting net income of $9.6 million, or $0.34 per share, of 2018. This compares to net income of $5.1 million, or $0.16 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income was $12.4 million of 2018, compared to $5.9 million for the same period in the previous year. On a per share basis, Adjusted Net Income was $0.44 in 2018, compared to $0.18 of 2017.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to net income determined in accordance with GAAP is shown below.\nAirAsia Update\nOn February 28, 2018, FLY signed definitive agreements with AirAsia Berhad (\"AAB\") and its subsidiary, Asia Aviation Capital Limited, under which FLY will acquire 54 Airbus narrowbody aircraft and seven CFM engines on lease to AAB and its affiliates, and one Airbus narrowbody aircraft on lease to a third-party airline. In addition, FLY will acquire the option to purchase an additional 20 Airbus A320neo family aircraft, not subject to lease, which begin delivering from the manufacturer as early as 2019. These transactions, taken together, are referred to as the \"AirAsia Transactions.\"\nInitially, FLY will acquire 34 Airbus A320-200 aircraft and seven engines. FLY expects to acquire these aircraft and engines in the second and third quarters of 2018, following the approval of the AirAsia Transactions by AAB's shareholders at their extraordinary general meeting scheduled for May 14, 2018.\nFinancial Position\nAt March 31, 2018, FLY's total assets were $3.6 billion, including investment in flight equipment totaling $3.1 billion. Total cash at March 31, 2018 was $455.9 million, of which $384.3 million was unrestricted. The book value per share at March 31, 2018 was $19.85.\nAircraft Portfolio\nAt March 31, 2018, FLY had 86 aircraft in its portfolio, with leases to 45 airlines in 28 countries. The table below does not include the two B767 aircraft owned by a joint venture in which FLY has a 57% interest.\nPortfolio at\nMar. 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nAirbus A319\n9\n9\nAirbus A320\n13\n12\nAirbus A321\n3\n3\nAirbus A330\n3\n3\nAirbus A340\n2\n2\nBoeing 737\n46\n46\nBoeing 757\n3\n3\nBoeing 777\n2\n2\nBoeing 787\n5\n5\nTotal\n86\n85\nAt March 31, 2018, the average age of the portfolio, weighted by net book value of each aircraft, was 6.5 years.

One aircraft was off-lease at quarter end, which was subsequently delivered to a new lessee in April 2018.

(ii) deferred income taxes; (iii) the fair value changes associated with interest rate derivative contracts that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges; and (iv) non-recurring expenses. The adjustments included within Adjusted Net Income are primarily non-cash or non-recurring items that we consider unrelated to the ongoing performance of our operations. Adjusted Return on Equity is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by average shareholders' equity for each period presented. For periods of less than one year, the resulting return is annualized.\nFLY uses Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Return on Equity, in addition to GAAP net income and earnings per share, to assess our core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. Management believes these measures are helpful in evaluating the operating performance of our ongoing operations and identifying trends in our performance, because they remove the effects of certain non-cash or non-recurring items and certain other items that are not indicative of our overall operating trends. In addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Return on Equity help us compare our performance to our competitors. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net income or other financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. FLY's definitions may be different than those used by other companies.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fly-leasing-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300642417.html\nSOURCE Fly Leasing Limited",
