    "text": "PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa., Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:INO) today announced that it has bolstered its efforts to attract partnerships and collaborations and increase non-dilutive funding with the hiring of an accomplished business development leader and the promotion of a key R&D leader.\nMr. Shawn D. Bridy joins Inovio as Vice President of Business Development reporting to Dr. J. Joseph Kim, President & CEO. Mr. Bridy has more than 20 years of business development & licensing, commercial strategy, and transaction experience in the life sciences industry. He previously held strategic business development roles at large pharma companies and smaller biotechs including GSK, Elan, BTG plc and Immunome. Most recently he was Managing Director of Bridy Advisors, a top-tier strategic and operational advisory company. Mr. Bridy has an MA in Biology and an MBA in Finance from Villanova University.\nInovio has also promoted Dr. Kate E. Broderick, Ph.D., to Vice President, Preclinical Research & Development reporting to Dr. Laurent Humeau, Senior Vice President, R&D. In her new position, Dr. Broderick will continue to spearhead Inovio’s efforts to secure non-dilutive strategic R&D funding opportunities to support the research and clinical testing of Inovio’s candidate vaccines. Dr. Broderick has previously led Inovio’s efforts to receive numerous grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense as well from other government and non-governmental organizations. She recently led Inovio’s efforts to secure a $56 million funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to evaluate DNA vaccine candidates for Lassa fever and MERS through Phase 2 clinical testing. She will also be responsible for the oversight of a diverse preclinical R&D team encompassing discovery and development research, as well as operations, research DNA manufacturing and next-generation device development. She earned her Ph.D. at the University of Glasgow, Scotland.\nDr. Broderick recently participated in World Health Organization (WHO) advisory panel in Geneva on “Product Development & Programmatic Considerations for Nucleic Acid-based Vaccines,” where she highlighted Inovio’s emerging infectious disease vaccine portfolio, which includes the company’s vaccine for Ebola.\nDr. J. Joseph Kim, Inovio’s President & CEO, said, “While we have a strong record of performance in attracting commercial partners such as MedImmune/AstraZeneca, Genentech/Roche and Regeneron and have secured significant non-dilutive funding in the past several years, hiring and promoting these two business and scientific leaders will accelerate and expand those efforts going forward. Kate and Shawn will play important roles in the growth of Inovio as we partner assets and secure funding to support the advancement of Inovio’s immunotherapies and vaccines.”\nAbout Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nInovio is a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of DNA immunotherapies that transform the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. Inovio’s proprietary platform technology, ASPIRE, applies next-generation antigen sequencing and DNA delivery to activate potent immune responses to targeted diseases. The technology functions exclusively in vivo, and has been demonstrated to consistently activate robust and fully functional T cell and antibody responses against targeted cancers and pathogens. Inovio is the only immunotherapy company that has reported generating T cells whose killing capacity correlates with relevant clinical outcomes. Inovio’s most advanced clinical program, VGX-3100, is in Phase 3 for the treatment of HPV-related cervical precancer. Also in development are Phase 2 immuno-oncology programs targeting head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, and glioblastoma, as well as platform development programs in hepatitis B, Zika, Ebola, MERS, and HIV. Partners and collaborators include MedImmune, Regeneron, Roche/Genentech, ApolloBio Corporation, The Wistar Institute, University of Pennsylvania, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, CEPI, DARPA, GeneOne Life Science, Plumbline Life Sciences, Drexel University, NIH, HIV Vaccines Trial Network, National Cancer Institute, U.S. Military HIV Research Program, and Laval University.

Actual events or results may differ from the expectations set forth herein as a result of a number of factors, including uncertainties inherent in pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and product development programs, the availability of funding to support continuing research and studies in an effort to prove safety and efficacy of electroporation technology as a delivery mechanism or develop viable DNA vaccines, our ability to support our pipeline of SynCon® active immunotherapy and vaccine products, the ability of our collaborators to attain development and commercial milestones for products we license and product sales that will enable us to receive future payments and royalties, the adequacy of our capital resources, the availability or potential availability of alternative therapies or treatments for the conditions targeted by us or our collaborators, including alternatives that may be more efficacious or cost effective than any therapy or treatment that we and our collaborators hope to develop, issues involving product liability, issues involving patents and whether they or licenses to them will provide us with meaningful protection from others using the covered technologies, whether such proprietary rights are enforceable or defensible or infringe or allegedly infringe on rights of others or can withstand claims of invalidity and whether we can finance or devote other significant resources that may be necessary to prosecute, protect or defend them, the level of corporate expenditures, assessments of our technology by potential corporate or other partners or collaborators, capital market conditions, the impact of government healthcare proposals and other factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and other regulatory filings we make from time to time. There can be no assurance that any product candidate in our pipeline will be successfully developed, manufactured or commercialized, that final results of clinical trials will be supportive of regulatory approvals required to market licensed products, or that any of the forward-looking information provided herein will be proven accurate.
