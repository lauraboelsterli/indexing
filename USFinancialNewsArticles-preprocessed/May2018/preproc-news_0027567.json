Such voluntary suspension materially and adversely impacted our the first quarter of 2018. We want to re-emphasize that we are one of the two entities approved by the Ministry of Finance in 2012 to provide online lottery sales services on behalf of the China Sports Lottery Administration Center.

Based on the assessment, the Company concluded that there was no change to the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for its current revenue streams in scope of Topic 606 and therefore there was no material changes to the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption of ASC 606.\nNet revenues were RMB38.4 million (US$6.1 million), representing a significant increase of RMB 34.9 million or 997.1% increase from RMB3.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of RMB3.5 million or 10.0% increase from RMB34.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in net revenues was primarily due to RMB32.6 million (EUR4.2 million) in revenue contribution from online lottery betting and online casino in Europe through TMG, which accounted for 84.9% of total net revenues. Net revenues generated from mobile gaming and sports information services were RMB5.8 million, accounting for 15.1% of total net revenues during the first quarter of 2018. Net revenues increased sequentially was mainly attributable to the increase in revenues from TMG.\nThe Company acquired the TMG in July 2017, on a pro forma basis, had the TMG acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, it would have contributed a total net revenue of RMB19.4 million (EUR2.5 million) to the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which would bring the total net revenue of the Company to RMB22.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.

The sequential decrease was mainly due to a decrease in salary expenses of RMB4.1 million for the bonus accrued at the end of the year 2017; a decrease in share-based compensation expenses associated with share options granted to the Company's employees and directors of RMB0.7 million and a decrease in technical fee of RMB0.3 million, which were partially offset by an increase in rental expense for the Company's new office of RMB1.9 million.\nOperating Loss\nOperating loss was RMB76.7 million (US$12.2 million), compared with operating loss of RMB71.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, and operating loss of RMB143.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.\nNon-GAAP operating loss was RMB55.3 million (US$8.8 million), compared with non-GAAP operating loss of RMB42.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, and non-GAAP operating loss of RMB120.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.\nNet Loss Attributable to 500.com\nNet loss attributable to 500.com was RMB58.6 million (US$9.3million), compared with net loss attributable to 500.com of RMB62.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, and net loss attributable to 500.com of RMB129.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.
