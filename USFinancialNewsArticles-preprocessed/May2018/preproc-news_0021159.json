As part of the agreements, JD will help digitalize the brands’ physical stores in China, including integration of online and offline sales channels, warehousing systems and membership programs, leveraging JD’s advanced big data and AI technologies. JD will also provide integrated logistics and targeted marketing solutions to help the brands improve operating efficiency and enhance customer experience. In April, as part of its “Retail as a Service” offering, JD.com leveraged its retail infrastructure to help Swiss luxury watchmaker Audemars Piguet launch its first ever online pop up boutique on the WeChat Mini-Program platform. JD.com offered full technical support, as well as tailored marketing, high-end logistics solutions and other services, to help the brand tap into the Chinese market. In the first quarter, H.Moser&Cie., a top independent Swiss watchmaking brand, launched its first store in China on JD’s direct sales platform. In March, world famous watch brands TAG Heuer, SEIKO and MIDO launched “real-time purchases” on JD’s platform in parallel with the Baselworld Watch and Jewelry Show, enabling consumers to purchase their latest models online during the show. In March, high-end Italian customized men’s wear brand CANALI and British luxury brand Mulberry joined JD.com’s independent online luxury fashion platform TOPLIFE, which brings high-end fashion and luxury items from around the globe directly to Chinese consumers and provides a curated, premium online shopping experience. Since its launch in 2017, TOPLIFE has attracted prominent international luxury brands including Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Derek Lam, as well as La Perla, Rimowa (LVMH), B&O Play, Trussardi and DYSON, among others. In March, JD.com officially launched “JD Umbrella,” an evaluation and incentive system designed to help home appliance brands optimize customer service levels on the JD platform thereby enhancing overall user experience. By monitoring service levels throughout the entire shopping process, from pre-sale to after-sale, the system provides service quality rankings of home appliance brands to help customers make purchasing decisions. The system also allows JD to incentivize its internal home appliance customer service representatives based on customer ratings. During the first quarter, JD.com expanded its premium “Expedited Delivery” service including two-hour delivery for small and medium sized packages and three-hour delivery for large items, with coverage of more than 50 major cities and approximately 1,000 counties and districts in China. Additionally, JD Logistics launched a new premium logistics service with China Railway Corporation, leveraging domestic high-speed trains for secure, long-distance transportation of high-end goods and JD’s Luxury Express, a premium delivery service for luxury products, for last mile delivery. The combination creates a seamless network allowing customers to enjoy same-day delivery for high-end goods originating from non-local warehouses.\nAs of April 30, 2018, JD.com’s joint venture, New Dada, had partnered with 192 Walmart stores and 424 Yonghui stores, among numerous other supermarkets and grocery stores, to provide a premium online fresh grocery shopping experience with one-hour home delivery service. New Dada is the largest crowdsourcing logistics provider and O2O grocery platform in China. During the first quarter, JD expanded its leadership position in fulfillment capabilities among China’s e-commerce companies. As of March 31, 2018, JD.com operated 515 warehouses covering an aggregate gross floor area of 10.9 million square meters in China. JD.com had approximately 170,000 merchants on its online marketplace as of April 30, 2018, and a total of 163,543 full-time employees as of March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet Revenues.

For the first quarter of 2018, free cash flow from continuing operations of the company was as follows:\nFor the three months ended March 31 , 2017 March 31, 2018 March 31, 2018 RMB RMB USD (In thousands) Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities from continuing operations 5,888,136 (3,772,925 ) (601,493 ) Add/(less): Impact from JD Finance related credit products included in the operating cash flow 395,296 (1,279,454 ) (203,975 ) Less: Capital expenditures Land use rights and construction in progress (383,373 ) (1,319,319 ) (210,330 ) Other CAPEX (280,008 ) (2,446,739 ) (390,068 ) Free cash flow 5,620,051 (8,818,437 ) (1,405,866 ) Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was RMB3.8 billion during the quarter, largely due to an RMB5.3 billion decrease in advance from customers for their marketplace purchases and payable to merchants related to a complex settlement process change that the company has been conducting since the second half of last year to settle the marketplace transactions directly through third party payment companies, as required by the regulators. The operating cash flow was also impacted by the timing of supplier payments as accounts payable decreased as of March 31, 2018 from the prior year-end. Such timing difference may vary from time to time.\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was RMB0.9 billion (US$0.2 billion) for the first quarter of 2018, consisting primarily of increases in short-term investments of RMB3.4 billion, cash paid for capital expenditures of RMB3.8 billion, increases in investment in equity investees of RMB1.4 billion, offset by decreases in loans to JD Finance of RMB6.1 billion.\nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was RMB13.3 billion (US$2.1 billion) for the first quarter of 2018, consisting primarily of proceeds from JD Logistics financing, partially offset by repayment of nonrecourse securitization debt.\nFor working capital turnover days, see table under “Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics.”\nRecent Development\nJD Logistics Financing\nAs of March 31, 2018, JD Logistics, the logistics subsidiary of the company has substantially completed its financing with a total amount of approximately $2.55 billion, representing 19% of the ownership of JD Logistics on a fully diluted basis. The company remains as the majority shareholder of JD Logistics upon completion of the transaction. This financing round enables JD Logistics to further enhance its smart supply chain network and support both JD.com's e-commerce business and logistic needs across a wide range of industries.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance\nNet revenues for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be between RMB120 billion and RMB124 billion, representing a growth rate between 29% and 33% compared with the second quarter of 2017, excluding the impact from JD Finance for the 2017 period. This forecast reflects JD.com’s current and preliminary expectation, which is subject to change.\nConference Call\nJD.com’s management will hold a conference call at 7:30 am, Eastern Time on May 8, 2018, (7:30 pm, Beijing/Hong Kong Time on May 8, 2018) to discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results.\nListeners may access the call by dialing the following numbers:\nUS Toll Free: +1-845-675-0437 or +1-866-519-4004 Hong Kong +852-3018-6771 or 800-906-601 Mainland China 400-6208-038 or 800-8190-121 International +65-6713-5090 Passcode: 6989367\nA telephone replay will be available from 11:30 am, Eastern Time on May 8, 2018 through 09:59 am, Eastern Time on May 16, 2018.

Its cutting-edge retail infrastructure enables consumers to buy whatever they want, whenever and wherever they want it.

JD.com is the largest retailer in China, a member of the NASDAQ100 and a Fortune Global 500 company.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn evaluating the business, the company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net margin, free cash flow, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) per weighted average number of shares and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The company defines non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations as income/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, revenue from business cooperation arrangements with equity investees and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The company defines non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, revenue from business cooperation arrangements with equity investees, gain on disposals of business, preferred shares redemption value accretion, income from non-compete agreement, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, net income attributable to mezzanine classified non-controlling interest shareholders, fair value change of long-term investments, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments. The company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow adding back the impact from JD Finance related credit products included in the operating cash flow and less capital expenditures, which include purchase of property, equipment and software, cash paid for construction in progress, purchase of intangible assets and land use rights. The company defines non-GAAP EBITDA as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions.\nThe company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP EBITDA reflect the company’s ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from JD Finance related credit products included in the operating cash flow and the demands that the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform has placed on financial resources. The company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the company's core operating results and business outlook.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the company’s operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The company encourages you to review the company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nCONTACTS:\nInvestor Relations\nRuiyu Li\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n+86 (10) 8912-6805\nIR@JD.com\nMedia\nJosh Gartner\nVP, International Corporate Affairs\nPress@JD.com\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis announcement contains .

JD Finance continues to perform the credit risk assessment services for the JD Baitiao business and purchase the over-due receivables from the company at carrying value to absorb the risks and obtain the rewards from JD Baitiao business. The company also assisted JD Finance in various ABS to raise funds to support the JD Baitiao business. JD Finance acts as the servicer of the ABS and also subscribes to the subordinate tranche. Due to the company’s continuing involvement right in ABS under the historical arrangement prior to October 2017, the company was not able to derecognize the related Baitiao receivables through the legacy ABS under U.S. GAAP. Beginning October 2017, the company revised certain structural arrangements for the issuance of ABS to relinquish its continuing involvement right, and has been able to derecognize certain Baitiao receivables through the new ABS plan. As a result, the balances of Baitiao receivables are expected to decrease gradually in the future with the adoption of the new ABS plan, and nonrecourse securitization debt balance will gradually decrease upon the settlement of the legacy ABS plan.
