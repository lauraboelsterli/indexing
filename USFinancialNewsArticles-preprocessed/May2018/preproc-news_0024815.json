    "text": "ATLANTA, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Luvu Brands, Inc., (OTCQB:LUVU), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of a portfolio of consumer lifestyle brands today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nOperating highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nNet sales increased 6% to $4.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to $4.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. The increase was driven by a $298,000 (75%) increase in the sales of Avana products and $139,000 (21%) increase in Jaxx products and was partially offset by a $131,000 decrease in sales of purchased products. Total gross profit decreased 5% to $1.28 million, as compared to $1.35 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease was due to higher labor and raw material costs. Income from operations increased to $251,000 from $240,000 reported in the prior year third quarter. EBITDA, as adjusted, for the third quarter was $301,000, as compared to $302,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating highlights for the nine months ended March 31, 2018:\nNet sales decreased 6% to $12.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $13.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. This decrease was due to a $1.9 million decrease in the sales of Tenga products and was partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in sales of the Company’s Jaxx and Avana products. Jaxx sales increased 26% from the prior year to $2.7 million and Avana sales increased 56% from the prior year first half to $1.7 million. Total gross profit decreased 7% to $3.6 million, as compared to $3.9 million for the comparable prior-year period. Income from operations was $473,000 during the nine months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $737,000 for the comparable prior-year period. EBITDA, as adjusted, for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 declined to $642,000, as compared to $914,000 in the comparable period of fiscal 2017.\nLouis Friedman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We continue to be pleased with the rapid growth in sales of our Jaxx and Avana product lines. Our high-quality products are resonating with consumers and the products reviews are extremely positive. During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we manufactured and shipped over 20,000 Jaxx products and almost 21,000 Avana products. We expect to see continued growth from both of these brands during the remainder of calendar 2018 and into 2019. For Liberator products, we’re expanding our international distribution into South Korea, Japan, India, China and Russia with new customers in all of these countries.”\nLUVU BRANDS, INC.

In addition to the Company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. While Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance in accordance with GAAP, management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the Company's operating results. The table below provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAs used herein, Adjusted EBITDA income represents net income before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense.\nReconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA income for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n(Dollars in thousands) Nine months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 79 $ 334 Plus interest expense, net 394 402 Plus depreciation and amortization expense 151 157 Plus stock-based compensation 18 21 Adjusted EBITDA income $ 642 $ 914 Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this press release may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
