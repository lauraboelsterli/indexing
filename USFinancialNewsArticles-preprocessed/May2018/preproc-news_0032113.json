    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PAVmed Inc. (Nasdaq: PAVM, PAVMW) ) (“PAVmed”), a highly differentiated, multiproduct medical device company, announced today that its board of directors approved a reduction to the exercise price of its Series Z Warrants (CUSIP number 70387R122) (the “Series Z Warrants”) that trade under the symbol “PAVMZ” on the Nasdaq Capital Market from $3.00 per share to $1.60 per share. Before this reduction takes effect, notice must first be provided to the current holders of Series Z Warrants. The effective date of the exercise price reduction will be June 1, 2018.\nAbout PAVmed\nPAVmed Inc. is a highly differentiated, multiproduct medical device company employing a unique business model designed to advance innovative products to commercialization much more rapidly and with significantly less capital than the typical medical device company.

PAVmed’s diversified pipeline of products address unmet clinical needs encompassing a broad spectrum of clinical areas with attractive regulatory pathways and market opportunities. Its three lead products provide groundbreaking approaches to carpal tunnel syndrome (CarpX™), precancerous conditions of the esophagus (EsoCheck), vascular access (PortIO™) and pediatric ear infections (DisappEAR™). The company is also developing innovative products in other areas, such as medical infusions and tissue ablation, while seeking to further expand its pipeline through engagements with clinician innovators and leading academic medical centers.

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements, based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the Company’s management, are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause such differences include, among other things, the Company’s ability to complete the offering; volatility in the price of the Company’s common stock; the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the cost and time required advance our products to regulatory submission; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from our preclinical studies; whether and when our products are cleared by regulatory authorities; market acceptance of our products once cleared and commercialized; our ability to raise additional funding and other competitive developments. PAVmed has not yet received clearance from the FDA or other regulatory body to market any of its products. New risks and uncertainties may arise from time to time and are difficult to predict. All of these factors are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of them are beyond our control. For a further list and description of these and other important risks and uncertainties that may affect our future operations, see Part I, Item IA, “Risk Factors,” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the same may be updated in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in any Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed by us after our most recent Annual Report. We disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which those expectations may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180515005608/en/\nInvestors\nLHA Investor Relations\nKim Sutton Golodetz, (212) 838-3777\nkgolodetz@lhai.com\nor\nMedia\nPAVmed Inc.\n(212) 949-4319\ninfo@pavmed.com\nSource: PAVmed Inc.",
