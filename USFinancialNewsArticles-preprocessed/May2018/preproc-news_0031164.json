Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses and gains that are not reflective of our ongoing operating results. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets - We are required to amortize the intangible assets, included in our GAAP financial statements, related to the through the acquisition of Beijer Electronics, Inc. in 2014. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization are unique to this transaction. The amortization of acquired intangible assets are non-cash charges. We believe that such changes do not reflect our operational performance. Therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-transaction operating results. Amortization of note discount - These expenses are non-cash and are related to amortization of discount of the note purchase agreements with YA II PN, or YA II. Such expenses do not reflect our on-going operations. Stock-based compensation – Stock based compensation consists of share based awards granted to certain individuals. They are non-cash and affected by our historical stock prices which are irrelevant to forward-looking analyses and are not necessarily linked to our operational performance.\nThe following table reconciles, for the periods presented, GAAP net loss attributable to Micronet Enertec to non-GAAP net loss attributable to Micronet Enertec and GAAP loss per diluted share attributable to Micronet Enertec to non-GAAP net gain (loss) per diluted share attributable to Micronet Enertec:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n(Dollars in\nThousands, other\nthan share and per\nshare amounts)\n2018\n2017\nGAAP net loss from continued operation attributable to Micronet Enertec\n$\n(961)\n$\n(1,017)\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n111\n132\nStock-based compensation and shares issued to service providers\n88\n33\nAmortization of note discount\n37\n-\nIncome tax-effect of above non-GAAP adjustments\n-\n(1)\nTotal Non-GAAP net loss from continued operation\n$\n(725)\n$\n(853)\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/micronet-enertec-reports-financial-results-for-the-1st-quarter-of-2018-300648424.html\nSOURCE Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc.",
