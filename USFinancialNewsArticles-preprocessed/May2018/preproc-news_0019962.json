    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- B. Riley Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:RILY), a diversified provider of financial and business advisory services, reported results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenues increased to $95.8 million from $52.9 million in Q1 2017 Net income of $4.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA increased to $16.1 million from $15.0 million in Q1 2017 Adjusted net income of $8.8 million or $0.32 per diluted share Declares special dividend of $0.04 per share in addition to regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share Provides Q2 2018 net income in the range of $5.4 million to $10.0 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $22 million to $30 million\n“Our first quarter performance was driven by strong results in the auction and liquidation business, offset by modest results in our capital markets business. Looking ahead, we believe the robust activity we’re seeing in these episodic business units will be the primary drivers of our second quarter results, in addition to the continued steady performance from our other business segments. While we do not typically provide guidance, we feel it is important to highlight the current strength in our business to our shareholders,” said Bryant Riley, Chairman and CEO, B. Riley Financial. “As we continue to find opportunities across our liquidation, appraisal, brokerage and principal investing platforms, the utilization and continued enhancement of our balance sheet will continue to play a critical role in providing value to our company and shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased to $95.8 million from $52.9 million for the same year-ago period, primarily driven by an increase in revenues related to services and fees associated with the company’s acquisitions of FBR & Co. and Wunderlich Securities, Inc. in 2017.\nCapital Markets Segment: Revenues totaled $60.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $17.7 million in the same year-ago period. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to revenues generated from services and fees associated with the company’s acquisitions of FBR & Co. and Wunderlich Securities, Inc. in 2017. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 include $52.8 million generated from services and fees, and $7.6 million generated from interest income by the securities lending business. Segment loss was $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to segment income of $6.6 million in the same year-ago period. Auction and Liquidation Segment: Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $15.5 million from $14.0 million in the same year-ago period. The year-over-year increase was driven by services and fees generated from the completion of a large retail liquidation engagement during the first quarter of 2018. Segment income generated $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, which represents a significant increase when compared to $1.8 million in the same year-ago period. Valuation and Appraisal Segment: Revenues increased to $8.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $7.8 million in the same year-ago period. Segment income generated totaled $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.0 million in the same year-ago period. Principal Investments – United Online Segment: Revenues, primarily driven by services and fees, and partially by the sale of goods, totaled $11.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. This compares to $13.4 million in the same year-ago period. Segment income totaled $4.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $4.2 million in the same year-ago period.\nThe company recorded $4.5 million in net income for the first quarter of 2018 or $0.17 per diluted share. This compares to $14.0 million in net income or $0.71 per diluted share in the same year-ago period.\nAdjusted net income (excluding the impact of share-based payments, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, transaction costs, tax impact of aforementioned adjustments, and certain tax items) totaled $8.8 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018. This compares to $7.7 million in adjusted net income or $0.39 in the same year-ago period. (See “Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term.)\nAdjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring costs, transaction costs, and share-based compensation) for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $16.1 million. This compares to $15.0 million in adjusted EBITDA in the same year-ago period. (See “Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term.)\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had $74.3 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $23.4 million in restricted cash, $47.9 million due from clearing brokers, $131.1 million in net securities and other investments owned (at fair value), and $212.8 million in total debt. Total stockholders’ equity was $271.5 million as of March 31, 2018.\nGuidance for Second Quarter 2018\nB. Riley Financial is providing guidance estimates for net income in the range of $5.4 million to $10.0 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $22 million to $30 million for the second quarter of 2018. (See “Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term.) These ranges reflect the expected impact of increased activity in the Capital Markets and Auction and Liquidation segments which have the potential to drive larger fee opportunities.\nDeclaration of Dividend\nOn May 7, 2018, B. Riley Financial’s board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share and a special dividend of $0.04 per share which will be paid on or about June 5, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 21, 2018.\nConference Call\nB.

Riley Financial, Inc. undertakes no duty to update this information.\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain of the information set forth herein, including adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA, may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. B. Riley Financial believes this information is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the company's available capital resources, the operating performance of its business and its cash flow, excluding net interest expense, provisions for or benefit from income taxes, depreciation, amortization, transaction expenses, restructuring costs, and stock-based compensation that would normally be included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). In addition, the company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in evaluating the company's operating performance, capital resources and cash flow. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-financial measures as reported by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. The non-GAAP measures are described above and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements portion of this release under the headings “Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation,” \"Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\" and “Forecasted Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation.”\nInvestor Contact\nInvestor Relations\nB.
