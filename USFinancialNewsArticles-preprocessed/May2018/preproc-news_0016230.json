    "text": "Sales of $97.3 million, up 20% Net income up 17% to $11.9 million; non-GAAP net income grew 18% to $13.6 million, impacted by supply chain constraints Adjusted EBITDA of $23.3 million, 24.0% of sales Raising 2018 revenue guidance to $490 million to $505 million, maintaining adjusted operating margin guidance of 22.7% to 24% Updated guidance includes Faster Group since April 5, 2018 acquisition\nSARASOTA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sun Hydraulics Corporation (NASDAQ: SNHY) (“Sun” or the “Company”), a global industrial technology leader that develops and manufactures solutions for both the hydraulics and electronics markets, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nWolfgang Dangel, Sun's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We’re off to a solid start in 2018, with our first quarter results generally in line with our internal expectations. The order environment continues to be strong for both our Hydraulics and Electronics segments in all of our geographic markets globally, especially Asia-Pacific.”\nHe continued, “From an operational perspective, we are working hard to maintain our Hydraulics segment’s best-in-industry lead times and improve the efficiency of our Electronics segment’s new production processes. As expected, some costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as inefficiencies caused by supply chain constraints pressured margins in the first quarter of 2018, and will continue into the second quarter but to a lesser degree. We are already realizing efficiency improvements as a result of new long-term agreements that we negotiated with our largest U.S. CVT (cartridge valve technology) component suppliers. Further, our lean enterprise initiative is guiding process improvements to achieve our expected profitability levels.\n“As previously announced, we closed on the acquisition of Faster Group in early April. A global leader in hydraulic couplings, Faster performed well in its first quarter of 2018, from both a topline and operational perspective. We anticipate that momentum will continue as we progress in 2018. Additionally, we are already beginning our integration activities. We held our first working session last week, with collaboration among our existing CVT and Electronics sales teams, along with Faster’s sales team. We have confidence that our acquisition synergies and organic investments are driving market share gains, leading us toward our Vision 2025 goals,” Mr. Dangel added.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Consolidated Results\n($ in millions, except per share data) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Change % Change Net sales $ 97.3 $ 81.4 $ 15.9 20 % Gross profit $ 37.6 $ 32.8 $ 4.8 15 % Gross margin 38.7 % 40.3 % Operating income $ 17.3 $ 15.8 $ 1.5 9 % Operating margin 17.7 % 19.4 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin 21.1 % 24.6 % Net income $ 11.9 $ 10.2 $ 1.7 17 % Diluted EPS $ 0.40 $ 0.38 $ 0.02 5 % Non-GAAP adjusted net income $ 13.6 $ 11.5 $ 2.1 18 % Non-GAAP adjusted EPS $ 0.46 $ 0.43 $ 0.03 6 % Sales in the 2018 first quarter grew by $15.9 million, or 20% over the same period last year. Demand remained strong with revenue growth in all of the Company’s geographic regions. Sales to the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific (“APAC”) grew 19%, 11% and 32%, respectively. In addition to strong market environments, sales growth also resulted from returns on our investments in global sales and marketing initiatives and new products. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted consolidated sales by approximately $2.4 million.\nWhile sales growth drove increases in gross profit and operating income, gross margin and operating margin were unfavorably impacted by supply chain constraints, higher material costs and other operational costs that began in the fourth quarter of 2017. These are explained further below in the segment reviews. The prior year gross profit included a $1.8 million charge for amortization of an inventory valuation adjustment associated with the Enovation Controls acquisition.\nOperating income in the first quarter of 2018 includes $1.2 million for acquisition and financing-related expenses and $0.1 million for restructuring charges. Those items, as well as $2.0 million of amortization of intangibles have been added back to arrive at non-GAAP adjusted operating margin of 21.1% shown in the table above. This is down from 24.6% in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the supply chain constraints, higher material costs and other operational costs noted above. See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Sun’s use of non-GAAP adjusted operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating margin as well as a reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP adjusted operating income.\nNet interest expense was $0.5 million, a decrease of 23% from the prior-year period due to lower outstanding debt during the 2018 quarter, upon application of stock offering proceeds in February.\nSun incurred a $0.5 million net foreign currency transaction loss associated with locking the Faster Group purchase price in euros, unfavorably impacting results in the first quarter of 2018. The Company also recorded a $0.4 million charge associated with interest on the change in fair value of contingent consideration associated with the Enovation Controls acquisition. Neither of those charges impacted 2017 first quarter results.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a lower effective tax rate in the 2018 first quarter, at 25.1%, compared with 32.6% in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income was $11.9 million, or $0.40 per share in the first quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income was $13.6 million, or $0.46 per share, compared with $11.5 million, or $0.43 per share, in the prior-year first quarter. See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Sun’s use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS as well as a reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income.\nFirst Quarter Adjusted EBITDA ($ in millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Change % Change Adjusted EBITDA $ 23.3 $ 22.8 $ 0.5 2 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 24.0 % 28.1 % First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA (consolidated net income before net interest expense/income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain unusual charges) was $23.3 million, or 24.0% of sales.\nSun believes that, when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales), which are non-GAAP measures, help in the understanding of its operating performance. See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Sun’s use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as well as a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nHydraulics Segment Review\n(Refer to sales by geographic region and segment data in accompanying tables)\nSegment sales of $62.6 million grew 15.7% over the prior-year first quarter. Growth was driven by increased demand in all geographic and end markets, and also positively impacted by global sales and marketing initiatives. APAC and EMEA showed particular strength, up 35% and 15%, respectively.\n“We are still seeing record levels of order intake in our hydraulics business,” stated Dangel. First quarter operating and gross margins were lower, primarily due to significant customer demand which led to constraints in our supply chain, inefficiencies in production and material cost increases. To offset material cost impacts, the segment has announced a price increase that is effective July 1. Sun has negotiated long-term agreements with its key suppliers and is already seeing improved component deliveries thereby reducing supply chain constraints in the second quarter. Sun also continues to make operational improvements, expecting its overall efficiency will increase in the second quarter and thereafter.\nHigher SEA (selling, engineering and administrative) expenses and R&D (research and development) expenses in the 2018 quarter are due to planned investments in the Company’s strategic growth initiatives.\nFirst quarter operating income decreased $0.3 million to $13.4 million. Operating margin declined to 21.5%, compared with last year’s 25.4%.\nElectronics Segment Review\n(refer to sales by geographic region and segment data in accompanying tables)\nSegment sales were $34.7 million for the first quarter, an increase of 27.5% over the first quarter of last year. Growth was driven by increased demand in power controls and recreational vehicle end markets. Proactive sales initiatives and increased demand for new products developed in the past year also contributed to the 2018 growth.\n“Our electronics business continues to grow significantly even after having already grown 33% in 2017,” commented Dangel. Improved productivity in the first quarter partially offset higher material and freight costs resulting in lower gross and operating margins. The segment is currently in negotiations with key suppliers in order to secure steady supply at the best possible cost. Further, the segment is progressing on its operational improvements, expecting those costs will be lower in the second quarter and thereafter.\nHigher SEA and R&D expenses in the 2018 quarter are due to planned investments in the Company’s strategic growth initiatives.\nFirst quarter operating income grew $0.9 million, or 14%, to $7.1 million. However, operating margin declined to 20.5% from 22.9% in the prior-year period.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Review\nTotal debt was $0.9 million at March 31, 2018, down from $116.0 million at December 30, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 were $198.5 million, compared with $63.9 million at the end of 2017.\nThe Company received $240 million in net proceeds from its public equity offering completed during the quarter, a portion of which was used to pay down its then outstanding debt. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company used approximately $533 million of cash and debt to complete its acquisition of the Faster Group on April 5.\nCash provided by operations was $14.7 million and $12.4 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 18% increase was primarily due to higher net income.\nCapital expenditures were $4.2 million and $0.8 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily for costs associated with the ongoing construction of the Company’s new production facility in South Korea.\n2018 Outlook and Guidance\nMr. Dangel stated, “Given our ongoing strong order rates, we are increasing our organic revenue growth expectations as well as adding Faster Group to our guidance for 2018. Additionally, we remain confident in the consolidated operating margin guidance range previously provided, which will drive incremental EPS growth and enhance shareholder value.”\nThe following summarizes the Company’s increased expectations for 2018, including Faster since its April 5 acquisition, compared with previously provided guidance:\nPrevious Updated 2018 Guidance 2018 Guidance Consolidated revenue $370 - $385 million $490 - $505 million Hydraulics segment revenue $250 - $258 million $368 - $378 million Electronics segment revenue $120 - $127 million $122 - $127 million Consolidated operating margin (1) 22.7% - 24.0% (1) 22.7% - 24.0% (1) Consolidated interest expense $0.1 - $0.2 million $10.5 - $12.0 million Effective tax rate 24.5% - 26.5% 24.5% - 26.5% Capital expenditures $15 - $20 million $20 - $25 million Depreciation $11.5 - $12.5 million $14.5 - $15.5 million Amortization $8 - $9 million $20 - $21 million (1) Operating margin is non-GAAP, before acquisition-related amortization of intangibles and one-time costs Mr. Dangel concluded, “We remain focused on our number one priority, which is our growing global customer base. To that end, we are working diligently to improve our operational performance to continue to deliver high quality products and service in the most efficient manner, improving our profitability. We remain steadfast in our quest to reach critical mass of $1 billion of revenue by 2025, while maintaining our superior profitability and financial strength.”\nWebcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to review its financial and operating results, and discuss its corporate strategies and outlook.

Nevertheless, Sun Hydraulics believes that providing non-GAAP information such as adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are important for investors and other readers of Sun Hydraulics’ financial statements, as they are used as analytical indicators by Sun Hydraulics’ management to better understand operating performance. Because adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are non-GAAP measures and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, as presented, may not be directly comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507006068/en/\nKei Advisors LLC\nKaren L.
