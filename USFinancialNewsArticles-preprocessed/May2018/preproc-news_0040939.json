    "text": "HOUSTON, May 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- McDermott International, Inc. (\"McDermott\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:MDR) today announced that, in connection with its combination with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. (\"CB&I\"), the Dutch dividend withholding tax obligation incurred in connection with the liquidation of Comet I B.V., a company organized under the laws of the Netherlands as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CB&I, has been satisfied by a payment finalized on May 17, 2018.\nAs previously announced, the consideration provided to former shareholders of CB&I who did not validly tender in McDermott's exchange offer is subject to a Dutch dividend withholding tax. As part of the overall business combination transaction, those shareholders became shareholders of CB&I Newco and became entitled to receive, in connection with the liquidation of CB&I Newco, the same consideration offered in the exchange offer (i.e. 0.82407 shares of McDermott common stock for each share of CB&I common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares), subject to reduction by the Dutch dividend withholding tax.\nBased on final computations made as of May 10, 2018, taking into account the number of shares of CB&I common stock not tendered in the exchange offer, the average paid-up capital of CB&I recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes with respect to such shares (approximately $319 million), the Euros/Dollars exchange rate in effect at the time of the tax payment and other applicable amounts, the aggregate amount of applicable Dutch dividend withholding tax was approximately $40.8 million. The liquidator of Comet I B.V. caused payment obligations with respect to such tax to be satisfied by directing the exchange agent to (1) sell shares of McDermott common stock that were previously deposited with the exchange agent in an amount necessary to fund the payment of the aggregate Dutch dividend withholding tax and (2) remit the proceeds of such sale to the Dutch tax authorities, all as contemplated by McDermott's previously filed Registration Statement on Form S-4, the related exchange offer prospectus and various other related documents that were circulated to CB&I stockholders in connection with the exchange offer. Accordingly, the exchange agent sold approximately 1.9 million shares of McDermott common stock at an average price of $21.44 per share and remitted the proceeds to the relevant Dutch tax authority. As a result, approximately 27.7 million shares of McDermott common stock remained to be distributed to the former shareholders of CB&I who did not validly tender in McDermott's exchange offer, and, after giving effect to the payment of the Dutch dividend withholding tax, those holders are entitled to receive 0.771059 shares of McDermott common stock, and cash in lieu of fractional shares, in respect of each former share of CB&I common stock. The final distribution of those shares is being effected today.\nAbout McDermott\nMcDermott is a premier, fully integrated provider of technology, engineering and construction solutions to the energy industry.
