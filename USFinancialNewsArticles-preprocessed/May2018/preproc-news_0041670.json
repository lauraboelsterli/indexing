    "text": "LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Britainâ€™s leading software company Micro Focus International said the signing of a $40 million licensing deal meant its six-month revenues would not fall by quite as much as originally feared.\nThe group, which lost its CEO in March when it announced a major profit warning, said it expected revenue to be better than management guidance of minus 9 to minus 12 percent on a constant currency basis.\nIt reiterated its revenue guidance for the full year.\nReporting by Kate Holton; editing by Sarah Young\n ",
