FILE PHOTO: A 777X banner is pictured above the 777 Wing Horizontal Build Line at Boeing's production facility in Everett, Washington, U.S. June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Redmond/File Photo\nThe design, which will be incorporated in the world’s largest commercial planemaker’s Model 777-8 and 777-9 models, would allow the bigger wings to fit into the standard-sized airport parking space.\nThe feature will help reduce the wingspan to 212 feet from 235 feet when folded during ground operations.\nTwin-engine, long-haul aircraft seating around 350 to 410 passengers is seen as the industry’s next big battle with both Boeing and rival Airbus ( AIR.PA ) competing for a potential market of several thousand.
