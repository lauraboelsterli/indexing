    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AristaMD , provider of the Smart Care Platform that connects primary care providers with specialists to deliver more timely access to care, is pleased to welcome Adam Darkins to its growing team. Darkins brings more than 22 years of experience in working to develop large telehealth networks, re-engineer clinical services and support organizational change management in healthcare systems. Darkins will serve as chief strategy officer, where he will help lead strategic initiatives and large-scale deployments for the company as it continues to rapidly expand its U.S. footprint.\n\"The need for innovative solutions to solve our country's worsening healthcare access problem has never been greater,\" said Brooke LeVasseur, CEO of AristaMD. \"There is strong market demand for eConsult solutions, and Adam's leadership and experience with large-scale telehealth implementations will support our efforts as we rapidly expand across the country.\nPrior to joining AristaMD, Darkins is known for spearheading one of the industry's longest running and largest leading platforms to date – the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) telehealth platform. From May 1999 to June 2003, Darkins worked collaboratively with clinical, technology and business stakeholders to develop models for home telehealth, clinical video telehealth and store-and-forward telehealth in preparation for national implementation throughout the U.S., U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.\nBetween 2003 and 2014, Darkins led the development and sustainment of telehealth services at the Department of Veteran Affairs. Since Darkins' implementation, over 600,000 patients received telehealth services through 1.7 million episodes of care annually. By 2014, VHA telehealth services grew by over 30 percent per year.\nDarkins also served as co-author of the book, \" Telemedicine and Telehealth: Principles, Policies, Performance and Pitfalls.\" The book gives background knowledge and useful tips on starting up and managing programs in an array of settings. Most importantly, the book is based on the recognition that patients are customers of healthcare and telemedicine companies developing new products vital to delivering care to rural or inaccessible clients is vital to health care's future.\n\"Introducing a new care delivery model can be complicated – but Adam brings a wealth of experience deploying telehealth solutions in diverse settings and understands what it takes to successfully deploy solutions that meet the unique needs of the diverse regions and clinics we serve.\" continues LeVasseur. \"He will be instrumental in leading strategic initiatives and large- scale deployments for the company as we continue to meet the demand for our platform.\"\nFor additional information about Adam Darkins and AristaMD, please visit: www.aristamd.com .\nAbout AristaMD\nAristaMD develops solutions to improve patient outcomes through quicker access to care.
