    "text": "GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- National Storage Affiliates Trust (“NSA” or the \"Company\") (NYSE: NSA) today reported the Company’s first quarter 2018 results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet income was $12.0 million for 2018, an increase of $4.8 million compared to $7.2 million for 2017. Core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") was $25.9 million, or $0.32 per share, for 2018, an increase of 10.3% per share compared to $21.3 million, or $0.29 per share, for 2017. Same store net operating income (\"NOI\") was $40.9 million for 2018, an increase of 4.4% compared to $39.2 million for 2017, driven by a 4.2% increase in same store total revenues and a 3.9% increase in same store property operating expenses. Acquired 25 wholly-owned self storage properties for $135.8 million and one joint venture property for $9.5 million during 2018.\nArlen Nordhagen, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, commented, \"We are very pleased that our combination of same store organic improvement plus strong external growth is continuing to drive double digit increases in Core FFO per share. Our same store performance for the quarter was right on budget, and we acquired another 25 wholly-owned properties during the quarter, making this our strongest first quarter acquisition pace on record. Despite the increased headwinds of new supply in several markets, our unique growth strategy has allowed us to benefit from both the fragmentation and the fundamental strengths of the self storage industry. We remain focused on our commitment to creating long-term shareholder value through the continued execution of our differentiated strategy.\"\nFinancial Results\n($ in thousands, except per share and unit data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Growth Net income $ 11,973 $ 7,181 66.7 % Funds From Operations (\"FFO\") (1) $ 25,678 $ 21,155 21.4 % Add back acquisition costs and NSA's share of unconsolidated real estate venture acquisition costs 180 163 10.4 % Core FFO (1) $ 25,858 $ 21,318 21.3 % Earnings (loss) per share - basic $ 0.16 $ 0.01 1,500.0 % Earnings (loss) per share - diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.01 800.0 % FFO per share and unit (1) $ 0.31 $ 0.29 6.9 % Core FFO per share and unit (1) $ 0.32 $ 0.29 10.3 % (1) Non-GAAP financial measures, including FFO, Core FFO and NOI, are defined in the Glossary in the supplemental financial information and, where appropriate, reconciliations of these measures and other non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Schedules to this press release and in the supplemental financial information. First quarter 2018 net income increased $4.8 million, driven primarily by incremental NOI generated from 85 self storage properties acquired between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018 and same store NOI growth, partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization and interest expense.\nFirst quarter 2018 basic earnings per share increased $0.15 per share and diluted earnings per share increased $0.08 per share. In addition to the items affecting net income described above, the comparison of earnings per share amounts between periods is affected by the allocation of net income to noncontrolling interests pursuant to GAAP. Additional information on NSA's allocation of net income (loss) can be found in the Glossary to the supplemental financial information under \"Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value Method.\"\nFirst quarter 2018 FFO per share increased 6.9% and Core FFO per share increased 10.3%. The increases in FFO and Core FFO were primarily the result of $7.5 million of incremental NOI from 85 self storage properties acquired between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018 and same store NOI growth of $1.7 million, partially offset by higher interest expense and the payment of dividends on preferred shares issued during the fourth quarter of 2017 to fund the Company's growth.\nTotal Consolidated Portfolio Operating Results\n($ in thousands, except per square foot data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Growth Total rental and other property-related revenue $ 74,332 $ 59,725 24.5 %\nProperty operating expenses 25,226 19,749 27.7 %\nNet Operating Income (NOI) $ 49,106 $ 39,976 22.8 %\nAverage Occupancy 87.2 % 88.3 % (1.1 )%\nAverage Annualized Rental Revenue Per Occupied Square Foot $ 11.87 $ 11.36 4.5 %\nFirst quarter 2018 total rental and other property-related revenue increased 24.5%, driven by $12.4 million of incremental revenues from 85 self storage properties acquired between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018 and a $2.5 million increase in same store total revenues.\nFirst quarter 2018 total property operating expenses increased 27.7% resulting from $4.8 million of incremental property operating expenses generated by 85 self storage properties acquired between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018, and an increase of $0.8 million in same store property operating expenses.\nTotal consolidated portfolio NOI was $49.1 million for 2018, an increase of 22.8% compared to NOI of $40.0 million for 2017.\nNSA's consolidated portfolio included 468 self storage properties, approximately 28.5 million rentable square feet, with period-end occupancy of 87.8% as of March 31, 2018.\nSame Store Operating Results (376 Properties)\n($ in thousands, except per square foot data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Growth Total rental and other property-related revenue $ 60,866 $ 58,403 4.2 %\nProperty operating expenses 19,990 19,231 3.9 %\nNet Operating Income (NOI) $ 40,876 $ 39,172 4.4 %\nNOI Margin 67.2 % 67.1 % 0.1 %\nAverage Occupancy 88.1 % 88.5 % (0.4 )% Average Annualized Rental Revenue Per Occupied Square Foot $ 11.75 $ 11.25 4.4 %\nYear-over-year, first quarter 2018 same store total revenues increased 4.2%, driven primarily by a 4.4% increase in average annualized rental revenue per occupied square foot partially offset by a 40 basis point decrease in average occupancy. Same store property operating expenses were $20.0 million for 2018, an increase of 3.9% compared to $19.2 million for 2017 driven primarily by increases in property taxes, personnel costs and advertising.\nTamara Fischer, Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"We were very pleased with customer demand during the first quarter, and especially the strong pace of move-in activity toward quarter-end. Our same store revenues came in slightly above plan, but some operating expenses were higher than forecast, so first quarter same store NOI was right in line with our expectations.\"\nInvestment Activity\nDuring 2018, NSA invested $135.8 million in the acquisition of 25 consolidated self storage properties located in six states, encompassing approximately 1.4 million rentable square feet configured in approximately 12,000 storage units. Consideration for these acquisitions included approximately $105.1 million of net cash, the assumption of $8.3 million of mortgages and other working capital liabilities and OP equity of approximately $22.4 million. The OP equity included the issuance of $8.1 million of NSA's 6.000% Series A-1 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the \"Series A-1 Preferred Units\") in NSA's operating partnership which have a stated value of $25.00 per unit and receive cumulative distributions at an annual rate of 6.000%.\nNSA's unconsolidated real estate venture invested $9.5 million in the acquisition of one self storage property located in New Jersey, encompassing approximately 0.1 million rentable square feet configured in approximately 500 storage units. NSA owns a 25% interest in its unconsolidated real estate venture and contributed approximately $2.4 million to the venture to fund the acquisition.\nBalance Sheet\nOn January 29, 2018, NSA entered into an increase agreement and amendment with a syndicated group of lenders to increase the total borrowing capacity under the Company's credit facility by $125.0 million for a total credit facility of over $1.0 billion, which included entry into a new $125.0 million five-year term loan tranche D. NSA has an expansion option under the credit facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for a total credit facility of $1.3 billion.\nCommon Share Dividends\nOn February 22, 2018, NSA's Board of Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per common share, which was paid on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2018.\n2018 Guidance\nNSA reaffirms its previously provided guidance estimates for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nThe full text of this earnings release and supplemental financial information, including certain financial information referenced in this release, are available on NSA's website at http://ir.nationalstorageaffiliates.com/quarterly-reporting and as exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on May 2, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures & Glossary\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented because NSA's management believes these measures help investors understand NSA's business, performance and ability to earn and distribute cash to its shareholders by providing perspectives not immediately apparent from net income (loss).

In addition, NSA's method of calculating these measures may be different from methods used by other companies, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures as calculated by other companies that do not use the same methodology as NSA. These measures, and other words and phrases used herein, are defined in the Glossary in the supplemental financial information and, where appropriate, reconciliations of these measures and other non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Schedules to this press release and in the supplemental financial information.\nQuarterly Teleconference and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call at 1:00pm Eastern Time on Thursday, May 3, 2018 to discuss its financial results.

Subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units may also, under certain circumstances, be convertible into or exchangeable for common shares (or other units that are convertible into or exchangeable for common shares). See footnote(3) for additional discussion of subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units in the calculation of FFO and Core FFO per share and unit.\nReconciliation of Earnings (Loss) Per Share - Diluted to FFO and Core FFO Per Share and Unit (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts) (unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Earnings (loss) per share - diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.01 Impact of the difference in weighted average number of shares (3) 0.02 (0.01 ) Impact of GAAP accounting for noncontrolling interests, two-class method and treasury stock method (4) — 0.09 Add real estate depreciation and amortization 0.26 0.25 Add Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture real estate depreciation and amortization 0.02 0.03 Subtract gain on sale of self storage properties (0.01 ) — FFO attributable to subordinated performance unitholders (0.07 ) (0.08 ) FFO per share and unit 0.31 0.29 Add acquisition costs and Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture acquisition costs 0.01 — Core FFO per share and unit $ 0.32 $ 0.29 (3)\nAdjustment accounts for the difference between the weighted average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share and the weighted average number of shares used to calculate FFO and Core FFO per share and unit. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method for the company's restricted common shares and the treasury stock method for certain unvested LTIP units, and assumes the conversion of vested LTIP units into OP units on a one-for-one basis and the hypothetical conversion of subordinated performance units, and DownREIT subordinated performance units into OP units, even though such units may only be convertible into OP units (i) after a lock-out period and (ii) upon certain events or conditions. For additional information about the conversion of subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units into OP units, see Note 10 to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The computation of weighted average shares and units for FFO and Core FFO per share and unit includes all restricted common shares and LTIP units that participate in distributions and excludes all subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units because their effect has been accounted for through the allocation of FFO to the related unitholders based on distributions declared.\n(4)\nRepresents the effect of adjusting the numerator to consolidated net income (loss) prior to GAAP allocations for noncontrolling interests, after deducting preferred share and unit distributions, and before the application of the two-class method and treasury stock method, as described in footnote(3).\nNet Operating Income (dollars in thousands) (unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 11,973 $ 7,181 (Subtract) add: Management fees and other revenue (2,161 ) (1,838 ) General and administrative expenses 8,306 7,181 Depreciation and amortization 21,368 18,683 Interest expense 9,635 7,471 Equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate venture 52 785 Acquisition costs 180 144 Income tax expense 143 317 Gain on sale of self storage properties (474 ) — Non-operating expense 84 52 Net Operating Income $ 49,106 $ 39,976 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (dollars in thousands) (unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 11,973 $ 7,181 Add: Depreciation and amortization 21,368 18,683 Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture depreciation and amortization 1,377 1,872 Interest expense 9,635 7,471 Income tax expense 143 317 EBITDA 44,496 35,524 Add (subtract): Acquisition costs 180 144 Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture acquisition costs — 19 Gain on sale of self storage properties (474 ) — Equity-based compensation expense (1) 867 983 Adjusted EBITDA $ 45,069 $ 36,670 (1)\nEquity-based compensation expense is a non-cash item that is included in general and administrative expenses in NSA's consolidated statements of operations.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006500/en/\nNational Storage Affiliates Trust\nMarti Dowling, 720-630-2624\nDirector - Investor Relations\nmdowling@nsareit.net\nSource: National Storage Affiliates Trust",
