    "text": "AIRPORT CITY, Israel, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SodaStream International Ltd. (NASDAQ: SODA), the leading manufacturer of home beverage carbonation systems, announced today its results for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nRevenue increased 24.6% to $143.6 million, compared to $115.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 Operating income increased 34.4% to $21.3 million, compared to $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 Net income increased 26.0% to $18.6 million, compared to $14.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 23.1% to $0.81 compared to $0.66 in the first quarter of 2017\n\"There were several positive takeaways from our start to the year,\" commented Daniel Birnbaum, Chief Executive Officer of SodaStream. \"We delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, expanded gross margins by 250 basis points, and posted a significant increase in profitability. These strong year-over-year results were fueled by an acceleration in our Americas' business led by the U.S. and Canada, our 25 th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Germany, continued meaningful progress in Asia-Pacific and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The first quarter was also highlighted by the launch of our new distribution model in France, which we are confident will accelerate our household penetration in this large market going forward. The change in France created a difficult first quarter comparison for sparkling water maker sales as we transitioned the business from distributor to direct selling. Excluding France, global sparkling water units were up 9% year-over-year. Importantly, our global active user base continues to increase with gas refill units up 9% to 8.3 million -- also a first quarter record -- and flavor units returning to growth, increasing 4%. We are very excited by our current momentum and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the many global growth opportunities that still lie ahead and continue creating value for our shareholders.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Review\nGeographical Revenue Breakdown\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIn millions USD\n%\nWestern Europe\n$\n70.0\n$\n85.3\n$\n15.3\n21.8\n%\nThe Americas\n25.6\n35.5\n9.9\n39.0\n%\nAsia-Pacific\n12.2\n15.6\n3.4\n28.3\n%\nCentral & Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa\n7.5\n7.2\n(0.3)\n(4.7)\n%\nTotal\n$\n115.3\n$\n143.6\n$\n28.3\n24.6\n%\nProduct Segment Revenue Breakdown\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIn millions USD\n%\nSparkling Water Maker Starter Kits\n$\n40.6\n$\n49.9\n$\n9.3\n23.1\n%\nConsumables\n72.0\n91.7\n19.7\n27.4\n%\nOther\n2.7\n2.0\n(0.7)\n(27.4)\n%\nTotal\n$\n115.3\n$\n143.6\n$\n28.3\n24.6\n%\nProduct Segment Unit Breakdown\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIn thousands\n%\nSparkling Water Maker Starter Kits\n770\n758\n(12)\n(1.6)\n%\nCO2 Refills\n7,602\n8,272\n670\n8.8\n%\nFlavors\n5,203\n5,432\n229\n4.4\n%\nRevenue increased $28.3 million, or 24.6%, to $143.6 million compared to $115.3 million in the same period in 2017 driven by growth in most of the Company's geographic regions, primarily Germany, U.S., Canada and Australia. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates (\"FX\") positively impacted revenue by approximately $12.0 million, mainly driven by the strengthening of the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate.\nGross margin increased 250 basis points to 55.2% compared to 52.7% for the same period in 2017. Gross margin was positively impacted by leveraging of our fixed infrastructure on higher revenue, the positive FX impact and changes in product mix, partially offset by an adverse impact on cost of revenue from the strengthening of the Israeli shekel against the U.S. Dollar. The net FX impact on gross profit was approximately $8.0 million.\nSales and marketing expenses were $43.3 million, or 30.2% of revenue, compared to $34.8 million, or 30.2% of revenue, in the same period in 2017, including the additional expenses associated with our new distribution model in France. Advertising and promotion expenses increased by $4.1 million to $20.5 million, or 14.2% of revenue, compared to $16.4 million, or 14.2% of revenue, in the same period in 2017. Sales team, distribution and logistics expenses were $22.8 million, or 15.9% of revenue, compared to $18.4 million, or 16.0% of revenue, in the same period in 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million to $14.6 million, or 10.2% of revenue, compared to $10.0 million, or 8.7% of revenue, in the same period in 2017. The increase was mainly due to higher share-based payment expense, additional expenses associated with the new French distribution model and the impact from FX.\nOperating income increased 34.4% to $21.3 million, or 14.8% of revenue, compared to $15.9 million, or 13.8% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. The net positive FX impact on operating income was approximately $3.0 million.\nNet financial expense was $0.5 million compared to net financial income of $1.1 million in the same period in 2017.\nTax expense was $2.3 million with an effective tax rate of 11.0%, compared to $2.2 million with an effective tax rate of 12.9% in the same period in 2017.\nNet income was $18.6 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, based on 22.8 million weighted shares outstanding compared to net income of $14.7 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, based on 22.3 million weighted shares outstanding in the same period in 2017.\nBalance Sheet Review\nCash and financial investments at March 31, 2018 decreased $7.0 million to $148.2 million from $155.2 million at December 31, 2017 mainly due to the acquisition of the French distributor for $21.9 million in February 2018.\nCash flow from operations less investing activities, excluding the acquisition of the Company's French distributor, financial investments and bank deposits, was $7.1 million compared to $29.3 million in the same period in 2017.\nWorking capital increased 21.5% to $160.6 million compared to $132.3 million at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased 22.4% to $118.8 million compared to $97.1 million at December 31, 2017, primarily reflecting additional inventory associated with the acquisition of the French distributor's inventory and the Company's strong top-line growth.\nGuidance\nFor 2018, the Company currently expects full year revenue to increase approximately 15% over 2017 revenue, up from its previous guidance of approximately 12%.\nOperating income for 2018 is expected to increase approximately 15% over 2017 operating income, compared to previous guidance of approximately 10%.\nDiluted earnings per share is now expected to increase approximately 8% over 2017. This compares to the previous guidance for diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 5%.\nThis guidance currently projects an increase in share-based payment expense of approximately $12.0 million over 2017, up from previous guidance of approximately $9.0 million.\nConference Call and Management Commentary\nA supplemental slide presentation has been furnished as part of today's report of a foreign private issuer on a Form 6-K and will be posted on the Company's website at http://sodastream.investorroom.com .\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (U.S. time) today (Wednesday, May 2, 2018) to review the Company's financial results.

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, other components of financial expense (income), income tax, depreciation and amortization. Non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for the IFRS results. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most closely comparable IFRS measure, is included at the end of this press release.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, as described above, should be considered in evaluating the Company's operations. This measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting financial expenses (income), net), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates) and the age and depreciation charges and amortization of fixed and intangible assets, respectively (affecting relative depreciation and amortization expense, respectively). Non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for the IFRS results. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, the most closely comparable IFRS measure, is included at the end of this press release. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this press release, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way that these measures are calculated.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
