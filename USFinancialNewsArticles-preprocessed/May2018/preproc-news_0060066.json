    "text": "BERLIN, May 30 (Reuters) - The German economy could grow more slowly than forecast due to political confusion in Italy - which could turn into an economic disaster - Germany’s Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said on Wednesday.\nEarlier on Wednesday the DIHK lowered its 2018 growth forecast for the German economy to 2.2 percent from its previous estimate of 2.7 percent, citing widespread uncertainty but said this forecast did not take account of developments in Italy.
