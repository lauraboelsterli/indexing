Most of its industrial estates are located in EEC provinces where investors qualify for incentives.\nWHA expects revenue growth to be higher in 2019, she said.\nThe company, which also operates an industrial estate in Vietnam, is studying expansion in Myanmar, the CEO said, as it was an “interesting” market due to its large population.\nAnother growth driver is the burgeoning e-commerce market. “E-commerce is dependent on logistics,” Jareeporn said, adding that WHA plans to invest 6.6 billion baht ($208.3 million) this year in logistics and new technologies to increase efficiency and distribution for customers.\nChinese tech giant Alibaba announced a $320 million investment in the EEC last month. Alibaba’s Lazada is the most popular e-commerce platform in Thailand followed by Tencent-backed Sea Group’s Shopee.\nWHA also plans an “e-commerce park” in the EEC to support logistic and distribution needs of these new businesses, CEO Jareeporn said.\nIn January, WHA signed a warehouse and logistics agreement with JD Central, a $500 million joint venture between China’s second largest e-commerce firm, JD.com Inc, and Thailand’s top retailer Central Group .\nCentral Group and WHA are venture partners in other commercial warehouses projects. This does not limit their business opportunities with e-commerce players, Jareeporn said, but declined to name any.\nWHA’s energy arm, WHA Utilities and Power Pcl (WHAUP) , is considering the use of blockchain technology to trade electricity within its industrial estates, Jareeporn said.\nWHAUP plans to set up water management in Myanmar and is considering investment in Japanese solar farms, she said.
