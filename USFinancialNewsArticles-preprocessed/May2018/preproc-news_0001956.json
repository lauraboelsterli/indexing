    "text": "SPOKANE, Wash., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avista Corp. (NYSE:AVA) today reported net income attributable to Avista Corp. shareholders of $54.9 million, or $0.83 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $62.1 million, or $0.96 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017.\n\"We had a good first quarter, with Avista Utilities' earnings that benefited from lower than expected resource costs, resulting from higher than normal hydroelectric generation and lower natural gas fuel prices. Also, customer growth contributed additional retail revenues and we had lower than expected operating expenses,\" said Scott Morris, chairman and chief executive officer of Avista Corp.\n\"The lower natural gas fuel prices were positive for the Company and our customers as the lower prices allowed us to file additional Purchased Gas Cost Adjustments to pass on the lower costs to our customers during the winter heating season.\n\"With regards to regulatory matters, last week we received an order from the Washington Commission that concluded our 2017 electric and natural gas general rate cases. The Commission's order allows us the opportunity to earn a fair return in 2018 and provides cost recovery for a portion of the capital projects in our request that are now serving our customers. We're also pleased to be able to return to our customers benefits resulting from the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through their rates.\n\"As we look ahead, we will consider the appropriate approach for future cost recovery. Right now we will stay focused on the current matters before the Commission. As these are resolved, we will engage with the Commission, Staff and other parties in an effort to better align expectations regarding our ongoing capital investments prior to filing future general rate cases.\n\"We have made significant progress in the Hydro One transaction and we are continuing to work through the approval processes. During 2018, we have been able to reach settlement agreements in Washington, Idaho and Alaska, which are now pending before these state commissions. We also received antitrust clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act and we received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Hydro One and Avista Corp. believe that we will be able to work with the commissions, their staff and other parties to receive the required approvals, and we anticipate the transaction closing during the second half of 2018.\n\"Alaska Electric Light and Power Company (AEL&P) had a good first quarter with earnings that were slightly above our expectations.\n\"We had net losses at our other businesses due to an impairment on an investment, unanticipated losses on our equity investments and increased expenses associated with a renovation.\n“We are initiating our 2018 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $1.90 to $2.10 per diluted share, excluding acquisition costs,” Morris said.\nSummary Results: Avista Corp.’s results for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands, except per-share data):\nFirst Quarter 2018 2017 Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment: Avista Utilities $ 55,540 $ 58,439 AEL&P 3,772 3,853 Other (4,422 ) (176 ) Total net income attributable to Avista Corp. shareholders $ 54,890 $ 62,116 Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share by Business Segment: Avista Utilities $ 0.84 $ 0.90 AEL&P 0.06 0.06 Other (0.07 ) — Total earnings per diluted share attributable to Avista Corp. shareholders $ 0.83 $ 0.96 The table below presents the change in net income attributable to Avista Corp. shareholders and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, as well as the various factors that caused such change (dollars in thousands, except per-share data):\nFirst Quarter Net Income (a) Earnings per Share 2017 consolidated earnings $ 62,116 $ 0.96 Changes in net income and diluted earnings per share: Avista Utilities Electric gross margin (including intracompany) (b) (7,123 ) (0.10 ) Natural gas gross margin (including intracompany) (c) (4,942 ) (0.08 ) Other operating expenses (d) (3,690 ) (0.06 ) Acquisition costs (e) (567 ) (0.01 ) Depreciation and amortization (f) (2,100 ) (0.03 ) Interest expense (g) (986 ) (0.01 ) Other (h) 1,275 0.02 Effective income tax rate (i) 15,234 0.23 Dilution on earnings n/a (0.02 ) Total Avista Utilities (2,899 ) (0.06 ) AEL&P earnings (81 ) — Other businesses earnings (j) (4,246 ) (0.07 ) 2018 consolidated earnings $ 54,890 $ 0.83 Analysis of 2018 Consolidated Earnings\n(a) The tax impact of each line item, except acquisition costs, was calculated using Avista Corp.'s statutory tax rate (federal and state combined) of 23.05 percent. See items (e) and (i) below for further discussion of the acquisition costs and our effective tax rate. (b) Electric gross margin (operating revenues less resource costs) decreased for the first quarter, primarily due to the following: A decrease in electric revenue due to the accrual of refunds to customers related to the federal income tax law changes that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. As our customers' rates continue to have the 35 percent corporate tax rate built in from prior general rate cases, we have deferred the impact of the change beginning January 1, 2018. There is no impact to our net income as there was a corresponding decrease in income tax expense;\nThe decrease above was partially offset by an increase in retail electric rates due to a general rate increase in Idaho; Customer growth, which contributed additional retail electric revenue in the first quarter of 2018; and An increase in gross margin from optimization activities during the quarter, which helped increase the pre-tax benefit under the Energy Recovery Mechanism (ERM) in Washington from a $4.1 million pre-tax benefit for the first quarter of 2017 to a $4.9 million pre-tax benefit for the first quarter of 2018.\n(c) Natural gas gross margin (operating revenues less resource costs) decreased for the first quarter primarily due to the following: A decrease in natural gas revenue due to the accrual of refunds to customers related to the federal income tax law changes; The above decrease was partially offset by general rate increases in Idaho and Oregon; and Customer growth, which contributed additional retail natural gas revenue in the first quarter of 2018.\n(d) Other operating expenses for the first quarter 2018 increased as a result of an increase in generation, transmission and distribution operating costs and compensation costs. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in pension and other postretirement benefit costs. (e) Acquisition costs were $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 pre-tax, which are not being passed through to customers. However, a portion of the acquisition costs, which reduce income before income taxes, are not deductible for tax purposes and thus do not reduce income tax expense. (f) Depreciation and amortization increased for the first quarter 2018 due to additions to utility plant. (g) Interest expense increased for the first quarter 2018 due to additional outstanding debt during 2018 as compared to 2017 and partially due to an increase in the overall interest rate. (h) Other for the first quarter 2018 decreased primarily due to a decrease in revenue-related taxes. (i) Our effective tax rate was 16.3 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 34.9 percent for the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate decreased during 2018 due to federal income tax law changes which were enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017, which lowered the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. In addition, there were reductions to the effective tax rate in 2018 due to plant excess deferred income taxes being amortized. (j) Losses at our other businesses for the first quarter 2018 were due to increased expenses at one of our subsidiaries associated with the insolvency of the general contractor on a renovation project. The general contractor's insolvency resulted in the recording of a liability to various subcontractors. In addition, we recognized an impairment loss on one equity investment and our portion of net losses from our other equity investments, which were larger in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Non-GAAP) Financial Measures\nThe tables above and below include electric gross margin and natural gas gross margin, two financial measures that are considered “non-GAAP financial measures.” Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included (or excluded) in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The presentation of electric gross margin and natural gas gross margin for Avista Utilities is intended to supplement an investor's understanding of Avista Utilities' operating performance. We use these measures to determine whether the appropriate amount of revenue is being collected from customers to allow for the recovery of energy resource costs and operating costs, as well as to analyze how changes in loads (due to weather, economic or other conditions), rates, supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations. We present electric and natural gas gross margin separately since each business has different cost sources, cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions. These measures are not intended to replace income from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. The calculations of electric and natural gas gross margins are presented below.\nThe following table presents Avista Utilities' operating revenues, resource costs and resulting gross margin (pre-tax and after-tax) for the three months ended March 31 (dollars in thousands):\nOperating Revenues Resource Costs Gross Margin (Pre-Tax) Income Taxes (a) Gross Margin (Net of Tax) For the three months ended March 31, 2018: Electric $ 262,477 $ 98,890 $ 163,587 $ 37,707 $ 125,880 Natural Gas 143,448 69,946 73,502 16,942 56,560 Less: Intracompany (17,171 ) (17,171 ) — — — Total $ 388,754 $ 151,665 $ 237,089 $ 54,649 $ 182,440 For the three months ended March 31, 2017: Electric $ 263,718 $ 90,875 $ 172,843 $ 39,840 $ 133,003 Natural Gas 170,212 90,287 79,925 18,423 61,502 Less: Intracompany (18,549 ) (18,549 ) — — — Total $ 415,381 $ 162,613 $ 252,768 $ 58,263 $ 194,505\n(a) Income taxes were calculated using Avista Corp.'s statutory tax rate (federal and state combined) of 23.05 percent. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have a $400.0 million committed line of credit that expires in April 2021. As of March 31, 2018, we had $314.6 million of available liquidity under this line of credit. We also had $25.0 million of available liquidity under AEL&P's committed line of credit that expires in November 2019.\nAvista Utilities' capital expenditures were $81.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and we expect Avista Utilities' capital expenditures to total about $405.0 million in 2018. AEL&P's capital expenditures were $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and we expect AEL&P's capital expenditures to total about $7.0 million in 2018.\nDuring 2018, we expect to issue approximately $375.0 million of long-term debt and up to $85.0 million of equity in order to refinance maturing long-term debt, fund planned capital expenditures, maintain an appropriate capital structure and for other general corporate purposes. The $85.0 million of equity in 2018 may come through the sale of shares through our sales agency agreements or from an equity contribution from Hydro One after consummation of the acquisition or from a combination of those sources.\n2018 Earnings Guidance and Outlook\nAvista Corp. is initiating its 2018 guidance for consolidated earnings to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.10 per diluted share, excluding acquisition costs. We expect acquisition costs to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.85 per diluted share in 2018.\nWe expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of $1.89 to $2.03 per diluted share for 2018, excluding acquisition costs. The midpoint of our Avista Utilities' guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the ERM. Our current expectation for the ERM is a benefit position within the 90 percent customer/10 percent Company sharing band, which is expected to add approximately $0.07 per diluted share. Our outlook for Avista Utilities assumes, among other variables, normal precipitation, temperatures and above normal hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year.\nFor 2018, we expect AEL&P to contribute in the range of $0.10 to $0.14 per diluted share. Our outlook for AEL&P assumes, among other variables, normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year.\nWe expect the other businesses to be between a loss of $0.09 and a loss of $0.07 per diluted share, which includes costs associated with exploring strategic opportunities.\nOur guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual items such as settlement transactions or acquisitions/dispositions until the effects are known and certain.\nNOTE: We will host a conference call with financial analysts and investors on May 2, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. EDT to discuss this news release.

entering into or growth of non-regulated activities may increase earnings volatility; failure to complete the proposed acquisition of the Company by Hydro One, which would negatively impact the market price of Avista Corp.'s common stock and could result in termination fees that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows; changes in environmental laws, regulations, decisions and policies, including present and potential environmental remediation costs and our compliance with these matters; the potential effects of initiatives, legislation or administrative rulemaking at the federal, state or local levels, including possible effects on our generating resources of restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate concerns over global climate changes; political pressures or regulatory practices that could constrain or place additional cost burdens on our distribution systems through accelerated adoption of distributed generation or electric-powered transportation or on our energy supply sources, such as campaigns to halt coal-fired power generation and opposition to other thermal generation, wind turbines or hydroelectric facilities; wholesale and retail competition including alternative energy sources, growth in customer-owned power resource technologies that displace utility-supplied energy or that may be sold back to the utility, and alternative energy suppliers and delivery arrangements; failure to identify changes in legislation, taxation and regulatory issues which are detrimental or beneficial to our overall business; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and its intended and unintended consequences on financial results and future cash flows, including the potential impact to credit ratings, which may affect our ability to borrow funds or increase the cost of borrowing in the future;
