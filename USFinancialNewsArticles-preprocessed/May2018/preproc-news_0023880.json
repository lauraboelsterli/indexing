    "text": "NEWARK, N.Y., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IEC Electronics Corp. (NYSE American:IEC) today announced results for the fiscal 2018 second quarter ended March 30, 2018.\nIEC reported revenues of $31.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 49% as compared to revenues of $21.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 15.1% as compared to 10.7% in the same quarter last year. Selling and administrative expenses increased on a dollar basis to $2.9 million but decreased as a percentage of sales to 9.2%, as compared to $2.7 million or 12.5% of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company reported net income of $1.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, or $0.15 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.6 million, or a loss of $0.06 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nRevenues for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased 25% to $52.9 million as compared to $42.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 11.9% as compared to 9.6% in the first six months of fiscal 2017. Selling and administrative expenses increased on a dollar basis to $5.7 million but decreased as a percentage of sales to 10.8%, as compared to $5.1 million or 12.0% of sales in the first six months of fiscal 2017. Net income for the first six months of 2018 was $1.1 million, or $0.11 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.5 million, or a loss of $0.14 per share, in the same prior year period.\nJeffrey T. Schlarbaum, President and CEO of IEC Electronics commented, “We’re pleased to have delivered strong second quarter results, characterized by significant revenue growth, gross margin improvement and a return to profitability. As expected, our conversion of backlog to sales improved during the quarter, including the shift of several program deliveries from the first quarter to the second quarter. Importantly, our sales pipeline and backlog continue to grow as a result of our ability to generate new program activity from existing customers and to attract new customers. This success can be attributed to our focus on improving our operations and project execution, as well as to our sales team’s ability to target the right customers for our skill set.\n“We continue to encounter global supply chain challenges related to component shortages, and remain actively involved with our supply chain partners to minimize any impact on our ability to assemble and ship products for our customers. As we’ve previously discussed, our new program onboarding process can be lengthy and complex, but we have a skilled and experienced team in place to ensure we do everything within our control to support our customers. We are energized by our second quarter performance and optimistic about the remainder of 2018 given the opportunities presented by our robust sales pipeline and growing backlog.”\nMr. Schlarbaum continued, “Our balance sheet remains strong, providing a solid foundation for our growth as we further our positon as a leading provider of electronic manufacturing solutions for life-saving and mission critical products. To continue to support this growth, we recently amended our credit facility with M&T Bank which increases the Company’s Revolving Credit Commitment from $16 million to $22 million. This is an exciting time for IEC as we look forward to driving the momentum we saw in the second quarter.”\nConference Call:\nIEC will host a conference call, today, Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its financial results for the fiscal 2018 second quarter.\nThe conference call may be accessed in the U.S. and Canada by dialing toll-free (877) 407-9210.
