    "text": "Published: May 14, 2018 10:50 a.m. ET Share\nNew Jersey ruling seen having far-reaching consequences\nBy Getty Images Atlantic City will now be able to offer sports betting alongside casino games.\nWASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday opened the door for states to allow betting on sporting events, invalidating a federal law that prohibited such wagers in most of the U.S.\nThe court, in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, sided with a challenge brought by the state of New Jersey, which has waged a six-year battle to allow sports betting within its borders.\nThe state has been unable to do so because of the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, a federal law that says states can’t “sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize” sports gambling.\nBets on individual sporting events now takes place only in Nevada, whose long wagering history allowed it to be grandfathered into the federal law.
