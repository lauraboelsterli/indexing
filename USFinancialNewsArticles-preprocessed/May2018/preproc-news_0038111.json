I plowed through my jammed door and exit my Jeep on my own. I’m truly blessed that God protected me through this accident. Without his favor I don’t know if I would’ve survived.\n“I’m thankful to only came out with minor injuries and a few scrapes and bruises. Thank you to the Parker Police and South Metro Fire Rescue in Parker for getting to me asap, attending all my needs and transporting me to the hospital safely. Thank you to the doctors at Parker Adventist for treating me as a first class patient also. I’m very grateful and humbled to be alive.\n“My family and I thanks everyone who has prayed for me over the last few days. My thoughts and prayers are with the other victims and I hope they all are safe and doing well. In the mean time I’m rehabbing and getting my body ready to participate in OTAs next week. Thanks everyone again!!! Jeremiah 29:11”\nAccording to police in Parker, Colo., the stolen vehicle was driven by a 36-year-old woman, Rainbow Sunset Espinoza.\nEspinoza was booked on multiple charges, including reckless driving, DUI, aggravated motor vehicle theft, vehicular eluding and assault with a deadly weapon.\nEspinoza hit multiple cars during the pursuit, causing four people to be transported to hospitals.\nHenderson had seven carries for 13 yards as a rookie last season.
