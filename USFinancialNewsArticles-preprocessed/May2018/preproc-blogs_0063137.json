    "text": "CNBC.com Homeview\nJeff Bezos' $23-million 27,000-square-foot home was the most expensive property in Washington D.C. when he bought it in 2016. (He's reportedly also coughing up $12 million for renovations .)\nNow, a 48,000-square-foot residence located on the edge of McLean's Great Falls Park in the D.C. suburb of McLean, Virginia, just went on sale for $62.95 million, dwarfing Bezos's buy and making this mansion the most expensive property ever to hit the market in the Washington D.C. area, according to the Washington Post . Homeview Living area at The Falls\nPreviously owned by the late James Kimsey, co-founder of AOL, the 3.2-acre estate is dubbed \"The Falls,\" since it is the only house on the Potomac River with direct views of the rapid falls. Sean Shanahan View of the Potomac\nThe main residence has six bedrooms, each with private bathrooms, including a master suite in its own wing with a steam, sauna and Jacuzzi, as well as a custom mahogany library and wet bar, private lounge with wine cellar and media room. Homeview The library at The Falls\nThe outdoor terrace includes an infinity pool with sweeping views of the river, as well as a full-size tennis court and gardens. Sean Shanahan Infinity pool at The Falls\nThe estate is also equipped with private security and gate house, staff quarters, and an underground parking garage accommodating 30 cars. Homeview\nThe estate comes with a separate, Frank Lloyd Wright-designed, three-bedroom guesthouse. \"The Marden House,\" shaped like a fish, was built in 1959 and, according to agent Russell Firestone III, it's stayed pretty true to the original structure over decades. \"There are pieces of original furniture,\" Firestone tells CNBC Make It . \"It's pretty pristine.\" Homeview The Frank Lloyd Wright-designed guesthouse\nThe Falls is listed through TTR Sotheby's International Realty.
