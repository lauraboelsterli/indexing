Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko speaks during a meeting of the country's Security and Defence Council in Kiev, Ukraine May 2, 2018. Mykola Lazarenko/Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS\nUkraineâ€™s council of security and defence approved in early May the sanctions that mirror those of the United States, which has blacklisted tycoons and allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nKiev has also extended existing sanctions it introduced against hundreds of Russian companies and entities in response to the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Kremlin support for a pro-Russian separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine.\nThe decree did not say which individuals or companies were on the latest list.\nThe council has said the new sanctions would be in force for at least three years and included penalties on Russian lawmakers and top officials.
