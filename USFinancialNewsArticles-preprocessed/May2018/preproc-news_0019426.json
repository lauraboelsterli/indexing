New Zealand's national rugby team All Blacks' Sonny Bill Williams meets with children at an event in Yokohama, Japan, November 28, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai\nThe twice World Cup winner broke his wrist in a loss to the Stormers in mid-March but returns at inside centre as the Blues look to end a winless streak of 15 matches against New Zealand opponents.\nAll Blacks prop Ofa Tuungafasi, fresh from signing a new deal to stay in New Zealand rugby until 2021, was also named in the side for Friday’s match at Eden Park after missing three matches with a knee injury.\n“It is great to have Ofa back, and it is awesome for the team to know we have him for a further three years, and Sonny has been fizzing to get back on the field,” coach Tana Umaga said in a team statement.
