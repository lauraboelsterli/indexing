This press release is issued as required by an exemptive order granted to the Fund by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNotification of Sources of Distribution\nThis notice provides shareholders of the John Hancock Premium Dividend Fund (NYSE: PDT) with important information concerning the distribution declared on April 2, 2018, and payable on April 30, 2018. No action is required on your part.\nDistribution Period:\nApril 2018\nDistribution Amount Per Common Share:\n$0.0975\nThe following table sets forth the estimated sources of the current distribution, payable April 30, 2018, and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short term capital gains; net realized long term capital gains; and return of capital or other capital source. All amounts are expressed on a per common share basis and as a percentage of the distribution amount.\nSource\nCurrent Distribution ($)\n% Breakdown of the Current Distribution\nTotal Cumulative Distributions for the Fiscal Year to Date ($) 1\n% Breakdown of the Total Cumulative Distributions for the Fiscal Year to Date 1\nNet Investment Income\n0.0593\n61%\n0.5115\n87%\nNet Realized Short-Term Capital Gains\n0.0000\n0%\n0.0000\n0%\nNet Realized Long-Term Capital Gains\n0.0234\n24%\n0.0731\n13%\nReturn of Capital or Other Capital Source\n0.0148\n15%\n0.0000\n0%\nTotal per common share\n0.0975\n100%\n0.5846\n100%\nAverage annual total return (in relation to NAV) for the 5 years ended on March 29, 2018\n8.44%\nAnnualized current distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of March 29, 2018\n8.15%\nCumulative total return (in relation to NAV) for the fiscal year through March 29, 2018\n-4.01%\nCumulative fiscal year-to-date distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of March 29, 2018\n4.07%\n1 The Fund's current fiscal year began on November 1, 2017, and will end on October 31, 2018.\nYou should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution plan.\nThe Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nThe Fund has declared the April 2018 distribution pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan (the \"Plan\"). Under the Plan, the Fund makes fixed monthly distributions in the amount of $0.0975 per share, which will continue to be paid monthly until further notice.\nIf you have questions or need additional information, please contact your financial professional or call the John Hancock Investments Closed-End Fund Information Line at 1-800-843-0090, Monday through Friday between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Eastern Time.\nStatements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined by the United States securities laws.
