    "text": "IMPROVED REVENUES AND ADJUSTED EBIT FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE VERSUS PRIOR YEAR ATTRIBUTABLE TO MAPLE PRODUCTS\nLOWER INTEREST RATE ON ISSUANCE OF SEVENTH SERIES DEBENTURES\nTWO-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENTION WITH ALBERTA SUGAR BEET GROWERS\nMONTREAL, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rogers Sugar Inc. (TSX:RSI)\nAs a result of the acquisition of LBMT and Decacer, the Company now has the following two operating segments: Sugar and Maple products.\nSugar\nThe Company’s total sugar deliveries for the second quarter of the current fiscal year decreased by approximately 5,500 metric tonnes versus the same quarter last year but were approximately 300 metric tonnes higher in the first half of fiscal 2018.\nIn the second quarter, the industrial market segment decreased by approximately 5,900 metric tonnes and by approximately 6,900 metric tonnes year-to-date when compared to the same periods last year. The decrease is mainly explained by timing in deliveries and a softening in demand from our customers.\nThe consumer market volume was slightly below last year for the current quarter and year-to-date with a decrease of approximately 1,200 metric tonnes and approximately 900 metric tonnes, respectively, both variations explained by timing in customers’ promotional activities.\nLiquid volume was approximately 1,700 metric tonnes higher than the second quarter of last year due to additional demand from existing customers. Year-to-date, the liquid volume was approximately 5,500 metric tonnes higher than last year due to the deliveries of a high fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”) substitutable customer in Western Canada for the full first half of fiscal 2018 as opposed to five months in the same period of fiscal 2017 and to additional demand from existing customers.\nExports were approximately 100 metric tonnes lower than the second quarter of fiscal 2017 but higher by approximately 2,600 metric tonnes year-to-date due to timing in sales deliveries to Mexico, as well as additional U.S. high tier opportunistic sales versus last year’s comparative periods.\nWith the mark-to-market of all derivative financial instruments and embedded derivatives in non-financial instruments at the end of each reporting period, our accounting income does not represent a complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the business. Consistent with previous reporting, we prepared adjusted gross margin and adjusted earnings results to reflect the performance of the Company during the period without the impact of the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments and embedded derivatives in non-financial instruments. Earnings before interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) for the Sugar segment included a mark-to-market loss of $1.3 million for the second quarter of the current year and a gain of $3.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018, which was added and deducted, respectively, to calculate the adjusted EBIT and adjusted gross margin results. See “Non-GAAP measures” section in the MD&A.\nAdjusted gross margin for the quarter was $22.0 million compared to $23.3 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of $1.3 million, due mainly to lower sales volume and lower by-product revenues. Adjusted gross margin per metric tonne of $134.66 was $3.24 lower than last year’s comparable period. The decrease is due mainly to the sales mix, lower volume and lower by-products revenues in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted gross margin of $53.2 million includes a non-cash pension plan income of $1.5 million recorded as a result of the approval by the Alberta Treasury Board and Finance of an amendment to the Alberta hourly pension plan. Excluding this non-cash income, adjusted gross margin was $51.7 million or $0.7 million lower than last year. The decrease is due mostly to lower by-product revenues and additional operating expenses. The year-to-date adjusted gross margin rate of $157.65 per metric tonne includes a gain of $4.38 for the non-cash pension plan income, explained above, thus reducing the adjusted gross margin rate to $153.27 per metric tonne as compared to $155.39 for fiscal 2017. The decrease of $2.12 per metric tonne is due mainly to the lower by-product revenues and to additional operating expenses.\nAdministration and selling expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $0.3 million higher than the comparable period last year due to timing, while year-to-date administration and selling expenses were comparable to last year.\nAdjusted results from operating activities for the second quarter of $13.9 million were $1.6 million lower than the comparable period year. The decrease is mainly due to lower by-product revenues and lower adjusted gross margin as a result of lower sales volume and higher administrative and selling expenses. Year-to-date, adjusted results were $0.7 million higher than the same period last year, but when excluding the non-cash pension plan income, were $0.8 million lower. The decrease is mainly explained by lower adjusted gross margin, as explained above, due to lower by-product revenues and additional operating expenses.\nMaple products\nRevenues include Decacer since its acquisition on November 18, 2017.\nGross margin of $6.4 million and $13.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and year-to-date do not reflect the economic margin of the Maple products segment, as it includes a loss of $0.2 million and a gain of $0.8 million for the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments on foreign exchange contracts, respectively. The mark-to-market was added and deducted to calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin results. See “Non-GAAP measures” section in the MD&A.\nIn addition to the impact of the mark-to-market adjustment for derivative instruments, the acquisition by LBMT of Decacer has resulted in expenses that do not reflect the economic performance of the operation of LBMT. Finally, certain non-cash items and non-recurring expenses also had a negative impact on the results from operating activities. As such Management believes that the Maple products segment’s financial results are more meaningful to management, investors, analysts, and any other interested parties when financial results are adjusted for the above mentioned items. See “Non-GAAP measures” section in the MD&A. Maple products Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the earnings before interest expenses, taxes and depreciation and amortization expenses of the Maple products segment, adjusted for the total adjustment to cost of sales relating to its segment and non-recurring expenses.\nAdjusted gross margin for the current quarter and the first six months of the fiscal year was $6.6 million and $12.7 million, respectively, representing an adjusted gross margin percentage of 12.5% for each period. However, included in cost of sales for the first half of fiscal 2018, was an amount of $0.3 million due to an increase in value of the finished goods inventory at the date of acquisition of Decacer. Under IFRS, all inventory of finished goods upon acquisition is valued at the estimated selling price less the sum of the costs of disposal, and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort of the acquirer which results in, lower selling margins when the acquired inventory is sold. As at December 30, 2017, there were no finished goods inventory remaining that existed as at the acquisition date. Without this adjustment, adjusted gross margin for the first six month of the year would have been $13.0 million or 12.7% of revenues.\nAdministration and selling expenses of $3.2 million and $6.4 million for the current quarter and year-to-date include non-recurring severance costs expensed to date of $0.8 million for the current quarter and of $1.1 million for the first six months of the year. Year-to-date administration and selling expenses also include $0.7 million in consulting fees and other costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of Decacer in the first quarter.\nDistribution expenses were $0.8 million for the current period and $1.7 million, year-to-date.\nThe results of operations would therefore need to be adjusted by the following:\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended Six months ended March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Results from operating activities $ 2,348 $ - $ 5,389 $ - Total adjustment to cost of sales (1) (2) 221 - (766 ) - Adjusted results from operating activities 2,569 - 4,623 - Non-recurring expenses: Acquisition costs incurred (35 ) - 675 - Other non-recurring items 839 - 1,093 - Finished goods valued at the estimated selling price less disposal cost as of acquisition date\n-\n-\n261\n- Depreciation and amortization 1,532 - 2,455 - Maple products segment adjusted EBITDA (1) (2) $ 4,905 $ - $ 9,107 $ - (1) See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\n(2) See “Adjusted results” within the unaudited condensed consolidated interim operating results section and “Segmented information” section of the MD&A.\nOther non-recurring items represent severance costs accrued to date.\nConsolidated\nAdjusted gross margin for the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2018 was $28.6 million and $65.9 million, respectively. This compares to $23.3 million and $52.4 million, respectively, for the comparable periods last year. The Maple segment contributed $6.6 million for the second quarter and $12.7 million year-to-date of adjusted gross margin, partially offset by a lower contribution of the Sugar segment which was explained above in the segmented information section.\nAdjusted EBIT for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $16.4 million versus $15.4 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of $1.0 million. Adjusted EBIT for the first half of fiscal 2018 amounted to $42.3 million versus $37.0 million for the comparable period last year, an improvement of $5.3 million. The variation for both periods is mainly explained by the Maple product segment which contributed $2.6 million and $4.6 million in adjusted EBIT for the current quarter and year-to-date, respectively. In addition, the adjusted EBIT of the Sugar segment was $1.6 million lower and $0.7 million higher than the same comparable periods, which was explained above in the segmented information section.\nNet finance costs for the second quarter and year-to-date were $1.8 million and $3.5 million higher than the comparable period of last year, respectively, excluding the amortization of the transitional balance, due to the increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility, the increase in interest rates, the additional accretion expense on the convertible unsecured subordinated debentures and the additional interest payable by LBMT and Decacer to the Fédération des Producteurs Acéricoles du Québec (“FPAQ”) on syrup purchases.\nFree cash flow for the second quarter of 2018 was $13.2 million compared to $12.5 million for the same period last year, an increase of $0.7 million. The increase is mainly explained by an increase in adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million (See “Non-GAAP measures” section in the MD&A), net of the non-cash pension income as well as a decrease in income taxes paid of $1.3 million. Offsetting a portion of the positive variance is an increase in interest paid of $2.2 million, higher capital expenditures, net of operational excellence capital expenditures of $0.8 million and an increase in pension plan contributions of $0.2 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2018 amounted to $30.6 million compared to $27.2 million for the same period last year or an increase of $3.4 million. The increase is also explained by higher adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 million, net of the non-cash pension income of $6.3 million and lower income taxes paid. The same items that created a negative variance for the quarter also applied for the year-to-date free cash flow such as higher interest paid of $3.6 million, higher capital spending, net of operational excellence capital expenditures of $2.1 million and higher pension contributions of $0.8 million. In addition, in the first half of fiscal 2017, an amount of $0.4 million was received during the second quarter following the exercise of share options by executives, compared to none in the current six months period. Finally, the Company paid $0.1 million in deferred financing charges during the first quarter of the current year to amend the revolving credit facility.\nOutlook\nIn fiscal 2018, we expect the industrial and consumer market segment to decrease slightly compared to fiscal 2017.\nThe liquid market segment should continue to be strong, benefitting from some growth with existing customers, the recapture of some of the volume loss in fiscal 2017 and the benefit of a full year of supply to a large bottler account in Western Canada. As a result, we expect the liquid market segment to surpass fiscal 2017 by approximately 10,000 metric tonnes.\nAs for the export segment, additional volume was booked during the quarter for high tier sales to the U.S. and therefore, we now anticipate an increase from our previous outlook from approximately 5,000 metric tonnes to approximately 10,000 metric tonnes. The improvement in volume compared to fiscal 2017 is expected to come from additional sales to Mexico and U.S. high tier opportunistic sales.\nOverall, we expect total volume to increase by approximately 10,000 metric tonnes.\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company will benefit from a full year of operations for LBMT and approximately ten months for Decacer, since its acquisition on November 18, 2017. The Maple products segment is comprised of both LBMT and Decacer. As of February 1, 2018 and as previously communicated, Management’s expectations for the Adjusted EBITDA of LBMT and Decacer were $18.4 million and $4.5 million, respectively, for fiscal 2018 and $20.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively, for fiscal 2019. As a result, the anticipated Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA was expected to total $22.9 million for fiscal 2018 and $25.6 million for fiscal 2019. As of the date of this MD&A, Management now anticipates that the Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 will be lower than expected and should amount to $19.9 million and $21.1 million for fiscal 2019.\nThe lower than anticipated results for the 2018 fiscal year are mainly attributable to a reduction in sales, foreign exchange impact and delays in operational excellence synergies for LBMT, due to the acquisition of Decacer. To date, revenues for the Maple product segment were below expectations as a result of some customer losses due to strategic reasons and/or competitive activities and the impact on the Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA from the lower than expected revenues should be approximately $1.0 million. Secondly, due to a stronger Canadian dollar versus last year, foreign exchange on sales booked prior to the LBMT acquisition and hedged after, had a negative impact for the first six months of the year and is expected to continue into the second half of the year to total approximately an $0.8 million, which would explain a portion of the lower than previously anticipated Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA. Finally, following the acquisition of Decacer, the Company delayed implementing some of the operational excellence synergies for LBMT as to include the newly acquired assets of Decacer and therefore delaying the implementation of the overall operational efficiencies into fiscal 2020. As a result of the delays, Management has lowered its anticipated operational excellence synergies for the Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 by approximately $0.9 million. The above items mainly explain the $3.0 million lower than anticipated results for the fiscal 2018 Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA that is now expected as of the date of this MD&A.\nWith regards to fiscal 2019, the lower than anticipated 2018 Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA is expected to carry through into next year. In addition, the lost sales experienced in the last six months are not expected to be recovered through higher than planned sales growth in fiscal 2019, which would have a negative impact of approximately $0.5 million. In addition, the analysis undertaken of all our Maple operations, as discussed above, will take an additional year to be implemented. Finally, syrup procurement costs are expected to be slightly higher in fiscal 2019 due to the mixed results from the spring 2018 harvest season, which would impact a portion of next fiscal year.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are expected to increase to $20.0 million as the Company intends to spend approximately $6.0 million on operational excellence capital projects. In addition, we have completed the engineering and project design to upgrade the Taber beet factory to be fully compliant with the new air emissions regulations. This solution is expected to require between $8 to $10 million in capital expenditures.\nThe beet slicing campaign was completed at the beginning of March. We expect that the current crop should derive approximately 125,000 metric tonnes of refined sugar. We contracted 28,000 acres for planting in Taber for the 2018 crop, a 1,000 acres increase versus last year.\nLabour negotiations with the Vancouver refinery unionized employees for the renewal of the labour contract have started and will continue over the coming weeks. The collective agreement expired at the end of February.\nFOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,\nDallas H. Ross, Chairman\nMontréal, Québec – May 1, 2018\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of Rogers Sugar Inc.’s (“Rogers”, “RSI” or the “Company”) dated May 1, 2018 should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes for the period ended March 31, 2018, as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and MD&A for the year ended September 30, 2017. The quarterly unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and any amounts shown in this MD&A were not reviewed nor audited by our external auditors.\nManagement is responsible for preparing the MD&A. This MD&A has been reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee of Rogers and its Board of Directors.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nIn analyzing results, we supplement the use of financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS with a number of non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position or cash flow that excludes (includes) amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding (including) amounts, that are included (excluded) in most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with the non-GAAP financial measures of other companies having the same or similar businesses. We strongly encourage investors to review the unaudited consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with IFRS. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the operations that, when viewed with the IFRS results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding IFRS financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.\nThe following is a description of the non-GAAP measures used by the Company in the MD&A:\nAdjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin adjusted for: “the adjustment to cost of sales”, which comprises of the mark-to-market gains or losses on sugar futures, foreign exchange forward contracts and embedded derivatives as shown in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the cumulative timing differences as a result of mark-to-market gains or losses on sugar futures, foreign exchange forward contracts and embedded derivatives as described below; and “the amortization of transitional balance to cost of sales for cash flow hedges”, which is the transitional marked-to-market balance of the natural gas futures outstanding as of October 1, 2016 amortized over time based on their respective settlement date until all existing natural gas futures have expired, as shown in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Adjusted EBIT is defined as EBIT adjusted for the adjustment to cost of sales, the amortization of transitional balances to cost of sales for cash flow hedges. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted EBIT adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the adjustment to cost of sales, the amortization of transitional balances to cost of sales for cash flow hedges, the amortization of transitional balance to net finance costs and the income tax impact on these adjustments. Amortization of transitional balance to net finance costs is defined as the transitional marked-to-market balance of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of October 1, 2016, amortized over time based on their respective settlement date until all existing interest rate swaps agreements have expired, as shown in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Adjusted gross margin rate per MT is defined as adjusted gross margin of the Sugar segment divided by the sales volume of the Sugar segment. Adjusted gross margin percentage is defined as the adjusted gross margin of the Maple segment divided by the revenues generated by the Maple product segment. Adjusted net earnings per share is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the earnings before interest expenses, taxes and depreciation and amortization expenses of the Maple products segment, adjusted for the total adjustment to cost of sales relating to its segment and non-recurring expenses. LBMT’s Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the earnings before interest expenses, taxes and depreciation and amortization expenses associated to the LBMT acquisition on August 5, 2017, adjusted for the total adjustment to cost of sales relating to its segment and non-recurring expenses. LBMT’s EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, business combination related costs, gain on business acquisition and fair value adjustment to purchase price allocation on inventories. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA is defined as LBMT’s EBITDA, adjusted to include the EBITDA of Highland and Great Northern from April 1, 2016 until their respective acquisition by LBMT and the expected EBITDA of Sucro-Bec for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017, as well as certain non-recurring operating expenses. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA assuming the LBMT Integration Gains is defined as the adjusted pro forma EBITDA, adjusted to include any recent customer gains, procurement efficiencies, redistribution of production lines, reduction of maple syrup losses and previous integration of acquired businesses. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA assuming the LBMT Integration Gains and the RSI Integration Gains is defined as the adjusted pro forma EBITDA assuming the LBMT Integration Gains, adjusted to include business efficiencies, including procurement cost reductions and Operational Excellence, and customer gains, as a result of the Rogers integration. Decacer’s pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017, adjusted to take into account non-recurring items identified by the Decacer Management, non-recurring items identified by the Company during the course of its due diligence and estimated adjustments required to reflect the going-forward EBITDA run-rate. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations excluding changes in non-cash working capital, mark-to-market and derivative timing adjustments, amortization of transitional balances, financial instruments non-cash amount, and includes funds received or paid from the issue or purchase of shares, deferred financing charges paid and capital expenditures, net of operational excellence capital expenditures.\nIn the MD&A, we discuss the non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons why we believe these measures provide useful information regarding the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, as applicable. We also discuss, to the extent material, the additional purposes, if any, for which these measures are used. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures are also contained in this MD&A.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains Statements or information that are or may be “forward-looking statements” or “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.

In light of the results for the Maple product segment during the second quarter as well as the delays in implementing certain of the LBMT integration plans, the Company updated its forecast for fiscal 2018 and 2019. As of the date of this MD&A, Management expects the Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 to decrease to $15.6 million from $18.4 million, as previously anticipated, and for fiscal 2019, to decrease to $17.0 million from $20.5 million. Refer to the “Outlook” section of this MD&A for further details.\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION IN THIS MD&A\nThe following table outlines the forward-looking information contained in this MD&A, which the Corporation considers important to better inform readers about its potential financial performance, together with the principal assumptions used to derive this information and the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from this information.\nPrincipal Assumptions Principal Risks and Uncertainties\nExpected adjusted EBITDA for LBMT\nThe expected adjusted EBITDA is the expected earnings before interest expenses, taxes, depreciation\nand amortization expense for a twelve-month period, adjusted for one-time costs and including the integration\ngains. The Corporation estimates annual operating earnings by subtracting from the estimated revenues,\nthe estimated annual operating costs, from which it subtracts estimated general and administrative expenses.\nThe integration gains include LBMT for fiscal 2018 and RSI integration gains for fiscal 2019. LBMT integration\ngains are estimated gains resulting from the three acquisitions completed by LBMT since February 2, 2016\nand which include customer gains, procurement efficiencies, redistribution of production lines, reduction of\nmaple syrup losses and previous integration of acquired businesses. RSI integration gains are estimated\noperational gains resulting from the combination of the Corporation and LBMT which include business\nefficiencies and customer gains.\nHistorical financial information used to estimate amounts may not be representative of future results.\nVariability in LBMT’s performance.\nUnexpected administration, selling or distribution expenditures.\nUncertainty of successful integration and operational gains.\nOther risks relating to the business of LBMT (refer to the “Risk Factors” section of the MD&A for the year ended September 30, 2017).\nExpected Adjusted pro forma EBITDA for Decacer\nDecacer’s Adjusted pro forma EBITDA is the expected earnings before interest expenses, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization expense for a twelve-month period, adjusted to take into account\nnon-recurring items identified by Decacer Management, non-recurring items identified by the\nCompany during the course of its due diligence and estimated adjustments required to reflect\nthe going-forward EBITDA run-rate.\nHistorical financial information used may not be representative of future results.\nVariability in Decacer’s performance.\nUnexpected administration, selling or distribution expenditures.\nUncertainty of successful integration and operational gains. INTERNAL DISCLOSURE CONTROLS\nIn accordance with Regulation 52-109 respecting certification of disclosure in issuers’ interim filings, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have designed or caused it to be designed under their supervision, disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”).\nIn addition, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have designed or caused it to be designed under their supervision internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes.\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated whether or not there were any changes to the Company’s ICFR during the three month period ended March 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s ICFR. No such changes were identified through their evaluation.\nLIMITATION ON SCOPE OF DESIGN\nThe Company has limited the scope of its DC&P and ICFR to exclude controls, policies and procedures of LBMT and its subsidiaries, including Decacer, acquired not more than 365 days before the last day of the period covered by the annual filing. The Company elected to exclude it from the scope of certification as allowed by NI 52-109. The Company intends to perform such testing within one year of acquisition.\nThe chart below presents the summary financial information included in the Corporation’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the excluded business:\nLMBT & Decacer\n(In thousands of dollars, unaudited) For the six months ended March 31, 2018\n$ Statement of Financial Position Total assets 238,526 Statement of Comprehensive Income Total revenue 102,140 Results from operating activities 5,389\nSELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following is a summary of selected financial information of Rogers’ unaudited condensed consolidated interim results for the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017.\nIn thousands of dollars, except volume and Three months ended Six months ended per share information) March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Total volume Sugar (metric tonnes) 163,253 168,723 337,397 337,099 Maple syrup (‘000 pounds) 12,725 n/a 23,916 n/a Total revenues $ 189,455 $ 163,566 $ 394,338 $ 323,170 Gross margin 27,055 16,605 70,168 44,781 Results from operating activities (“EBIT”) 14,888 8,784 46,573 29,380 Net finance costs 4,186 2,414 8,190 4,719 Income tax expense 3,116 1,582 10,581 6,321 Net earnings 7,586 4,788 27,802 18,340 Net earnings per share: Basic 0.07 0.05 0.26 0.20 Diluted 0.07 0.05 0.23 0.19 Dividends per share $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.18 $ 0.18 Consolidated results of operations\nAligned with one of our business priorities, Rogers made two strategic acquisitions in the natural sweetener market. On August 5, 2017, the Company acquired LBMT, a maple syrup bottler, for approximately $160.3 million, subject to closing adjustments of approximately $6.1 million, and on November 18, 2017, Rogers acquired Decacer, another maple syrup bottler, for approximately $40.0 million, subject to closing adjustments of approximately $3.0 million. This new platform will provide the Company with opportunities to grow organically, leverage sales and administrative synergies, and investigate other potential opportunistic acquisitions in that segment. Results from the LBMT and Decacer operations are included in the unaudited consolidated interim results of operations since their acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, Rogers now has the following two operating segments: Sugar and Maple products.\nTotal revenues\nRevenues for the current quarter and year-to-date amounted to $189.5 million and $394.3 million, respectively, an increase of $25.9 million and $71.2 million versus last year’s comparable periods. This improvement is attributable to revenues generated by LBMT and Decacer of $53.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and of $102.1 million year-to-date. The overall results were tempered slightly by lower #11 raw sugar values that translated into lower selling prices for refined sugar.\nGross margin\nGross margin of $27.1 million and $70.2 million for the second quarter and for the first half of the current fiscal year, respectively do not reflect the economic margin of the Company, as it includes a loss of $1.6 million for the second quarter and a gain of $4.3 million year-to-date for the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments as explained below (See “Adjusted results” section). In fiscal 2017, a mark-to-market loss of $6.7 million and $7.6 million was recorded for the second quarter and year-to-date, resulting in a gross margin of $16.6 million and $44.8 million for each respective period.\nResults from operating activities (“EBIT”)\nEBIT is defined as earnings before interest and taxes. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, EBIT amounted to $14.9 million compared to $8.8 million last year. The Maple product segment contributed $2.3 million of the increase in EBIT. In addition, a gain of $5.1 million was recorded for the quarter-over-quarter mark-to-market variation of derivative financial instruments, which does not reflect the economic results from operating activities. This was partially offset by a lower contribution from the Sugar segment due mainly to a reduction in volume and lower by-product revenues.\nYear-to-date, EBIT amounted to $46.6 million versus $29.4 million for the comparable period last year. The Maple product segment and the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments had a positive impact of $5.4 million and $11.9 million, respectively, explaining the year-over-year positive variation in EBIT.\nNet finance costs\nNet finance costs consisted of interest paid under the revolving credit facility, as well as interest expense on the convertible unsecured subordinated debentures and other interest. It also includes a mark-to-market gain or loss on the interest swap agreements.\nThe net finance costs breakdown is as follows:\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018\nApril 1,\n2017 Interest expense on convertible unsecured subordinated debentures, including accretion expense\n$\n1,844\n$\n1,615\n$ 3,542\n$ 3,201 Interest on revolving credit facility 1,377 680 2,803 1,308 Amortization of deferred financing fees 529 206 778 412 Other interest expense 569 - 1,335 - Net change in fair value of interest rate swap agreements (133 ) (87 ) (268 ) (202 ) Net finance costs $ 4,186 $ 2,414 $ 8,190 $ 4,719 The interest expense on the convertible unsecured subordinated debentures increased by approximately $0.2 million, for the current quarter and by $0.3 million, year-to-date, when compared to the same periods last year. The additional interest expense is mostly explained by an increase in accretion expense on the equity component of the convertible unsecured subordinated debentures.\nThe increase in interest on the revolving credit facility is due mainly to the additional drawdown as a result of the LBMT and Decacer acquisitions. The increase in interest rates also had a negative impact when compared to the same periods last year.\nThe other interest expense pertains mainly to interest payable to the FPAQ on syrup purchases, in accordance with the FPAQ payment terms.\nStarting on October 2, 2016, interest rate swap agreements were designated as effective cash flow hedging instruments and as a result, mark-to-market adjustments are now recorded in other comprehensive income. The transitional balances, representing the mark-to-market value recorded as of October 1, 2016, will be subsequently removed from other comprehensive income when each of the fixed interest rate tranches will be liquidated, in other words, when the fixed interest rate is paid. As a result, the Company removed a gain of $0.1 million and of $0.3 million for the current quarter and year-to-date, respectively, from other comprehensive income and recorded a gain of the same amount in net finance costs. The transitional balance relating to interest rate swap agreements will be fully depleted in fiscal 2020. See “Adjusted results” section. For the prior year, a gain of $0.1 million and $0.2 million were recorded for the respective comparative periods.\nTaxation\nThe income tax expense is as follows:\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended\nSix months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Current $ 4,165 $ 9,828 $ 9,926 $ 13,673 Deferred (1,049 ) (8,246 ) 655 (7,352 ) Income tax expense $ 3,116 $ 1,582 $ 10,581 $ 6,321 The variation in current and deferred tax expense quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date is consistent with the variation in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2018.\nDeferred income taxes reflect temporary differences, which result primarily from the difference between depreciation claimed for tax purposes and depreciation amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes, employee future benefits and derivative financial instruments. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates anticipated to apply to income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be realized or reversed. The effect of a change in income tax rates on future income taxes is recognized in income in the period in which the change occurs.\nNet earnings\nNet earnings for the second quarter were $7.6 million compared to $4.8 million for fiscal 2017. The increase in net earnings is mostly explained by the after-tax contribution of the Maple product segment and a gain on the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments. The positive net earnings variance was somewhat offset by the after-tax impact of a decrease of $2.7 million of EBIT for the Sugar segment and $1.8 million in additional finance costs, as explained above.\nYear-to-date, net earnings amounted to $27.8 million, a $9.5 million increase versus the comparative period last year. The increase is also explained by the after-tax contribution of the Maple product segment and a gain on the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments somewhat offset by additional interest expense and acquisition costs.\nAdjusted results\nIn the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments consisting of sugar futures, foreign exchange forward contracts, natural gas futures and interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2016 and prior years, all derivative financial instruments were marked-to-market at each reporting date, with the unrealized gains/losses charged to the consolidated statement of earnings. As of October 2, 2016, the Company adopted all the requirements of IFRS 9 (2014) Financial Instruments. As a result, the Company has designated as effective hedging instruments its natural gas futures and its interest rate swap agreements entered into in order to protect itself against natural gas prices and interest rate fluctuations as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial instruments pertaining to sugar futures and foreign exchange forward contracts continue to be marked-to-market at each reporting date and are charged to the consolidated statement of earnings. In addition, the derivative financial instruments pertaining to foreign exchange forward contracts on maple syrup sales were marked-to-market as at March 31, 2018 and also charged to the consolidated statement of earnings. The unrealized gains/losses related to natural gas futures and interest rate swaps are accounted for in other comprehensive income. The amount recognized in other comprehensive income is removed and included in net earnings under the same line item in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income as the hedged item, in the same period that the hedged cash flows affect net earnings, reducing earnings volatility related to the movements of the valuation of these derivatives hedging instruments. The transitional marked-to-market balances outstanding as of October 1, 2016 will be amortized over time based on their settlements until all existing natural gas futures and all existing interest rate swaps agreements have expired.\nThe Company sells refined sugar to some clients in U.S. dollars. Prior to October 1, 2016, these sales contracts were viewed as having an embedded derivative if the functional currency of the customer was not U.S. dollars, the embedded derivative being the source currency of the transaction. The embedded derivatives were marked-to-market at each reporting date, with the unrealized gains/losses charged to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of earnings with a corresponding offsetting amount charged to the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of financial position. As of October 2, 2016, the U.S. dollars of these sales contract will no longer be considered as being an embedded derivative as it was determined that the U.S. dollar is commonly used in Canada. This change in estimate will be applied prospectively, as a result, only the embedded derivatives relating to sales contracts outstanding as of October 1, 2016 will continue to be marked-to-market every quarter until all the volume on these contracts has been delivered. As at March 31, 2018, there were no embedded derivatives on sales contracts outstanding from the October 1, 2016 balance.\nManagement believes that the Company’s financial results are more meaningful to management, investors, analysts and any other interested parties when financial results are adjusted by the gains/losses from financial derivative instruments and from embedded derivatives. These adjusted financial results provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. This measurement is a non-GAAP measurement. See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nManagement uses the non-GAAP adjusted results of the operating company to measure and to evaluate the performance of the business through its adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBIT and adjusted net earnings. In addition, management believes that these measures are important to our investors and parties evaluating our performance and comparing such performance to past results. Management also uses adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBIT and adjusted net earnings when discussing results with the Board of Directors, analysts, investors, banks and other interested parties. See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nThe results of operations would therefore need to be adjusted by the following:\nIncome (loss)\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended\nSix months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Mark-to-market on: Sugar futures contracts $ (3,375 ) $ (1,732 ) $ (2,144 ) $ (6,326 ) Foreign exchange forward contracts (28 ) (823 ) 1,305 (1,936 ) Embedded derivatives - (524 ) 51 198 Total mark-to-market adjustment on derivatives $ (3,403 ) $ (3,079 ) $ (788 ) $ (8,064 ) Cumulative timing differences 1,360 (4,208 ) 3,671 (1,010 ) Adjustment to cost of sales (2,043 ) (7,287 ) 2,883 (9,074 ) Amortization of transitional balance to cost of sales for cash flow hedges\n491\n625\n1,374\n1,473 Total adjustment to costs of sales (1) $ (1,552 ) $ (6,662 ) $ 4,257 $ (7,601 ) (1) See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nThe fluctuations in mark-to-market adjustment on derivatives are due to the price movements in #11 world raw sugar and foreign exchange market. See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nCumulative timing differences, as a result of mark-to-market gains or losses, are recognized by the Company only when sugar is sold to a customer. The gains or losses on sugar and related foreign exchange paper transactions are largely offset by corresponding gains or losses from the physical transactions, namely sale and purchase contracts with customers and suppliers. See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nAs previously mentioned, starting on October 2, 2016, natural gas futures were designated as an effective cash flow hedging instrument and as a result, mark-to-market adjustments are now recorded in other comprehensive income. The transitional balances, representing the mark-to-market value recorded as of October 1, 2016, will be subsequently removed from other comprehensive income when the natural gas futures will be liquidated, in other words, when the natural gas is used. As a result, in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company removed a gain of $0.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, from other comprehensive income and recorded a gain of the same amount in cost of sales. The transitional balance relating to natural gas futures will be fully depleted in fiscal 2020. See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nThe above described adjustments are added or deducted to the mark-to-market results to arrive at the total adjustment to cost of sales. For the second quarter of the current year, the total cost of sales adjustment is a loss of $1.6 million to be added to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim operating results versus a loss of $6.7 million to be added to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim results for the comparable quarter last year. Year-to-date, the total cost of sales adjustment is a gain of $4.3 million to be deducted from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim operating results versus a loss of $7.6 million to be added to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim results for the comparable period last year. See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nThe following is a table showing the adjusted unaudited condensed consolidated interim results (non-GAAP) without the above mark-to-market results:\nConsolidated results\n(In thousands of dollars, except per share information) Three months ended\nSix months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Gross margin as per financial statements $ 27,055 $ 16,605 $ 70,168 $ 44,781 Adjustment as per above 2,043 7,287 (2,883 ) 9,074 Amortization of transitional balance to cost of sales as per above (491 ) (625 ) (1,374 ) (1,473 ) Adjusted gross margin (1) 28,607 23,267 65,911 52,382 EBIT as per financial statements $ 14,888 $ 8,784 $ 46,573 $ 29,380 Adjustment as per above 2,043 7,287 (2,883 ) 9,074 Amortization of transitional balance to cost of sales as per above (491 ) (625 ) (1,374 ) (1,473 ) Adjusted EBIT (1) 16,440 15,446 42,316 36,981 Net earnings as per financial statements 7,586 4,788 27,802 18,340 Adjustment to cost of sales as per above 2,043 7,287 (2,883 ) 9,074 Amortization of transitional balance to cost of sales as per above (491 ) (625 ) (1,374 ) (1,473 ) Amortization of transitional balance to net finance costs (133 ) (87 ) (268 ) (202 ) Income taxes on above adjustments (388 ) (1,735 ) 1,188 (1,993 ) Adjusted net earnings (1) 8,617 9,628 24,465 23,746 Net earnings per share basic, as per financial statements 0.07 0.05 0.26 0.20 Adjustment for the above 0.01 0.05 (0.03 ) 0.05 Adjusted net earnings per share basic (1) $ 0.08 $ 0.10 $ 0.23 $ 0.25 (1) See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nAdjusted gross margin\nAdjusted gross margin for the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2018 was $28.6 million and $65.9 million, respectively. This compares to $23.3 million and $52.4 million, respectively, for the comparable periods last year. The Maple segment contributed $6.6 million for the second quarter and $12.7 million year-to-date of adjusted gross margin, partially offset by a lower contribution of the Sugar segment explained later in the segmented information section.\nResults from operating activities\nAdjusted EBIT for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $16.4 million versus $15.4 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of $1.0 million. Adjusted EBIT for the first half of fiscal 2018 amounted to $42.3 million versus $37.0 million for the comparable period last year, an improvement of $5.3 million. The variation for both periods is mainly explained by the Maple product segment which contributed $2.6 million and $4.6 million in adjusted EBIT for the current quarter and year-to-date, respectively. In addition, the adjusted EBIT of the Sugar segment was $1.6 million lower and $0.7 million higher than the same comparable periods, which is explained later in the segmented information section.\nSegmented information\nFollowing the acquisition of LBMT and Decacer, the Company has two distinct segments, namely, refined sugar and by-products, together referred to as the “Sugar” segment and maple syrup and derived products, together referred to as the “Maple products” segment.\nThe following is a table showing the key results by segments:\nConsolidated results\n(In thousands of dollars, except volume) Three months ended March 31, 2018 Three months ended April 1, 2017 Sugar Maple\nProducts Total Sugar Maple\nProducts Total Revenues $ 136,434 $ 53,021 $ 189,455 $ 163,566 $ - $ 163,566 Gross margin 20,654 6,401 27,055 16,605 - 16,605 Administration and selling expenses 5,635 3,216 8,851 5,312 - 5,312 Distribution costs 2,479 837 3,316 2,509 - 2,509 Results from operating activities 12,540 2,348 14,888 8,784 - 8,784 Non- GAAP results: Total adjustment to the cost of sales (1) 1,331 221 1,552 6,662 - 6,662 Adjusted Gross Margin (1) 21,985 6,622 28,607 23,267 - 23,267 Adjusted results from operating activities (1) $ 13,871 $ 2,569 $ 16,440 $ 15,446 $ - $ 15,446 Additional information:\nAddition to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n$\n3,476\n$ 573\n$\n4,049\n$\n3,638\n$ -\n$\n3,638 (1) See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nConsolidated results\n(In thousands of dollars, except volume) Six months ended March 31, 2018\nSix months ended April 1, 2017 Sugar Maple\nProducts Total Sugar Maple\nProducts Total Revenues $ 292,198 $ 102,140 $ 394,338 $ 323,170 $ - $ 323,170 Gross margin 56,681 13,487 70,168 44,781 - 44,781 Administration and selling expenses 10,622 6,416 17,038 10,602 - 10,602 Distribution costs 4,875 1,682 6,557 4,799 - 4,799 Results from operating activities 41,184 5,389 46,573 29,380 - 29,380 Non- GAAP results: Total adjustment to the cost of sales (1) (3,491 ) (766 ) (4,257 ) 7,601 - 7,601 Adjusted Gross Margin (1) 53,190 12,721 65,911 52,382 - 52,382 Adjusted results from operating activities (1) $ 37,693 $ 4,623 $ 42,316 $ 36,981 $ - $ 36,981 Additional information:\nAddition to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n$\n7,791\n$ 737\n$\n8,529\n$\n6,011\n$ -\n$\n6,011 (1) See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nResults from operation by segment\nSugar\nRevenues\n(In thousands of dollars, except volume) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Volume (MT) 163,253 168,723 337,397 337,099 Revenues $ 136,434 $ 163,566 $ 292,198 $ 323,170 The Company’s total sugar deliveries for the second quarter of the current fiscal year decreased by approximately 5,500 metric tonnes versus the same quarter last year but were approximately 300 metric tonnes higher in the first half of fiscal 2018. The decrease in revenues for the second quarter and for the first half of fiscal 2018 versus the comparable periods last year, is mainly explained by a decrease in the weighted average raw sugar values in fiscal 2018 and to a smaller extent, to the decrease in volume for the current quarter.\nIn the second quarter, the industrial market segment decreased by approximately 5,900 metric tonnes and by approximately 6,900 metric tonnes year-to-date when compared to the same periods last year. The decrease is mainly explained by timing in deliveries and a softening in demand from our customers.\nThe consumer market volume was slightly below last year for the current quarter and year-to-date with a decrease of approximately 1,200 metric tonnes and approximately 900 metric tonnes, respectively, both variations explained by timing in customers’ promotional activities.\nLiquid volume was approximately 1,700 metric tonnes higher than the second quarter of last year due to additional demand from existing customers. Year-to-date, the liquid volume was approximately 5,500 metric tonnes higher than last year due to the deliveries of a high fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”) substitutable customer in Western Canada for the full first half of fiscal 2018 as opposed to five months in the same period of fiscal 2017 and to additional demand from existing customers.\nExports were approximately 100 metric tonnes lower than the second quarter of fiscal 2017 but higher by approximately 2,600 metric tonnes year-to-date due to timing in sales deliveries to Mexico, as well as additional U.S. high tier opportunistic sales versus last year’s comparative periods.\nGross Margin\nTwo major factors impact gross margins: the selling margin of the products and operating costs.\n(In thousands of dollars, except per metric tonne information) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Gross margin $ 20,654 $ 16,605 $ 56,681 $ 44,781 Total adjustment to cost of sales (1) (2) 1,331 6,662 (3,491 ) 7,601 Adjusted gross margin $ 21,985 $ 23,267 $ 53,190 $ 52,382 Gross margin per metric tonne $ 126.51 $ 98.42 $ 167.99 $ 132.84 Adjusted gross margin per metric tonne $ 134.66 $ 137.90 $ 157.65 $ 155.39 (1) See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\n(2) See “Adjusted results” within the unaudited condensed consolidated interim results of operation section and “Segmented information” section.\nGross margin of $20.7 million for the quarter and $56.7 million, year-to-date do not reflect the economic margin of the sugar segment, as it includes a loss of $1.3 million for the second quarter and a gain of $3.5 million year-to-date for the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments as explained above. In fiscal 2017, a mark-to-market loss of $6.7 million and $7.6 million were recorded for the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively, resulting in gross margins of $16.6 million and $44.8 million, respectively.\nWe will therefore comment on adjusted gross margin results.\nAdjusted gross margin for the quarter was $22.0 million compared to $23.3 million for the same quarter last year, a decrease of $1.3 million, due mainly to lower sales volume and lower by-product revenues. Adjusted gross margin per metric tonne of $134.66 was $3.24 lower than last year’s comparable period. The decrease is due mainly to the sales mix, lower volume and lower by-products revenues in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted gross margin of $53.2 million includes a non-cash pension plan income of $1.5 million recorded as a result of the approval by the Alberta Treasury Board and Finance of an amendment to the Alberta hourly pension plan. Excluding this non-cash income, adjusted gross margin was $51.7 million or $0.7 million lower than last year. The decrease is due mostly to lower by-product revenues and additional operating expenses. The year-to-date adjusted gross margin rate of $157.65 per metric tonne includes a gain of $4.38 for the non-cash pension plan income, explained above, thus reducing the adjusted gross margin rate to $153.27 per metric tonne as compared to $155.39 for fiscal 2017. The decrease of $2.12 per metric tonne is due mainly to the lower by-product revenues and to additional operating expenses.\nIncluded in gross margin and adjusted gross margin is $3.1 million and $6.1 million of depreciation expense in cost of sales for the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively, which is comparable to last year.\nOther expenses\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Administration and selling expenses $ 5,635 $ 5,312 $ 10,622 $ 10,602 Distribution costs $ 2,479 $ 2,509 $ 4,875 $ 4,799 Administration and selling expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $0.3 million higher than the comparable period last year due to timing, while year-to-date administration and selling expenses were comparable to last year.\nDistribution costs for the current quarter were comparable to last year and approximately $0.1 million higher on a year-to-date basis.\nResults from operating activities\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Results from operating activities $ 12,540 $ 8,784 $ 41,184 $ 29,380 Adjusted results from operating activities $ 13,871 $ 15,446 $ 37,693 $ 36,981 The results from operating activities for the current quarter and the first half of fiscal 2018 of $12.5 million and $41.2 million, respectively, do not reflect the adjusted results from operating activities of the Company, as they include gains and losses from the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments, as well as timing differences in the recognition of any gains and losses on the liquidation of derivative instruments. We will therefore comment on adjusted results from operating activities.\nAdjusted results from operating activities for the second quarter of $13.9 million were $1.6 million lower than the comparable period year. The decrease is mainly due to lower by-product revenues and lower adjusted gross margin as a result of lower sales volume and higher administrative and selling expenses. Year-to-date, adjusted results were $0.7 million higher than the same period last year, but when excluding the non-cash pension plan income, were $0.8 million lower. The decrease is mainly explained by lower adjusted gross margin, as explained above, due to lower by-product revenues and additional operating expenses.\nMaple products\nRevenues\n(In thousands of dollars and volume, in thousands of pounds) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Volume (pounds) 12,725 - 23,916 - Revenues $ 53,021 $ - $ 102,140 $ - Revenues include Decacer since its acquisition on November 18, 2017.\nGross Margin\nTwo major factors impact gross margins: the selling margin of the products and operating costs.\n(In thousands of dollars, except adjusted gross margin percentage information) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Gross margin $ 6,401 $ - $ 13,487 $ - Total adjustment to cost of sales (1) (2) 221 - (766 ) - Adjusted gross margin $ 6,622 $ - $ 12,721 $ - Gross margin percentage 12.1 % - 13.2 % - Adjusted gross margin percentage 12.5 % - 12.5 % - (1) See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\n(2) See “Adjusted results” within the unaudited condensed consolidated interim operating results section and “Segmented information” section.\nGross margin of $6.4 million and $13.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and year-to-date do not reflect the economic margin of the Maple products segment, as it includes a loss of $0.2 million and a gain of $0.8 million for the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments on foreign exchange contracts, respectively.\nWe will therefore comment on adjusted gross margin results.\nAdjusted gross margin for the current quarter and the first six months of the fiscal year was $6.6 million and $12.7 million, respectively, representing an adjusted gross margin percentage of 12.5% for each period. However, included in cost of sales for the first half of fiscal 2018, was an amount of $0.3 million due to an increase in value of the finished goods inventory at the date of acquisition of Decacer. Under IFRS, all inventory of finished goods upon acquisition is valued at the estimated selling price less the sum of the costs of disposal, and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort of the acquirer which results in, lower selling margins when the acquired inventory is sold. As at December 30, 2017, there were no finished goods inventory remaining that existed as at the acquisition date. Without this adjustment, adjusted gross margin for the first six month of the year would have been $13.0 million or 12.7% of revenues.\nOther expenses\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Administration and selling expenses $ 3,216 $ - $ 6,416 $ - Distribution costs $ 837 $ - $ 1,682 $ - Administration and selling expenses of $3.2 million and $6.4 million for the current quarter and year-to-date include non-recurring severance costs expensed to date of $0.8 million for the current quarter and of $1.1 million for the first six months of the year. Year-to-date administration and selling expenses also include $0.7 million in consulting fees and other costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of Decacer in the first quarter.\nIncluded in administration and selling expenses were $1.1 million and $1.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense for the three and six month periods ended March 31, 2018.\nDistribution expenses were $0.8 million for the current period and $1.7 million, year-to-date.\nResults from operating activities\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Results from operating activities $ 2,348 $ - $ 5,389 $ - Adjusted results from operating activities $ 2,569 $ - $ 4,623 $ - The above results from operating activities reflect the earnings before interest and taxes of LBMT for the period and Decacer since its acquisition.\nAdjusted results\nIn the normal course of business, the Company uses derivative financial instruments consisting of foreign exchange forward contracts, which are marked-to-market at each reporting date with the unrealized gains/losses charge to the consolidated statement of earnings. In addition, the acquisition by LBMT of Decacer has resulted in expenses that do not reflect the economic performance of the operation of LBMT. Finally, certain non-cash items and non-recurring expenses also had a negative impact on the results from operating activities. As such Management believes that the Maple products segment’s financial results are more meaningful to management, investors, analysts, and any other interested parties when financial results are adjusted for the above mentioned items.\nThe results of operations would therefore need to be adjusted by the following:\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended Six months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Results from operating activities $ 2,348 $ - $ 5,389 $ - Total adjustment to cost of sales (1) (2) 221 - (766 ) - Adjusted results from operating activities 2,569 - 4,623 - Non-recurring expenses: Acquisition costs incurred (35 ) - 675 - Other non-recurring items 839 - 1,093 - Finished goods valued at the estimated selling price less disposal cost as of acquisition date\n-\n-\n261\n- Depreciation and amortization 1,532 - 2,455 - Maple products segment adjusted EBITDA (1) (2) $ 4,905 $ - $ 9,107 $ - (1) See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\n(2) See “Adjusted results” within the unaudited condensed consolidated interim operating results section and “Segmented information” section.\nOther non-recurring items represent severance costs expensed to date.\nSummary of Quarterly Results\nThe following is a summary of selected financial information of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and non-GAAP measures of the Company for the last eight quarters:\n(In thousands of dollars, except for volume and per share information) QUARTERS\n2018 2017 2016 Second First Fourth Third Second First Fourth Third Sugar Volume (MT) 163,253 174,144 183,397 173,969 168,723 168,376 187,179 169,481 Maple products volume (‘000 Lbs) 12,725 11,191 5,764 - - - - - $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Total revenues 189,455 204,883 192,984\n166,363 163,566 159,604 161,733 138,600 Gross margin 27,055 43,113 22,631 9,886 16,605 28,176 32,418 36,721 EBIT 14,888 31,685 10,138 1,513 8,784 20,596 24,472 28,636 Net earnings 7,586 20,216 4,014 (448 ) 4,788 13,552 16,453 19,383 Gross margin rate per MT (1) 126.51 206.88 103.82 56.83 98.42 167.34 173.19 216.67 Gross margin percentage (2) 12.1 % 14.4 % 13.5 % - - - - - Per share Net earnings Basic 0.07 0.19 0.04 - 0.05 0.14 0.18 0.21 Diluted 0.07 0.18 0.04 - 0.05 0.14 0.16 0.19 Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted gross margin 28,607 37,303 28,034 22,843 23,267 29,115 29,615 20,356 Adjusted EBIT 16,440 25,875 15,541 14,470 15,446 21,535 21,669 12,271 Adjusted net earnings 8,617 15,848 7,938 9,030 9,628 14,118 14,263 7,259 Adjusted gross margin rate per MT (1) 134.66 179.19 134.18 131.31 137.90 172.92 158.22 120.11 Adjusted gross margin percentage (2) 12.5 % 12.4 % - - - 12.8 % - - Adjusted net earnings per share Basic 0.08 0.15 0.08 0.10 0.10 0.15 0.15 0.08 Diluted 0.07 0.14 0.08 0.10 0.10 0.14 0.14 0.08 (1) Gross margin rate per MT and adjusted gross margin rate per MT pertains to the Sugar segment only.\n(2) Gross margin percentage and adjusted gross margin percentage pertains to the Maple products segment only\nHistorically the first quarter (October to December) of the fiscal year is the best quarter of the sugar segment for adjusted gross margins and adjusted net earnings due to the favourable sales mix associated with an increased proportion of consumer sales during that period of the year. At the same time, the second quarter (January to March) historically has the lowest volume as well as an unfavourable customer mix, resulting in lower revenues, adjusted gross margins and adjusted net earnings.\nThe increase in revenues for fiscal 2018 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 is explained by the benefit of the LBMT acquisition on August 5, 2017 and of the Decacer’s acquisition on November 18, 2017. The timing of both acquisitions also had an impact on the maple product volume.\nLiquidity\nCash flow generated by Lantic is paid to Rogers by way of dividends and return of capital on the common shares and by the payment of interest on the subordinated notes of Lantic held by Rogers, after taking a reasonable reserve for capital expenditures, debt reimbursement and working capital. The cash received by Rogers is used to pay administrative expenses, interest on the convertible debentures, income taxes and dividends to its shareholders. Lantic had no restrictions on distributions of cash arising from the compliance of financial covenants for the year.\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended\nSix months ended March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Net cash flow from (used in) operating activities $ 9,693 $ 16,869 $ (1,069 ) $ (2,427 ) Cash flow (used in) from financing activities (11,807 ) (15,459 ) 36,054 6,522 Cash flow used in investing activities (1,026 ) (3,136 ) (46,142 ) (4,433 ) Effect of changes in exchange rate on cash 103 - 171 - Net decrease in cash $ (3,037 ) $ (1,726 ) $ (10,986 ) $ (338 ) Net cash flow from operating activities was positive $9.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to positive $16.9 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2017, resulting in a negative variance $7.2 million The decrease was due to a negative non-cash working capital variation of $13.9 million, an increase in interest paid of $2.2 million and an increase in pension plan contributions of $0.2 million partially offset by an increase of $6.1 million in EBIT and a decrease of $1.3 million in paid income taxes. Year-to-date, net cash flow from operating activities was negative $1.1 million compared to negative $2.4 million for the same period last year, an improvement of $1.3 million. The positive variance is mostly explained by an increase in EBIT of $17.2 million and lower income taxes paid of $4.1 million. Somewhat offsetting the positive variance is a negative non-cash working capital variation of $13.2 million, mostly attributable to the movement in accounts payable and inventories, higher interest paid of $3.6 million, a negative non-cash variance in fair value of derivative financial instruments of $3.4 million and higher pension plan contribution of $0.8 million. It should be noted that the acquisition of the working capital of Decacer is shown in investing activities and therefore, only the working capital variation between the acquisition date and March 31, 2018 is presented as part of the cash flow from operating activities.\nCash flow from financing activities decreased for the current quarter from $15.5 million to $11.8 million, a reduction of $3.7 million. During the current quarter, the Company issued Seventh series convertible unsecured subordinated debentures (“Seventh series debentures”) for a total amount of $81.2 million, net of underwriting and issuance fees. The proceeds from the Seventh series debentures were used to repay the outstanding balance of $60.0 million of the Fifth series convertible unsecured subordinated debentures (“Fifth series debentures”) as well as a portion of the revolving credit facility. Overall, during the current quarter, total borrowings declined by $2.3 million versus $7.0 million for the same period last year, a positive variation of $4.7 million. Somewhat offsetting this positive variance is an increase in dividend paid of $1.1 million as a result of the issuance of common shares under the public offering of July 2017. Year-to-date, cash flow from financing activities was $36.1 million for the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to $6.5 million last year, an increase of $29.6 million. The issuance of the Seventh series debentures, the repayment of the Fifth series debentures and the additional borrowings under the revolving credit, mostly related to the Decacer acquisition, resulted in a cash inflow of $55.2 million, as opposed to $23.0 million last year, a year-over-year positive variation of $32.2 million. Additional dividend paid of $2.1 million somewhat offset the positive variation versus the same period last year. In addition, the Company paid $0.1 million in financing fees associated with the additional borrowings to fund the Decacer acquisition. Finally, in the first half of fiscal 2017, a total amount of $0.4 million was received for stock options exercised.\nThe cash outflow used in investing activities decreased compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 by $2.1 million. During the quarter, the closing adjustments for the LBMT and Decacer acquisition were settled, resulting in a $3.1 million cash inflow. Somewhat reducing this positive variation is $1.0 million in additional capital and intangible assets spending. Year-to-date, cash flows from investing activities were $46.1 million compared to $4.4 million, a negative variation of $41.7 million, due mainly to the acquisition of Decacer, net of the closing adjustments of the second quarter, totalling $39.0 million. Also contributing to the negative variation is greater capital and intangible spending during the first six-month period of $2.7 million, in line with an increase in anticipated capital spending in fiscal 2018.\nIn order to provide additional information, the Company believes it is appropriate to measure free cash flow that is generated by the operations of the Company. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations excluding changes in non-cash working capital, mark-to-market and derivative timing adjustments, amortization of transitional balances, financial instruments non-cash amount, and includes funds received or paid from the issue or purchase of shares, deferred financing charges paid and capital expenditures, net of operational excellence capital expenditures.. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure.\nFree cash flow is as follows:\n(In thousands of dollars) Three months ended\nSix months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 April 1,\n2017 Net cash flow from (used in) operations $ 9,693 $ 16,869 $ (1,069 ) $ (2,427 ) Adjustments: Changes in non-cash working capital 5,431 (8,514 ) 37,175 23,939 Mark-to-market and derivative timing adjustments 2,043 7,287 (2,883 ) 9,074 Amortization of transitional balances (624 ) (712 ) (1,642 ) (1,675 ) Financial instruments non-cash amount (430 ) (294 ) 4,323 962 Capital expenditures (4,101 ) (3,136 ) (7,156 ) (4,433 ) Operational excellence capital expenditures 1,176 964 1,924 1,268 Share options exercised - - 428 Deferred financing charges - - (122 ) - Free cash flow (1) $ 13,188 $ 12,464 $ 30,550 $ 27,136 Declared dividends $ 9,517 $ 8,459 $ 19,034 $ 16,919 (1) See “Non-GAAP measures” section.\nFree cash flow for the second quarter of 2018 was $13.2 million compared to $12.5 million for the same period last year, an increase of $0.7 million. The increase is mainly explained by an increase in adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million (See “Non-GAAP measures” section in the MD&A), net of the non-cash pension income as well as a decrease in income taxes paid of $1.3 million. Offsetting a portion of the positive variance is an increase in interest paid of $2.2 million, higher capital expenditures, net of operational excellence capital expenditures of $0.8 million and an increase in pension plan contributions of $0.2 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2018 amounted to $30.6 million compared to $27.2 million for the same period last year or an increase of $3.4 million. The increase is also explained by higher adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 million, net of the non-cash pension income of $6.3 million and lower income taxes paid. The same items that created a negative variance for the quarter also applied for the year-to-date free cash flow such as higher interest paid of $3.6 million, higher capital spending, net of operational excellence capital expenditures of $2.1 million and higher pension contributions of $0.8 million. In addition, in the first half of fiscal 2017, an amount of $0.4 million was received during the second quarter following the exercise of share options by executives, compared to none in the current six months period. Finally, the Company paid $0.1 million in deferred financing charges during the first quarter of the current year to amend the revolving credit facility.\nCapital expenditures, net of operational excellence expenditures, were slightly higher in fiscal 2018, in line with an increase in anticipated capital spending in fiscal 2018. Operational excellence capital expenditures were $0.2 million and $0.7 million higher for the second quarter of the current fiscal year and year-to-date, when compared to the same periods last year. Free cash flow is not reduced by operational excellence capital expenditures, as these projects are not necessary for the operation of the plants, but are undertaken because of the substantial operational savings that are realized once the projects are completed.\nFinancing charges are paid when a new debt financing is completed and such charges are deferred and amortized over the term of that debt. The cash used in the year to pay for such fees is therefore not available and as a result is deducted from free cash flow.\nThe Company declared a quarterly dividend of 9.0 cents per common share, for a total amount of approximately $9.5 million for the current quarter and $19.0 million, for the first six months of fiscal 2018, versus to $8.5 million and $16.9 million for the comparable periods last year. The increase is due to the issuance of common shares pursuant to the offering made under a short term prospectus in July 2017.\nChanges in non-cash operating working capital represent year-over-year movements in current assets, such as accounts receivable and inventories, and current liabilities, such as accounts payables. Movements in these accounts are due mainly to timing in the collection of receivables, receipts of raw sugar and payment of liabilities. Increases or decreases in such accounts are due to timing issues and therefore do not constitute free cash flow. Such increases or decreases are financed from available cash or from the Company’s available credit facility of $315.0 million. Increases or decreases in bank indebtedness are also due to timing issues from the above and therefore do not constitute available free cash flow.\nThe combined impact of the mark-to-market and financial instruments non-cash positive amount of $1.0 million for the current quarter and non-cash negative amount of $0.2 million year-to-date do not represent cash items as these contracts will be settled when the physical transactions occur, which is the reason for the adjustment to free cash flow.\nContractual obligations:\nThere are no significant changes in the contractual obligations table disclosed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the September 30, 2017 Annual Report.\nAs at March 31, 2018, Lantic had commitments to purchase a total of 1,502,000 metric tonnes of raw sugar, of which 273,054 metric tonnes had been priced for a total dollar commitment of $121.0 million.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2018, the Company entered into an additional two years agreement with the Alberta Sugar Beet Growers (“ASBG”) for the 2019 and 2020 crops, to be harvested and processed in fiscal 2020 and 2021.\nCapital resources:\nOn December 20, 2017, the Company amended its existing revolving credit facility thereby increasing its available credit by $40.0 million by drawing additional funds under the accordion feature embedded in the revolving credit facility (“Additional Accordion Borrowings”). As a result of the amended revolving credit facility and the Additional Accordion Borrowings, the Company has a total of $315.0 million of available working capital from which it can borrow at prime rate, LIBOR rate or under bankers’ acceptances, plus 20 to 250 basis points, based on achieving certain financial ratios. As at March 31, 2018, a total of $391.4 million have been pledged as security for the revolving credit facility, compared to $339.7 million as at April 1, 2017, including trade receivables, inventories and property, plant and equipment. The maturity date of the amended revolving credit facility is June 28, 2022.\nAt March 31, 2018, $204.0 million had been drawn from the working capital facility and $6.0 million in cash was also available.\nCash requirements for working capital and other capital expenditures are expected to be paid from available cash resources and funds generated from operations. Management believes that the unused credit under the revolving facility is adequate to meet any future cash requirements.\nOUTSTANDING SECURITIES\nDuring the quarter, some holders of the Fifth series debentures converted a total of $10 thousands into 1,388 common shares. As a result, a total of 105,744,940 shares were outstanding as at March 31, 2018 and May 1, 2018.\nOn March 28, 2018, the Company issued $85.0 million of 4.75% Seventh series debentures, maturing June 30, 2025, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each year, starting June 30, 2018. The Seventh series debentures may be converted at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $8.85 per share (representing 9,604,519 common shares) at any time prior to maturity, and cannot be redeemed prior to June 30, 2021. On or after June 30, 2021and prior to June 30, 2023, the Seventh series debentures may be redeemed by the Company only if the weighted average trading price of the share, for 20 consecutive trading days, is at least 125% of the conversion price of $8.85. Subsequent to June 30, 2023, the Seventh series debentures are redeemable at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn April 3, 2018, the Company issued an additional $12.8 million Seventh series debentures pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment option granted by the Company. The additional Seventh series debentures carry the same term and condition as those issued on March 28, 2018 and may be converted at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $8.85 per share (representing an additional 1,440,677 common shares).\nFollowing the issuance of the Seventh series debentures on March 28, 2018, the Company used a portion of the funds to repay the Fifth series debentures totalling $60.0 million at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest as of March 28, 2018.\nOn December 4, 2017, a total of 1,065,322 share options were granted at a price of $6.23 per common share to certain executives and senior managers. Last year, on December 5, 2016, the Company granted a total of 360,000 share options to certain executives at an exercise price of $6.51. These options are exercisable to a maximum of twenty percent per year, starting after the first anniversary date of the granting of the options and will expire after a term of ten years. Upon termination, resignation, retirement, death or long-term disability, all shares granted under the Share Option Plan not vested are forfeited.\nIn addition, during the first quarter, a Performance Share Unit plan (“PSU”) was created and on December 4, 2017, a total of 224,761 PSUs were granted to executives. In addition, an aggregate of 3,145 PSUs were allocated as a result of the dividend paid during the current quarter. Therefore, an aggregate amount of 227,906 PSUs are outstanding as at March 31, 2018. These PSUs will vest at the end of the 2017-2020 Performance Cycle based on the achievement of total shareholder returns set by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (“HRCC”) and the Board of Directors of the Company. The value to be paid-out to each participant will be equal to the result of: the number of PSUs granted to the participant which have vested, multiplied by the volume weighted average closing price of the Common Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) for the five trading days immediately preceding the day on which the Company shall pay the value to the participant under the PSU Plan.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThere were no significant changes in the critical estimate and accounting policies disclosed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the September 30, 2017 Annual Report, except as follows:\n• Employee benefits:\nCash-settled performance share units:\nDuring the first quarter, the Company implemented a Performance Share Units plan (“PSUs”) entitling executives to a cash payment. A liability is recognized for the services acquired and is recorded at fair value based on the share price of the Company’s Common Shares in payables with a corresponding expense recognized in administration and selling expenses. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of units for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the units of awards that meet the related service and market performance conditions at the vesting date. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings of the period.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe significant accounting policies as disclosed in the Company’s audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2017 have been applied consistently in the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements except as noted below:\nIAS 7, Disclosure Initiative:\nOn January 7, 2016 the IASB issued Disclosure Initiative (amendments to IAS 7). The amendments apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017. Earlier application is permitted.\nThe amendments require disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, includes both changes arising from cash flow and non-cash changes. One way to meet this new disclosure requirement is to provide a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances for liabilities from financing activities.\nThe Company adopted the amendments to IAS 7 in its consolidated financial statements for the annual period beginning on October 1, 2017. The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on the consolidated interim financial statements. IAS 12, Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses :\nOn January 19, 2016 the IASB issued Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses (Amendments to IAS 12). The amendments apply retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017. Earlier application is permitted.\nThe amendments clarify that the existence of a deductible temporary difference depends solely on a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset and its tax base at the end of the reporting period, and is not affected by possible future changes in the carrying amount or expected manner of recovery of the asset. The amendments also clarify the methodology to determine the future taxable profits used for assessing the utilization of deductible temporary differences.\nThe Company adopted the amendments to IAS 12 in its consolidated interim financial statements for the annual period beginning on October 1, 2017. The adoption of the amendments did not have an impact on the consolidated interim financial statements. Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards (2014-2016) Cycle:\nOn December 8, 2016 the IASB issued narrow-scope amendments to three standards as part of its annual improvements process. Each of the amendments has its own specific transition requirements and effective date.\nAmendments were made to the following standard: Clarification that IFRS 12, Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities also applies to interests that are classified as held for sale, held for distribution, or discontinued operations, effective retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017.\nThe Company adopted the amendment in its consolidated interim financial statements for the annual period beginning October 1, 2017. The adoption of the amendments did not have an impact on the consolidated interim financial statements.\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES NOT YET ADOPTED\nA number of new standards, and amendments to standards and interpretations, are not yet effective and have not been applied in preparing these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements. New standards and amendments to standards and interpretations that are currently under review include:\nIFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers :\nOn May 28, 2014 the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . IFRS 15 will replace IAS 11 Construction Contracts , IAS 18 Revenue , IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes , IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate , IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers , and SIC 31 Revenue – Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services . The new standard is effective for years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Earlier application is permitted.\nThe standard contains a single model that applies to contracts with customers and two approaches to recognizing revenue: at a point in time or over time. The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. New estimates and judgmental thresholds have been introduced, which may affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognized.\nThe new standard applies to contracts with customers. It does not apply to insurance contracts, financial instruments or lease contracts, which fall in the scope of other IFRSs.\nThe Company intends to adopt IFRS 15 in its consolidated financial statements for the year beginning on September 30, 2018. The extent of the impact of adoption of the standard on the consolidated financial statements of the Company has not yet been determined. IFRS 16, Leases :\nOn January 13, 2016 the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases . The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of initial adoption of IFRS 16. IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 Leases .\nThis standard introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.\nThis standard substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements of IAS 17, while requiring enhanced disclosures to be provided by the lessors. Other areas of the lease accounting model have been impacted, including the definition of a lease. Transitional provisions have been provided.\nThe Company intends to adopt IFRS 16 in its consolidated financial statements for the annual period beginning on September 29, 2019. The extent of the impact of adoption of the standard on the consolidated financial statements of the Company has not yet been determined.\nAdditional new standards, and amendments to standards and interpretations, include: IFRS 2, Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions , Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards (2014-2016) Cycle and (2015-2017) Cycle, IFRIC 22, Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration and IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments . The Company intends to adopt these new standards, and amendments to standards and interpretations, in its consolidated financial statements in each of their respective annual period for which they become applicable. The extent of the impact of adoption of these new standards, and amendments to standards and interpretations, has not yet been determined. Refer to note 3 (d) to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for more detail.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisk factors in the Company’s business and operations are discussed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our Annual Report for the year ended September 30, 2017. This document is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on one of our websites at www.lantic.ca or www.rogerssugarinc.com .\nOUTLOOK\nIn fiscal 2018, we expect the industrial and consumer market segment to decrease slightly compared to fiscal 2017.\nThe liquid market segment should continue to be strong, benefitting from some growth with existing customers, the recapture of some of the volume loss in fiscal 2017 and the benefit of a full year of supply to a large bottler account in Western Canada. As a result, we expect the liquid market segment to surpass fiscal 2017 by approximately 10,000 metric tonnes.\nAs for the export segment, additional volume was booked during the quarter for high tier sales to the U.S. and therefore, we now anticipate an increase from our previous outlook from approximately 5,000 metric tonnes to approximately 10,000 metric tonnes. The improvement in volume compared to fiscal 2017 is expected to come from additional sales to Mexico and U.S. high tier opportunistic sales.\nOverall, we expect total volume to increase by approximately 10,000 metric tonnes.\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company will benefit from a full year of operations for LBMT and approximately ten months for Decacer, since its acquisition on November 18, 2017. The Maple products segment is comprised of both LBMT and Decacer. As of February 1, 2018 and as previously communicated, Management’s expectations for the Adjusted EBITDA of LBMT and Decacer were $18.4 million and $4.5 million, respectively, for fiscal 2018 and $20.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively, for fiscal 2019. As a result, the anticipated Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA was expected to total $22.9 million for fiscal 2018 and $25.6 million for fiscal 2019. As of the date of this MD&A, Management now anticipates that the Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 will be lower than expected and should amount to $19.9 million and $21.1 million for fiscal 2019.\nThe lower than anticipated results for the 2018 fiscal year are mainly attributable to a reduction in sales, foreign exchange impact and delays in operational excellence synergies for LBMT, due to the acquisition of Decacer. To date, revenues for the Maple product segment were below expectations as a result of some customer losses due to strategic reasons and/or competitive activities and the impact on the Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA from the lower than expected revenues should be approximately $1.0 million. Secondly, due to a stronger Canadian dollar versus last year, foreign exchange on sales booked prior to the LBMT acquisition and hedged after, had a negative impact for the first six months of the year and is expected to continue into the second half of the year to total approximately an $0.8 million, which would explain a portion of the lower than previously anticipated Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA. Finally, following the acquisition of Decacer, the Company delayed implementing some of the operational excellence synergies for LBMT as to include the newly acquired assets of Decacer and therefore delaying the implementation of the overall operational efficiencies into fiscal 2020. As a result of the delays, Management has lowered its anticipated operational excellence synergies for the Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 by approximately $0.9 million. The above items mainly explain the $3.0 million lower than anticipated results for the fiscal 2018 Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA that is now expected as of the date of this MD&A.\nWith regards to fiscal 2019, the lower than anticipated 2018 Maple products segment Adjusted EBITDA is expected to carry through into next year. In addition, the lost sales experienced in the last six months are not expected to be recovered through higher than planned sales growth in fiscal 2019, which would have a negative impact of approximately $0.5 million. In addition, the analysis undertaken of all our Maple operations, as discussed above, will take an additional year to be implemented. Finally, syrup procurement costs are expected to be slightly higher in fiscal 2019 due to the mixed results from the spring 2018 harvest season, which would impact a portion of next fiscal year.\nTurning back to the Sugar segment, we expect energy costs to increase by approximately $1.5 million in fiscal 201",
