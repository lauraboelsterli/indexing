    "text": "LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Patron Capital, the pan-European institutional investor focused on property backed investments, has acquired ‘Le Magnum’, an office building located in one of the most sought-after locations of Greater Paris in Levallois-Perret. Patron acquired the building for €71.5 million from the open-ended real estate fund Deka-Immobilien Europa with the support of Cleaveland, Patron’s asset management partner.\nBuilt in 1994 and renovated in 2008-2009, the postmodernist property offers 10,550 sqm of floor space and is fully leased to L’Oréal, the French cosmetic products manufacturer, until the middle of 2019. Patron plans to redevelop the building to provide a contemporary, high-quality headquarters office building, fitting with its immediate neighborhood, designed to attract first-class tenants.\nThe acquisition was made via Patron’s latest fund, Patron Capital, L.P. V.\nKeith Breslauer, Managing Director of Patron Capital, said:\n“In a prime and increasingly popular location close to Paris’s CBD, this property represents an exceptional opportunity to add value through asset management and an in-depth understanding of the local property market.\n“Having raised €949 million to invest in property and property-related investments in Western Europe, and with a history of over 18 years investing in France, we currently see significant potential in France and are actively looking to acquire further assets and platforms to grow our portfolio within this market.”\nDominique Bonin, Co-Founder of Cleaveland, added:\n“This is a building with significant value creation potential in one of the most prime districts of Greater Paris. We are pleased to be continuing our long-standing partnership with Patron Capital to reposition Le Magnum to create a sustainable office building with very high specifications.”\n-ends-\nNotes to Editors\nAbout Patron Capital Partners\nPatron represents approximately €3.4 billion of capital across several funds and related co-investments, investing in property, corporate operating entities whose value is primarily supported by property assets and distressed debt and credit related businesses.\nSince it was established in 1999, Patron has invested in over 74 investments and programs involving over 65 million square feet (6 million square metres) in 16 countries and a significant focus in France, with many of these investments realised.\nInvestors represent a variety of sovereign wealth funds, prominent universities, major institutions, private foundations, and high net worth individuals located throughout North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
