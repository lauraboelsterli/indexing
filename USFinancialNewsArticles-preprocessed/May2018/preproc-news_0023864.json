On an earnings call in December, Mr. Iger said that Mr. Murdoch would help integrate the companies “and during that period of time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not.” Inside Disney, a role for Mr. Murdoch was always seen as uncertain, according to people familiar with the matter.
