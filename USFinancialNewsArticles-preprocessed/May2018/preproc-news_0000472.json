Attunity adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method, which means that the comparative financial information for first quarter 2017 has not been restated in the current financial statements under the new accounting standard. Accordingly, the percentage changes from the 2017 to 2018 periods differ from what they would have been had the same accounting standards been in effect for both periods. In the interest of comparability during the transition year to ASC 606, the company has provided revenue, operating expenses, operating income (loss), financial income, taxes on income, net income (loss) and earnings per share information in accordance with both ASC 606 and revenue recognition rules in effect prior to the adoption of ASC 606 (ASC No. 985-605, or ASC 605). For further details, see the Impact of the Adoption of ASC 606 table later in this press release and the note thereto.\n(**) Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Attunity uses Non-GAAP measures of net income (loss), operating expenses, operating profit (loss), and diluted net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude amortization associated with acquisitions, equity-based compensation expenses, non-cash financial expenses, such as the effect of a revaluation of liabilities presented at fair value, and the effect of changes in deferred taxes related to non-GAAP adjustments. Attunity's management believes the non-GAAP financial information provided in this release is useful to investors' understanding and assessment of Attunity's on-going core operations and prospects for the future. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP information in evaluating and operating its business internally and as such has determined that it is important to provide this information to investors. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. For further details, see the Reconciliation of Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information table later in this press release.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other applicable securities laws. Statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words \"believes\", \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"plans\", and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as \"will\", \"should\", \"would\", \"may\" and \"could\" are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. For example, when we discuss the demand for our products, improved visibility and our updated outlook for 2018, we are using forward-looking statements. In addition, announced results 2018 are preliminary, unaudited and subject to year-end audit adjustment. Because such statements deal with future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties and actual results, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, could differ materially from Attunity's current expectations. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to: our history of operating losses and ability to achieve or sustain profitability; our business and operating results dependency on the successful and timely implementation of our third party partner solutions; the lengthy sales cycle of our products; competition; acquisitions, including costs and difficulties related to integration of acquired businesses and impairment charges; global economic conditions; the potential loss of one or more of our significant customers or a decline in demand from one or more of these customers; timely availability and customer acceptance of Attunity's new and existing products; risks relating to proprietary rights and risks of infringement; loss of the services of our key personnel; international operations; and other factors and risks on which Attunity may have little or no control. This list is intended to identify only certain of the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting Attunity, reference is made to Attunity's latest Annual Report on Form 20-F which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the other risk factors discussed from time to time by Attunity in reports filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Except as otherwise required by law, Attunity undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nThe contents of any website or hyperlinks mentioned in this press release are for informational purposes and the contents thereof are not part of this press release.\n© Attunity 2018.
