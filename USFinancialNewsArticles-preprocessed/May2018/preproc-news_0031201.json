    "text": "SILVER SPRING, Md., May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Retacrit (epoetin alfa-epbx) as a biosimilar to Epogen/Procrit (epoetin alfa) for the treatment of anemia caused by chronic kidney disease, chemotherapy, or use of zidovudine in patients with HIV infection. Retacrit is also approved for use before and after surgery to reduce the chance that red blood cell transfusions will be needed because of blood loss during surgery.\n\"It is important for patients to have access to safe, effective and affordable biological products and we are committed to facilitating the development and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable products,\" said Leah Christl, Ph.D., director of the Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars Staff in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Biosimilars can provide greater access to treatment options for patients, increasing competition and potentially lowering costs.\"\nBiological products are generally derived from a living organism and can come from many sources, such as humans, animals, microorganisms or yeast. A biosimilar is a biological product that is approved based on data showing that it is highly similar to a biological product already approved by the FDA (reference product) and has no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity and potency (i.e., safety and effectiveness) from the reference product, in addition to meeting other criteria specified by law.\nThe FDA's approval of Retacrit is based on a review of evidence that included extensive structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, clinical immunogenicity data and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrates Retacrit is biosimilar to Epogen/Procrit. Retacrit has been approved as a biosimilar , not as an interchangeable product.\nThe most common side effects of epoetin alfa-treated patients in clinical studies of the reference product were high blood pressure, joint pain, muscle spasm, fever, dizziness, medical device malfunction, blood vessel blockage, respiratory infection, cough, rash, injection site irritation, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, inflammation of the mouth and lips, weight decrease, reduction in white blood cells, bone pain, high blood sugar, insomnia, headache, depression, difficulty swallowing, low blood potassium, blood clots, itching, headache, injection site pain and chills.\nLike Epogen/Procrit, Retacrit must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that provides information about the drug's uses and risks. In addition, as with Epogen/Procrit, Retacrit contains a Boxed Warning to alert health care professionals and patients about increased risks of death, heart problems, stroke and tumor growth or recurrence. Additional warnings include high blood pressure, seizures, a condition in which the bone marrow stops making red blood cells thus causing anemia, serious allergic reactions and severe skin reactions.\nThe FDA granted approval of Retacrit to Hospira Inc., a Pfizer company.\nFor more information:\nFDA: Biosimilar Product Information\nFDA: Information on Biosimilars\nFDA: Office of Hematology and Oncology Products\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\nMedia Inquiries: Sandy Walsh, 301-796-4669, sandy.walsh@fda.hhs.gov\nConsumer Inquiries: 888-INFO-FDA\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-first-epoetin-alfa-biosimilar-for-the-treatment-of-anemia-300648734.html\nSOURCE U.S. Food and Drug Administration",
