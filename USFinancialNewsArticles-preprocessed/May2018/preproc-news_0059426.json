Elias Y. Biam joined CDS as the Director of Business Development for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Additionally, Aidan McArdle was appointed the Director of Partner Enablement for EMEA. Biam and McArdle will report to Ron Croce, Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing at CDS. This announcement falls on the heels of CDS strengthening its global partnerships with the major data storage technology vendors including Dell EMC , HPE , Pure Storage , NetApp and INFINIDAT .\n“CDS continues to bolster its global capabilities as we build stronger connections with our customers and partners who are driving digital transformation through new data center functionality,” said Ron Croce, Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing, Cirrus Data Solutions, Inc. “The demand for data management solutions continues to accelerate as new data storage solutions add significant business benefits to organizations worldwide. Our European team has achieved impressive growth in the last eighteen months and with our new appointments we expect to accelerate this trend.”\n“By committing more resources to the European market, Cirrus Data Solutions is strengthening its market position in Europe and across the globe,” said Elias Biam, Director, EMEA Business Development. “My decision to join CDS was based on firsthand accounts of the DMS’s technological superiority.
