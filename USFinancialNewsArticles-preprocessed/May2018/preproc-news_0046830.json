    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 1:55 AM / Updated 26 minutes ago Westfield shareholders approve Unibail-Rodamco $16 billion takeover offer Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Shareholders of Westfield Corp ( WFD.AX ), an Australian shopping mall giant, voted in favour of a $16 billion (12 billion pounds) takeover offer from Unibail-Rodamco ( UNBP.AS ), Westfield Chairman Frank Lowy said on Thursday, closing the biggest takeover offer of an Australian company on record. A Westfield Corp sign adorns the side of a building in central Sydney, Australia, December 12, 2017. REUTERS/David Gray\nThis was the final lap for the takeover, having already received the green signal from Unibail’s shareholders, boards of both companies, and Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board.\nUnibail, Europe’s biggest property firm, and Westfield announced the deal in December, looking to create a global leader in a sector that is grappling with the online shopping challenges led by Amazon.\nShares of Westfield had jumped nearly 15 percent on December 13 after the deal was announced.\nWestfield shares were down 0.3 percent on Thursday, in line with the broader market’s decline of 0.2 percent.
