REUTERS/Feisal Omar\nSituated at the northern tip of east Africa on the Gulf of Aden, Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991.\n“In the last 24 hours, heavy stormy rains killed 15 people in the districts of Lughaya and Baki,” Abdirahman Ahmed Ali, governor of the Awdal area told reporters on Sunday.

People who live there are divided over which side to back. Last week, dozens of people were killed in clashes between troops from the two sides.\n“Due to the dispute over the regions of Sool and Sanaag and lack of access to some affected areas after the destruction of roads, the situation of affected populations and impediments caused by blocked roads and failed communications, the extent of the damage is yet to be fully confirmed,” the UN said.
