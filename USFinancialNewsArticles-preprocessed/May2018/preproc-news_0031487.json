    "text": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SenesTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNES), a developer of proprietary technologies for managing animal pest populations through fertility control, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial and operational results.\nSenesTech will hold a conference call today at 5:00pm ET (2:00 PT) to discuss these results and expectations for the coming year.\nKey commercial and recent highlights:\nReached distribution agreements with two new distributors, bringing total distributor relationships to four; Partnered with Pestmaster Services, a national pest management professional (PMP); Established relationships with 5 additional regional PMPs during the quarter; Expanded the SenesTech sales team dedicated to supporting the distribution and PMP partners across the US to eight professionals, including the appointment of 20-year Orkin executive Joe Malinowski as Vice President of Sales in February 2018; Adjusted our product messaging and market outreach to focus on attracting new pest management professional (PMP) customers; Patent issued on \"Reducing The Reproductive Capacity Of Mammals.\" This intellectual property is a key aspect of ContraPest ® , SenesTech's flagship product that targets the reproductive capabilities of Norway and roof rats; and Improved manufacturing efficiencies expected to lower the cost of goods sold and increase throughput.\nManagement Discussion\nDr. Loretta Mayer, Chair and CEO of SenesTech, commented, \"The financial results for the quarter do not tell the whole story – a story which includes a successful change in strategic direction for the acquisition of new customers that we have undertaken in order to drive revenue in 2018 and beyond.\"\nTom Chesterman, EVP and CFO continued, \"Based on our learnings over the past year, we have adjusted our product messaging and market outreach to focus on attracting PMP customers. This strategy places the PMP and the benefits to them at the center of the conversation. Specifically, we are messaging how ContraPest can be a highly effective solution whether as a fertility-control anchor to magnify the success of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, or as a standalone, non-lethal solution for customers looking to reduce or eliminate the use of lethal methodologies. Our potential new customers have received this messaging well, and we believe that will be manifested in revenue in the coming quarters.\"\n\"The distribution relationships we established last year with Univar and Target Specialty Products, and most recently with two more distributors, have created market access to many of the leading PMPs around the United States. These agreements, along with enhancements to our manufacturing operations, have created the infrastructure to effectively and efficiently move product to our end-user customers.\"\n\"In addition to our improved messaging and expanded points of distribution access, we have allocated additional resources to sales and marketing through the hiring of 20-year Orkin executive, Joe Malinowski, and the addition of four new sales professionals over the last six weeks. This additional expertise will ensure we are able to not only provide the highest level of support to our distribution and PMP partners, but also continue to support the education about and deployment of ContraPest.\"\n\"We know ContraPest works, from scientific studies, from field trials and from positive early reports and testimonials from reference customers. Building on these experiences, we have repositioned our messaging to address the benefits to our most important PMP partners, have taken the steps necessary to build out an infrastructure to support large scale deployment, and have built a sales team capable of driving adoption.\"\nDr. Mayer resumed, \"One of our board members, Marc Dumont, who has seen and commercialized innovative products before, recently remarked, 'Senestech has reached the bottom of the J-curve, which is traditionally experienced when creating, getting approval and introducing a disruptive technology product in an existing market. SenesTech is manufacturing a patented product, approved by the EPA and is encountering resistance to innovation in the traditional rodenticide world market. The company is spending time and money and making substantial efforts to get through with its disruptive technology and is determined to prevail.' We are confident that 2018 will show the results of these actions to position SenesTech for long-term success. As has been said by others, it is not a question of if , it is a question of when . These recent achievements are closing in on the when .\"\nEarly PMP adopters and reference customers have relayed their success with ContraPest:\nA PMP in Texas has seen a significant reduction of rat population and effort required for station maintenance at a large customer location where ContraPest was deployed along with other IPM techniques. The owner of a PMP in New York City shared that, after using ContraPest as a complement to its IPM protocol within larger housing structures, they saw success in reducing infestations that previously were not responding without ContraPest. The PMP continues to expand the use of ContraPest as part of their IPM protocols on other sites, and with customers looking for a non-lethal solution for a rat infestations. A PMP in the mid-Atlantic area reported that its customer saw a dramatic reduction in rat population levels after the deployment of ContraPest. This report was supported by photographic evidence of population decline and no immature rat sightings after ContraPest deployment. An animal facility in the south-Atlantic area over several months saw photographic evidence that ContraPest successfully controlled a major rat infestation that the use of poisons alone were unsuccessful in managing . Based on successful results in a controlled study, SenesTech is now supplying a metropolitan PMP that is rolling out ContraPest across a large transit system.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues from product sales during Q1 2018 were $19,000, compared to $7,000 of revenue from product sales during Q1 2017.\nOperating expenses during Q1 2018 were approximately $2.7 million, compared to approximately $3.5 million during Q1 2017. Operating expenses during Q1 2018 included non-cash equity compensation of $0.7 million. The decrease in operating expense was attributable to decreases in net salary costs and professional service fees, and a decrease in R&D related-activities. The Company anticipates that operating cash utilization will continue at or below $750,000 per month.\nNet loss during Q1 2018 was approximately $2.7 million or $0.16 per share, compared to approximately $3.5 million, or $0.34 per share, during Q1 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure of operating performance, was $(1.8) million during Q1 2018, compared to $(2.3) million during Q1 2017.\nCash, cash equivalents and highly liquid investments at the end of the first quarter were approximately $4.8 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call Details\nDate and Time : 5:00 pm ET (2:00 pm PT) on Monday, May 14, 2018\nCall-in Information : Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (844) 308-3351 or (412) 317-5407.\nLive Webcast Information: Interested parties can access the conference call via a live Internet webcast, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at http://senestech.investorroom.com/ .\nTo Ask a Question : The conference call will be moderated by Lytham Partners, an investor relations firm.

However, this measure is not intended to be a substitute for those financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has been included because management believes that, when considered together with the GAAP figures, it provides meaningful information related to our operating performance and liquidity and can enhance an overall understanding of financial results and trends. See our attached financials for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.\nAbout SenesTech\nSenesTech is changing the paradigm of pest management by targeting the root cause of the problem: reproduction.\nContraPest ® is an innovative technology that targets the reproductive capabilities of Norway and roof rats. As a highly palatable liquid, the formulation promotes sustained consumption, helping to reduce fertility in both male and female rats, bringing populations down and keeping them down. Our delivery system is designed to minimize handler exposure, and ContraPest is dispensed inside tamper resistant bait stations, minimizing the risks to non-target species.\nAs a versatile tool, ContraPest can be used within Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs to help reduce reproduction and magnify the success of IPM protocols or as a standalone, non-lethal solution for customers that are looking to reduce or eliminate the use of lethal methodologies.\nContraPest is a Restricted Use Pesticide, due to applicator expertise. Please read and comply with all label instructions.
