    "text": "CHESTER, N.Y., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Liberated Solutions, Inc. (OTC PINK:LIBE) is pleased to announce it has executed a letter of intent to acquire Sterling Global Products, LLC., and all its assets. Financial terms will be available once the closing contracts and auditing process has been completed.\nSterling Global Products, LLC.; is a Louisiana based company owned and operated by Robert Delaney. Mr. Delaney is the inventor of a unique, eco-friendly, refillable, hanging flushable wipe dispenser and a disposable, biodegradable flushable wipe. Mr., Delaney, who is a builder by trade came up with idea when he noticed that his sub-contractors would routinely bring baby wipes into the portable facilities. The dispenser which is patented and trademarked in the USA hangs on any toilet paper holder and comes in three brands targeted to Men, Women and Children.\n“Current Baby/Personal wipe sales in Food, Drug and Mass are $1.4 billion per year. A 1% share amounts to over $14 million in revenue,” stated Mr. Delaney, CEO of Sterling Global Products. “In pursuit of this market share, we’ve launched our first three products in retail stores such as Bed, Bath & Beyond, United Supermarkets, Brookshire Brothers, Academy Sports, Camping World, Rouses, Associated Grocers Baton Rouge just to name a few. By operating under Liberated, we’re looking to not only add additional retail chains nation-wide, but to also place our commercial dispensers for public restrooms in Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Airports, Hotels and Office buildings.”\n\"This is an exciting opportunity for Liberated to step outside the energy and real estate industries to acquire an eco-friendly company and build out our Lifestyle brand,\" said Brian Conway, CEO. \"Financially for our shareholders, it’s rewarding because the positive earnings relinquish our dependence upon debt-based financing and allows us to seek non-dilutive, asset-based opportunities.”\nAbout Liberated Solutions, Inc.\nLiberated Solutions, Inc. is a diversified green energy services holding company delivering conventional as well as non-conventional Eco-friendly solutions throughout North America.
