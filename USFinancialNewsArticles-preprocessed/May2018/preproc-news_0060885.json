    "text": "LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) â€” Authorities say a Tesla sedan in Autopilot mode crashed into a parked police cruiser in Southern California.\nPolice Sgt. Jim Cota says the officer was not in the cruiser at the time of the crash Tuesday in Laguna Beach.\nCota says the Tesla driver suffered minor injuries.\nThe police SUV ended up with its two passenger-side wheels on a sidewalk.\nTesla's semi-autonomous Autopilot mode has come under scrutiny following other collisions. The carmaker says the function is not designed to avoid a collision and warns drivers not to rely on it entirely.",
