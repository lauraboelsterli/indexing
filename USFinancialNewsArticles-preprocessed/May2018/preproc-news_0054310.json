    "text": "ISTANBUL, May 25 (Reuters) - Turkeyâ€™s central bank will allow the repayment of some rediscount credits for export and foreign exchange earning services to be repaid in Turkish lira, it said on Friday, a move designed to ease the strain from the currency sell-off.\nThe step corresponds to about $3.5 billion of repayments, bankers said.\nCompanies will be able to repay the discount credits at a fixed exchange rate of 4.2 lira to the dollar, 4.9 to the euro and 5.6 to the pound sterling, it said in a statement.\nThe lira was at 4.7460 to the dollar at 0657 GMT.
