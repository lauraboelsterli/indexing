    "text": "0 COMMENTS Chairman & CEO MDC Partners Scott Kauffman Photo: Getty Images MDC Partners Inc.’s MDCA -8.76% shares plunged 33% after the advertising company reported disappointing first quarter earnings and downgraded its full-year guidance.\n“The start of 2018 has been challenging,” said Scott Kauffman, MDCs chief executive. He blamed slow development of new business, client cutbacks and new accounting regulations.\nThe New York ad firm, which owns agencies such as Crispin Porter+Bogusky and 72andSunny, reported a net loss of $29.4 million for the first quarter.\nRevenue for the quarter, adjusted for new accounting guidelines, totaled $327 million, down 5% from a year ago. The accounting change was a primary reason for the decline.\nThe company also lowered its full-year forecast for growth in organic revenue -- a closely-watched figure in the ad industry that strips out acquisitions, disposals and currency -- to between 1% and 3%. It is “no longer realistic” for the company to reach 4% organic growth, added Mr. Kauffman.\nAn investor in the company, Leon Cooperman of hedge fund Omega Advisors, signaled his frustration on MDC’s call Wednesday evening with analysts and investors.\n“I’ve held on for so long because I was hoping the industry would be consolidated, but I’m wondering whether with the advent of digital media, Google and Facebook ’s effect on the advertising business, whether the franchise is worth less than I would have thought,” said Mr. Cooperman.\nMr. Kauffman said there is a “lot of unrecognized value in the portfolio” and the company is “vigorously pursuing any and all options to realize that value.”\nMDC’s shares, which have declined 55% since the beginning of the year, were at $4.57 in early trading on Thursday.\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com",
