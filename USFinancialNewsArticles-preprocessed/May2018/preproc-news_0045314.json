CAIXIN MEDIA via REUTERS\nFinancial opening also should an orderly process to control any risks that could arise, said Huang Yiping, a member of a member of the People’s Bank of China’s monetary policy committee.\nBeijing has promised to reduce or remove market entry barriers to foreign firms in its financial market, and the United States has pushed China to allow greater foreign access to its domestic market as part of broader trade negotiations.\n“I think our financial services market should open further. But we should be more cautious with the capital account, with capital flows,” said Huang.\nChina has pledged to open its capital account further, but has proceeded cautiously due to concerns capital outflows could increase, putting downward pressure on the yuan.\nCommenting on the fintech industry at the same forum, the head of Beijing’s financial office Huo Xuewen said that China needed more competition from foreign financial institutions in order to make China’s financial technology industry stronger.
