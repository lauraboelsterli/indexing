    "text": "CARSON, Calif., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solis Tek, Inc. (OTCQB:SLTK), a vertically integrated cannabis technology innovator, manufacturer and distributor, is pleased to provide an update on its business transition, including expected targets and milestones for its recently acquired cannabis cultivation and processing facility in Arizona, and its first quarter 2018 operating results.\nOver the next few weeks, the Board and management plan on rebranding the corporate entity and public company name to better reflect management’s strategy to transition to high growth opportunities in legalized cannabis jurisdictions, including cultivation and processing. The Company will continue to aggressively develop and innovate its lighting division as Solis Tek Digital Lighting and its nutrients division as Zelda Horticulture.\nIn regard to the recently acquired cannabis cultivation and processing facility in Arizona, the Company has planned for 50,000 square feet of cultivation and 10,000 square feet of processing, which will be funded by the recently raised $2.5 million and future commitments from its previously disclosed financial partner. Management is targeting for processing to begin by November 2018 potentially generating up to $500,000 in processing revenue per month and targeting ramping up to $1 million per month over time. Management also expects to begin the cultivation build out imminently with its sights on a first crop in January 2019, and a capacity of producing 8,000 pounds per year, which would equate to $10 million at current wholesale prices.\nSolis Tek Chief Executive Officer, Alan Lien, commented, “We are very excited with the transformation of our business strategy and the incredible growth opportunities our team has identified in the legalized cannabis industry. We look forward to a multi-prong approach in growing our business and creating long-term shareholder value through varying segments of the legalized cannabis industry in the United States and potentially in Canada and overseas. We remain confident in our Solis Tek lighting and newly introduced Zelda Horticulture nutrients, but feel this is the right time and opportunity to expand to the touching the plant segment, which will lead to higher and more predictable revenue growth and profitability. Additional details of our plans will be announced over the next few weeks and we look forward to communicating with our current shareholders and prospective new shareholders.”\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018:\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1,011,749 and $2,901,826, respectively, a decrease of $1,890,077 or 65%. The decrease was due to several negative factors during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nSuch factors included, market instability and uncertainty, reports of over-capacity and price declines at the wholesale level. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions messaging, the Administration’s stance and announcements on marijuana enforcement, particularly the rescinding of the Cole Memorandum and giving the Federal US Attorneys “free-reign” as to enforcement priorities set a very negative tone and caused hesitation from buyers in the cannabis industry. Industry-wide build-outs slowed and were pushed-out.\nSpecific reasons to beset to Solis Tek, included a change at the Chief Executive Officer level and change of message and direction. Solis Tek had previously been a retail driven company servicing our 500+ hydro-stores targeting the home and hobbyist growers. Solis Tek restructured its sales force to five nationwide commercial cultivation account managers and had to re-program the sales team, change pricing and change marketing strategies. Its recent shift to convert to a commercial mindset, also altered its inventory strategy to longer fulfillment and lead times.\nCost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, was $533,925 and $1,781,304, respectively. Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, was $477,824 and $1,120,522, respectively. The decrease in gross profit of $642,698, or 57% was primarily due to our decrease in revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 47% compared to 39% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit percentage was due to the change in product mix sold.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3,448,271 and $4,764,655, respectively, a decrease of $1,316,384 or 28%. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, stock-based compensation expense decrease $1,857,866 to $1,780,288, compared to $3,638,154 for the prior year period. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, our SG&A increased $541,482 due to the recording of a $449,000 severance obligation to our former Chief Executive Officer, and $92,482 in increased operating expenses to support our operations.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $51,878 and $82,770, respectively, a decrease of $30,892 or 37%. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to decreased employee compensation and royalty expense.\nOther income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $2,651,620 as compared to other expense of $24,171 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in other income was due to the recording of a gain on the extinguishment of derivatives of $674,254, a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability of $2,630,052, and financing costs of $607,717, all of which did not exist during the prior year period. Interest expense increased over the prior year period by $20,798 due to our increase in borrowings.\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $370,705 compared to net loss of $3,751,987 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in net loss was due to the increase in other income and expenses, decreased operating expenses, offset by decreased revenues and gross profit as discussed above.\nAbout Solis Tek, Inc.\nSolis Tek, Inc.

However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus other expense, net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2018 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net loss $ (370,705 ) $ (3,751,987 ) Provision for income taxes - 913 Other (income) expense, net Financing costs 607,717 - Gain on extinguishment of derivatives (674,254 ) Change in fair value of derivative liability (2,630,052 ) - Interest expense 44,969 24,171 Total other (income) expense, net (2,651,620 ) 24,171 Depreciation and amortization expense 17,910 17,745 Stock-based compensation expense 1,780,288 3,663,154 Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,224,127 ) $ (46,004 ) We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; and\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nSource:Solis Tek, Inc.",
