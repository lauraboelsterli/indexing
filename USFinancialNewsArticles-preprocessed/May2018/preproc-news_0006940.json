(NASDAQ:CIGI) (TSX:CIGI) today reported operating and financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. All amounts are in US dollars.\nRevenues for the first quarter were $552.5 million, an 18% increase (14% in local currency) relative to the same quarter in the prior year, Adjusted EBITDA (note 1) was $36.1 million, up 16% (14% in local currency) and Adjusted EPS (note 2) was $0.45, a 25% increase versus the prior year quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS would have been approximately $0.01 lower excluding foreign exchange impacts. GAAP operating earnings were $15.7 million, relative to $12.8 million reported in the prior year period. GAAP diluted net earnings per common share was $0.13 for the quarter, versus $0.04 per share for the same quarter a year ago. First quarter GAAP EPS would have been approximately $0.01 lower excluding foreign exchange impacts. Operating results for the first quarter of 2018 reflect the adoption of new US GAAP revenue guidance which became effective January 1, 2018. The comparative quarter has been restated to reflect the impact of the new revenue guidance.\n“Colliers is off to a strong start in 2018, with well-balanced revenue growth from acquisitions and internally from our existing operations.

Last month we also completed the expansion and extension of our revolving credit facility, providing additional capacity for growth over the next five years. With our strong balance sheet, disciplined growth strategy, and proven track record, Colliers International is well positioned to continue expanding our global platform in 2018 and beyond,” he concluded.\nAbout Colliers International\nColliers International Group Inc.

Consolidated internal revenue growth in local currencies was 6% (note 3), led by double-digit internal growth in Sales and Lease Brokerage in the Asia Pacific region.\nSegmented Quarterly Results\nAmericas region revenues totalled $328.5 million for the first quarter compared to $283.8 million in the prior year quarter, up 15% on a local currency basis. Revenue growth was comprised of 8% contribution from recent acquisitions and 7% internal growth spread evenly across all three service lines. Adjusted EBITDA was $26.5 million, relative to $22.4 million in the prior year quarter. GAAP operating earnings were $20.0 million, relative to $12.7 million in the prior year quarter, with the prior year period impacted by acquisition-related costs.\nEMEA region revenues totalled $115.7 million for the first quarter compared to $90.8 million in the prior year quarter, up 11% on a local currency basis, comprised of 13% growth from recent acquisitions offset by a 2% decline in internal revenues. Internal revenues were impacted by a decline in Sales Brokerage activity, primarily in the UK, relative to strong results reported in the prior year period, with activity levels also impacted by timing which is expected to increase future quarters’ revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.4 million, versus a profit of $3.7 million in the prior year quarter, driven by planned investments in incremental revenue producers in major markets as well as revenue mix. The GAAP operating loss was $9.6 million for the quarter, relative to a loss of $1.0 million in the prior year quarter, with the current period impacted by acquisition-related costs and incremental acquisition-related amortization.\nAsia Pacific region revenues totalled $107.8 million for the first quarter compared to $91.2 million in the prior year quarter, up 14% on a local currency basis. Revenue growth was comprised of 12% internal growth concentrated in Sales Brokerage and Lease Brokerage, and 2% growth from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.2 million versus $6.9 million in the prior year quarter, benefitting from operating leverage attributable to higher revenues resulting from investments in personnel in Asia over the last two years. GAAP operating earnings were $9.4 million for the first quarter, relative to $5.5 million in the prior year quarter.\nGlobal corporate costs as reported in Adjusted EBITDA were $1.1 million in the first quarter, relative to $1.8 million in the prior year period, positively impacted by lower variable expenses. The corporate GAAP operating loss for the first quarter was $4.1 million, relative to a loss of $4.4 million in the prior year period.\nAdoption of New Revenue Guidance\nThe Company adopted new US GAAP revenue guidance effective January 1, 2018, which had the impact of (i) increasing the proportion of reimbursable expenses related to property management activities accounted for as revenue on a gross basis, with no impact on earnings and (ii) accelerating the recognition of revenue related to certain Lease Brokerage transactions, with an accompanying immaterial increase to earnings.\nIn connection with the adoption, the Company restated its results for the prior year first quarter ended March 31, 2017 with the following impact:\nIncrease to revenue of $43.4 million Increase to adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 million Increase to operating earnings of $2.0 million Increase to adjusted EPS of $0.04 Increase to diluted net earnings per common share of $0.04\nConference Call\nColliers will be holding a conference call on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the quarter’s results.

Such factors include: economic conditions, especially as they relate to commercial and consumer credit conditions and business spending; commercial real estate property values, vacancy rates and general conditions of financial liquidity for real estate transactions; the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates in relation to the US dollar on Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, UK pound sterling and Euro denominated revenues and expenses; competition in markets served by the Company; labor shortages or increases in commission, wage and benefit costs; disruptions or security failures in information technology systems; and political conditions or events, including elections, referenda, changes to international trade and immigration policies, and any outbreak or escalation of terrorism or hostilities.\nAdditional factors and explanatory information are identified in the Company’s Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2017 under the heading “Risk Factors” (which factors are adopted herein and a copy of which can be obtained at www.sedar.com ) and other periodic filings with Canadian and US securities regulators.

This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company's quarterly financial statements and MD&A to be made available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nNotes\n1. Reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA:\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings, adjusted to exclude: (i) income tax; (ii) other expense (income); (iii) interest expense; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) acquisition-related items; (vi) restructuring costs and (vii) stock-based compensation expense. We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our own operating performance and our ability to service debt, as well as an integral part of our planning and reporting systems. Additionally, we use this measure in conjunction with discounted cash flow models to determine the Company’s overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We present adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure because we believe such measure is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance because of the low capital intensity of the Company’s service operations. We believe this measure is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies, especially in the services industry. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, net earnings or cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA appears below.\nThree months ended (in thousands of US$) March 31 2018 2017 Net earnings $ 8,541 $ 6,800 Income tax 4,716 4,327 Other income, net (427 ) (1,229 ) Interest expense, net 2,915 2,942 Operating earnings 15,745 12,840 Depreciation and amortization 15,858 12,027 Acquisition-related items 2,253 4,208 Restructuring costs 70 734 Stock-based compensation expense 2,214 1,443 Adjusted EBITDA $ 36,140 $ 31,252 2. Reconciliation of net earnings and diluted net earnings (loss) per common share to adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share:\nAdjusted earnings per share is defined as diluted net earnings (loss) per common share, adjusted for the effect, after income tax, of: (i) the non-controlling interest redemption increment; (ii) amortization expense related to intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions; (iii) acquisition-related items; (iv) restructuring costs and (v) stock-based compensation expense. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and enhances the comparability of operating results from period to period. Adjusted earnings per share is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for diluted net earnings per share, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating this non-GAAP measure may differ from other issuers and, accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings and of diluted net earnings (loss) per share to adjusted earnings per share appears below.\nThree months ended (in thousands of US$) March 31 2018 2017 Net earnings $ 8,541 $ 6,800 Non-controlling interest share of earnings (670 ) (2,202 ) Amortization of intangible assets 8,588 6,050 Acquisition-related items 2,253 4,208 Restructuring costs 70 734 Stock-based compensation expense 2,214 1,443 Income tax on adjustments (2,423 ) (2,010 ) Non-controlling interest on adjustments (844 ) (844 ) Adjusted net earnings $ 17,729 $ 14,179 Three months ended (in US$) March 31 2018 2017 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.13 $ 0.04 Non-controlling interest redemption increment 0.07 0.08 Amortization of intangible assets, net of tax 0.14 0.09 Acquisition-related items 0.05 0.10 Restructuring costs, net of tax - 0.01 Stock-based compensation expense, net of tax 0.06 0.04 Adjusted earnings per share $ 0.45 $ 0.36 3. Local currency revenue growth rate and internal revenue growth\nPercentage revenue variances presented on a local currency basis are calculated by translating the current period results of our non-US dollar denominated operations to US dollars using the foreign currency exchange rates from the periods against which the current period results are being compared. Percentage revenue variances presented on an internal growth basis are calculated assuming acquired entities were owned for the entire current period as well as the entire prior period. Revenue from acquired entities is estimated based on the operating performance of each acquired entity for the year prior to the acquisition date. We believe that these revenue growth rate methodologies provide a framework for assessing the Company’s performance and operations excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Since these revenue growth rate measures are not calculated under GAAP, they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers.\nCOLLIERS INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC.
