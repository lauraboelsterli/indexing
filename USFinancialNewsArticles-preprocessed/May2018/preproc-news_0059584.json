    "text": "6 COMMENTS ISTANBUL—At a clothing shop in Turkey’s megalopolis late last week, there were few customers but Esra Yildirim was still in a rush.\nShe was racing to keep up with a rapid drop in the Turkish lira. Although the pajamas she sells are sewed locally, they are made with imported materials, and her supplier is hiking prices by the day.\n“I’m busy updating price tags,” the 30-year-old manager said. “Sometimes, I’m not yet finished with a pile that I have to start again.”\nOne month ahead of national elections in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking a new mandate, the fast-weakening lira has left some voters questioning a claim by the long-dominant Turkish leader that he knows the way to economic prosperity.\nThe lira, which has lost a fifth of its value against the dollar since the start of the year, has been hit by a wider storm sweeping through emerging markets caused by a sharp rise in the dollar. But Mr. Erdogan, analysts say, bears some responsibility for the bruised lira and double-digit inflation because he has publicly expressed opposition to interest rate hikes, a traditional tool to support an ailing currency.\nTurkish households have been on the front row of the lira’s slide. Their eroding spending power is on display at gas stations, in particular, because Turkey imports most of its fossil fuel.\n“I’m filling only half of my tank,” said 40-year-old Funda Sevinc, as she parked at a service station in Istanbul on Tuesday. “And we are going out less on the weekends.”\nMany economists say Turkey must signal it is committed to prodding the lira, or risk being hit by an exodus of foreign investors. But the president, who survived a military coup attempt in 2016 and has a strong base of support among small businessmen and middle-income workers, says he is opposed to high interest rates because they slow down investment. Instead, Mr. Erdogan has urged Turkish people “who have euros and dollars under their pillows” to support the national currency by buying lira.\nTurkey’s central bank did take emergency steps last week , increasing one of its interest rates by three points, and government officials have also held meetings with foreign investors. That has brought some respite for the lira, which was up more than 1% on Wednesday, trading at 4.49 to the dollar.\nSupporters of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrive for an election rally in Istanbul on Tuesday. Photo: Emrah Gurel/Associated Press “The critical question at this juncture is whether the recent Turkish lira rout has damaged President Erdogan’s polling numbers,” said Phoenix Kalen, a strategist at Societe Generale in London.\nSome recent election polls have pointed to a victory of Mr. Erdogan in the first round of the presidential ballot, on June 24, but political opponents have questioned their reliability at a time when authorities, which imposed emergency rule in the wake of the 2016 failed coup, are cracking down on independent media , the military and the judiciary.\nTurkey appears extremely polarized, with 47.8% of respondents to a May 18 survey by polling agency MetroPoll saying they disapprove of Mr. Erdogan’s policies, compared to 46.3% who approve of them—the first time disapproval has surpassed approval since June 2016. Other opinion polls suggest Turks have grown more pessimistic about the economic outlook, and the confidence of consumers, a major driver of the Turkish economy, has dropped to a five-month low in May.\nRivals to Mr. Erdogan in the presidential race have homed in on the lira’s weakness to criticize the president’s economic record.\nThe drop in the lira “will come back to us in the form of higher inflation and even higher interest rates,” Muharrem Ince, candidate for the secular Republican People’s Party, or CHP, the main opposition force in parliament, said at a rally last week.\nYet, some business owners said Mr. Erdogan was the safest bet for financial stability.\n“Yes, inflation is eating into my budget. But if this government loses, it will be chaos,” said Hasan Binkat, who runs a textile company. “I will vote for Mr. Erdogan because I don’t want my business to be ruined.”\nThe economy has traditionally been an asset for Mr. Erdogan on the campaign trail.\nHe and his ruling party Justice and Development Party, or AKP, take credit for thrusting Turkey, which was under supervision by the International Monetary Fund when he came to power 15 years ago, into the league of Group 20 economies. The Turkish economy grew 7.4% last year.\nThe lira has also been on a rollercoaster before without significant negative impact on the electoral performance of Mr. Erdogan, who hasn’t lost a vote since he rose to the national stage in 2003.\nIn recent months, however, concerns have risen over the country’s economic imbalances ,with the weakening lira and high annual inflation, which stood at close to 11% in April. Turkey is saddled with a widening current-account deficit, a key indicator of the country’s economic vulnerability.\nThe concerns spiked when Mr. Erdogan went to London earlier this month and said he aimed to play a bigger role in monetary policy. Foreign outflows from Turkish bonds amounted to $638 million in the week ended May 18, the biggest weekly outflow since November 2016, according to data from the central bank.\nIn Turkey, however, Mr. Erdogan can count on die-hard supporters.\n​​“The rise in the dollar doesn’t affect me,” said Yunus Soylemez, a 37-year-old building contractor. “Mr. Erdogan has stood up against pressure from everywhere. I will support him forever.”\nWrite to Yeliz Candemir at yeliz.candemir@wsj.com",
