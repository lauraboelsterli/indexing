(NYSE:MTX) (“MTI” or “the Company”) today reported diluted earnings per share of $1.13, excluding acquisition-related costs, for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018, compared with earnings per share of $1.07 in the prior year. Reported diluted earnings per share were $1.12, an increase of 15 percent compared with $0.97 in the prior year.\n“The Company had a solid first quarter. We saw sales growth in all four of our segments and across all geographies,” said Douglas T. Dietrich, Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, we continued to make progress on our organic growth initiatives, and recently completed the acquisition of Sivomatic which doubles the size of our pet litter business.”\nWorldwide net sales increased 6 percent to $431.3 million. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of approximately $18 million. Operating income, as reported, was $62.6 million and represented 14.5 percent of sales. Operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs, was $63.0 million and represented 14.6 percent of sales.\nSegment Information\nPerformance Materials and Specialty Minerals\nSales in the Minerals businesses, which include the Performance Materials and Specialty Minerals segments, grew 7 percent in the first quarter to $336.9 million. Operating income for the Minerals businesses was $50.3 million and operating margins represented 14.9 percent of sales.\nPerformance Materials segment sales increased 10 percent to $187.3 million. Metalcasting sales rose 19 percent on higher demand in all regions. Household, Personal Care & Specialty Products increased 18 percent driven by higher pet care revenue and increased European fabric care sales. Environmental Products sales rose 20 percent on higher volumes in the U.S., and Building Materials sales increased 9 percent due to several large projects in the U.S. These sales increases were partially offset by 19 percent lower Basic Minerals sales due to the planned exit of bulk chromite operations in South Africa. Operating income decreased $2.6 million to $26.2 million, primarily due to the decline in profits of bulk chromite of approximately $7 million. Double-digit operating income growth in Metalcasting and Household, Personal Care & Specialty Products partially offset this impact. The Performance Materials segment provides a wide range of bentonite-based and synthetic materials for industrial and consumer markets and for non-residential construction, environmental remediation and infrastructure projects worldwide.\nSpecialty Minerals segment sales, which consist of the Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) and Processed Minerals product lines, increased 2 percent to $149.6 million. Operating income decreased 1 percent to $24.1 million and represented 16.1 percent of sales. Paper PCC had a strong operational quarter while margins in the Processed Minerals product line were lower due to higher energy and manufacturing costs.\nWorldwide sales of Paper PCC, which is used mainly in the manufacturing processes of the paper industry, increased 4 percent to $97.0 million. Higher sales in Asia, Europe and Latin America were partially offset by reduced sales in North America.\nSales of Processed Minerals products decreased 1 percent to $35.6 million. Ground Calcium Carbonate sales growth of 5 percent, driven by higher volumes in the construction market, was offset by an 8 percent decrease in Talc sales. Processed Minerals products are used in the building materials, polymers, ceramics, consumer products, paints and coatings, glass and other manufacturing industries.\nRefractories and Energy Services\nSales of $94.4 million in the Service businesses, which include the Refractories and Energy Services segments, were 6 percent higher than the same period last year. Operating income for the Service businesses, excluding special items, increased 28 percent to $14.3 million and represented 15.1 percent of sales.\nRefractories segment sales increased 7 percent to $75.3 million, driven by higher sales of refractory products. The Refractories segment operating income increased 39 percent to $12.8 million and was 17.0 percent of sales, a record level. The Refractories segment provides products and services primarily to the worldwide steel industry.\nEnergy Services segment sales increased 2 percent to $19.1 million, primarily driven by higher filtration activity. Operating income was $1.5 million and represented 7.9 percent of sales. Energy Services offers a range of patented technologies, products and services for off-shore filtration and well testing to the worldwide oil and gas industry.\nAcquisition of Sivomatic Holding B.V. (“Sivomatic”)\nOn April 30, 2018, MTI completed the acquisition of Sivomatic, a leading European supplier of premium pet litter products. Sivomatic is a vertically integrated manufacturer, with production facilities in the Netherlands, Austria and Turkey. With a leading position in premier clumping products, their product portfolio spans the range of pet litter derived from bentonite, sourced predominantly from wholly-owned mines in Turkey. Sivomatic has approximately 115 employees and generated revenue of €73 million in 2017.\nThe acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand and the Company’s credit facilities, and is expected to be accretive to Minerals Technologies in 2018.\n“We’re pleased to have completed the acquisition of Sivomatic, which extends one of our core minerals-based product lines into Europe and positions us well for continued profitable growth in the pet care business,” said Mr. Dietrich. “We look forward to working with Sivomatic’s employees on a seamless integration and continuing to deliver value to our retail partners.”\nMinerals Technologies will host a conference call tomorrow, May 4, 2018 at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.

The Company's management believes these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance as inclusion of such special items are not indicative of the ongoing operating results and thereby affect the comparability of results between periods. The Company believes inclusion of these non-GAAP measures also provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of historic operating trends. (millions of dollars) Quarter Ended Apr. 1, Dec. 31, Apr. 2, 2018 2017 2017 Income from continuing operations attributable to MTI $ 39.9 $ 75.8 $ 34.6 Special items: Acquisition related transaction and integration costs 0.4 0.6 1.5 Debt modification costs and fees 0.0 0.0 3.9 Write-off of receivables for Malaysia bankruptcy 0.0 2.1 0.0 Restructuring and other items, net 0.0 8.8 0.3 Impairment of assets 0.0 5.3 0.0 Related tax effects on special items (0.1 ) (6.0 ) (2.2 ) Effect of US tax law change 0.0 (47.3 ) 0.0 Income from continuing operations attributable to MTI, excluding special items $ 40.2 $ 39.3 $ 38.1 Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items $ 1.13 $ 1.10 $ 1.07 4 ) Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures. The following is a presentation of the Company's non-GAAP free cash flow for the quarterly periods ended April 1, 2018, December 31, 2017, and April 2, 2017 and a reconciliation to cash flow from operations for such periods. The Company's management believes this non-GAAP measure provides meaningful supplemental information as management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's ability to maintain capital assets, satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Quarter Ended (millions of dollars) Apr. 1, Dec. 31, Apr. 2, 2018 2017 2017 Cash flow from continuing operations $ 35.7 $ 57.0 $ 15.9 Capital expenditures 17.9 22.5 13.1 Free cash flow $ 17.8 $ 34.5 $ 2.8 5 ) The following table reflects the components of non-operating income and deductions: (millions of dollars) Quarter Ended Apr. 1, Dec. 31, Apr. 2, 2018 2017 2017 Interest income $ 0.5 $ 0.5 $ 0.4 Interest expense (11.2 ) (11.4 ) (12.2 ) Debt modification costs and fees 0.0 0.0 (3.9 ) Foreign exchange gains (losses) (0.7 ) 0.1 0.6 Other deductions (2.0 ) (1.6 ) (1.5 ) Non-operating income (deductions), net $ (13.4 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (16.6 ) On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-07, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\".
