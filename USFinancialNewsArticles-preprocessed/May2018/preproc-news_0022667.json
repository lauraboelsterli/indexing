    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Invitae Corporation (NYSE: NVTA), one of the fastest growing genetics companies, today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Based on the growing momentum in test volume and substantial revenue growth, the company is increasing its volume guidance from accessioning 250,000 samples to accessioning more than 275,000 samples in 2018. Additionally, the company is raising its revenue guidance from at least $120 million to more than $130 million in 2018.\n\"Given the investments we've made in content and customer experience, we are now poised to become the leading provider of genetic information, as well as the partner of choice for therapeutics companies and others in the broader healthcare continuum,\" said Sean George, co-founder and chief executive officer of Invitae. \"With the resources, team and capital we have today, we have demonstrated the capability to disrupt the genetic information landscape, and we now plan to drive operating and financial leverage across the business and meaningfully reduce our cash burn by 40 to 50% as we exit 2018.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nAccessioned more than 64,000 samples in the first quarter of 2018, a 22% sequential increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 and a 150% increase over the 26,000 samples in the first quarter of 2017. Generated revenue of $27.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 9% sequential increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 and a 169% increase over the first quarter of 2017 revenue of $10.3 million. Reduced the average cost per sample to less than $280 in the first quarter of 2018, representing a 13% sequential reduction from the fourth quarter of 2017 and a 22% reduction from a $360 average cost per sample in the first quarter of 2017. Achieved positive gross profit of $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a positive gross profit of $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $1.0 million gross profit in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018, excluding cost of goods sold, were $46.1 million compared to $28.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, Invitae reported a net loss of $36.1 million, or a $0.66 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $26.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, or a $0.64 loss per share.\nCash used in operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $32.9 million, compared to $22.0 million in the same period in 2017. At March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $60.6 million. Subsequent to the quarter's close, Invitae raised $53.5 million in net proceeds from an equity offering and has access to $20 million additional debt, bringing total available capital to more than $130 million.\nRecent Highlights\nMade significant progress integrating recent acquisitions. Trained and deployed combined and expanded sales team to effectively deliver comprehensive test menu. Invested in lab build-out to transfer reproductive health technology to San Francisco to support continued volume growth. Integrated billing operations onto single platform. Expanded biopharma partnerships to more than 20 in Invitae's network, connecting patients and clinicians to treatments, clinical trials, support and advocacy groups, and research programs. A new program with Biogen to offer genetic testing at no-charge to patients suspected of having or clinically diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare, progressive, genetic, neuromuscular disease. An expanded partnership with Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. to assist clinicians in identifying Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients eligible for Sarepta's clinical trials. New collaborations with five leading rare and ultra-rare disease advocacy groups, now part of the Invitae network. No Stomach For Cancer launched the Global Gastric Cancer Registry , a program that enables patients, advocates, clinicians and researchers to share and access secure data on stomach cancers. The Bow Foundation initiated a patient network for individuals with GNAO1 disorders, an ultra-rare pediatric genetic disorder causing developmental delays and neurological symptoms. The National Tay Sachs & Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD) started a program to gather data on the GM2 Gangliosidoses, such as Tay Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease, rare neurodegenerative lysosomal disorders. The RASopathies Network launched a network aimed at gathering information across a number of rare genetic conditions associated with genetic variants in the Ras-MAPK pathway that cause developmental delays, heart defects and neurologic problems. The Spastic Paraplegia Foundation created a network for families impacted by Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia or Primary Lateral Sclerosis, a group of rare primary upper motor neuron disorders that cause progressive spasticity (stiffness) and weakness of the leg and hip muscles. Presented data at the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) annual meeting showing proactive genetic health screening reveals medically significant findings for a substantial portion of patients. Additionally, secondary findings identified through genetic testing provide a substantial yield of actionable risk factors for disease. Announced a collaboration with KEW, Inc. to develop comprehensive genomic profiling solutions to combine the benefit of germline and somatic information for the treatment of cancer.\nWebinar and Conference Call Details\nManagement will host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern / 1:30 p.m. Pacific to discuss financial results and recent developments.
