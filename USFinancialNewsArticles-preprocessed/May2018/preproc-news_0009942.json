    "text": "PLANO, Texas, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nuvectra Corporation (NASDAQ:NVTR), a neurostimulation medical device company, announced today financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nReported consolidated revenues of $10.6 million for the first quarter 2018, including total Algovita ® sales of $9.1 million. Expanded U.S. commercial team. Completed follow-on public offering of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $26.0 million in February 2018. Completed second amendment to the Company’s existing loan and security agreement and drew down second tranche for $12.5 million in February 2018.\nScott Drees, CEO, said, “We have increased our U.S. Algovita commercial team to 50 active territories and plan to continue to grow our headcount through 2018 to further expand our market presence. We expect that these recruiting efforts, together with the advancement of clinical studies and MRI submissions, should help drive further penetration in the SCS market. With respect to our Virtis™ sacral neuromodulation (SNM) system for the treatment of overactive bladder, we have filed our resubmissions with both FDA and TUV Süd. Subject to regulatory approvals we look forward to entering the large, fast-growing, and underserved European and U.S. SNM markets in 2018.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $10.6 million, a 112% increase from $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Total Algovita sales were $9.1 million, a 168% increase from $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit in the first quarter of 2018 was $5.8 million, or 55% gross margin, an increase from $2.6 million, or 52% gross margin, in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $15.4 million, a 1.3% increase from $15.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase reflects investments in the Company’s sales and marketing team, along with higher headcount offset by a reduction in R&D expense.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $(10.5) million or $(0.84) per share, compared with a net loss of $(13.1) million, or $(1.27) per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $53.9 million as of March 31, 2018, which includes total net proceeds of approximately $23.8 million from the Company’s follow-on common stock offering and cash proceeds from the draw down of $12.5 million from the Company’s credit facility both completed in February 2018.\nConference Call Information\nNuvectra will hold a conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 4:30pm ET to discuss the results.
