    "text": "By Bloomberg 9:50 AM EDT\nAmazon.com Inc. said it’s hiring 2,000 people in Boston, expanding an existing technology hub that focuses on everything from machine learning and speech science to cloud computing and robotics.\nThe Seattle-based e-commerce giant plans to open a 430,000-square-foot (39,900-square-meter) office in the city’s Seaport waterfront development by 2021, bringing the company’s total headcount in the Boston area to more than 3,500 full-time employees, Amazon said in a statement Tuesday.\n“In just a few years, we’ve grown from a handful of software developers and scientists to a team of more than 1,200, inventing new capabilities and products on behalf of millions of customers around the world,” said Rohit Prasad, Amazon’s Boston area-based vice president and head scientist of Amazon Alexa.\nAmazon’s current Boston technology employees mostly work on Alexa, Amazon Web Services and Audible, the company said. Amazon employed about 566,000 full- and part-time employees worldwide at the end of December, and on Monday announced it was hiring 3,000 people in Vancouver.\nBoston is among a list of 20 finalists to land Amazon’s second headquarters, which would create about 50,000 new jobs and cost more than $5 billion.
