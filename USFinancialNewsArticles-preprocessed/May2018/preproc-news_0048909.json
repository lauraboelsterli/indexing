It's that recognizable.\"\nThe two-story estate, located across the street from the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, went on the market last week for $11.8 million. The price isn't completely due to its Hollywood fame. Wallace Neff is a legendary architect who has built homes for the rich and famous, including Jennifer Aniston and Diane Keaton. Neff not only built this particular home in San Marino, he lived here too.\nDon Lewis In the movie, the home belonged to Cameron Diaz's character, who swapped houses with Kate Winslet's character for Christmas vacation.\nTake a look inside.\nThe Spanish eclectic-style estate has seven bedrooms and six-and-a-half baths.\nDon Lewis Winslet's character did some cooking in the home's kitchen during the movie.\nDon Lewis Built in 1928, it has many original details, like the flooring in its library.\nDon Lewis The outside features a pool and spa, a paddle tennis court and a gated motor court with a center fountain.\nThere are also various gardens and a courtyard...\nDon Lewis ...as well as several terraces.\nDon Lewis Wallace Neff homes can be found all over Southern California, like Palm Desert, Pasadena and Beverly Hills. Prince William and Kate stayed in a Wallace Neff property when they were in Hancock Park in 2011.\nAnd according to Chang, Kristen Wiig and Meryl Streep have recently moved to San Marino and Ryan Gossling looked at a house there.
