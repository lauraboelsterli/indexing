Among other things, he will identify partners who can help GfK leverage or develop innovative data solutions.\nSwinton brings exceptional experience in multiplatform measurement, including mobile, as well as building and launching new ventures in the technology and analytics markets. He co-founded RealityMine, a world-leader in consumer behavioral analytics and passive multi-platform measurement, and Lumi Mobile, one of the world's first mobile-centric market research and real-time consumer engagement platforms.\nMost recently, Swinton co-founded Crow’s Nest Ventures, which provides financial and intellectual capital to organizations pushing the boundaries in the mobile technology, consumer insight, retail, and health tech industries.\nSwinton has worked with GfK in a variety of capacities over the years. Beginning in 2014, RealityMine fused its cross-platform behavioral data with the GfK MRI database to provide deeper insights on media use, through a product called USA Touchpoints. Swinton has also worked with GfK on data integration and fusion related to KnowledgePanel® and other proprietary assets.\n“Rolfe is a pioneer in many areas that have become central to GfK’s work and mission,” said Gregg Lindner, Regional Managing Director of GfK North America. “He brings an unusual combination of measurement expertise and entrepreneurial savvy to his new role, and he is deeply familiar with GfK’s existing businesses. We know Rolfe will provide inspiration and leadership in this crucial area.”\nA Canadian who has lived in the US for many years, Swinton holds degrees from Yale University, the University of Cambridge, and INSEAD. He is based in GfK’s New York City office.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180523006193/en/\nDavid Stanton , +01 908 875 9844\nVP, MarComms\ndavid.stanton@gfk.com\nSource: GfK",
