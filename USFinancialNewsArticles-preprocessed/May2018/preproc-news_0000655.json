    "text": "CHARLES TOWN, W.Va., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Potomac Bancshares, Inc. (OTC-QB: PTBS), the one bank holding company for Bank of Charles Town (BCT), for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 earned $900 thousand or $0.27 per share compared to $1.354 million or $0.40 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Excluding the impact in the first quarter of 2017 from Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) proceeds of $670 thousand, net of a beneficiary payment and the related tax benefit on this amount, net income would have been $684 thousand or $0.20 cents per share. The increase in net income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 excluding the impact from BOLI would have been $216 thousand or a $0.07 per share increase over 2017.\nTotal assets were up $23.4 million over the first quarter of 2017 or 6%. Loans were up 2% over the same period a year ago. Deposits and cash management accounts were $23.5 million greater than 2017 or up 6.5%. While the first quarter loan growth was slower than expected, positive variances over the year ago quarter in net interest income, loan loss provision, and non-interest income excluding non-recurring income, were partly offset by a non-interest expense increase as continued growth and staffing plans were rolled out. In addition, the first quarter of 2018 was positively impacted by the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%. Credit quality remained favorable in the quarter with the non-performing asset ratio at 0.42%.\nLinked Quarter:\nLoans, net were up $1.04 million. Loans have shown an increase in each of the last two quarters. Investment securities were up $682 thousand, and deposits and cash management accounts were up $6.4 million. Decrease in net interest income of $62 thousand. Non-interest income was down slightly from $1.080 million to $1.058 million. Non-interest expense was down $211 thousand. The fourth quarter of 2017 included expense for annual incentives and various initiatives to support future growth plans including corresponding staffing initiatives and expenses.\nQ1 2018 Compared to Q1 2017:\nGrowth in net interest income of $192 thousand. Reduction in loan loss provision of $114 thousand. Non-interest income was up $31 thousand on a recurring basis. Increases in trust and wealth advisory services and Visa / MC fees were partly offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts. Non-interest expenses were up $288 thousand on a recurring basis primarily attributable to increases in salary and benefits, net occupancy expenses due to our recently completed main office renovation, legal fees, and other professional fees. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets including OREO remained relatively flat at 0.42% compared to 0.41% as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\n\"As announced last quarter we are moving ahead with our plans with expansion into Purcellville, Loudoun County, VA. We are on track to open late second quarter or early third quarter. We are excited to have a team of bankers very familiar with the Purcellville market,\" said CEO Frazier. \"In addition, we are moving forward with the launch of a loan production office in Leesburg, VA. Hiring is underway with the addition of two experienced mortgage bankers with over 20 years' experience in the Loudoun market. These new hires joined BCT in April and will eventually be situated in Leesburg, VA. This initiative is designed to help grow both mortgage fee income and business lending. Both initiatives are part of our strategy for continued expansion in growth markets,\" said CEO Frazier.\nA dividend of $0.07 per share for the second quarter was approved at the April board meeting. The dividend will be paid on May 1, 2018 to all shareholders of record on April 23, 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018 Potomac Bancshares, Inc. stock was trading at $15.30. On the same date, book value per share was $10.93. Should you need information on PTBS, feel free to contact President & CEO Alice P. Frazier.
