REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo The joint venture started operations in April and plans an initial public offering on one of the country’s stock exchanges, the Nikkei reported.\nThe new unit called ARM mini China is officially registered in the Chinese city of Shenzhen and is 51 percent owned by Chinese investors, including state-backed entities, with the British chipmaker controlling the remaining 49 per cent, the report said. s.nikkei.com/2jnQqr1\nThe IPO plan is likely to receive fast-track approval from regulators, Nikkei reported, citing sources.\nSoftBank and ARM Holdings were not immediately available for comment.\nSoftBank acquired ARM, Britain’s most valuable technology company, for $32 billion in 2016 in an all-equity deal.\nReporting by Mekhla Raina in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ",
