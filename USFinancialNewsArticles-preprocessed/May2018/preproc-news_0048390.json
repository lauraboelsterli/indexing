    "text": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aldridge Minerals Inc. (TSX-V: AGM) (“Aldridge” or the “Company”) provided a corporate update and announced today the filing of its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as at and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (the “Q1 Financials”), and the Management’s Discussion & Analysis related thereto (the “Q1 MD&A”), which are available on SEDAR and at www.aldridgeminerals.ca . All dollar amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are reported in U.S. dollars.\nHighlights\nCapital Markets - Cap i tal markets for the junior mining sector continue to be challenging in 2018, as the Company pursues financing alternatives to address its liquidity needs, including refinancing or extending its $40,000,000 debt facility that matures in September 2018. The Company has initiated discussions with Banka Kombetare Tregtare sh.a. (“BKT”) with an objective of extending the maturity date. Metal Prices - Improved metal prices have reflected positively on the financial metrics of the project. Land Access - In January 2018, the Company successfully completed the private land acquisition process, resulting in ownership and/or treasury land access of 99.5% of the 9,495,649 m 2 project area. Pasture Land Approval Outstanding - The application to convert the remaining 48,338 m 2 of pasture land (0.5% of the project area) to treasury land awaits government approval. The Company continues to work with the applicable government departments to advance the application approval process. Working Capital Deficit - At March 31, 2018, the Company’s working capital deficit (non-GAAP measure equal to current assets less current liabilities) was approximately $48,042,323 primarily due to the September 16, 2018 maturity date of the debt facility ($38,049,985) from BKT and the due dates of deferred land payments ($11,081,095). Cash Resources – At March 31, 2018, available cash totaled $1,947,985. Cash resources include cash and cash equivalents, plus restricted cash of $200,000, which related to an unused foreign exchange credit facility that was cancelled on May 1, 2018, thereby releasing the cash security to the Company.\nStrategy and Outlook\nThe Company’s short-term focus continues to be on obtaining additional financing to fund the Company’s working capital requirements, extending the maturity date of, or refinancing, the BKT Credit Facility, and/or completing a strategic transaction to address its near-term liquidity challenge and to maximize value for Aldridge shareholders.\nThe Board’s Independent Committee, which was formed in Q1 2018 to facilitate and lead the liquidity and strategic alternatives review, is exploring financing and other alternatives to address the Company’s liquidity challenges. The Independent Committee’s independent and disinterested directors will evaluate all potential transactions that may develop or are received by the Company. The Company does not intend to periodically or otherwise disclose developments with respect to the strategic alternatives review process unless the Board has approved a specific transaction or action plan, except as required by applicable law.\nThe measures taken by the Board to reduce the Company’s operating expenses have been implemented and will continue to be closely managed by the executive team.\nThe Board cautions the Company's shareholders and others considering trading in the Company's securities that there can be no assurance that the strategic alternatives review will result in a transaction or, if a transaction is undertaken, as to its terms or timing or that it will be consummated. In particular, the Company estimates, that, without additional financing, its present cash resources will be depleted by the maturity date of the BKT Credit Facility in September 2018. The Company does not currently have any source of capital other than additional debt or potential equity financings and there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available, or that the Company will be successful in re-financing the indebtedness owing under, or extending the maturity date of, the BKT Credit Facility, on acceptable terms or at all. The Company’s obligations under the BKT Credit Facility are secured by conventional security, including a pledge of all of the shares of the Company’s subsidiary in Turkey that owns or has the right to use the land on which the Company’s Yenipazar Project is located and a mortgage of the subsidiary’s mining license for the Yenipazar Project.\nSelected Financial Information\nThe following table provides selected consolidated financial information that should be read in conjunction with the Q1 2018 Financial Statements of the Company.\nTHREE MONTHS THREE MONTHS YEAR ENDED ENDED AND AS AT ENDED AND AS AT AND AS AT MARCH 31, MARCH 31, DECEMBER 31, 2018 2017 2017 Loss before income tax and discontinued operations $ (669,030) $ (622,024) $ (2,308,415) Net loss (669,030) (622,024) (2,308,415) Net loss per share (0.01) (0.01) (0.02) Cash and cash equivalents 1,747,985 1,581,296 2,551,079 Working capital (i) (48,042,323) 1,111,168 (45,107,450) Total assets 59,764,693 52,582,304 59,235,081 Total non-current liabilities (ii) 175,200 44,377,823 1,112,873 (i) Working capital equals current assets less current liabilities, and is a non-GAAP measure used by management.\n(ii) Total non-current liabilities exclude deferred revenue and environmental rehabilitation provision\nAbout Aldridge\nAldridge is a development-stage mining company focused on its wholly owned and permitted Yenipazar polymetallic VMS Project (Gold, Silver, Copper, Lead, Zinc) in Turkey. Aldridge completed the Yenipazar Optimization Study and filed the related NI 43-101 compliant technical report in May 2014, which updated the original May 2013 Feasibility Study. The Optimization Study demonstrated that the Yenipazar Project is highly robust with an after-tax NPV of US$330 million at a 7% discount rate and an after-tax IRR of approximately 32%. The Company is currently advancing the Yenipazar Project on key aspects including land acquisition and financing.\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Information\nThis news release includes certain within the meaning of Canadian securities laws.
