    "text": "Live Conference Call to be Held at 9:00 PM U.S. Eastern Time on May 14, 2018\nBEIJING, May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Phoenix New Media Limited (NYSE: FENG) (\"Phoenix New Media\", \"ifeng\" or the \"Company\"), a leading new media company in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We are delighted to start the year 2018 with solid financial and operating performance, and pleased to see that our mobile advertising remained a strong growth driver in the first quarter,\" stated Mr. Shuang Liu, CEO of Phoenix New Media. \"Our strong media DNA and our mission to provide high-quality, professional and unbiased news content allows us to stay at the forefront of the media space in the long run. During the quarter, we further enhanced our artificial intelligence solutions by adding editorial recommendations. In doing so, we have not only improved the efficiency of our content distribution and the accuracy of our audience targeting, but also enriched with humanity and value into digital media, thus further differentiating ourselves from peers. We are also building out our content ecosystem that includes both original content and we-media content. Together with our premium brand equity and synergy among our diversified business segments, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in China's rapidly growing socially responsible media industry.\"\nMs. Betty Ho, CFO of Phoenix New Media, further stated, \"We are pleased to carry the strong growth of our mobile advertising revenues, which increased by 46.3% under the old accounting standard of ASC605, into the first quarter of 2018 despite of seasonality factors. Due to the adoption of the new accounting standard of ASC606 on January 1, 2018, our total revenues decreased by 3.4% year over year to RMB284.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of adoption of the new accounting standard, or under ASC605, our total revenues would have increased by 5.2% year over year to RMB309.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net advertising revenue increased by 10.5% year-over-year, driven by the strong growth in mobile advertising revenues at 46.3% year-over-year. In addition, our gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 increased to 54.9% under the new accounting standard of ASC606 (50.0% under ASC605), from 44.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Looking forward, we will continue to differentiate our products by enhancing our content offerings, while taking strict control over our cost and expense, in order to generate long-term return to our shareholders\"\nAdoption of ASC606\nBeginning from January 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard of ASC606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (the \"new accounting standard\"). The main impact of applying the new accounting standard on the Company's financial results include, (1) sales taxes and surcharges, previously presented as a component of cost of revenues, are now presented as a reduction item of revenues, and (2) some advertising-for-advertising barter transactions, previously not recognized as revenues, are now recognized as revenues. By applying the modified retrospective method under the new accounting standard, the financial statements of prior periods are not retrospectively adjusted as the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance at January 1, 2018, the date of initial application, is not material. Accordingly, the financial data presented in the Company's financial statements for the first quarter of 2018 are in accordance with the new accounting standard while all financial data presented for the quarters of 2017 are in accordance with ASC605, Revenue Recognition (the \"old accounting standard\").\nImpact of applying the new accounting standard on the Company's unaudited financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the old accounting standard is as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nAdjustments\nOld Accounting Standard (1)\nSales Taxes And Surcharges\nBarter Transactions\nContract Fulfillment Costs\nNew Accounting Standard (2)\n(RMB in thousands)\nRevenues\n309,918\n(25,739)\n233\n-\n284,412\nNet advertising revenues\n266,284\n(23,656)\n233\n-\n242,861\nPaid services revenues\n43,634\n(2,083)\n-\n-\n41,551\nCost of revenues\n(154,887)\n25,739\n(172)\n1,087\n(128,233)\nGross profit\n155,031\n-\n61\n1,087\n156,179\nOperating expenses\n(213,384)\n-\n(645)\n-\n(214,029)\nSales and marketing expenses\n(130,574)\n-\n(645)\n-\n(131,219)\nLoss from operations\n(58,353)\n-\n(584)\n1,087\n(57,850)\nNote:\n(1) This financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is presented under the old accounting standard (ASC605).\n(2) This financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is presented under the new accounting standard (ASC606).\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nREVENUES\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB284.4 million (US$45.3 million) under the new accounting standard, which represented a decrease of 3.4% from RMB294.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet advertising revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB242.9 million (US$38.7 million) (net of advertising agency service fees and sales taxes and surcharges) under the new accounting standard, which represented an increase of 0.7% from RMB241.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nPaid services revenues [1] for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB41.6 million (US$6.6 million) under the new accounting standard, which represented a decrease of 22.2% from RMB53.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues from digital entertainment [2] for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB32.8 million (US$5.2 million) under the new accounting standard, which represented a decrease of 22.6% from RMB42.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues from games and others [3] for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB8.4 million (US$1.3 million) under the new accounting standard, which represented a decrease of 24.1% from RMB11.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nUnder the old accounting standard ASC605, total revenues for the first quarter of 2018 would have been RMB309.9 million (US$49.4 million), which would have represented an increase of 5.2% from RMB294.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nUnder the old accounting standard ASC605, net advertising revenues for the first quarter of 2018 would have been RMB266.3 million (US$42.5 million), which would have represented an increase of 10.5% from RMB241.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily attributable to a 46.3% year-over-year increase in mobile advertising revenues that was partially offset by a 26.0% year-over-year decrease in PC advertising revenues.\nUnder the old accounting standard ASC605, paid services revenues for the first quarter of 2018 would have been RMB43.6 million (US$7.0 million), which would have represented a decrease of 18.3% from RMB53.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Under the old accounting standard ASC605, revenues from digital entertainment for the first quarter of 2018 would have been RMB34.7 million (US$5.5 million), which would have represented a decrease of 17.9% from RMB42.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, due to a 30.9% decrease in the MVAS revenues mainly resulting from the decline in users' demand for services provided through telecom operators in China. Under the old accounting standard ASC605, revenues from games and others for the first quarter of 2018 would have been RMB8.9 million (US$1.4 million), which would have represented a decrease of 19.6% from RMB11.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues generated from web-based games operated on the Company's own platform.\nCOST OF REVENUES\nCost of revenues for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB128.2 million (US$20.4 million) under the new accounting standard, which represented a decrease of 21.1% from RMB162.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Under the old accounting standard, cost of revenues for the first quarter of 2018 would have been RMB154.9 million (US$24.7 million), which would have represented a decrease of 4.7% from RMB162.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Such decrease was mainly due to:\nThe sales taxes and surcharges were RMB25.8 million (US$4.1 million) in the first quarter of 2018, which was excluded from cost of revenues and recorded as a reduction item of revenues under the new accounting standard, as compared to sales taxes and surcharges of RMB24.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, which was recorded as a component of cost of revenues under the old accounting standard. Content and operational costs for the first quarter of 2018 decreased slightly to RMB105.3 million (US$16.8 million) from RMB106.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue sharing fees to telecom operators and channel partners for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 50.2% to RMB8.6 million (US$1.4 million) from RMB17.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily attributable to a decrease in the sales of MVAS products. Bandwidth costs for the first quarter of 2018 decreased slightly to RMB14.3 million (US$2.3 million) from RMB14.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Share-based compensation included in cost of revenues was RMB0.2 million (US$0.03 million) in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to RMB1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the lesser share-based compensation recognized in the first quarter of 2018 for share options granted before 2017, as the Company recognized share-based compensation, net of estimated forfeitures, on a graded-vesting basis over the vesting term of the awards.\nGROSS PROFIT\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB156.2 million (US$24.9 million), as compared to RMB132.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 54.9%, as compared to 44.8% in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the slight decrease in revenues under the new accounting standard and the more significant decrease in certain cost of revenues as explained above.\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in accordance with the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, which excluded the impact of certain reconciling items as stated in the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below. The related reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are presented in the accompanying \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Results of Operation Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures.\"\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2018, which excluded share-based compensation, was 55.0%, as compared to 45.4% in the first quarter of 2017.\nOPERATING EXPENSES AND LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 24.4% to RMB214.0 million (US$34.1 million) from RMB172.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in traffic acquisition expenses. Share-based compensation included in operating expenses was RMB3.2 million (US$0.5 million) in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to RMB6.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in share-based compensation was primarily due to the lesser share-based compensation recognized in the first quarter of 2018 for share options granted before 2017, as the Company recognized share-based compensation, net of estimated forfeitures, on a graded-vesting basis over the vesting term of the awards, and due to the fact that several batches of share options granted to employees in 2013 became fully vested in 2017 and the corresponding share-based compensation were no longer recognized in 2018.\nLoss from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB57.9 million (US$9.2 million), as compared to loss from operations of RMB40.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2018 was negative 20.3%, as compared to negative 13.6% in the first quarter of 2017, which was primarily attributable to the increase in traffic acquisition expenses.\nNon-GAAP loss from operations for the first quarter of 2018, which excluded share-based compensation, was RMB54.4 million (US$8.7 million), as compared to non-GAAP loss from operations of RMB31.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of 2018, which excluded share-based compensation, was negative 19.1%, as compared to negative 10.8% in the first quarter of 2017.\nOTHER INCOME OR LOSS\nOther income or loss reflects interest income, interest expense, foreign currency exchange gain or loss, income or loss from equity investments, including impairments, and others, net [4] . Total net other income for the first quarter of 2018 was negative RMB5.2 million (US$0.8 million), as compared to RMB4.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nInterest income for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB12.9 million (US$2.1 million), as compared to RMB12.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to RMB4.6 million (US$0.7 million), from RMB6.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, which was primarily due to the decrease in outstanding short-term bank loans in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to that in 2017. Foreign currency exchange loss for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB15.1 million (US$2.4 million), as compared to foreign currency exchange loss of RMB2.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, which was mainly caused by the further appreciation of Renminbi against US dollars in the first quarter of 2018. Loss from equity investments, including impairments, for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB2.4 million (US$0.4 million), as compared to loss from equity investments, including impairments, of RMB0.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Others, net, for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 186.9% to RMB4.1 million (US$0.7 million), from RMB1.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, which was primarily attributable to the decrease in litigation provisions as a result of the settlement of several claims in March 2018 and the increase of government subsidies received in the first quarter of 2018.\nNET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PHOENIX NEW MEDIA LIMITED\nNet loss attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB57.5 million (US$9.2 million), as compared to a net loss of RMB32.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net margin for the first quarter of 2018 was negative 20.2%, as compared to negative 10.9% in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss per diluted ADS [5] in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB0.79 (US$0.13), as compared to net loss per diluted ADS of RMB0.45 in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net loss attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited for the first quarter of 2018, which excluded share-based compensation and income or loss from equity investments, including impairments, was RMB51.7 million (US$8.2 million), as compared to non-GAAP net loss attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited of RMB23.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net margin for the first quarter of 2018 was negative 18.2%, as compared to negative 7.9% in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss per diluted ADS in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB0.71 (US$0.11), as compared to non-GAAP net loss per diluted ADS of RMB0.32 in the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company's weighted average number of ADSs used in the computation of diluted net income per ADS was 72,403,514. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had a total of 578,729,336 ordinary shares outstanding, or the equivalent of 72,341,167 ADSs.\nCERTAIN BALANCE SHEET ITEMS\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and short term investments and restricted cash were RMB1.30 billion (US$207.6 million).

Non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit excluding share-based compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin is non-GAAP gross profit divided by total revenues. Non-GAAP income or loss from operations is income or loss from operations excluding share-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is non-GAAP income or loss from operations divided by total revenues. Non-GAAP net income or loss attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited is net income or loss attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited excluding share-based compensation and income or loss from equity investments, including impairments. Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income or loss attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited divided by total revenues. Non-GAAP net income or loss per diluted ADS is non-GAAP net income or loss attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited divided by weighted average number of diluted ADSs. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the aforementioned non-GAAP to GAAP reconciling items add clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with the related GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that using these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its business allows both management and investors to assess the Company's performance against its competitors and ultimately monitor its capacity to generate returns for investors. The Company also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the effect of items like share-based compensation and income or loss from equity investments, including impairments, which have been and will continue to be significant and recurring in its business. However, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company's gross profit, income or loss from operations and net income or loss attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited for the period. In addition, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as an alternative to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nExchange Rate\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"USD\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, beginning from January 1, 2018. After the adoption of this new accounting standard, the Company measures long-term equity investments other than equity method investments at fair value through earnings. As investments in Particle meet the definition of debt securities, which are recorded as available-for-sale investments, there is no impact by the adoption of ASU 2016-1 on the available-for-sale investments in Particle and the changes in their fair value continue to be recorded in other comprehensive income.\nPhoenix New Media Limited\nCondensed Segments Information\n(Amounts in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2017\n2017\n2018\n2018\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nUS$\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nRevenues:\nNet advertising service\n241,084\n410,547\n242,861\n38,718\nPaid services\n53,395\n51,240\n41,551\n6,624\nTotal revenues\n294,479\n461,787\n284,412\n45,342\nCost of revenues\nNet advertising service\n131,125\n181,361\n107,289\n17,104\nPaid services\n31,364\n27,318\n20,944\n3,339\nTotal cost of revenues\n162,489\n208,679\n128,233\n20,443\nGross profit\nNet advertising service\n109,959\n229,186\n135,572\n21,614\nPaid services\n22,031\n23,922\n20,607\n3,285\nTotal gross profit\n131,990\n253,108\n156,179\n24,899\nPhoenix New Media Limited\nCondensed Information of Cost of Revenues\n(Amounts in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2017\n2017\n2018\n2018\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nUS$\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nRevenue sharing fees\n17,320\n12,350\n8,617\n1,374\nContent and operational costs\n106,316\n143,588\n105,273\n16,783\nBandwidth costs\n14,528\n12,830\n14,343\n2,286\nSales taxes and surcharges\n24,325\n39,911\n-\n-\nTotal cost of revenues\n162,489\n208,679\n128,233\n20,443\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Results of Operations Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures\n(Amounts in thousands, except for number of ADSs and per ADS data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nNon-GAAP\nNon-GAAP\nNon-GAAP\nGAAP\nAdjustments\nNon-GAAP\nGAAP\nAdjustments\nNon-GAAP\nGAAP\nAdjustments\nNon-GAAP\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nGross profit\n131,990\n1,623\n(1)\n133,613\n253,108\n1,221\n(1)\n254,329\n156,179\n205\n(1)\n156,384\nGross margin\n44.8%\n45.4%\n54.8%\n55.1%\n54.9%\n55.0%\nIncome from operations\n(40,051)\n8,266\n(1)\n(31,785)\n(5,433)\n4,677\n(1)\n(756)\n(57,850)\n3,450\n(1)\n(54,400)\nOperating margin\n-13.6%\n-10.8%\n-1.2%\n-0.2%\n-20.3%\n-19.1%\n8,266\n(1)\n4,677\n(1)\n3,450\n(1)\n664\n(2)\n(4,865)\n(2)\n2,430\n(2)\nNet (loss)/income attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited\n(32,174)\n8,930\n(23,244)\n11,821\n(188)\n11,633\n(57,540)\n5,880\n(51,660)\nNet margin\n-10.9%\n-7.9%\n2.6%\n2.5%\n-20.2%\n-18.2%\nNet (loss)/income per ADS—diluted\n(0.45)\n(0.32)\n0.16\n0.16\n(0.79)\n(0.71)\nWeighted average number of ADSs used in computing diluted net (loss)/income per ADS\n71,741,910\n71,741,910\n73,896,840\n73,896,840\n72,403,514\n72,403,514\n(1) Share-based compensation\n(2) Loss/(income) from equity investments, including impairments\nNon-GAAP to GAAP reconciling items have no income tax effect.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/phoenix-new-media-reports-unaudited-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300647861.html\nSOURCE Phoenix New Media Limited",
