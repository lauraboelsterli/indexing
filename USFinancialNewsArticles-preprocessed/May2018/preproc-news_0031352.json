    "text": "PARIS, May 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank could give fresh guidance on the timing it its first rate hike as the end of its exceptional bond purchases approaches, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Monday.\nThe Bank of France governor said that whether the decision to end of the ECB’s net asset purchases came at its September or December meeting was “not a deep existential question”.\nWith that decision nearing, he said that the ECB would adapt its guidance on interest rates, which currently states that they are to remain at current levels for an “extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases”.\nVilleroy said: “As far as the first rate hike is concerned, we could give additional guidance on its timing, ‘well past’ meaning at least some quarters but not years, and additional guidance on its contingency on the inflation outlook.” (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Richard Lough)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
