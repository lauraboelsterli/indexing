    "text": "NEW YORK, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Five Oaks Investment Corp . (NYSE: OAKS) (\"we\", \"Five Oaks\" or \"the Company\") today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the first quarter, the Company reported GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of $10.4 million, or $0.45 per basic and diluted share, a comprehensive loss of $0.4 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, and core earnings (1) of $0.9 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share. The Company also reported a net book value of $4.78 per share on a basic and diluted basis at March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Summary and Subsequent Events\nReported an economic loss on common equity of 0.6% for the quarter after accounting for dividends of $0.10 (2) . Reduced our Agency RMBS exposure from $1,285.1 million as of December 31, 2017 to $1,095.2 million as of March 31, 2018. The capital released from this reduction is expected to be redeployed into new investment opportunities in the commercial real estate space; since quarter end, we have sold an additional $605.6 million in Agency RMBS. During the quarter, we continued the reduction of our credit risk MBS exposure. We reduced our Multi-Family MBS exposure from $27.4 million at December 31, 2017 to $20.3 million as of March 31, 2018 (on a non-GAAP combined basis). On January 18, 2018, we issued 1,539,406 shares of common stock, for $4.77 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million in connection with the Hunt Transaction. As a first and significant step in our strategic transition, on April 30, 2018, the Company announced that it had acquired 100% of the equity interests of Hunt CMT Equity, LLC from Hunt Mortgage Group, LLC for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $68.05 million. Assets of Hunt CMT Equity, LLC include the junior retained notes and preferred shares of a commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation, a licensed commercial mortgage lender and eight loan participations.\n(1) Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure that we define as GAAP net income, excluding impairment losses, realized and unrealized gains or losses on the aggregate portfolio and certain non-recurring upfront costs related to securitization transactions or other one-time charges. As defined, Core Earnings includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments.\n(2) Economic return is a non-GAAP measure that we define as the sum of the change in net book value per common share and dividends declared on our common stock during the period over the beginning net book value per common share.\nThe Hunt Transaction And New Strategic Direction\nOn January 18, 2018, we announced a new strategic direction, and the entry into a new external management agreement with Hunt Investment Management, LLC, an affiliate of the Hunt Companies Inc. (\"Hunt\"). Under management by Hunt, Five Oaks is expected to endeavor to reallocate capital into investment opportunities focused in the commercial real estate mortgage space and gain direct access to Hunt's significant pipeline of transitional floating-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans.\nIn connection with the transaction, an affiliate of Hunt purchased 1,539,406 shares of our common stock in a private placement, at a purchase price of $4.77 per share resulting in an aggregate capital raise of $7,342,967. In addition, an affiliate of Hunt also purchased 710,495 Five Oaks shares from our largest shareholder, XL Investments Ltd. (\"XL Investments\"), for the same price per share. After completion of these share purchases, Hunt and its affiliates own approximately 9.5% of Five Oaks outstanding common shares. Also in connection with the transaction, the Five Oaks board appointed James C. (\"Chris\") Hunt as a director and Chairman of the board and named James P. Flynn as CEO of Five Oaks and Michael P. Larsen as President of Five Oaks.\nAs a first and significant step in our strategic transition, we announced on April 30, 2018 that we had acquired 100% of the equity interests of Hunt CMT Equity, LLC from Hunt Mortgage Group, LLC for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $68.05 million. Assets of Hunt CMT Equity, LLC include the junior retained notes and preferred shares of a commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation, a licensed commercial mortgage lender and eight loan participations. The assets of the CLO consist of performing transitional floating rate commercial mortgage loans with a portfolio balance of $346.3 million as of March 31, 2018, collateralized by a diverse mix of property types, including multifamily, retail, office, mixed use, industrial and student housing. The securitization pool is financed by $290.7 million of investment grade notes that bear a weighted average cost of 138 basis points over one month LIBOR, excluding fees and transaction costs. The CLO has a replenishment period that allows principal proceeds from repayments of the portfolio assets to be reinvested in qualifying replacement assets, subject to certain conditions.\nManagement Observations\nJames Flynn, CEO commented: \"The modest decline in our first quarter book value can be viewed relatively positively given the meaningful rise in interest rates during the quarter. We also began the process of transitioning our portfolio out of RMBS securities, and after quarter end we concluded the first meaningful step in reallocating capital towards commercial real estate mortgage assets with the successful conclusion of the Hunt CMT Equity transaction. Going forward, we anticipate further similar investments as we continue to reposition the Company's business in line with our new strategic direction.\".\nInvestment Portfolio and Capital Allocation\nThe following table summarizes certain characteristics of our investment portfolio and the related allocation of our equity capital on a non-GAAP combined basis as of March 31, 2018:\nFor the period ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nAgency MBS\nMulti-Family MBS\n(1)(2)\nNon-Agency\nRMBS (1)(2)\nResidential\nLoans (3)\nUnrestricted\nCash (4)\nTotal\nAmortized Cost\n1,118,672,405\n15,991,089\n11,063,922\n4,951,539\n42,257,248\n1,192,936,203\nMarket Value\n1,095,189,264\n20,339,324\n4,152,493\n4,027,374\n42,257,248\n1,165,965,703\nRepurchase Agreements\n1,174,281,000)\n-\n(2,779,000)\n-\n-\n(1,177,060,000)\nHedges\n18,132,700\n-\n-\n-\n-\n18,132,700\nOther (5)\n146,476,696\n28,836\n43,516\n-\n(1,143,428)\n145,405,620\nRestricted Cash and Due to Broker\n(2,082,900)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(2,082,900)\nEquity Allocated\n83,434,760\n20,368,160\n1,417,009\n4,027,374\n41,113,820\n150,361,123\nDebt/Net Equity (6)\n14.07\n-\n1.96\n-\n-\n7.83\nFor the period ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nAgency MBS\nMulti-Family MBS\nNon-Agency\nRMBS\nResidential\nLoans (7)\nUnrestricted\nCash\nTotal\nYield on Earning Assets (8)\n2.22%\n15.83%\n-0.39%\n23.23%\n-\n2.46%\nLess Cost of Funds\n1.55%\n0.18%\n1.18%\n-\n-\n1.49%\nNet Interest Margin (9)\n0.67%\n15.65%\n-1.58%\n23.23%\n-\n0.98%\n(1)\nInformation with respect to Non-Agency RMBS and Multi-Family MBS, and the resulting total is presented on a non-GAAP basis.

However, our maximum exposure to loss from consolidation of the trusts is limited to the fair value of our net investment therein. We therefore have also presented certain information as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 that includes our net investments in the consolidated trusts. This information as well as core earnings, economic return and comparative expenses constitute non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, as promulgated by the SEC. While we believe the non-GAAP information included in this press release provides supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing that portion of our portfolio composed of Non-Agency RMBS and Multi-Family MBS, and to assist investors in comparing our results with other peer issuers, these measures are not in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Core Earnings\nGAAP to Core Earnings Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nReconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Information\nNet Income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\n$\n10,434,491\n$\n8,000,436\nAdjustments for non-core earnings\nRealized (Gain) Loss on sale of investments, net\n$\n2,848,007\n$\n(562,833)\nRealized (Gain) Loss on derivative contracts, net\n$\n(2,792,794)\n$\n(170,319)\nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on derivative contracts, net\n$\n(12,783,088)\n$\n(5,878,687)\nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on mortgage servicing rights\n$\n(57,689)\n$\n30,136\nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on multi-family loans held in securitization trusts\n$\n1,355,774\n$\n(555,799)\nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on residential loans held in securitization trusts\n$\n255,403\n$\n187,426\nOther income\n$\n-\n$\n(12,987)\nSubtotal\n$\n(11,174,387)\n$\n(6,963,063)\nOther Adjustments\nRecognized compensation expense related to restricted common stock\n$\n4,804\n$\n3,951\nAdjustment for consolidated securities/securitization costs\n$\n1,283,061\n$\n1,257,955\nAdjustment for one-time charges\n$\n378,656\n$\n-\nCore Earnings\n$\n926,625\n$\n2,299,279\nWeighted average shares outstanding - Basic and Diluted\n23,392,387\n22,142,926\nCore Earnings per weighted average shares outstanding - Basic and Diluted\n$\n0.04\n$\n0.10\nAdditional Information\nAs of March 31, 2018, we have determined that we were the primary beneficiary of two Multi-Family MBS securitization trusts, the FREMF 2011-K13 Trust, and the FREMF 2012-KF01 Trust.
