    "text": "May 19, 2018 / 5:22 PM / Updated an hour ago I've done all I can to earn World Cup spot - Aspas Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nVIGO (Reuters) - Celta Vigo forward Iago Aspas made a convincing case to be included in Spain coach Julen Lopetegui’s World Cup squad after capping an outstanding season with two goals in his side’s 4-2 win at home to Levante on Saturday.\nAspas, 30, had already recorded his best ever goals tally in a top-flight season before the game and increased his haul to 22 Liga goals with two close-range strikes either side of halftime, after setting up the opener for strike partner Maxi Gomez.\n“I’ve done everything in my hands to go to the World Cup,” Aspas told reporters after the game.\n“Now the decision is over to Lopetegui.”\nThe Spain coach is due to name his squad for the tournament in Russia on Monday.\nAspas has eight caps for Spain and four goals, even though he has made only one start, in a 1-1 friendly draw with Colombia last June.\nHe was included in Lopetegui’s last squad call-up, scoring in the 6-1 thrashing of Argentina.\nAspas is the highest-scoring Spanish player in La Liga and the fourth-top overall, behind Lionel Messi, who has 34 strikes, and Luis Suarez and Cristiano Ronaldo, who have 25 each.
