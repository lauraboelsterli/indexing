This action is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nGet Help\nBRF S.A. investors should visit https://www.claimsfiler.com/cases/view-brf-sa-securities-litigation or call to speak to our claim center toll-free at (844) 367-9658.\nAbout the Lawsuit\nOn March 5, 2018, news outlets reported that Brazilian police had arrested BRF’s former Chief Executive Officer on charges that he as well as other executives knew that BRF fraudulently avoided food safety checks.
