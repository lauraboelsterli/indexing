    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 7:50 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago European shares rise as Italy recovers and China tariff cut boosts autos Helen Reid 4 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - European shares touched their highest level since the start of February on Tuesday as autos and bank stocks climbed, and Italian shares recovered as the anti-establishment coalition’s government formation process stalled. Traders work at their desks at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, November 22, 2017. REUTERS/Staff/Remote\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.2 percent, extending Monday's gains as carmakers rose on a cut to Chinese tariffs. Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB gained 0.7 percent.\nVolkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) were among the biggest boosts to the STOXX, up 1 to 1.6 percent, after China said it would cut the import duty on passenger cars and auto parts from July 1.\nEurope’s autos sector .SXAP climbed 0.7 percent and Italy’s Fiat Chrysler ( FCHA.MI ) also rose 1.3 percent, helping the Italian index gain 0.6 percent.\nItalian bank stocks .FTIT8300 recovered as the anti-establishment 5Star and League parties’ government plans stalled. President Sergio Mattarella sought further consultations over their proposed prime minister, a political novice. [nL5N1SS1DE]\nSome investors were doubtful a coalition government would be able to go ahead with their big spending plans that have spooked markets, sending Italian bond yields to their highest in more than a year.\n“I don’t know how long this coalition will last. There’s an awful lot of negativity around it but I would be surprised if the coalition can go any meaningful distance,” said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth.\n“Certainly Italy is a problem but geopolitical tension seems actually lower now than I can remember in a long time,” he added.\nCompetitive pressures, and hopes of dealmaking, triggered strong single-stock and sector-wide moves.\nInmarsat ( ISA.L ) shares dropped 8.4 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after the International Maritime Organisation authorised competitor Iridium ( IRDM.O ) to provide maritime safety systems, threatening Inmarsat’s monopoly in maritime distress communications.\nFrench telecoms stocks Bouygues ( BOUY.PA ), Orange ( ORAN.PA ) and Iliad ( ILD.PA ) all rose after the head of the country’s telecoms regulator reignited talk of possible mergers in the sector, in comments to Le Monde newspaper.\nAltice ( ATCA.AS ) shares also rose on investors’ hopes for M&A, and as the stock readjusted to the separation of Altice USA from Altice NV. The telecoms sector rose 0.8 percent overall.\nBanks HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Santander ( SAN.MC ), BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) and UBS ( UBSG.S ) were also among top drivers, benefiting from the recent rise in bond yields.\nSwiss industrial machinery firm Georg Fischer ( FIN.S ) jumped 7.7 percent after UBS upgraded the stock to a “buy”, saying the market is underestimating the company’s margins and earnings potential, helped by its diversification in different industrial products.\nOverall Europe’s earnings performance has been relatively disappointing, particularly compared with a stellar quarter in the U.S.. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the ratio of STOXX 600 companies beating earnings targets this quarter was the worst since 2013.\n“Year-to-date a lot of people have been overweight European equities and that’s been a frustrating trade, but the recent pullback in the euro is going to help because the strong appreciation was hurting exports,” said Tavistock’s Peel.
