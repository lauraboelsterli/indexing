    "text": "Juan Lagares had four hits and three RBIs on Tuesday night as the New York Mets routed the visiting Toronto Blue Jays 12-2 at Citi Field.\nThe Mets won for the ninth time in their past 26 games. The Blue Jays took their third consecutive loss and fell for the 16th time in the past 25 games.\nToronto carried a 2-1 lead into the fourth inning thanks to a two-run single in the third by Yangervis Solarte. However, the Mets scored five runs in the fourth before putting the game away with three more runs in the fifth.\nWinning pitcher Noah Syndergaard, who knocked in the Mets’ first run with a second-inning double, tied the game with a fourth-inning sacrifice fly. Amed Rosario followed with an RBI double. Two batters later, Lagares chased Jaime Garcia with a two-out, two-run single. Asdrubal Cabrera then greeted Jake Petricka with an RBI double.\nRosario, Brandon Nimmo and Lagares laced consecutive RBI singles against Petricka in the fifth.\nLagares collected his fourth hit, tying his career high, when he led off the eighth with a triple. Luis Guillorme followed with a run-scoring single for his first big league RBI, and Devin Mesoraco hit a two-run, two-out homer.\nRosario had three hits while Mesoraco reached base in all five plate appearances (three walks, two hits) and scored four runs.\nSyndergaard (3-1) gave up two runs on five hits and two walks while striking out seven over five innings.\nGarcia (2-3) allowed six runs on six hits and three walks while striking out three over 3 2/3 innings.\nCurtis Granderson, who hit 95 homers in three-plus seasons for the Mets and helped the team to the 2015 World Series, went 1-for-4 with a run for the Blue Jays. It was his first game at Citi Field since New York traded him to the Los Angeles Dodgers last Aug. 18.\nGranderson received a warm ovation in the first inning from those in the announced crowd of 28,967 who sat through a nearly 90-minute rain delay prior to first pitch.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
