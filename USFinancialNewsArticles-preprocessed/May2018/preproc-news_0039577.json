    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors remained unchanged at its lowest level in five and a half years in May, a survey showed on Tuesday, reflecting persisting concerns that Europe’s biggest economy could be hit be a trade dispute with the United States.\nThe ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed a reading for economic sentiment among investors remained unchanged at -8.2 , the lowest since November 2012. This was in line with the Reuters consensus forecast.\nA separate gauge measuring investors’ assessment of the economy’s current conditions edged down to 87.4 from 87.9 last month. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a reading of 86.2.\n“The U.S. decision to back out of the nuclear treaty with Iran and fears of a further escalation of the international trade conflict with the U.S., as well as a further rise in crude oil prices, have had an overall negative impact on economic expectations in Germany”, ZEW researcher Achim Wambach said.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Madeline Chambers\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
