    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, RPX Corporation (NASDAQ: RPXC), the leading provider of patent risk and discovery management solutions, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nCash provided by operating activities in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $33.2 million. The Company generated $15.1 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $67.1 million compared to $75.4 million in the prior year period. Subscription revenue from patent risk management services—including insurance—was $40.5 million compared to $47.0 million in the prior year period. Discovery services revenue was $20.4 million compared to $18.0 million in the prior year period. This quarter's results and prior periods are presented under the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606.\nManagement noted that the quarter's discovery services revenue included the positive impact from a few large European review projects ramping down slower than anticipated.\nSummary Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 was $67.1 million and $75.4 million, respectively.\nGAAP net income for the first quarter was $0.1 million or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to $5.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income for the first quarter, which excludes stock-based compensation, the amortization of acquired intangibles and their related tax effects, was $4.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $9.2 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company generated free cash flow of $15.1 million of free cash flow in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, which it defines as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures such as property and equipment and patent assets. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $37.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, less net patent spend of $17.3 million, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA less net patent spend, of $19.8 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, RPX's patent segment had approximately 320 clients, consisting of patent risk management network members and insurance clients.\nNet patent acquisition spend during the quarter totaled $17.3 million, and included 12 patent transactions.\nAs of March 31, 2018, RPX had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $168.2 million.\nNew Accounting Standard\nRPX adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") as of January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method. The prior periods presented here have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASC 606.\nTransaction Announcement\nSeparately, RPX today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by HGGC, a leading middle market private equity firm, in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $555 million. Due to the strategic review process, the Company did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. Further, as part of the announced agreement, the Company will suspend its dividend.\nDue to the announced transaction, RPX will not be hosting the conference call and webcast previously scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2018 to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results and will not be updating previously disclosed guidance.\nAbout RPX\nRPX Corporation (NASDAQ: RPXC) is the leading provider of patent risk and discovery management solutions. Since its founding in 2008, RPX has introduced efficiency to the patent market by providing a rational alternative to litigation. The San Francisco-based company's pioneering approach combines principal capital, deep patent expertise, and client contributions to generate enhanced patent buying power. By acquiring patents and patent rights, RPX helps to mitigate and manage patent risk for its growing client network.\nAs of March 31, 2018, RPX had invested over $2.4 billion to acquire more than 26,000 US and international patent assets and rights on behalf approximately 320 clients in eight key sectors: automotive, consumer electronics and PCs, E-commerce and software, financial services, media content and distribution, mobile communications and devices, networking, and semiconductors.\nRPX subsidiary Inventus is a leading international discovery management provider focused on reducing the costs and risks associated with the discovery process through the effective use of technology solutions. Inventus has been providing litigation support services to corporate legal departments, law firms and government agencies since 1991.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis news release dated May 1, 2018 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Tables are provided in this news release that reconcile the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP provision for income taxes, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income per share, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA less net patent spend, and free cash flow.\nTo supplement the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about the Company's core operating results and thus are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance and its prospects for the future. Management is excluding from some or all of its non-GAAP operating results (1) stock-based compensation expenses (inclusive of related employer payroll taxes), (2) the amortization of acquired intangible assets (other than patents), and (3) the related tax effects of these exclusions.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company's financial results and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, assess the health of our business and determine company-wide incentive compensation. Management believes these non-GAAP measures may prove useful to investors who wish to consider the impact of certain items when comparing the Company's financial performance with that of other companies. The adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results, trends and performance.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which items are adjusted to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures.\nThe presentation of additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial results determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nNotice to Investors and Security Holders\nThe tender offer for the outstanding common stock of RPX Corporation (\"RPX\") related to the acquisition of RPX referred to in this communication has not yet commenced. This communication is neither a recommendation, an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. The solicitation and the offer to buy the shares of RPX's common stock will be made pursuant to an offer to purchase and related materials that Riptide Parent, LLC (\"Parent\") and Riptide Purchaser, Inc. (\"Purchaser\") intend to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). At the time the tender offer is commenced, Purchaser will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the SEC, and thereafter RPX will file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the tender offer. The Tender Offer Statement (including an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and other offer documents) and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement will contain important information that should be read carefully and considered before any decision is made with respect to the tender offer. RPX, Purchaser and Parent will file other relevant materials in connection with the proposed acquisition of RPX by Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. RPX, Purchaser and Parent intend to mail these documents to the stockholders of RPX. All of the tender offer materials (and all other materials filed by RPX with the SEC) will also be available free of charge from the SEC through its website at www.sec.gov . INVESTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF RPX ARE ADVISED TO READ THE SCHEDULE TO AND THE SCHEDULE 14D-9, INCLUDING THE SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT OF RPX, AS EACH MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY PRIOR TO MAKING ANY DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TENDER OFFER OR WHETHER TO TENDER THEIR SHARES OF RPX COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE OFFER, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION (INCLUDING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TENDER OFFER) AND THE PARTIES THERETO.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this communication are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the statements made concerning the pending acquisition of RPX by Purchaser. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"aim,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"ongoing,\" \"goal,\" \"can,\" \"seek,\" \"target\" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These statements reflect RPX's current views concerning future events, including the planned completion of the tender offer and the anticipated merger, and are based on a number of assumptions that could ultimately prove inaccurate. As a general matter, forward-looking statements are those focused upon anticipated events or trends, expectations, and beliefs relating to matters that are not historical in nature. Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to RPX's operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of RPX. Among others, the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: (i) uncertainties as to the timing of the tender offer and the anticipated merger; (ii) uncertainties as to how many RPX stockholders will tender their shares of RPX common stock in the anticipated merger; (iii) the possibility that competing offers will be made, (iv) the possibility that various closing conditions for the transaction may not be satisfied or waived; (v) the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances requiring RPX to pay a termination fee; (vi) risks related to obtaining the requisite consents to the tender offer and the anticipated merger, including, without limitation, the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the proposed transaction, including under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) and the German Act of Restraints of Competition 1957, as amended (GWB), is delayed, is not obtained, or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (vii) the possibility that the transaction may not be timely completed, if at all; (viii) the risk that, prior to the completion of the transaction, if at all, RPX's business and its relationships with employees, collaborators, vendors and other business partners could experience significant disruption due to transaction-related uncertainty; (ix) the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the tender offer or the anticipated merger may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; and (x) the risks and uncertainties pertaining to RPX's business, including those detailed under \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in RPX's public periodic filings with the SEC, as well as the tender offer materials to be filed by Purchaser and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement to be filed by RPX in connection with the tender offer. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include those set forth in RPX's SEC reports, including, without limitation, the risks described in RPX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, which is on file with the SEC. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement and RPX undertakes no obligation to revise or update this report to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, except as required by law.\nContacts :\nInvestor Relations\nMedia Relations\nJoAnn Horne\nJen Costa\nMarket Street Partners\nRPX Corporation\n+1 415-445-3233\n+1
