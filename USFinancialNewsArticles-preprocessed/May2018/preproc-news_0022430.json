CannaRoyalty is a first-mover, and our current standing as one of the largest cannabis players in the largest cannabis market in the world 1 , is largely due to his vision. Afzal has proven himself time and again to be adept at recognizing value and, more importantly at successfully completing transactions and integrating acquisitions quickly and efficiently.\"\nAfzal added, \"I grow more confident every day that we are executing the right strategy at the right time. We have assembled an experienced team and put the pieces in place to grow a dominant cannabis brand commercialization and distribution platform in California. This is just the beginning for CannaRoyalty. Over the next 12 months we will reinforce this platform and seek to replicate it in other legal jurisdictions such as Canada, to become a truly global cannabis brand powerhouse.\"\nAdditional appointments made by the Company recently, include:\nRichard Sellers as VP of Operations.
