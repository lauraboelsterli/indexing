Please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items\" for more information.\nThe Virtu Financial, Inc. Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share. This dividend is payable on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2018.\n“Our continued successful integration enabled this quarter’s outstanding performance in this favorable environment. The first quarter of 2018 saw the return of volume and volatility. Average realized volatility of 19.8 for the quarter was at a multi-year high. Our profitability and margins this quarter demonstrate the earnings power and competitive advantage of having a scaled and unified firm. As our integration progresses we see opportunity for continued superior performance,” said Douglas Cifu, Chief Executive Officer of Virtu Financial.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenues increased 453.4% to $815.1 million for this quarter, compared to $147.3 million for the same period in 2017. Trading income, net, increased 191.0% to $406.2 million for this quarter, compared to $139.6 million for the same period in 2017. Net income increased 1,845.6% to $410.0 million for this quarter, compared to $21.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nBasic and Diluted earnings per share for this quarter were $1.89 and $1.86, respectively, compared to $0.10 each for the same period in 2017.\nAdjusted Net Trading Income increased 314.0% to $340.3 million for this quarter, compared to $82.2 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 366.9% to $222.7 million for this quarter, compared to $47.7 million for the same period in 2017. Normalized Adjusted Net Income increased 559.1% to $145.0 million for this quarter, compared to $22.0 million for the same period in 2017.\nAssuming all non-controlling interests had been exchanged for common stock, and the Company’s Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes was subject to corporation taxation, Normalized Adjusted EPS was $0.76 for this quarter and $0.16 for the same period in 2017.\nOperating Segment Information\nPrior to the acquisition of KCG Holdings, Inc. in July 2017, the Company was managed and operated as one business, and, accordingly, operated under one reportable segment. As a result of the acquisition of KCG, beginning in the third quarter of 2017 the Company has three operating segments: (i) Market Making; (ii) Execution Services; and (iii) Corporate.\nMarket Making principally consists of market making in the cash, futures and options markets across global equities, options, fixed income, currencies and commodities. As a market maker, the Company commits capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from, or sell securities to, broker dealers, banks and institutions.\nExecution Services comprises agency-based trading and trading venues, offering execution services in global equities, options, futures and fixed income on behalf of institutions, banks and broker dealers.\nCorporate contains the Company's investments, principally in strategic trading-related opportunities, and maintains corporate overhead expenses.\nThe following tables show the total revenues and Adjusted Net Trading Income by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTotal Revenues by operating segment\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Market Execution Making Services Corporate Total Trading income, net $ 405,709 $ 453 $ - $ 406,162 Commissions, net and technology services 8,501 45,343 - 53,844 Interest and dividends income 17,769 145 35 17,949 Other, net 557 337,838 (1,297 ) 337,098 Total Revenues $ 432,536 $ 383,779 $ (1,262 ) $ 815,053 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Market Execution Making Services Corporate Total Trading income, net $ 139,574 $ - $ - $ 139,574 Commissions, net and technology services - 2,779 - 2,779 Interest and dividends income 4,874 - - 4,874 Other, net - - 60 60 Total Revenues $ 144,448 $ 2,779 $ 60 $ 147,287 Reconciliation of trading income, net to Adjusted Net Trading Income by operating segment\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Market Execution Making Services Corporate Total Trading income, net $ 405,709 $ 453 $ - $ 406,162 Commissions, net and technology services 8,501 45,343 - 53,844 Interest and dividends income 17,769 145 35 17,949 Brokerage, exchange and clearance fees, net (69,072 ) (18,752 ) - (87,824 ) Payments for order flow (16,196 ) (60 ) - (16,256 ) Interest and dividends expense (33,207 ) (417 ) - (33,624 ) Adjusted Net Trading Income $ 313,504 $ 26,712 $ 35 $ 340,251 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Market Execution Making Services Corporate Total Trading income, net $ 139,574 $ - $ - $ 139,574 Commissions, net and technology services - 2,779 - 2,779 Interest and dividends income 4,874 - - 4,874 Brokerage, exchange and clearance fees, net (52,770 ) - - (52,770 ) Interest and dividends expense (12,280 ) - - (12,280 ) Adjusted Net Trading Income $ 79,398 $ 2,779 $ - $ 82,177 Reconciliation of trading income, net to Adjusted Net Trading Income by category – Market Making segment\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Americas ROW Global FICC, Total Equities Equities Options and Other Unallocated Market Making Trading income, net $ 273,188 $ 51,694 $ 82,070 $ (1,243 ) $ 405,709 Commissions, net and technology services 8,522 - (21 ) - 8,501 Brokerage, exchange and clearance fees, net (41,085 ) (15,949 ) (12,539 ) 501 (69,072 ) Payments for order flow (16,196 ) - - - (16,196 ) Interest and dividends, net (8,733 ) (2,394 ) (3,251 ) (1,060 ) (15,438 ) Adjusted Net Trading Income $ 215,696 $ 33,351 $ 66,259 $ (1,802 ) $ 313,504 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Americas ROW Global FICC, Total Equities Equities Options and Other Unallocated Market Making Trading income, net $ 49,831 $ 38,749 $ 51,572 $ (578 ) $ 139,574 Brokerage, exchange and clearance fees, net (20,216 ) (17,090 ) (15,076 ) (388 ) (52,770 ) Interest and dividends, net (1,564 ) (2,925 ) (2,366 ) (551 ) (7,406 ) Adjusted Net Trading Income $ 28,051 $ 18,734 $ 34,130 $ (1,517 ) $ 79,398 The following tables show our Adjusted Net Trading Income and average daily Adjusted Net Trading Income by category for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages).\nThree Months Ended March 31, Adjusted Net Trading Income by Category: 2018\n2017\n% Change Market Making: Americas Equities $ 215,696 $ 28,052 668.9 % ROW Equities 33,351 18,734 78.0 % Global FICC, Options and Other 66,259 34,130 94.1 % Unallocated 1 (1,802 ) (1,518 ) NM Total Market Making $ 313,504 $ 79,398 294.9 % Execution Services 26,712 3,114 757.8 % Corporate 35 - NM Adjusted Net Trading Income $ 340,251 $ 82,512 312.4 % Average Daily Three Months Ended March 31, Adjusted Net Trading Income by Category: 2018\n2017\n% Change Market Making: Americas Equities $ 3,536 $ 452 681.5 % ROW Equities 547 302 80.9 % Global FICC, Options and Other 1,086 550 97.3 % Unallocated 1 (30 ) (24 ) NM Total Market Making $ 5,139 $ 1,281 301.3 % Execution Services 438 50.23 772.1 % Corporate 1 - NM Adjusted Net Trading Income $ 5,578 $ 1,331 319.2 % 1 Under our methodology for recording ‘‘trading income, net’’ in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, we recognize revenues based on the exit price of assets in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP rules, and when we calculate Adjusted Net Trading Income for corresponding reporting periods, we start with trading income, net. By contrast, when we calculate Adjusted Net Trading Income by category, we recognize revenues on a daily basis, and as a result prices used in recognizing revenues may differ.Because we provide liquidity on a global basis, across asset classes and time zones, the timing of any particular Adjusted Net Trading Income calculation can defer or accelerate the amount in a particular asset class from one day to another, and, at the end of a reporting period, from one reporting period to another. The purpose of the Unallocated category is to ensure that Adjusted Net Trading Income by category sums to total Adjusted Net Trading Income, which can be reconciled to Trading Income, Net, calculated in accordance with GAAP. We do not allocate any resulting differences based on the timing of revenue recognition. BondPoint Sale\nOn January 2, 2018, the Company completed the sale of BondPoint to Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) for $400 million in cash. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of $337.5 million, which is recorded as other, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The net gain on the sale of BondPoint was $329 million including direct costs associated with the sale which comprised professional fees of $7.1 million and compensation of $1.4 million.\nOn January 8, 2018, the Company completed a repricing transaction of its 1 st Lien Senior Secured Term Loan along with a principal repayment of $276 million from the proceeds from the sale of BondPoint to ICE. The repriced term loan bears interest at LIBOR + 325 bps, reflecting a reduction of 50 bps compared to its prior rate.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of March 31, 2018, Virtu had $637.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, and total long-term debt outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $1.157 billion.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items\nTo supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we use the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance:\n\"Adjusted Net Trading Income\", which is the amount of revenue we generate from our market making activities, or trading income, net, plus commissions, net and technology services, plus interest and dividends income and expense, net, less direct costs associated with those revenues, including brokerage, exchange and clearance fees, net and payments for order flow. Management believes that this measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Although we use Adjusted Net Trading Income as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business, the use of Adjusted Net Trading Income is limited because it does not include certain material costs that are necessary to operate our business. Our presentation of Adjusted Net Trading Income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by revenues or expenses that are not directly associated with our market making activities. \"EBITDA\", which measures our operating performance by adjusting Net Income to exclude financing interest expense on our long-term borrowings, debt issue cost related to debt refinancing, depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles and acquired capitalized software, and income tax expense, and \"Adjusted EBITDA\", which measures our operating performance by further adjusting EBITDA to exclude severance, reserve for legal matter, transaction advisory fees and expenses, termination of office leases, acquisition related retention bonus, trading related settlement income, gain on sale of business, connectivity early termination, other, net, equipment write-off, share based compensation, charges related to share based compensation at IPO, 2015 Management Incentive Plan, and charges related to share based compensation at IPO. “Normalized Adjusted Net Income”, “Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes”, “Normalized provision for income taxes”, and “Normalized Adjusted EPS”, which we calculate by adjusting Net Income to exclude certain items and other non-cash items, assuming that all vested and unvested Virtu Financial LLC units have been exchanged for Class A Common Stock, and applying a corporate tax rate between 35.5% and 37%. As a result of the Tax Act, our corporate tax rate is estimated to be approximately 23% beginning January 1, 2018 due to the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.\nTotal Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures used by management in evaluating operating performance and in making strategic decisions. Additional information provided regarding the breakdown of Total Adjusted Net Trading Income by category is also a non-GAAP financial measure but is not used by the Company in evaluating operating performance and in making strategic decisions. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures or similar non-GAAP measures are used by research analysts, investment bankers and lenders to assess our operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS provide indicators of general economic performance that are not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that these measurements are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Furthermore, our credit agreement contains covenants and other tests based on metrics similar to Adjusted EBITDA. Other companies may define Adjusted Net Trading Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS differently, and as a result our measures of Adjusted Net Trading Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Although we use these non-GAAP financial measures as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because they do not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business.\nAdjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Adjusted Net Income should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, Net Income in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted Net Trading Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes, Normalized Adjusted EPS and our EBITDA-based measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nthey do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; our EBITDA-based measures do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and our EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and they do not reflect limitations on our costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Adjusted Net Income are not intended as alternatives to Net Income as indicators of our operating performance and should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Adjusted Net Income along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. These U.S. GAAP measurements include Net Income, cash flows from operations and cash flow data. See below a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nVirtu Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands, except share and per share data) 2018 2017 Revenues: Trading income, net $ 406,162 $ 139,574 Commissions, net and technology services 53,844 2,779 Interest and dividends income 17,949 4,874 Other, net 337,098 60 Total revenues 815,053 147,287 Operating Expenses: Brokerage, exchange and clearance fees, net 87,824 52,770 Communication and data processing 49,486 18,207 Employee compensation and payroll taxes 64,670 21,347 Payments for order flow 16,256 - Interest and dividends expense 33,624 12,280 Operations and administrative 19,919 4,846 Depreciation and amortization 15,339 6,757 Amortization of purchased intangibles and acquired capitalized software 6,851 53 Termination of office leases 19,970 - Debt issue cost related to debt refinancing 6,021 - Transaction advisory fees and expenses 7,496 132 Charges related to share based compensation at IPO 14 185 Financing interest expense on long-term borrowings 19,047 6,828 Total operating expenses 346,517 123,405 Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest 468,536 23,882 Provision for income taxes 58,514 2,808 Net income $ 410,022 $ 21,074 Noncontrolling interest (235,271 ) (16,494 ) Net income available for common stockholders $ 174,751 $ 4,580 Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.89 $ 0.10 Diluted $ 1.86 $ 0.10 Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic 90,699,321 40,398,381 Diluted 92,406,318 40,398,381 Comprehensive income: Net income $ 410,022 $ 21,074 Other comprehensive income (loss) Foreign exchange translation adjustment, net of taxes 2,529 785 Comprehensive income $ 412,551 $ 21,859 Less: Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interest (236,559 ) (17,044 ) Comprehensive income available for common stockholders $ 175,992 $ 4,815 Virtu Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation to Non-GAAP Operating Data (Unaudited)\nThe following tables reconcile Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income to arrive at Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and selected Operating Margins.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands, except percentages) 2018 2017 Reconciliation of Trading income, net to Adjusted Net Trading Income Trading income, net $ 406,162 $ 139,574 Commissions, net and technology services 53,844 2,779 Interest and dividends income 17,949 4,874 Brokerage, exchange and clearance fees, net (87,824 ) (52,770 ) Payments for order flow (16,256 ) - Interest and dividends expense (33,624 ) (12,280 ) Adjusted Net Trading Income $ 340,251 $ 82,177 Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Net income $ 410,022 $ 21,074 Financing interest expense on long-term borrowings 19,047 6,828 Debt issue cost related to debt refinancing 6,021 - Depreciation and amortization 15,339 6,757 Amortization of purchased intangibles and acquired capitalized software 6,851 53 Provision for income taxes 58,514 2,808 EBITDA $ 515,794 $ 37,520 Severance 3,744 877 Transaction advisory fees and expenses 7,496 132 Termination of office leases 19,970 - Connectivity early termination 2,500 - Gain on sale of business (337,549 ) - Other, net 451 (60 ) Equipment write-off 936 - Share based compensation 7,902 7,579 Charges related to share based compensation at IPO, 2015 Management Incentive Plan 1,398 1,425 Charges related to share based compensation awards at IPO 14 185 Adjusted EBITDA $ 222,656 $ 47,658 Selected Operating Margins Net Income Margin 1 120.5 % 25.6 % EBITDA Margin 2 151.6 % 45.7 % Adjusted EBITDA Margin 3 65.4 % 58.0 % 1 Calculated by dividing net income by Adjusted Net Trading Income. 2 Calculated by dividing EBITDA by Adjusted Net Trading Income. 3 Calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Adjusted Net Trading Income.
