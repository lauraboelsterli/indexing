FILE PHOTO: A Fox News channel sign is seen on a television vehicle outside the News Corporation building in New York City, in New York, U.S. November 8, 2017. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\nScott, who will be the first woman to head Fox News, was most recently president of programming at both networks.\nRupert Murdoch took charge of Fox News following the exit of Roger Ailes over sexual harassment charges. Ailes, who started Fox News in 1996, had turned the network into a booming voice for conservatives. He passed away in May 2017.\nScott will report to Rupert Murdoch, Twenty First Century Fox’s Executive Chairman and Lachlan Murdoch, chairman of Twenty First Century Fox, and the chairman and CEO of the proposed New Fox following Twenty First Century Fox’s deal with Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ).\nFox agreed last year to sell the bulk of its film and TV assets to Disney in a $52.4 billion stock deal. The new Fox will include its news divisions, Fox sports, Fox television stations group, Fox Broadcasting Co and sports cable networks.\nFox News on Thursday also named Jay Wallace as its executive editor and president.\n(This version of the story corrects paragraph 3 to say Rupert Murdoch took charge of Fox News after Ailes exit, removes reference to him being acting CEO in paragraph 2) Reporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Sriraj Kalluvila",
