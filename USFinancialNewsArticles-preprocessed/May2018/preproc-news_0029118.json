    "text": "HOUSTON, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanguard Natural Resources, Inc. (OTCQX: VNRR) (\"Vanguard,\" \"VNRR,\" or the \"Company\") today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and other operational results.\nKey Highlights\nExecuted four purchase and sales agreements for more than $60.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds Reported production volumes of 368 million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) per day, at the high-end of first quarter guidance Participated in drilling and completion of two new Pinedale horizontal wells with four more horizontal wells being drilled at quarter end Lease operating expenses were $31.0 million, below first quarter guidance Updated second quarter and full-year 2018 operational and financial guidance for the year, with an updated 2018 capital budget of approximately $140.0 million to $145.0 million Lower end of full year production guidance increased despite incorporating the impact of the recently announced divestments and reduced capital budget Remain significantly hedged for the balance of 2018 and through 2020 with the balance of 2018 production hedged 71%, 85% and 43% for natural gas, oil and NGLs, respectively, at the mid-point of announced guidance\nMr. R. Scott Sloan, President and CEO, commented, \"We have taken several steps forward in achieving our long-term strategy to realign the portfolio, lower debt and maintain liquidity. We signed multiple purchase and sales agreements for proceeds of over $60.0 million, and we are continuing to evaluate non-core assets for accretive divestments. These assets are not core to our growth strategy, and we will be able to use these proceeds to decrease our leverage and improve our financial positioning. I'm pleased with the strategic changes we're making to turn Vanguard into a competitive E&P company focused on organic growth and financial discipline. We continue to actively pursue ways to optimize the portfolio and achieving these recent milestones is an affirmation that we're headed down the road for future success.\"\n\"I'm also excited to see our volumes in the Pinedale field start to ramp up. An operator of our Pinedale position is turning what was once a conventional vertical play into an unconventional horizontal gas play with very attractive economics. I'm also extremely proud of the success our team achieved during the quarter on our operated assets. They continue to execute our business plan by operating efficiently and effectively,\" concluded Mr. Sloan.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nReported average production of 368 MMcfe per day in the first quarter of 2018 represents a 2% increase compared to 362 MMcfe per day for the fourth quarter of 2017. When adjusting fourth quarter 2017 volumes for the Williston asset sale, which was completed in December 2017, production volumes for the first quarter of 2018 increased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2017. The production increase was primarily attributable to new well completions in the Pinedale field of the Green River Basin, along with the resolution of production curtailments we had experienced at the end of 2017. On a Mcfe basis, crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs accounted for 15%, 71% and 14%, respectively, of our first quarter 2018 production.\nLease operating expenses (\"LOE\") of $31.0 million during the first quarter of 2018 ($0.94 per Mcfe) decreased 10% compared to the $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 ($1.04 per Mcfe). When adjusted for the Williston asset sale, pro forma LOE decreased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2017 which is primarily attributable to lower workover costs in the first quarter.\nTransportation and gathering expenses related to certain of our natural gas and NGLs contracts were $11.5 million during the first quarter of 2018 ($0.35 per Mcfe) and are marginally higher as compared to $11.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 ($0.34 per Mcfe). However, on a per unit basis, these costs remained virtually unchanged quarter-over-quarter.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") were $12.7 million during the first quarter of 2018 ($0.38 per Mcfe). Excluding non-cash compensation of $0.5 million and severance costs of approximately $2.3 million, SG&A was $9.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 5% compared to the $10.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017 ($0.31 per Mcfe). The fourth quarter 2017 SG&A also excludes non-cash compensation and non-recurring adjustments of approximately $4.8 million.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expenses (\"DD&A\") were $40.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 ($1.21 per Mcfe), representing a decrease of 8% from $43.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 ($1.31 per Mcfe). The reported DD&A decreased primarily due to impairment charges and the sale of properties in the Williston Basin in the fourth quarter of 2017, both of which reduced our depletable base for the current period.\nWe reported a net loss attributable to Common Stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 of $32.7 million. This compares to a net loss attributable to Common Stockholders of $74.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease in the Company's reported net loss for the first quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to lower impairment expenses reported during the period. Lower operating costs and SG&A expenses also contributed to the improvement in net earnings as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) was $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. This compares to Adjusted Net Loss of $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Adjusted Net Loss for the first quarter of 2018 included adjustments for net non-cash expenses of $23.9 million primarily comprised of a $14.6 million impairment charge on our oil and natural gas properties and a $9.3 million loss from the change in fair value of commodity derivative contracts. The Adjusted Net Loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 results included adjustments for net non-cash expenses of $52.7 million primarily comprised of a $47.6 million impairment charge on our oil and natural gas properties, a $4.5 million gain on divestiture of oil and natural gas properties and a $9.5 million loss from the change in fair value of commodity derivative contracts.\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) was $52.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 and represents a 7% increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 is attributable primarily to a decrease in LOE and SG&A.\nCapital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were $42.1 million, up from $39.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Drilling and development in the Pinedale field, located in the Green River Basin, and the Mamm Creek field in the Piceance Basin, accounted for approximately 86% of the Company's total capital costs for the period. In Pinedale, we participated as a non-operated partner in the drilling and completion of two horizontal and 49 vertical natural gas wells, and in Mamm Creek, we accelerated our infill development drilling program that we are continuing to focus on in 2018.\n\"We started off 2018 on the right track by delivering first quarter results that either met or exceeded our initial guidance for the period and is a testament to our assets and dedicated employees. Steady production volumes and cost control helped drive our Adjusted EBITDA to approximately $52.0 million in the first quarter. Although there is a component of seasonality to our LOE, we expect to have continued success on structural cost-control measures over the course of 2018,\" stated Ryan Midgett, Chief Financial Officer.\nSelected Financial Information\nA summary of selected financial information follows (in thousands, except for production data):\n(Unaudited)\nSuccessor\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nThree Months\nThree Months\nThree Months\nEnded\nEnded\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nProduction (Mcfe/day)\n367,568\n362,011\n384,870\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids sales\n$\n123,275\n$\n125,818\n$\n118,756\nNet gains (losses) on commodity derivative contracts\n$\n(18,585)\n$\n(23,505)\n$\n7\nOperating expenses (1)\n$\n40,776\n$\n41,937\n$\n48,546\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n12,736\n$\n15,367\n$\n10,295\nNet Loss Attributable to Vanguard Common Stockholders/Unitholders\n$\n(32,684)\n$\n(74,113)\n$\n(11,155)\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Vanguard Common Stockholders/Unitholders (2)\n$\n(4,679)\n$\n(9,681)\n$\n15,466\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Vanguard Common Stockholders/Unitholders (2)\n$\n51,981\n$\n48,765\n$\n62,134\nTotal Debt (as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, and December 31, 2017, respectively)\n$\n926,144\n$\n911,976\n$\n1,770,053\nInterest expense, including settlements paid on interest rate derivative contracts\n$\n14,753\n$\n14,589\n$\n16,535\nCapital expenditures\n$\n42,073\n$\n39,201\n$\n13,645\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n36,249\n$\n24,054\n$\n51,174\n(1)\nIncludes lease operating expenses and production and other taxes.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP financial measures.

As such, our average realized prices are not comparable with the prior periods. If our natural gas and NGLs revenues are shown net of these fees, the average realized natural gas price and average NGLs price excluding hedges would be $2.00 and $24.13, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and $2.12 per Mcf and $25.26 per Bbl, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n(b)\nDuring 2017, we divested certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets. As such, there are no operating results from these properties included in our operating results from the closing date of the divestitures forward.\n(c)\nExcludes the premiums paid, whether at inception or deferred, for derivative contracts that settled during the period and the fair value of derivative contracts acquired as part of prior period business combinations that apply to contracts settled during the period.\nAsset Divestiture Update\nSince the end of the first quarter, the Company has executed four purchase and sale agreements (\"PSA\") for the divestments of certain of our properties in the Permian Basin, Green River Basin, and Mississippi. Collectively, these divestment properties have current production of approximately 17 MMcfe per day. Aggregate gross proceeds are more than $60.0 million and the transactions are expected to close in mid-2018.\nUpon closing, proceeds from the four divestments are intended to be used to pay down outstanding debt on the Company's revolving credit facility and, furthermore, these divestments are expected to be accretive to liquidity.\nThe Company continues to actively market and evaluate additional assets for accretive divestment options, including certain assets in the Midcontinent and the Gulf Coast areas. The sales of these properties are anticipated to further reduce debt under the Company's revolving credit facility and sharpen the focus of the asset base by optimizing the portfolio.\n\"We're taking the right steps to holistically look at our portfolio and determine the right mix of assets while protecting the balance sheet. Our guiding principle during this ongoing process is to improve our operational focus and the strength of our balance sheet while enhancing the long-term value of the Company. By doing so, I believe we will position the Company to be a successful exploration and production company with competitive organic growth opportunities,\" remarked Mr. Sloan.\nOperational Update\nThe Company continues to invest in key assets and evaluate future potential in new resources, primarily in the Pinedale field of the Green River Basin, the Piceance Basin, and the Arkoma Basin.\nIn the Pinedale field, production increased 8% to approximately 117 MMcfe per day in the first quarter of 2018 from approximately 109 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter of 2017. The production increase is attributable to new horizontal and vertical wells placed online during the quarter. The production from two horizontal wells are exceeding the Company's budget case assumptions. The operator of the horizontal wells, Ultra Petroleum Corporation, expects to drill 15 to 20 additional horizontal wells throughout the year as they continue to test and delineate the play. To date the six horizontal wells the Company has participated in have an average working interest of approximately 12%.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Arkoma Woodford area produced approximately 30 MMcfe per day. Vanguard participated in the drilling of two wells operated by BP America, Inc. (\"BP\") and we expect these to be completed during the second quarter. Later in 2018 the Company will participate in seven additional wells which Newfield Exploration Company (\"Newfield\") will operate. Lease operating expenses continue to remain low in the area as the Company reported $0.60 per Mcfe, sustaining cash flow for the Company.\nThe Piceance assets produced approximately 71 MMcfe per day for the first quarter of 2018. We have drilled 14 vertical gas wells and we are in the process of completing them. We expect to have all of these wells in production by early third quarter.\nCapital Expenditures Update\nOur 2018 capital budget has been revised to approximately $140.0 million to $145.0 million, down from our initial 2018 guidance of $160.0 million. This is primarily due to a shift in drilling activity in the Green River Basin at the Pinedale Field where we expect to spend between $70.0 million and $80.0 million, down from our previously estimated $90.0 million to $95.0 million. In the Piceance Basin, our operated drilling and completion program is continuing as planned at the Mamm Creek Field where we expect to spend between $10.0 million and $15.0 million during the remainder of 2018. In the Arkoma Basin, we are on track to spend approximately $20.0 million of our total 2018 capital budget where we will be participating as a non-operated partner with Newfield and BP in a one rig program. The remaining drilling and completion capital will be spent on additional drilling, completion and production uplift projects in the Permian, Big Horn, and Powder River Basins.\nRevised 2018 Guidance\nNew guidance is being issued for the second quarter and full year of 2018 to reflect the updated investment allocation and to incorporate the operational and financial results of the first quarter. Production is now estimated to be in the range of 360 MMcfe per day to 370 MMcfe per day and 360 MMcfe per day to 380 MMcfe per day for the second quarter and full year of 2018, respectively.\n\"Overall, our revised 2018 guidance considers both $60.0 million in divestments closing in July of 2018 and a decrease of over $15.0 million in forecasted capital spend for the year with minimal impact to our previously announced production guidance. This is clearly a testament to the high rate of return from drilling in the Pinedale and the performance of our other assets,\" commented Mr. Midgett.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's revised guidance for 2018 which is based on certain estimates being used by the Company to model its anticipated results of operations for the 2018 fiscal year. These estimates include the recently announced divestments in the Permian Basin, Green River Basin, and Mississippi, assuming a close date in July of 2018. No additional acquisitions or divestitures of oil or natural gas properties or changes in the Company's current capital structure are assumed.\nQ2 2018E\nFY 2018E\nNet Production:\nOil (Bbls/day)\n8,600\n-\n9,000\n8,600\n-\n9,000\nNatural gas (Mcf/day)\n258,600\n-\n263,800\n257,400\n-\n272,600\nNGLs (Bbls/day)\n8,300\n-\n8,700\n8,500\n-\n8,900\nCombined (Mcfe/day)\n360,000\n-\n370,000\n360,000\n-\n380,000\nCosts ($ in thousands):\nLease operating expenses\n$\n35,000\n-\n$\n38,000\n$\n128,000\n-\n$\n136,000\nProduction taxes (% of revenue)\n9\n%\n-\n10\n%\n9\n%\n-\n10\n%\nG&A expenses (1)\n$\n8,500\n-\n$\n10,500\n$\n38,000\n-\n$\n43,000\nInterest expense\n$\n15,000\n-\n$\n16,000\n$\n58,000\n-\n$\n62,000\nCapital expenditures\n$\n28,000\n-\n$\n34,000\n$\n140,000\n-\n$\n145,000\nAverage NYMEX Differentials (2) :\nOil ($/Bbl)\n$\n(9.00)\n-\n$\n(11.00)\n$\n(8.00)\n-\n$\n(10.00)\nNatural gas ($/MMBtu)\n$\n(1.10)\n-\n$\n(1.30)\n$\n(1.00)\n-\n$\n(1.25)\nNGLs realization of crude oil price (%) (3)\n37\n%\n-\n42\n%\n37\n%\n-\n42\n%\n(1)\nIncludes post-emergence restructuring related costs of $2.3 million for the balance of 2018.\n(2)\nIncludes impact of transportation and gathering costs that may be classified as operating expenses under ASC Topic 606.

We also had approximately $9.0 million in available cash.\nRyan Midgett, Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"Rightsizing the balance sheet is the primary focus for 2018, and our ongoing divestment strategy will help the Company pay down debt, improve liquidity and position the Company for future success. We have begun working with our banking group as the August redetermination is now in our sights. Of utmost importance is making sure the Company has the financial flexibility to execute on its strategy to focus the portfolio and grow its core assets. We are actively making strides towards executing these goals, and are taking a proactive and early approach to work with our lenders to improve our financial position over the next twelve to eighteen months.\"\nHedging Activities\nThe Company has implemented a hedging program for its crude oil and natural gas production through 2021, and NGLs production through 2019. Currently, we use fixed-price swaps and collars to hedge oil, natural gas and NGLs prices. The Company believes its hedging program will provide substantial near-term cash flow visibility regardless of the volatility in commodity prices as management and the board of directors explore options for maximizing stockholder value.\nCommodity derivative contracts in place as of March 31, 2018 are as follows:\nApril -\nDecember\n2018\nYear\n2019\nYear\n2020\nYear\n2021\nGas Positions:\nFixed-Price Swaps:\nNotional Volume (MMBtu)\n52,093,000\n52,539,000\n47,227,500\n—\nFixed Price ($/MMBtu)\n$\n2.89\n$\n2.79\n$\n2.75\n$\n—\nCollars:\nNotional Volume (MMBtu)\n—\n4,125,000\n5,490,000\n1,825,000\nFloor Price ($/MMBtu)\n$\n—\n$\n2.60\n$\n2.60\n$\n2.60\nCeiling Price ($/MMBtu)\n$\n—\n$\n3.00\n$\n3.00\n$\n3.07\nOil Positions:\nFixed-Price Swaps (West Texas Intermediate):\nNotional Volume (Bbls)\n2,014,950\n1,858,200\n1,393,800\n—\nFixed Price ($/Bbl)\n$\n46.60\n$\n48.50\n$\n49.53\n$\n—\nCollars:\nNotional Volume (Bbls)\n—\n575,730\n659,340\n3,409,972\nFloor Price ($/Bbl)\n$\n—\n$\n43.81\n$\n44.17\n$\n47.50\nCeiling Price ($/Bbl)\n$\n—\n$\n54.04\n$\n55.00\n$\n56.05\nNGL Positions:\nFixed-Price Swaps:\nMont Belvieu Ethane\nNotional Volume (Gallons)\n6,930,000\n2,494,779\n—\n—\nFixed Price ($/Gallon)\n$\n0.28\n$\n0.29\n$\n—\n$\n—\nMont Belvieu Propane\nNotional Volume (Gallons)\n17,325,000\n6,270,427\n—\n—\nFixed Price ($/Gallon)\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.71\n$\n—\n$\n—\nMont Belvieu N.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Vanguard stockholders/unitholders plus:\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest.\nThe result is net income (loss) which includes the non-controlling interest. From this we add or subtract the following:\nNet interest expense; Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion; Impairment of oil and natural gas properties; Exploration expense; Change in fair value of commodity derivative contracts; Cash settlements paid on termination of derivative contracts; Net gains or losses on interest rate derivative contracts; Net gain on divestiture of oil and natural gas properties; Taxes; Compensation related items, which include share/unit-based compensation expense, unrealized fair value of phantom units granted to officers and cash settlement of phantom units granted to officers; Reorganization items; Severance costs; Material costs incurred on strategic transactions; and Non-controlling interest amounts attributable to each of the items above which revert the calculation back to an amount attributable to the Vanguard stockholders/unitholders.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a significant performance metric used by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness; and our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor is it presented as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Our Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and operating income and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nVANGUARD NATURAL RESOURCES, INC.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA (a)\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nSuccessor\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nThree Months\nThree Months\nThree Months\nEnded\nEnded\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet loss attributable to Vanguard stockholders/unitholders\n$\n(32,684)\n$\n(74,113)\n$\n(8,925)\nAdd: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n93\n71\n17\nNet loss\n$\n(32,591)\n$\n(74,042)\n$\n(8,908)\nPlus:\nInterest expense\n14,753\n14,589\n16,440\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion\n40,039\n43,743\n25,729\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n14,601\n47,640\n—\nExploration expense\n1,316\n—\n—\nChange in fair value of commodity derivative contracts (a)\n9,293\n9,517\n—\nCash settlements paid on termination of derivative contracts\n—\n4,140\n—\nNet gains on interest rate derivative contracts (b)\n—\n—\n(30)\nNet gain on divestiture of oil and natural gas properties\n—\n(4,450)\n—\nTaxes\n—\n—\n(356)\nCompensation related items\n496\n81\n2,629\nReorganization items\n1,707\n5,585\n26,746\nSeverance costs\n2,256\n—\n—\nMaterial costs incurred on strategic transactions\n148\n2,000\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA before non-controlling interest\n52,018\n48,803\n62,250\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest\n(37)\n(38)\n(116)\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Vanguard stockholders/unitholders\n$\n51,981\n$\n48,765\n$\n62,134\n(a)\nThese items are included in the net losses on commodity derivative contracts line item in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:\nSuccessor\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nThree Months\nThree Months\nThree Months\nEnded\nEnded\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet cash settlements received (paid) on matured commodity derivative contracts\n$\n(9,292)\n$\n(9,848)\n$\n7\nChange in fair value of commodity derivative contracts\n(9,293)\n(9,517)\n—\nCash settlements paid on termination of derivative contracts\n—\n(4,140)\n—\nNet gains (losses) on commodity derivative contracts\n$\n(18,585)\n$\n(23,505)\n$\n7\n(b)\nNet gains on interest rate derivative contracts as shown on the consolidated statements of operations is comprised of the following:\nPredecessor\nThree Months\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2017\nCash settlements paid on interest rate derivative contracts\n$\n(95)\nChange in fair value of interest rate derivative contracts\n125\nNet gains on interest rate derivative contracts\n$\n30\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders/Unitholders\nWe present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders/Unitholders in addition to our reported net income (loss) attributable to Common Stockholders/Unitholders in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders/Unitholders is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income available to Common Stockholders/Unitholders plus the following adjustments:\nChange in fair value of commodity derivative contracts; Change in fair value of interest rate derivative contracts; Cash settlements paid on termination of derivative contracts; Net gain on divestiture of oil and natural gas properties; Impairment of oil and natural gas properties; Reorganization items; Severance costs; and Material costs incurred on strategic transactions.\nWe present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders/Unitholders because management believes exclusion of the impact of these items will help investors compare results between periods and identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by these items and to highlight the significant fluctuations that commodity price volatility has on our results, particularly as it relates to changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts.\nIn particular, we make the adjustment for the change in fair value of commodity derivative contracts to allow investors to make a comparison of our quarterly results without the non-cash impact of commodity price fluctuations from period to period resulting from changes in the mark-to-market value of our portfolio of commodity derivative contracts. Rather than highlighting the significant fluctuations that commodity price volatility has on Net Income (Loss), we are aiming to give investors a meaningful picture of our performance (especially versus prior periods) that shows how the Company performed without the impact of the value of our portfolio of commodity derivative contracts. The fluctuations in the value of our portfolio of commodity derivatives contracts is related to futures pricing which is not a good indicator of historical performance of the business during the periods presented. Furthermore, any increases or decreases in the value of our portfolio of commodity derivatives contracts will result in non-cash charges or non-cash income. The inherent value (or cost) of such contracts is the amount of cash which our counterparties pay to us, or, with respect to costs, the amount which we paid to acquire the contracts and the amount that we are required to pay to our counterparties upon settlement. We believe this non-GAAP measure allows our investors to measure our actual performance without the impact of certain non-cash items that do not actually reflect the performance of the Company for the periods presented.\nWe also make the adjustment for the change in fair value of interest rate derivative contracts to give investors a period to period comparison without showing the impact of non-cash gains or losses related to the mark-to-market valuation of these derivatives contracts.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders/Unitholders is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor is it presented as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\nVANGUARD NATURAL RESOURCES, INC.\nReconciliation of Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders/Unitholders to\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders/Unitholders\n(in thousands, except per share/unit data)\n(Unaudited)\nSuccessor\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nThree Months\nThree Months\nThree Months\nEnded\nEnded\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet Loss Attributable to Vanguard Common Stockholders/Unitholders\n$\n(32,684)\n$\n(74,113)\n$\n(11,155)\nPlus (less):\nChange in fair value of commodity derivative contracts (a)\n9,293\n9,517\n—\nChange in fair value of interest rate derivative contracts (b)\n—\n—\n(125)\nCash settlements paid on termination of derivative contracts\n—\n4,140\n—\nNet gain on divestiture of oil and natural gas properties\n—\n(4,450)\n—\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n14,601\n47,640\n—\nReorganization items\n1,707\n5,585\n26,746\nSeverance costs\n2,256\n—\n—\nMaterial costs incurred on strategic transactions\n148\n2,000\n—\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Vanguard Common and Class B Stockholders/Unitholders\n$\n(4,679)\n$\n(9,681)\n$\n15,466\nNet Loss Attributable to Vanguard Common Stockholders/Unitholders, per share/unit\n$\n(1.63)\n$\n(3.69)\n$\n(0.08)\nPlus (less):\nChange in fair value of commodity derivative contracts (a)\n0.46\n0.47\n—\nChange in fair value of interest rate derivative contracts (b)\n—\n—\n—\nCash settlements paid on termination of derivative contracts\n—\n0.21\n—\nNet gain on divestiture of oil and natural gas properties\n—\n(0.22)\n—\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n0.73\n2.37\n—\nReorganization items\n0.08\n0.28\n0.20\nSeverance costs\n0.11\n—\n—\nMaterial costs incurred on strategic transactions\n0.01\n0.10\n—\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Vanguard Common and Class B Stockholders/Unitholders, per share/unit\n$\n(0.24)\n$\n(0.48)\n$\n0.12\nWeighted average common shares/common and Class B units outstanding\n20,100\n20,061\n131,377\n(a)\nChange in fair value of commodity derivative contracts reflects the increase or decrease in the mark-to-market value of the commodity derivative contracts.
