    "text": "WEST DES MOINES, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FBL Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: FFG):\nFinancial Highlights (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to FBL Financial Group $ 23,631 $ 26,433 Non-GAAP operating income (1) 27,633 26,988 Earnings per common share (assuming dilution): Net income 0.94 1.05 Non-GAAP operating income (1) 1.10 1.08 FBL Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: FFG) today reported net income attributable to FBL Financial Group for the first quarter of 2018 of $23.6 million, or $0.94 per diluted common share, compared to $26.4 million, or $1.05 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating income (1) totaled $27.6 million, or $1.10 per common share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $27.0 million, or $1.08 per common share, for the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 earnings per share reflects:\nThe benefit of other investment-related income of $0.11 per share Unfavorable mortality results in the Life Insurance segment A lower effective tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nNon-GAAP operating income differs from the GAAP measure, net income attributable to FBL Financial Group, in that it excludes the initial impact of changes in federal statutory income tax rates and tax laws, realized gains and losses on investments, and the change in net unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and equity securities. For further information on this non-GAAP financial measure, please refer to Note (1) and the reconciliation provided within this release.\n\"FBL Financial Group's first quarter 2018 earnings were strong with net income of $0.94 per share and record first quarter non-GAAP operating income of $1.10 per share,\" said James P. Brannen, Chief Executive Officer of FBL Financial Group, Inc. \"We've had success with life sales, resulting in a four percent increase in life insurance premiums collected in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. In addition to increased non-GAAP operating income, we returned $49 million of capital to shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 via a $1.50 per share special dividend and an increased regular quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share.\"\nProduct Revenues. Premiums and product charges for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $79.6 million compared to $77.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Interest sensitive product charges increased three percent while traditional life insurance premiums increased two percent during the quarter. Premiums collected (2) in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $169.7 million compared to $169.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Annuity premiums collected decreased three percent while life insurance premiums collected increased four percent.\nInvestment Income. Net investment income in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $101.0 million, compared to $101.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. This reflects an increase in average invested assets offset by lower investment yields. The annualized yield earned on average invested assets, with securities at amortized cost, including investments held as securities and indebtedness of related parties, was 5.19 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 5.30 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, 97 percent of the fixed maturity securities in FBL Financial Group's investment portfolio were investment grade debt securities.\nBenefits and Expenses. Benefits and expenses totaled $155.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $148.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Death benefits, net of reinsurance and reserves released, totaled $32.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $29.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. By its nature, mortality experience can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nNet Realized Gains/Losses. In the first quarter of 2018, FBL Financial Group recognized net realized losses on investments of $1.7 million. This is attributable to realized gains on sales of $0.1 million and change in unrealized gains/losses on equity securities of $1.8 million. In addition, other-than-temporary impairments totaled $1.3 million.\nEarnings Outlook. While subject to volatility from mortality experience, investment prepayment fee income and the impact of unlocking actuarial assumptions, non-GAAP operating income for the final nine months of 2018 is expected to compare favorably to the non-GAAP operating income for the final nine months of 2017, due primarily to the impact of the Tax Act on FBL Financial Group’s effective tax rate. The benefit of the lower effective tax rate is expected to be partially offset by decreases in non-GAAP pre-tax operating income in the Corporate segment. The Corporate segment results in the final nine months of 2018 are expected to be negatively impacted, relative to the comparable period in 2017, by the impact of less favorable equity market performance on the closed-block variable business and lower equity income from low income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. The expected decrease in income from LIHTC investments is driven primarily by the lower effective tax benefit, due to the Tax Act, on future investment partnership losses.\nStock Repurchases. During the first quarter of 2018, FBL Financial Group repurchased 99,312 shares of its Class A common stock. In March 2018, FBL Financial Group announced the authorization of a new stock repurchase program for up to $50.0 million.\nCapital and Book Value. As of March 31, 2018, the book value per share of FBL Financial Group common stock totaled $50.78, compared to $55.59 at December 31, 2017. Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (3) , totaled $43.28 at March 31, 2018, compared to $44.16 at December 31, 2017. The March 31, 2018 company action level risk based capital ratio of FBL Financial Group's wholly owned subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, was approximately 543 percent.\nFurther Financial Information.

Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited) (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues: Interest sensitive product charges $ 30,098 $ 29,201 Traditional life insurance premiums 49,497 48,434 Net investment income 101,022 100,994 Net realized capital losses (1,747 ) (403 ) Net other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings (1,295 ) (66 ) Other income 4,600 3,760 Total revenues 182,175 181,920 Benefits and expenses: Interest sensitive product benefits 61,345 62,760 Traditional life insurance benefits 45,456 42,954 Policyholder dividends 2,551 2,553 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses 39,577 34,353 Interest expense 1,213 1,212 Other expenses 5,593 4,151 Total benefits and expenses 155,735 147,983 26,440 33,937 Income taxes (4,687 ) (10,733 ) Equity income, net of related income taxes 1,855 3,231 Net income 23,608 26,435 Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest 23 (2 ) Net income attributable to FBL Financial Group, Inc. $ 23,631 $ 26,433 Earnings per common share - assuming dilution $ 0.94 $ 1.05 Weighted average common shares 25,003,691 25,030,462 Effect of dilutive securities 15,818 21,914 Weighted average common shares - diluted 25,019,509 25,052,376 (1) Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to FBL Financial Group to Non-GAAP Operating Income - Unaudited\nIn addition to net income, FBL Financial Group has consistently utilized non-GAAP operating income, a financial measure common in the life insurance industry that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as a primary economic measure to evaluate its financial performance. Non-GAAP operating income equals net income attributable to FBL Financial Group adjusted to exclude the initial impact of changes in federal statutory income tax rates and tax laws, realized gains and losses on investments, and the change in net unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and equity securities, which can fluctuate greatly from period to period. These fluctuations make it difficult to analyze core operating trends. In addition, for derivatives not designated as hedges, there is a mismatch between the valuation of the asset and liability when deriving net income (loss). Specifically, call options relating to indexed business are one-year assets while the embedded derivatives in the indexed contracts represent the rights of the contract holder to receive index credits over the entire period the indexed products are expected to be in force. This non-GAAP measure is used for goal setting, determining short-term incentive compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by many in the investment community. FBL Financial Group believes the combined presentation and evaluation of non-GAAP operating income, together with net income, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of FBL Financial Group's underlying results and profitability. A reconciliation is provided in the following table:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nNet income attributable to FBL Financial Group $ 23,631 $ 26,433 Adjustments: Initial impact of the Tax Act 1,069 — Net realized gains/losses on investments (a) (b) 2,424 554 Change in net unrealized gains/losses on derivatives (a) 509 1 Non-GAAP operating income $ 27,633 $ 26,988 Non-GAAP operating income per common share - assuming dilution $ 1.10 $ 1.08 (a) Net of adjustments, as applicable, to amortization of unearned revenue reserves, deferred acquisition costs, value of insurance in force acquired, interest sensitive policy reserves and income taxes attributable to these items.\n(b) Beginning in 2018, the change in net unrealized gains/losses on equity securities is included as an adjustment to net income.\n(2) Premiums Collected - Net statutory premiums collected is a non-GAAP measure and includes premiums collected from annuities and universal life-type products. It is a useful metric for investors as it is a measure of sales production. For GAAP reporting, these premiums received are not reported as revenues.\n(3) Reconciliation of Book Value Per Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income - Unaudited\nMarch 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 Book value per share $ 50.78 $ 55.59 Less: Per share impact of accumulated other comprehensive income 7.50 11.43 Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income $ 43.28 $ 44.16 Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income is a non-GAAP financial measure. Accumulated other comprehensive income totaled $186.2 million at March 31, 2018 and $285.0 million at December 31, 2017. Since accumulated other comprehensive income fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to unrealized changes in the fair value of investments caused principally by changes in market interest rates, FBL Financial Group believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information.\nFBL Financial Group, Inc.
