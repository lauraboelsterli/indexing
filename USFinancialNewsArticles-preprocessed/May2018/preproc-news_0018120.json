    "text": "Published: May 8, 2018 10:35 p.m. ET Share\nSlack’s top two customers are IBM and Oracle Shutterstock CEO Stewart Butterfield said the company’s average revenue per user has increased recently, citing the introduction of Slack’s enterprise product and migration to higher-priced plans.\nBy Rolfe Winkler\nSlack Technologies Inc. has surpassed 8 million daily active users and 3 million paid users, the company said Tuesday, continuing to grow rapidly as it sets the stage for a public offering in the next few years.\nThe company behind the popular workplace messaging app saw its daily active user number increase by roughly a third from last September and double since October 2016.\nThe number of paid users jumped 50% from last September and more than doubled since fall 2016.\nThe company, which launched its product in 2013, didn’t update its estimate for current annual recurring revenue, though the number would be approaching $300 million if the proportion of revenue to paid users has held steady since the company last commented on revenue.\nIn an interview, Slack Co-Founder and Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield said that such a figure wouldn’t be far off, but added that Slack would no longer provide the recurring revenue number because it isn’t a measure used by public companies. He said Slack, which remains privately held, is in a multiyear process of preparing to go public. Butterfield ruled out an IPO this year.",
