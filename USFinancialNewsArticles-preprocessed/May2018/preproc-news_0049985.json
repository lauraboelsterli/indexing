    "text": "GARDEN CITY, N.Y., May 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- In an April 13 th letter to National Bankshares President and Chief Executive Officer Brad Denardo, Hilton Capital Management outlined a number of concerns regarding National Bankshares' capital position and requested that National Bankshares normalize its capital levels by way of stock buybacks and/or a special dividend.\nThe letter – signed by Abbott Cooper, Portfolio Manager for Hilton Capital Management's Financial Opportunities Strategy – stated that reviewing its capital position and returning excess capital would benefit all stockholders, including National Bankshares' current and former CEOs.\n\"National Bankshares is a great bank,\" stated Mr. Cooper, \"but it has a lot of excess capital—far more that it is likely to ever be able to deploy to make loans and support business in its markets—and would be better off returning that excess capital to stockholders, particularly when, not only does the market not seem to give National Bankshares any benefit for their excess capital, but it likely masks what I think is pretty enviable performance.\"\n\"Returning all capital in excess of current norms would benefit all stockholders,\" added Dick Bove, Chief Strategist for the Financial Opportunities Strategy, \"we suggest that any other stockholders who share this view communicate that fact to National Bankshares.\"\nThe full text of the letter can be found here .\nAbout Hilton Capital Management, LLC\nHilton Capital Management is a privately held investment management boutique based in Garden City, NY.
