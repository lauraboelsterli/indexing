    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A top Federal Reserve official is suggesting that the unemployment rate could fall further to 3.5 percent with inflation modestly overshooting the Fed's target for a time without raising concerns.\nJohn Williams, currently president of the Fed's San Francisco regional bank, says that he still expects a gradual pace of three to four increases in the Fed's key interest rate this year. He spoke in an interview with CNBC after the government reported that the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent in April, the lowest level in more than 17 years, with 164,000 jobs created.\nWilliams will be moving next month to take over as president of the Fed's most influential regional bank in New York.",
