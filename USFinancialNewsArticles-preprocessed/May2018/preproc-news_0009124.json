    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 9:12 AM / Updated 38 minutes ago UBS CEO says investors may be expecting too much Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nZURICH (Reuters) - UBS Group ( UBSG.S ) Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti warned on Thursday that investors may be expecting too much too soon from Switzerland’s biggest bank, noting heavy spending on technology would weigh on results in the short term. CEO Sergio Ermotti of Swiss bank UBS speaks at the annual news conference in Zurich, Switzerland January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n“I have said this before – we cannot, unfortunately, simply multiply the first-quarter result by four,” he said in remarks prepared for the bank’s annual meeting in Basel.\n“While the macroeconomic environment may have improved somewhat, the geopolitical position remains difficult. And the interest rate situation – particularly in Switzerland and Europe – continues to be a challenge.\n“As with many of our U.S. competitors, the market may have too high short-term expectations,” he said.
