    "text": "WINNIPEG, May 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Medicure Inc. (\" Medicure \" or the \" Company \") (TSXV:MPH, OTC:MCUJF), a cardiovascular pharmaceutical company, today reported its results from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018 Highlights:\nRecorded net revenue from the sale of AGGRASTAT ® (tirofiban hydrochloride) of $6.1 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $7.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017;\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA 1 ) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $874,000 compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017; and\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1.4 million compared to a net loss of $5.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\n$72.4 million in cash and short-term investments as at March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Results\nNet revenues from AGGRASTAT ® for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $6.1 million compared to $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company continues to experience an increase in patient market share held by the product and an increase in the number of new hospital customers using AGGRASTAT ® leading to the highest hospital demand for AGGRASTAT ® in the Company's history. Although, there was an increase in use of AGGRASTAT ® , the lower net revenue was largely due to a stronger Canadian dollar compared to its US counterpart and increased competitive pricing of generic Integrilin.\nMedicure continues to focus on expanding the customer base for AGGRASTAT ® . Along with this, the Company has begun to diversify revenues with the recent launch of ZYPITAMAG TM (pitavastatin magnesium), its second cardiovascular drug targeting the US market. Additional drugs are expected to be launched in the next 12 to 15 months.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $874,000 compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is the result of:\nlower revenues which were primarily due to lower discounted prices for AGGRASTAT ® and a higher Canadian dollar relative to its US counterpart, higher cost of goods sold due to higher volume of AGGRASTAT ® sold during the period,\npartially offset by;\nlower research and development expenses when compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of timing of expenses relating to the Company's research and development projects.\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.4 million or $0.09 per share compared to a net loss of $5.1 million or $0.32 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017, however the net loss for the 2017 quarter includes a net loss of $6.3 million from discontinued operations relating to the results from the Apicore business, which was divested in 2017. Excluding the loss from discontinued operations, net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by $176,000 over same period in 2017 primarily due to foreign exchange gains resulting from increased U.S. dollar denominated cash and short-term investment balances, partially offset by lower revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nAs at March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and short-term investments totaling $72.4 million compared to $5.3 million as of December 31, 2017. This consisted of $14.4 million of unrestricted cash and $58.0 million of short-term investments in the form of term deposits with maturities of greater than three months and less than one year. As at March 31, 2018, the Company had working capital of $73.6 million compared to December 31, 2017 of $70.9 million. The Company had cash from operating activities of $319,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to cash used in operating activities of $834,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAll amounts referenced herein are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.\nNotes\n(1) The Company defines EBITDA as \"earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other income or expense\" and Adjusted EBITDA as \"EBITDA adjusted for non-cash and one-time items\". The terms \"EBITDA\" and \"Adjusted EBITDA\", as it relates to the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 results prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), do not have any standardized meaning according to IFRS. It is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nConference Call Info:\nTopic: Medicure's Q1 2018 Results\nCall date: Thursday May 24, 2018\nTime: 7:30 AM Central Time (8:30 AM Eastern Time)\nCanada toll-free: 1 (888) 465-5079 Canada toll: 1 (416) 216-4169\nUnited States toll-free: 1 (888) 545-0687\nPasscode: 5781086#\nWebcast: This conference call will be webcast live over the internet and can be accessed from the Medicure investor relations page at the following link: http://www.medicure.com/investors.html\nYou may request international country-specific access information by e-mailing the Company in advance.
