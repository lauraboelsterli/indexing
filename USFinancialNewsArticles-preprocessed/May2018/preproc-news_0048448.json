    "text": "NEW YORK, WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of LaSalle Hotel Properties (\"LHO\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: LHO) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII (the \"Affiliates\"). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, LHO shareholders will receive $33.50 in cash for each share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether LHO's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, the Company rejected a cash-and-stock offer from Pebblebrook Hotel Trust which values LHO at $35.89 per share, or nearly $2.50 more than the Affiliates' offer.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether LHO's Board acted in the best interests of LHO's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own LHO shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/lasalle-hotel-properties/\n releases/weisslaw-llp-investigates-lasalle-hotel-properties-300654011.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP",
