    "text": "May 27, 2018 / 8:58 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Exclusive - U.S. warships sail near South China Sea islands claimed by Beijing Idrees Ali 4 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Navy warships sailed near South China Sea islands claimed by China on Sunday, two U.S. officials told Reuters, in a move that drew condemnation from Beijing as President Donald Trump seeks its continued cooperation on North Korea.\nThe operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters.\nWhile this operation had been planned months in advance, and similar operations have become routine, it comes at a particularly sensitive time and just days after the Pentagon uninvited China from a major U.S.-hosted naval drill.\nThe U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Higgins guided-missile destroyer and the Antietam, a guided-missile cruiser, came within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals over which China has territorial disputes with its neighbours.\nThe U.S. military vessels carried out manoeuvring operations near Tree, Lincoln, Triton and Woody islands in the Paracels, one of the officials said.\nTrump’s cancellation of a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has put further strain on U.S.-China ties amid a trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.\nCritics of the operations, known as a “freedom of navigation,” have said that they have little impact on Chinese behaviour and are largely symbolic.\nThe U.S. military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and that they are separate from political considerations.\nSatellite photographs taken on May 12 showed China appeared to have deployed truck-mounted surface-to-air missiles or anti-ship cruise missiles at Woody Island.\nEarlier this month, China’s air force landed bombers on disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the region, triggering concern from Vietnam and the Philippines.\nThe U.S. military did not directly comment on Sunday’s operation, but said U.S. forces operate in the region daily. Related Coverage China condemns U.S. warships' South China Sea mission\n“We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to do in the future,” U.S. Pacific Fleet said in a statement.\nChina’s Defence Ministry expressed its anger, saying it had sent ships and aircraft to warn the U.S. warships to leave, saying they had entered the country’s territorial waters without permission.\nThe move “contravened Chinese and relevant international law, seriously infringed upon Chinese sovereignty (and) harmed strategic mutual trust between the two militaries,” it said.\nIn a separate statement, China’s Foreign Ministry urged the United States to stop such actions.\n“China will continue to take all necessary measures to defend the country’s sovereignty and security,” it added, without elaborating. CONTESTED SEA\nPentagon officials have long complained that China has not been candid enough about its rapid military build-up and using South China Sea islands to gather intelligence in the region.\nIn March, a U.S. Navy destroyer carried out a “freedom of navigation” operation close to Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands.\nChinese officials have accused Washington of viewing their country in suspicious, “Cold War” terms. Satellite photo dated March 28, 2018 shows Woody Island. Planet Labs Inc/Handout via REUTERS\nChina’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion (3.75 trillion pounds) in shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nThe United States has said it would like to see more international participation in freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea.
