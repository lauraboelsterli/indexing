    "text": "Mike Moustakas homered twice and drove in five runs, and the visiting Kansas City Royals homered four times and scored 10 runs in the first inning, finishing with five homers overall in a 15-7 rout of the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night.\nMoustakas hit a solo home run in the first and added a two-run double later that inning. He belted a two-run homer in the fifth and finished the night 3-for-6.\nThe four homers in the first inning — all off Baltimore starter Dylan Bundy — tied a Kansas City record. This was the third time the Royals have hit four homers in one frame, the last being in the fourth inning of a June 29, 2001 game at Cleveland.\nJorge Soler started the scoring in the first with a two-run homer. Then came Moustakas and Salvador Perez with homers — the three batters homering back-to-back-to-back for a 4-0 lead.\nLater in the inning. Alex Gordon belted a three-run homer which gave the Royals a 7-0 edge. The Orioles then pulled Bundy (1-5), who did not retire any of the seven batters he faced and allowed seven runs on five hits.\nBundy is the first pitcher in modern major league history to give up four home runs without recording an out, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\nThe Royals eventually sent 14 batters to the plate in the first inning. They finished with 10 runs on nine hits in that opening half-inning.\nKansas City totaled 20 hits in the game. Seven Royals got at least two hits, with Gordon (4-for-5) leading the way.\nAll that offense made life easier for Kansas City starter Danny Duffy (1-4). The left-hander has struggled at times early this season but gave up one run on six hits in 5 1/3 innings.\nThe Orioles now have dropped seven consecutive games. They returned home after losing all six games on a West Coast trip that ended Sunday.\nChris Davis hit a solo homer in the second off Duffy. Danny Valencia and Caleb Joseph later added solo homers off of Burch Smith in the eighth.\nBaltimore got All-Star second baseman Jonathan Schoop back from the disabled list Tuesday. Infielder Engelb Vielma was sent back to Triple-A Norfolk.\nSchoop added a two-run single during a four-run ninth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
