Its shares fell as much as 10 percent at the open before paring some of the losses.\nTelecommunications company Axiata Group Bhd, majority owned by state sovereign fund Khazanah, fell 8.5 pct, while bank CIMB Group Holdings Bhd plunged 12 percent. The group chairman of CIMB is Nazir Razak, Najib’s brother.\nBucking the trend were firms with links to the new government. Robert Kuok-controlled PPB Group Bhd rose 8.3 percent, following Kuok’s appointment as an adviser to the new administration.\nPackaged-food maker Nestle also rose 3.6 percent.
