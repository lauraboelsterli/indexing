Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) of $247.9 million for the first quarter of 2018. Reduced unit operating expense, including lease operating expense, midstream gathering and processing expense, production tax expense and general and administrative expense, for the first quarter of 2018 by 11% to $0.88 per Mcfe from $0.99 per Mcfe for the fourth quarter of 2017. Completed previously announced stock repurchase program of $100 million during first quarter of 2018 by acquiring 9.7 million shares. Expanded stock repurchase program to acquire up to an additional $100 million of outstanding common stock during 2018 for a total of $200 million. Sold 25% equity interest in Strike Force Midstream LLC (\"Strike Force\") for $175 million. Reduced 2018 non-drilling and completion (\"D&C\") capital expenditures by $20 million following the sale of Gulfport's equity interest in Strike Force. Budgeted 2018 total capital expenditures to be in the range of $750 million to $815 million and funded within cash flow. Increased forecasted 2018 production and estimate 2018 full year net production to average 1,310 MMcfe to 1,340 MMcfe per day, an increase of approximately 20% to 23% over the average daily net production of 1,089.2 MMcfe per day during 2017. Currently estimate second quarter of 2018 net production to average 1,300 MMcfe to 1,320 MMcfe per day. Gulfport's lead lenders have proposed an increase to Gulfport's borrowing base to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion, subject to the approval of the additional banks within the syndicate, with Gulfport's elected commitment to remain at $1.0 billion. Increased hedge position to approximately 948 BBtu per day of natural gas fixed price swaps during 2018 at an average fixed price of $3.05 per MMBtu and a large base level of 662 BBtu per day of natural gas fixed price swaps during 2019 at an average fixed price of $2.84 per MMBtu.\nChief Executive Officer and President, Michael G. Moore, commented, \"Gulfport began the year strong both operationally and financially, delivering on several of our strategic objectives planned for 2018. The outperformance of our base production wedge and new well delivery in the SCOOP positioned us well in the first quarter and led to an increase in our forecasted average daily volumes for the full year, highlighting the quality of our asset base and further bolstering the free cash flow generated from our 2018 activities. Gulfport remains steadfastly committed to funding our total 2018 capital budget from cash flow and estimate that roughly two-thirds of the capital budget will be invested during the first half of the year, with spend decreasing significantly in the third and fourth quarters.\nWe were opportunistic and aggressive with our stock repurchase program and completed the full $100 million authorization in the open market prior to the end of the first quarter. We remain committed to realizing the most value for our stockholders. As we evaluate the best uses of our available liquidity, we will consider a range of options, including stock repurchases and debt reduction, practicing discipline as we allocate capital to programs and strategic initiatives that we believe have the highest return potential. Furthermore, our commitment to demonstrating capital discipline is highlighted by our board’s decision to include a metric relating to Gulfport's return on average capital employed into Gulfport's 2018 annual incentive plan targets, which are intended to maximize the value of every dollar we invest and our commitment to the Gulfport stockholders.\"\nStock Repurchase Program\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Gulfport repurchased 9.7 million shares and completed in full the previously announced authorized program to acquire up to $100 million of the Company's outstanding common stock during 2018.\nGulfport announced today that its board of directors has expanded the stock repurchase program and Gulfport has been authorized to acquire up to an additional $100 million of its outstanding common stock during 2018 for a total of up to $200 million. Purchases under the expanded repurchase program may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, and will be subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations and other factors. The repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. The Company intends to purchase shares under the repurchase program opportunistically with available funds while maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund its 2018 capital development program. This repurchase program is authorized to extend through December 31, 2018 and may be suspended from time to time, modified, extended or discontinued by the board of directors at any time.\nFinancial Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Gulfport reported net income of $90.1 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, on revenues of $325.4 million.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that Gulfport expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), business strategy and measures to implement strategy, competitive strength, goals, expansion and growth of Gulfport's business and operations, plans, market conditions, references to future success, reference to intentions as to future matters and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by Gulfport in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with Gulfport's expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, general economic, market, credit or business conditions that might affect the timing and amount of the repurchase program; the opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by Gulfport; Gulfport’s ability to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions of properties and businesses; competitive actions by other oil and gas companies; changes in laws or regulations; and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Gulfport. Information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurances that the actual results or developments anticipated by Gulfport will be realized, or even if realized, that they will have the expected consequences to or effects on Gulfport, its business or operations. Gulfport has no intention, and disclaims any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future results or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, accretion expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to EBITDA less non-cash derivative loss (gain), acquisition expense and (income) loss from equity method investments. Cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to cash provided by operating activity before changes in operating assets and liabilities. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to pre-tax net income less non-cash derivative loss (gain), acquisition expense and (income) loss from equity method investments. The Company has presented EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because it uses these measures as an integral part of its internal reporting to evaluate its performance and the performance of its senior management. These measures are considered important indicators of the operational strength of the Company's business and eliminate the uneven effect of considerable amounts of non-cash depletion, depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets. A limitation of these measures, however, is that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's business. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets and the impact of related impairments through other financial measures, such as capital expenditures, investment spending and return on capital. Therefore, the Company believes that these measures provide useful information to its investors regarding its performance and overall results of operations. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities are not intended to represent funds available for dividends, reinvestment or other discretionary uses, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in the Company's various agreements.\nInvestor & Media Contact:\nJessica Wills – Director, Investor Relations\njwills@gulfportenergy.com\n405-252-4550\nGULFPORT ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands, except share data) Revenues: Natural gas sales $ 249,399 $ 177,837 Oil and condensate sales 45,686 24,411 Natural gas liquid sales 46,836 31,179 Net (loss) gain on gas, oil and NGL derivatives (16,529 ) 99,577 325,392 333,004 Costs and expenses: Lease operating expenses 18,906 19,303 Production taxes 6,854 3,906 Midstream gathering and processing 64,193 47,941 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 111,018 65,991 General and administrative 13,099 12,600 Accretion expense 1,004 282 Acquisition expense — 1,298 215,074 151,321 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS 110,318 181,683 OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE: Interest expense 33,965 23,479 Interest income (37 ) (842 ) (Income) loss from equity method investments, net (13,536 ) 4,907 Other income (95 ) (316 ) 20,297 27,228 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 90,021 154,455 INCOME TAX BENEFIT (69 ) — NET INCOME $ 90,090 $ 154,455 NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: Basic $ 0.50 $ 0.91 Diluted $ 0.50 $ 0.91 Weighted average common shares outstanding—Basic 180,714,881 170,272,685 Weighted average common shares outstanding—Diluted 180,802,301 170,488,519\nGULFPORT ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Unaudited) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (In thousands, except share data) Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 118,613 $ 99,557 Accounts receivable—oil and natural gas 199,457 182,213 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 7,564 4,912 Short-term derivative instruments 50,906 78,847 Total current assets 376,540 365,529 Property and equipment: Oil and natural gas properties, full-cost accounting, $2,971,119 and\n$2,912,974 excluded from amortization in 2018 and 2017, respectively 9,470,697 9,169,156 Other property and equipment 89,648 86,754 Accumulated depletion, depreciation, amortization and impairment (4,264,647 ) (4,153,733 ) Property and equipment, net 5,295,698 5,102,177 Other assets: Equity investments 311,694 302,112 Long-term derivative instruments 15,769 8,685 Deferred tax asset — 1,208 Inventories 8,505 8,227 Other assets 20,186 19,814 Total other assets 356,154 340,046 Total assets $ 6,028,392 $ 5,807,752 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 577,548 $ 553,609 Asset retirement obligation—current 120 120 Short-term derivative instruments 37,570 32,534 Current maturities of long-term debt 629 622 Total current liabilities 615,867 586,885 Long-term derivative instruments 2,499 2,989 Asset retirement obligation—long-term 76,267 74,980 Deferred tax liability 2,884 — Other non-current liabilities 2,963 2,963 Long-term debt, net of current maturities 2,239,023 2,038,321 Total liabilities 2,939,503 2,706,138 Commitments and contingencies Preferred stock, $.01 par value;
