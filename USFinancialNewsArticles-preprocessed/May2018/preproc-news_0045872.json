    "text": "Inside the training camp where Google shares its A.I. secrets with Alphabet-invested companies Jillian D'Onfro Reblog The multi-day program offers a multi-day machine-learning crash course adapted from Google's own internal training program. A group of about 30 engineers sipped coffee and tapped out notes on their laptops, while a charismatic Google employee named Michael \"Mig\" Gerard whipped through a presentation on how to best apply machine learning, a trendy sub-field of A.I. in which software programs get \"smarter\" at solving problems over time as they receive more data. While the audience of fellow engineers got the joke, they weren't who you might expect.",
