    "text": "BEIJING, May 25 (Reuters) - Almost all base metals rose on Friday, led by Shanghai nickel which hit a near three-year high, after the dollar took a hit following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to cancel a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. A weaker dollar makes metals more expensive for holders of other currencies and can support prices. FUNDAMENTALS * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.2 percent at $6,894 tonne, as of 0225 GMT, building on a 0.2 gain in the previous session. * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed 0.5 percent to 51,570 yuan ($8,071.94) a tonne. * USD: The dollar index edged up 0.2 percent, and recovered slightly against the yen after hitting its lowest in more than two weeks in the previous session. * NICKEL: Shanghai nickel gained 3.1 percent to 111,330 yuan a tonne, hitting its highest since June 2015. * LEAD: Lead was flat in London at $2,493, but is up 7 percent so far this week on dwindling stocks and a crackdown on recycling capacity in China. The metal is on course for its best week since January 2017. Shanghai lead added another 0.9 percent, and is up 9.6 percent in May. * RUSAL: Russian aluminium producer Rusal has asked the Russian government to purchase some of its output, a government source said on Thursday, in an effort to alleviate the pain inflicted by U.S. sanctions. * LITHIUM: Chilean miner SQM said on Thursday it would invest $525 million to boost its lithium production capacity in Chile through 2021 as demand for the key ingredient in electric vehicle batteries continues to surge.
