The pair is a barometer of risk over the euro’s outlook.\nGoldman Sachs said on Thursday that any systemic spillovers from Italian political risks into peripheral Europe could push the euro down against the dollar by “around five big figures.”\nThough the yen and the safe-haven Swiss franc are set to notch up big weekly gains in response to heightened worries over global politics, traders were quick to lock in gains ahead of long weekends in the United States and Britain.\nThe dollar had been rising for weeks on its widening yield advantage but lost some of its momentum after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting published on Wednesday were seen as more dovish than markets had expected.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Tomo Uetake in TOKYO Editing by Keith Weir\n ",
