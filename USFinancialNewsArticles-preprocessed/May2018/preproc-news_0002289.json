    "text": "Facebook users got a new addition to their News Feed on Tuesday: A yellow-orange icon with the question “Does this post contain hate speech?” and an option to select “yes” or “no.”\nThis feature, which Facebook called a “bug” in a statement to tech news site ArsTechnica , appeared on every user post, according to reports, and allegedly appeared twice on ads.\nIf users clicked “no,” the message disappeared. But if users selected “yes,” three unfinished-looking options appeared, as documented by one Twitter user:\nwhen you click the \"yes\" button on the \"Does this post contain hate speech?\" prompt on facebook you're presented with a form that clearly wasn't supposed to be pushed to live.\nWhat a terrible website. pic.twitter.com/s8OkovU78A\n— Kay Fabe Hutchinson (@LonestarTallBoi) May 1, 2018\nThe “hate speech” question appeared for less than 30 minutes before disappearing by noon ET.\n“This was an internal test we were working on to understand different types of speech, including speech we thought would not be hate,” a Facebook spokesperson told Fortune . “A bug caused it to launch publicly. It’s been disabled.”\nUsers flooded Twitter to document the glitch, which apparently appeared under posts about food, dogs, and former boy band N*SYNC “It’s gonna be May” memes:\nFacebook — an industry leader in Artificial Intelligence who thinks that AI is going to solve all of its problems — is asking me if this post contains hate speech pic.twitter.com/4MqrGw8PFj\n— brian feldman (@bafeldman) May 1, 2018\nWhen did Facebook start appending every post with \"Does this post contain hate speech\"?\n— Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) May 1, 2018\nSo glad Facebook has finally given me the ability to report every single pro- New York Mets post as \"hate speech.\"\n— Andrew Mullins (@AndrewWMullins) May 1, 2018\nNo. My sandwich news does not, in fact, contain hate speech, Facebook. pic.twitter.com/0VWo9Z21yX\n— Adam Rawnsley (@arawnsley) May 1, 2018\nThis is weird.\nFacebook is asking me about whether *my own post* on Facebook contains hate speech.\nAnd also, the post is just a NYT story about restaurant trends in Austin, to which I've added no commentary. pic.twitter.com/ZIrUW4IW4q\n— Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) May 1, 2018\nIs this happening to anyone else? Every post on Facebook asks ‘Does this post contain hate speech? Yes No’\n— Colin Chisholm (@ColinHantsCo) May 1, 2018\neveryone: yo facebook your company has an issue with hate speech\nfacebook: our top engineers are designing algorithms to solve this problem\nfacebook: pic.twitter.com/Gn9QMCqRfF\n— Produced by Philip M. Jamesson (@PhilJamesson) May 1, 2018\nThe bug appeared on the same day as the 2018 Facebook’s F8 developer conference in San Jose, Calif. that featured a presentation by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He announced new features for Instagram and Messenger along with a planned dating service.\nThis year’s F8 comes amid backlash against Facebook over user privacy and election meddling, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal , in which data from up to 87 million users was inappropriately obtained by a third party.",
