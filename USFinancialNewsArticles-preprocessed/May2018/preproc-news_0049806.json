Imports, however, only make up a fraction of the overall market and tend to be upper-end models.\nYale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said price cuts by foreign premium brands will likely force them to adjust the price tag for vehicles they produce locally in China. This in turn will gradually impact the price of more affordable, mainstream cars - even local Chinese brands.\n“With imminent price adjustments in the higher-end segment, that will over time lead to a pricing adjustment for the entire market,” Zhang said.\nOther carmakers, including Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and BMW, said after the tariff cut that they would look at adjusting their retail prices in China to provide competitive offers to consumers. $1 = 6.3735 Chinese yuan Reporting By Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Adam Jourdan",
