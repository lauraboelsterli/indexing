    "text": "HOUSTON, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VAALCO Energy, Inc. (NYSE:EGY) today reported operational and financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nHighlights and Recent Key Items :\nReported income from continuing operations of $8.7 million ($0.15 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2018, which was 146% higher compared with $3.5 million ($0.06 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2017; Generated operating income of $13.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, which was $10.5 million higher compared with $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017; Grew Adjusted EBITDAX to $14.5 million, up $10.5 million from $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017; As previously disclosed, income from continuing operations, operating income and Adjusted EBITDAX were positively impacted this quarter by higher realized Brent pricing, no commodity hedges in place and the split lifting that took place during the period from December 31, 2017 to January 1, 2018; Produced an average of 3,611 net barrels of oil per day (BOPD) in the first quarter of 2018, above the guidance range for the quarter, despite two wells that were shut-in during the period as a result of prior year electrical submersible pump (“ESP”) failures on the Avouma platform; Realized pricing of $68.69 per barrel of oil in the first quarter of 2018, up 15% compared with $59.89 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017; Increased working capital from continuing operations by $7.9 million, which contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents; Reduced debt by $2.1 million, resulting in total debt (principal amount) at March 31, 2018 of $7.1 million.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, VAALCO reported income from continuing operations of $8.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. In the same period in 2017, the Company reported income from continuing operations of $4.4 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, and in the fourth quarter of 2017 reported income from continuing operations of $3.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. The average realized price for crude oil in the first quarter of 2018 was $68.69 per barrel, an increase of 32% from $51.99 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the average realized price for crude oil was $59.89 per barrel. Adjusted EBITDAX totaled $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $10.4 million in the same period of 2017, and $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDAX and working capital from continuing operations are Non-GAAP financial measures and are described and reconciled to the closest GAAP measure in the attached table under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nCary Bounds, VAALCO’s Chief Executive Officer commented: “I am very pleased with our strong first quarter 2018 results. With our realized pricing correlated to Brent and no hedges in place for 2018, we were able to generate significant net income and adjusted EBITDAX. As our oil price realizations in the first quarter grew to the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2014, so did our operational margin per barrel, and we were able to increase our operational income from the fourth quarter of 2017 by over $10 million. We also paid down our debt by $2.1 million and grew cash to $32.2 million. We are delivering on guidance and strengthening our balance sheet, while we continue to evaluate development opportunities at Etame that we are considering drilling early next year, subject to approvals from the Gabon government and our partners. We are mobilizing a hydraulic workover unit to our Avouma platform to replace the ESPs in our two wells that are temporarily shut-in and expect to restore approximately 750 BOPD of production from those wells before the end of the second quarter. I am optimistic that we will create substantial value for our shareholders in 2018 by continuing to enhance our operations and improving our balance sheet.\nGabon\nIn the first quarter of 2018, net oil production exceeded guidance at 3,611 BOPD compared with 3,957 BOPD in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease in production was primarily due to the loss of production from two Avouma wells that experienced ESP failures in late 2017.\nIn late 2016, VAALCO completed a successful workover campaign and replaced ESPs in the South Tchibala 2-H and Avouma 2-H wells on the Avouma platform. Following the failure of the South Tchibala 2-H ESP in July 2017, VAALCO began workover operations in October 2017 to replace failed ESPs in the South Tchibala 1-HB and South Tchibala 2-H wells. While production from the South Tchibala 1-HB well was not restored, the workover operation on the South Tchibala 2-H well was successfully completed in November 2017. Following demobilization of the workover unit in late 2017, the Avouma 2-H well experienced ESP failures, and the well remains temporarily shut-in. VAALCO has worked closely with the original equipment manufacturer and other technical experts to identify the root causes of the ESP failures. Based on the results of the combined team’s analysis, changes have been made to the design, installation and operating systems of the ESPs which the Company believes will reduce the likelihood of untimely failures in the future. VAALCO is mobilizing a hydraulic workover unit to the Avouma platform to replace the ESP systems in the Avouma 2-H and the South Tchibala 1-HB wells and restore approximately 750 BOPD of net production to both wells before the end of the second quarter of 2018. Excluding the Avouma platform wells, the wells with ESPs on our three other platforms have operated without incident for up to four years.\nEquatorial Guinea\nThe Company continues to examine alternative, lower cost development options for discoveries on Block P offshore Equatorial Guinea. These discoveries present unique development opportunities that will be re-evaluated as prices continue to recover.\n2018 First Quarter Financial Results\nTotal oil sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $27.6 million, compared to $17.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, VAALCO sold approximately 393,000 net barrels of oil at an average price of $68.69 per barrel, compared to 280,000 net barrels at an average price of $59.89 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017. In late December, the normal monthly sales lifting from the floating production facility that stores oil produced in the Etame block was not able to be completed by December 31 due to adverse sea and weather conditions. As a result, the December lifting took place during the period from December 31, 2017 to January 1, 2018 with 53,300 net barrels of oil sold in December and the remaining balance of 95,500 net barrels of oil sold in January 2018. In addition to 95,500 net barrels of oil being sold in January 2018 instead of December 2017, the Company also benefited from the split-lifting because VAALCO’s January 2018 pricing was $68.66 per barrel of oil sales as compared to $63.67 per barrel in December 2017.\nCosts and Expenses\nTotal production expense, excluding workovers, was $10.7 million, or $27.17 per barrel of oil of sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.1 million, or $20.44 per barrel of oil of sales, in the first quarter of 2017, and $8.2 million, or $29.12 per barrel of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. Costs per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2017 were impacted by higher FPSO costs and certain regulatory related costs. Workover expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.3 million.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was $1.1 million, or $2.86 per barrel of oil of sales in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.9 million, or $4.74 per barrel of oil of sales in the comparable period in 2017, and $0.9 million, or $3.28 per barrel of oil of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. DD&A per barrel decreased due to the increase in proved reserves at December 31, 2017.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expense for the first quarter 2018 was $2.6 million, or $6.62 per barrel of oil of sales, as compared to $3.1 million, or $7.94 per barrel of oil of sales in the first quarter 2017 and $1.7 million, or $6.15 per barrel of oil of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. General and administrative expense includes $0.3 million, $0.2 million, and $0.2 million of non-cash compensation expense for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Fourth quarter 2017 G&A was lower due to a benefit from increased charges to our joint venture partners during the quarter offset by accruals related to a Gabon regulatory audit.\nIncome tax expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.0 million compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2017, and $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in income tax expense in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same quarter in 2017 is primarily attributable to higher revenue in VAALCO’s operations in Gabon. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, a $1.3 million income tax benefit associated with the reversal of the valuation allowance related to AMT credits was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCapital Investments/Balance Sheet\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, VAALCO invested approximately $0.4 million in capital expenditures on a cash basis, primarily for equipment and enhancements. The Company does not currently have any material commitments for capital investments in 2018 but is considering development drilling offshore Gabon in early 2019.\nAt the end of the first quarter, VAALCO had an unrestricted cash balance of $32.2 million. This does not include an additional $0.9 million in restricted cash (related primarily to deposits in Gabon) classified as current assets or the additional $1.0 million of restricted cash classified as long term. The unrestricted cash balance includes $4.8 million of cash attributable to non-operating partner advances.\nBeginning with the first quarter of 2018, the government of Gabon elected to lift the state’s share of oil (which is reported as income taxes) separately from the Etame joint venture partners. As a result, Gabon income taxes will be settled when the government of Gabon lifts its own share of production. Such settlements are expected to occur once or twice per year, depending on production levels. At March 31, 2018, VAALCO had $1.8 million of foreign taxes payable attributable to such taxes.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, VAALCO reduced its debt by $2.1 million. At March 31, 2018, debt, net of deferred financing costs, totaled $7.0 million, of which $5.8 million is expected to be repaid during 2018 and was classified as current, reflecting the repayment terms of the loan agreement with the IFC.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, the Company will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter financial and operating results May 8, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by VAALCO’s management and by external users of the Company’s financial statements, such as industry analysts, lenders, rating agencies, investors and others who follow the industry as an indicator of the Company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net income before discontinued operations, interest income (expense) net, income tax expense, depletion, depreciation and amortization, impairment of proved properties, exploration expense, non-cash and other items including stock compensation expense and commodity derivative loss.\nAdjusted EBITDAX has significant limitations, including that it does not reflect the Company’s cash requirements for capital expenditures, contractual commitments, working capital or debt service. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and operating income (loss) and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, the Company’s Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe table below reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to Adjusted EBITDAX.\nVAALCO ENERGY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended Reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDAX March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Net income $ 8,659 $ 4,259 3,431 Add back: Impact of discontinued operations 52 176 103 Interest expense, net 354 403 306 Income tax expense 4,042 3,194 1,339 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,124 1,869 918 Exploration expense — — 3 Non-cash or unusual items: Stock-based compensation 314 154 165 Accrued liabilities reversal — — (2,614 ) Shareholder matters — 15 — Commodity derivative loss — 180 61 Equipment (recovery) write-offs (24 ) 63 — Bad debt expense (recovery) and other (56 ) 98 220 Adjusted EBITDAX $ 14,465 $ 10,411 $ 3,932 Reconciliation of Changes in Working Capital From Continuing Operations March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Change Current assets $ 46,477 $ 33,616 $ 12,861 Current liabilities 36,250 31,241 5,009 Working capital (1) $ 10,227 $ 2,375 $ 7,852 Excludes current assets and current liabilities attributable to discontinued operations.\nSource:VAALCO Energy, Inc.",
