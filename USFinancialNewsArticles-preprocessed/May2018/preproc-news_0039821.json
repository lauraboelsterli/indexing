    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 17 (Reuters) - China has offered U.S. President Donald Trump a package of proposed purchases of U.S. goods and other measures aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China by some $200 billion a year, U.S. officials familiar with the offer said.\nThe offer was made during U.S.-China trade talks in Washington aimed at resolving tariff threats and other trade irritants between the worldâ€™s two largest economies, but it was not immediately clear how the total value was determined.\nOne of the sources said that U.S. aircraft maker Boeing Co would be a major beneficiary of the Chinese offer. Boeing is the largest U.S. exporter and already sells about a quarter of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers.
