    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MACK), a clinical-stage oncology company focused on biomarker-defined cancers, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018.\n\"At Merrimack, we set out to design targeted solutions with pharmacological properties to match our team's understanding of cancer pathways and drug metabolism. We have been focused on executing this strategy as we advance the ten wholly-owned programs across our clinical and preclinical pipeline, each addressing biomarker-defined cancers,\" said Richard Peters, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We look forward to our three upcoming clinical readouts: randomized Phase 2 data for istiratumab (MM-141) in pancreatic cancer and seribantumab (MM-121) in non-small cell lung cancer and Phase 1 data for MM-310 in solid tumors.\"\nFirst Quarter and Recent Highlights\nKey events from the first quarter and more recently include:\nAppointment of Lee Newcomer, M.D., M.H.A., former Senior Vice President for Oncology and Genetics and Chief Medical Officer at UnitedHealthcare and board-certified medical oncologist, to Merrimack's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). Dr. Newcomer, with his perspective on medical oncology and patient access, joins distinguished experts in precision oncology, bioengineering, drug discovery and clinical development on Merrimack's SAB; and Presentation of preclinical data at the 2018 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. Merrimack hosted four poster sessions, highlighting preclinical data from MM-310 as well as other preclinical programs currently in development.\nUpcoming Milestones\nMerrimack anticipates the following upcoming clinical milestones:\nTop-line results in the first half of 2018 from the CARRIE study, an event-driven, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating istiratumab (MM-141) added to standard of care in patients with front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer who have high serum levels of free IGF-1; Top-line results in the second half of 2018 from the SHERLOC study, an event-driven, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating seribantumab (MM-121) added to standard of care in patients with heregulin positive non-small cell lung cancer; and Safety data and maximum tolerated dose in the second half of 2018 from the Phase 1 clinical study of MM-310 in patients with solid tumors.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThe following summarizes Merrimack's financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $13.1 million, compared to $21.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Research and development spending for the first quarter of 2018 was lower versus the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to Merrimack's refocused clinical and preclinical pipeline; General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $4.3 million, compared to $5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. General and administrative spending for the first quarter of 2018 was lower versus the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to a decrease in corporate expenses related to headcount levels following the asset sale to Ipsen S.A.; Net loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $17.8 million, or $1.33 per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $28.7 million, or $2.20 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017; As of March 31, 2018, Merrimack had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $76.3 million, compared to $93.4 million as of December 31, 2017; and As of March 31, 2018, Merrimack had 13.3 million shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, outstanding.\nFinancial Outlook\nMerrimack continues to believe that its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $76.3 million as of March 31, 2018 and certain potential net milestone payments anticipated from Shire will be sufficient to fund its planned operations into the second half of 2019.\nConference Call and Webcast\nMerrimack will host a live conference call and webcast today, Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 8:30 am ET, to provide an update on its operational progress and a summary of these financial results.\nInvestors and the general public are invited to listen to the call by dialing (877) 564-1301 (domestic) or (224) 357-2394 (international) five minutes prior to the start of the call and providing the passcode 1596995.
