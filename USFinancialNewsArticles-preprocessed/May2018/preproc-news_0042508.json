    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 5:47 AM / Updated 40 minutes ago Italy's maverick coalition to boost spending, seek review of EU rules Steve Scherer , Gavin Jones 5 Min Read\nROME (Reuters) - Italy’s two anti-establishment parties promised on Friday to ramp up spending in a program for a new coalition government, putting them on a collision course with the European Union despite having dropped some of their most radical proposals.\nThe “contract” between the League and the 5-Star Movement, the two parties that won the most parliamentary seats in an election on March 4, was overwhelmingly approved by 5-Star’s members in an online vote held after the document was unveiled.\n“More than 94 percent of 5-Star Movement members who participated in the vote have said yes to the contract for the ‘Government of Change’!”, 5-Star’s 31-year-old leader Luigi Di Maio said on Facebook on Friday evening.\nThere had been “great participation”, he added, with 44,796 of the movement’s 140,000 members casting votes, compared with fewer than 40,000 who elected Di Maio as party leader in September.\nThe League will consult its own supporters in an informal ballot organized in squares around the country on Saturday.\nDi Maio and League leader Matteo Salvini said they would meet President Sergio Mattarella on Monday. Mattarella must give his blessing to the program and to their candidate for prime minister, who has yet to be named, before a government can be formed.\nThe document, published after 11 weeks of political stalemate in the euro zone’s third-largest economy, calls for billions of euros in tax cuts, additional spending on welfare for the poor, and a roll-back of pension reforms.\n(For an interactive graphic on 'Italian economy' click tmsnrt.rs/2bxVe8n )\n(For an interactive graphic on 'Italian bad loans' click tmsnrt.rs/2z9QrWe )\nThe euro sank on the latest developments on Friday and was headed for its fifth straight weekly fall against the dollar, in what would be a first for the currency since 2015.\n“The possibility of a eurosceptic government in Rome is shaking investor confidence ... at this point, a larger fiscal deficit and greater bond issuance (in Italy) does seem likely,” said David Madden, a strategist at CMC Markets.\nThe final accord dropped a previous draft proposal, seen by Reuters, to create fiscal headroom by adjusting the formula used to calculate debt burdens in the EU, and contained nothing questioning Italy’s membership of the euro.\nBut it still called for a review of EU governance and fiscal rules — setting the stage for the bloc’s biggest political challenge since Britain voted to leave two years ago.\nBoth parties have a history of euroscepticism. 5-Star has moderated its position over the last year, but the League still wants to leave the euro zone as soon as politically feasible.
