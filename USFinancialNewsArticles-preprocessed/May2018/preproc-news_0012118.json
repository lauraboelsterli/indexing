    "text": "Ship Finance International Limited (\"Ship Finance\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: SFL) today announced the underwriters in its underwritten public offering of $150 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the \"Notes\") have exercised a portion of their option to purchase additional Notes to cover over-allotments and are purchasing an additional $14 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The over-allotment option was granted to the underwriters by the Company in connection with the previously consummated offering of $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. Settlement of the sale of additional Notes is expected to occur on May 4, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The Notes pay interest quarterly in arrears at a rate of 4.875% per annum, and will mature on May 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Notes are convertible into, at the Company's election, cash, common shares, or a combination of cash and common shares, as further described in the offering prospectus. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 52.8157 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $18.93 per common share, and is subject to adjustment under the terms of the Notes.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds received from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Company continuously evaluates potential transactions that it believes will be accretive to earnings, enhance shareholder value or are in the best interests of the Company.

Hjertaker, Chief Executive Officer: +47 23114011\nAbout Ship Finance\nShip Finance International Limited (NYSE: SFL) has a unique track record in the maritime industry, being consistently profitable and paying dividends every quarter since 2004. The Company's fleet of more than 80 vessels is split between tankers, bulkers, container vessels and offshore assets, and Ship Finance's long term distribution capacity is supported by a portfolio of long term charters and significant growth in the asset base over time.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward looking statements. These statements are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including Ship Finance management's examination of historical operating trends. Although Ship Finance believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, Ship Finance cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions. Important factors that, in the Company's view, to discussed in this presentation include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions including fluctuations in charter hire rates and vessel values, changes in demand in the tanker market as a result of changes in OPEC's petroleum production levels and worldwide oil consumption and storage, changes in the Company's operating expenses including bunker prices, dry-docking and insurance costs, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events, and other important factors described from time to time in the reports filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSource:Ship Finance International Limited",
