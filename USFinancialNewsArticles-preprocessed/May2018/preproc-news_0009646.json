( TSX-V: LBL ) (OTCBB: LBLTF) (“ Lattice Biologics ” or the “ Company ”) announces financial results for the fourth quarter 2017, year ended September 30, 2017, and first quarter 2018:\nHighlights:\nGross profit margin was 65.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 36.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Cash flow positive from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Successfully relocated processing facility to Belgrade, Montana, while maintaining adequate inventory levels to maintain sales and expanding reach into personal injury and dental markets. Maintained American Association of Tissue Bank certification after relocation of processing facilities. Penetrated new international markets in Columbia and Dominican Republic. Launched new products into higher margin dental market.\nFinancial Highlights:\nSuccessfully relocated operations to Belgrade, Montana from Scottsdale, Arizona, resulting in operational efficiencies of over $ 230,000 per month, year over year. Reduced net loss from $1,213,490 ($0.02/share) for three months ended December 31, 2016 to $132,726 or ($0.00/share) for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Reduced net loss from $7,852,007 ($0.16/share) for fiscal year ended 2016 to $1,524,804 or ($0.02/share) for fiscal year ended 2017. Total liabilities reduced from $10.5 million for fiscal year ended 2016 to $ 7.7 million for fiscal year ended 2017. Cash from operations was $25,858 for quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to a deficit of $522,495 for quarter ended December 31, 2016. Negative EBITDA for quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $85,509 compared to negative EBITDA of $571,408 for quarter ended December 31, 2016.\n2017 Business Update:\n“After a careful review of overhead and operational throughput, the Company decided to relocate operations to Belgrade, Montana in June of 2017. While we expected the move to generate savings of approximately $ 80,000 per month, the actual savings turned out to be roughly $230,000 per month as borne out by our year over year financials,” said Guy Cook, CEO of Lattice Biologics.\n“As a result, we have had our first quarter of being cash flow positive from operations, and a substantial increase in margins to 66% of revenues. Although sales are down year over year and quarter over quarter, the Company thought it would be prudent to not recognize revenues in the personal injury market until we have a clearer understanding of timeliness associated with reimbursements in this market.\n“We remain focused on higher margin products as we continue to grow the business. With the reduction in overhead and associated expenses, the Company is well positioned to grow and be profitable in 2018 and beyond,” continued Cook.\nThe Company continues to make significant improvements on the balance sheet, and is working with creditors to convert certain balances to equity for working capital purposes.\nThe Company restructured Grenville debt to favorable terms, including the conversion of $2.7 million of royalty funding into equity, reduction of interest payments on the Grenville Secured Note from 12.5% to 4.244%, and reduced remaining royalty charges from 6% to 1.25%.\nLattice Biologics maintains its commitment to honoring the gift of donation by implementing a strong quality control environment for the recovery and processing of donors. The Company has significantly increased its processing efficiencies, and has substantial inventory reserves to meet customer demand.\nAs indicated below, the Company continues efforts to diversify the sales mix across the new higher margin product lines added in 2015, 2016, and 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Year End Financial Results (all figures denoted in USD):\nThe product launches have been well received by surgeons and the Company continues to replace unprofitable legacy contracts and focus on the newer higher margin products. Lattice Biologics’ total revenue was $362,137 in the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $732,905 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 50%, as shown in the following quarter sales table:\nDec-31\n2017 Sep-30\n2017 Jun-30\n2017 Mar-31\n2017 Dec-31\n2016 Sep-30\n2016 Jun-30\n2016 Mar-31\n2016 ADM dermis $ 73,399 20 % $ 54,700 14 % $ 72,370 11 % $ 212,740 28 % $ 208,912 23 % $ 130,575 18 % $ 220,365 23 % $ 48,336 5 % DBM putty 18,749 5 % - 0 % 17,941 3 % 62,964 8 % 58,110 7 % 151,071 21 % 246,235 25 % 104,856 10 % Bone scaffold 212,972 59 % 315,152 79 % 454,132 66 % 403,027 53 % 567,841 64 % 411,131 56 % 505,603 52 % 847,326 84 % Other 57,017 16 % 28,690 7 % 139,583 20 % 86,626 11 % 56,588 6 % 40,128 5 % 117 0 % 6,457 1 % Total revenue $ 362,137 100 % $ 398,542 100 % $ 684,026 100 % $ 765,357 100 % $ 891,451 100 % $ 732,905 100 % $ 972,320 100 % $ 1,006,975 100 % The following table sets out selected unaudited financial information, prepared in accordance with IFRS.
