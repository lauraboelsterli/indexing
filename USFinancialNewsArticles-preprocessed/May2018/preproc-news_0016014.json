Completed substantially all of our previously announced headcount rightsizing plans and ended the first quarter of 2018 with approximately 1,225 employees, which is ahead of the 1,250 employee target by the second half of 2018. Our Total Servicing Portfolio was comprised of 648,040 loans serviced representing $143.5 billion of unpaid principal balance, including 609,250 loans in our subservicing portfolio.\nMOUNT LAUREL, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PHH Corporation (NYSE: PHH) (“PHH” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on the proposed merger with Ocwen Financial Corporation. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported Net loss attributable to PHH Corporation of $30 million or $0.92 per basic share. Net loss from continuing operations was $26 million or $0.80 per basic share.\nRobert B. Crowl, President and Chief Executive Officer of PHH Corporation, said, “Our team is fully committed to executing our business plans and meeting the closing requirements for our merger with Ocwen. Based on the progress made to date on certain closing conditions, including the levels of adjusted net worth and available cash on hand levels as compared to the threshold levels agreed upon in the merger agreement, we continue to believe that the transaction could close in the third or fourth quarter 2018.”\nSummary Consolidated Results (In millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Total net revenues $ 50 $ 40 Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (26 ) (77 ) Loss from continuing operations, net of tax (26 ) (53 ) Net loss attributable to PHH Corporation (30 ) (67 ) Basic and Diluted loss per share: From continuing operations $ (0.80 ) $ (0.99 ) From discontinued operations (0.12 ) (0.27 ) Total attributable to PHH Corporation $ (0.92 ) $ (1.26 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding — basic & diluted 32.645 53.683 Notable items and Exit and disposal costs attributable to the continuing operations of PHH included the following:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Pre-Tax Post-Tax Pre-Tax Post-Tax $ Per Share $ Per Share Notable items: Legal and regulatory reserves, net of insurance proceeds $ 14 $ 0.44 $ (9 ) $ (0.11 ) Merger and strategic review expenses (4 ) (0.11 ) (17 ) (0.19 ) Loss from MSR sales and related transaction costs (1 ) (0.03 ) (7 ) (0.08 ) Severance — — (1 ) (0.01 ) Re-engineering and growth investments — — 1 0.01 Exit and disposal costs $ — $ — $ (9 ) $ (0.10 ) Update on the Proposed Merger with Ocwen Financial Corporation\nOn February 27, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ocwen Financial Corporation (“Ocwen”), and POMS Corp (“MergerSub”) pursuant to which all of PHH’s outstanding common stock will be acquired by Ocwen in a merger of MergerSub with and into PHH with PHH as the surviving entity (the “Merger”) in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $360 million, or $11.00 per share on a fully-diluted basis. The Merger is subject to, in addition to various other customary closing conditions: approval by the Company’s stockholders; antitrust, state licensing, and other governmental and regulatory approvals; and PHH maintaining cash and adjusted net worth above certain thresholds. The Company has made progress toward meeting its key closing conditions as follows:\nThe Company ended the first quarter of 2018 with stockholders’ equity of $523 million. Ocwen may terminate the merger agreement if the Company’s adjusted net worth, as calculated under the merger agreement, is more than $47.5 million below a prescribed amount, which prescribed amount was $489 million as of March 31, 2018 and ranges from $476 million to $393 million between April and December 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the adjustments made to PHH Corporation stockholders’ equity to arrive at the adjusted net worth under the merger agreement were immaterial. The Company ended the first quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $480 million. Ocwen may terminate the merger agreement if available cash on hand falls below a prescribed amount, which prescribed amount was $367 million as of March 31, 2018, and ranges from $357 million to $293 million between April and December 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the adjustments made to cash and cash equivalents to arrive at available cash on hand were immaterial. The Company has submitted substantially all requisite notices and approval requests to governmental agencies and state regulatory and licensing entities. It has not received any objections to date, and continues to communicate with those agencies and entities regarding any further information requests. The Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act effective April 19, 2018 with respect to both the Company and Ocwen. A Special Meeting of Stockholders has been scheduled for June 11, 2018 to approve the merger with Ocwen. The Company satisfied the closing conditions relating to its exit from the private label services origination business and purchase of Realogy's membership interest in PHH Home Loans.\nPending the closing of the Merger, the Company does not intend to provide further profitability forecasts or estimates of potential excess cash and other financial performance metrics.\nAbout PHH Corporation\nPHH Corporation (NYSE: PHH), through its subsidiary, PHH Mortgage, is one of the largest subservicers of residential mortgages in the United States.

Represents the assets and liabilities directly attributable to the PLS business and Real Estate channel.

Accordingly, the results of the PLS business and Real Estate channel have been presented as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), and excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Certain corporate overhead costs that were previously allocated to the PLS business and Real Estate channel for segment reporting purposes did not qualify for classification within discontinued operations, and have been included in continuing operations.\nReportable segments presented in continuing operations now include Mortgage Servicing, which acts as a subservicer for clients that own the underlying mortgage servicing rights and performs servicing activities for owned mortgage servicing rights, and Mortgage Production, which provides portfolio origination retention services to subservicing clients and sells the related mortgage loans in the secondary market.\nMortgage Servicing\nMortgage Servicing segment loss during the first quarter of 2018 was $6 million, as compared to a loss of $34 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Total net revenues increased by $17 million, or 63%, as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily driven by a $15 million gain related to an insurance settlement with one of our insurance carriers for certain previously disclosed legal settlements. Our Total net revenues also reflect a $9 million decrease in unsecured debt interest expense related to the capital actions taken in 2017 to reduce our unsecured debt levels, that was partially offset by a decrease in net servicing revenue from a decrease in the size of our average total loan servicing portfolio and the change in mix of our servicing portfolio to primarily subserviced loans which lowered our contractual servicing fees and the impact from changes in fair value of MSRs.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Total expenses decreased by $11 million or 18%, as compared to the same period in 2017. The provision for legal and regulatory matters decreased by $8 million primarily driven by various legal proceedings that are or were still ongoing related to our legacy mortgage servicing practices. Foreclosure and repossession expenses decreased by $4 million primarily due to lower foreclosure activity and improved delinquencies that were partially the result of the sales of delinquent government loans that occurred throughout 2017. Exit and disposal costs decreased by $2 million due to non-recurring costs incurred during 2017 for severance and retention expenses related to Mortgage shared services employees related to the reorganization exit plan.\nCorporate overhead allocation increased by $7 million, which was impacted by the PLS business and Real Estate channel exits. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, $13 million of indirect costs not allocated to discontinued operations were stranded within the Other reporting unit, whereas, for 2018, 100% of those costs are included in the allocations to our segments.\nAt March 31, 2018, our subservicing portfolio consisted of approximately 609,000 units, up 127% from March 31, 2017, reflecting the addition of subserviced loans from 2017 sales of MSRs to New Residential. We continue to expect the transfer of approximately 115,000 subservicing units off of our platform in multiple transfers beginning in May 2018, based upon notifications from two of our largest subservicing clients. Approximately 65,000 of these units are subject to a portfolio defense agreement and will no longer be solicitable units upon transfer to a new servicer.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In millions) Segment Results:\nLoan servicing income, net $ 43 $ 33 Net interest expense (14 ) (8 ) Other income 15 2 Total net revenues 44 27 Salaries and related expenses 15 17 Foreclosure and repossession expenses 3 7 Professional and third-party service fees 6 7 Technology equipment and software expenses 3 3 Occupancy and other office expenses 4 3 Depreciation and amortization 1 1 Exit and disposal costs — 2 Other operating expenses 18 21 Total expenses 50 61 Segment loss $ (6 ) $ (34 ) March 31, 2018 2017 ($ In millions) Total Loan Servicing Portfolio:\nConventional loans $ 133,618 $ 150,022 Government loans 8,490 11,833 Home equity lines of credit 1,347 1,771 Total Unpaid Principal Balance\n$ 143,455 $ 163,626 Number of loans in owned portfolio (units) 38,790 486,706 Number of subserviced loans (units) (1) 609,250 267,949 Total number of loans serviced (units) 648,040 754,655 Weighted-average interest rate 3.9 % 3.8 % Total Portfolio Delinquency:\n% of UPB - 30 days or more past due 2.06 % 1.94 % % of UPB - Foreclosure, REO and Bankruptcy 1.46 % 1.93 % Units - 30 days or more past due 2.91 % 2.65 % Units - Foreclosure, REO and Bankruptcy 1.97 % 2.40 % Total Capitalized Servicing Portfolio:\nUnpaid Principal Balance of capitalized MSRs owned $ 7,853 $ 71,808 Unpaid Principal Balance of capitalized MSRs in secured borrowing arrangement (1) 47,738 — Total Unpaid Principal Balance of capitalized servicing portfolio\n$ 55,591 $ 71,808 Capitalized servicing rate 0.89 % 0.83 % Capitalized servicing multiple 3.3 3.0 Weighted-average servicing fee (in basis points) 27 28 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In millions) Total Loan Servicing Portfolio:\nAverage Portfolio UPB $ 146,221 $ 169,152 Owned Capitalized Servicing Portfolio: (1)\nAverage Portfolio UPB $ 8,252 $ 78,155 Payoffs and principal curtailments 347 3,459 Sales 1,125 10,316",
