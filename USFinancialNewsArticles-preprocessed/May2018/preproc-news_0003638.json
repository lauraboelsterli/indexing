    "text": "(Reuters) - Humana Incâ€™s ( HUM.N ) first-quarter profit reflects lower-than-expected flu costs after the rates of infection peaked earlier than it had anticipated, Chief Financial Officer Brian Kane said on Wednesday.\nEarnings were also helped by restrained medical use during the first quarter as well as the financial benefit of accounting for lower-than-foreseen claims during the fourth quarter, Kane said during a conference call with analysts to discuss the first-quarter report.\nReporting by Caroline Humer in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ",
