Such statements are not historical fact and are forward-looking statements. Certain of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"estimates,\" \"assumes,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"shall,\" \"will,\" \"seeks,\" \"targets,\" \"future,\" or other similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, and our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from results, performance or achievements expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the court-supervised restructuring process, descriptions of management's strategy, plans, objectives, expectations, or intentions, including the ability to support the company's operations during the restructuring process and descriptions of assumptions underlying any of the above matters and other statements that are not historical fact.\nThe above factors, risks and uncertainties are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and may be beyond the Company's control. New factors, risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, risks and uncertainties. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore any of these statements may prove to be inaccurate.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date such statements were made or any earlier date indicated, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in underlying assumptions or otherwise. If the Company were in any particular instance to update or correct a forward-looking statement, investors and others should not conclude that the Company would make additional updates or corrections thereafter.\nJoe Caldwell\nJed Repko or Meaghan Repko\nSenior Manager; Corporate Communications\nJoele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher\n904-318-7197\n212-355-4449\nmedia@segrocers.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/southeastern-grocers-plan-of-reorganization-confirmed-by-court-300647955.html\nSOURCE Southeastern Grocers, LLC",
