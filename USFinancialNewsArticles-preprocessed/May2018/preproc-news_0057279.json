    "text": "EditorsNote: Editors: Recasts numeral use in headline\nSix players had multiple hits Saturday afternoon for the Milwaukee Brewers, who scored multiple runs in five innings as they routed the New York Mets, 17-6, at Miller Park.\nThe Brewers have won the middle two games of the four-game series and eight of 10 overall. The Mets have dropped four of five.\nThe Brewers actually trailed 3-0 before they even stepped to the plate before tying the game in the bottom of the first. The Mets led 5-3 in the third before Milwaukee scored twice apiece in the third and fourth, three more times in the fifth and seven times in the seventh.\nChristian Yelich and Jesus Aguilar had three hits and three RBIs apiece for the Brewers. Yelich’s run-scoring triple in the fourth gave Milwaukee the lead for good.\nHernan Perez had three RBIs for Milwaukee while Lorenzo Cain had three hits and an RBI. Travis Shaw, Tyler Saladino and Erik Kratz had two hits apiece.\nDan Jennings (3-1) was credited with the win after allowing one run in 1 1/3 innings of relief. Starter Chase Anderson lasted just 3 2/3 innings, during which he allowed five runs on seven hits and three walks while striking out five.\nWilmer Flores (single), Devin Mesoraco (single) and Jose Reyes (bases-loaded walk) all had RBIs in the first for the Mets, who forced Anderson to throw 46 pitches in the opening inning.\nBrandon Nimmo (second inning) and Michael Conforto (third inning) homered for the Mets, who scored their final run on Reyes’ RBI double in the fifth.\nFlores finished with three hits while Conforto and Mesoraco had two hits apiece.\nJacob Rhame (0-1), the second of five Mets pitchers, took the loss after allowing two runs in an inning. He was pitching in relief of Jason Vargas, who was pulled after giving up five runs on six hits and two walks while striking out five over three innings. Vargas has a 10.62 ERA in five starts this season.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
