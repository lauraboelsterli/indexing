Target sank 5.6 percent after the retailer’s quarterly profit rose less than expected as increasing investments dented margins. The results weighed on Walmart, which fell 0.9 percent.\nTiffany surged 19.6 percent after the jeweler’s quarterly results blew past estimates and the company raised its full-year profit forecast and announced a $1 billion buyback program.\nRalph Lauren soared 16.2 percent after the company’s higher margins helped deliver a solid profit that beat analysts’ estimates.\nLowe’s gained 9.3 percent after the home improvement retailer maintained its annual financial targets and billionaire investor Bill Ackman was reported to have bought a $1 billion stake in company.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise slipped 10.3 percent after the company reiterated expectations of moderating growth.\nComcast dipped 1.7 percent after the U.S. cable operator said it was preparing to top Disney’s offer for certain Twenty-First Century Fox assets.\nDisney fell 1.4 percent, while Fox rose 1.8 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.31-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.12-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 4 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 58 new highs and 33 new lows.
