    "text": "The visiting Pittsburgh Pirates erased an early four-run deficit by pounding out 16 hits Tuesday in a 10-6 win over the struggling Chicago White Sox.\nPittsburgh, which has won three of its past four games, scored three runs in the fifth off reliever Chris Volstad (0-2) to take the lead for good, 7-5.\nCorey Dickerson was 4-for-5 with two RBIs and Starling Marte was 3-for-5 with an RBI for the Pirates.\nWelington Castillo hit two homers and knocked in three runs for Chicago, which lost its fourth straight and eighth in nine games. The White Sox dropped to 3-14 at home.\nPittsburgh’s Ivan Nova had his second consecutive rough start, giving up five runs and six hits in two innings, his shortest outing with the Pirates. Against Washington on May 2, he allowed 11 hits and a season-high eight runs in 4 2/3 innings.\nTyler Glasnow (1-1), the first of five Pirates relievers, gave up one hit in 2 1/3 scoreless innings. He struck out three without issuing a walk.\nChicago starter Lucas Giolito allowed four runs and seven hits in four innings.\nThe White Sox scored four in the first, capped by Castillo’s two-run homer. Earlier, Yolmer Sanchez hit an RBI triple and scored on Jose Abreu’s groundout. Nova needed 51 pitches to escape the inning.\nGiolito needed the same, 51 pitches, in the second, when Pittsburgh tied it 4-4.\nJose Osuna had an RBI single, Colin Moran drove in a run on a fielder’s choice, Gregory Polanco hit an RBI double, and Polanco scored on Marte’s single.\nChicago regained the lead, 5-4, in the second on Abreu’s RBI double.\nIn the Pirates’ three-run fifth, Moran banged a two-run double and Jordy Mercer added an RBI single to take put Pittsburgh on top for good, 7-5.\nThe Pirates tacked on two more in the sixth, on Josh Bell’s RBI triple and Dickerson’s RBI single.\nDickerson added an RBI single in the seventh to increase the margin to 10-5.\nCastillo hit his second homer of the game and fifth of the season to lead off the eighth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
