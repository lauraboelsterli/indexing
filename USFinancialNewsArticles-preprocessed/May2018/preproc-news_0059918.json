From time to time we exclusively post material information to this website along with other disclosure channels that we use. This press release contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, assumptions and other information available to the Company as of the date hereof. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding Ciena's expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future and can be identified by forward-looking words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" and \"would\" or similar words. Forward-looking statements in this release include: \"We delivered strong revenue and record order flow in the second quarter as we continue to broaden our leadership and capture market share.\"; \"Gross margin was impacted by several new, international service provider deployments in their early stages; however, we are confident in our ability to return to our normalized gross margin levels.\"; \"We anticipate strong revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2018 and we remain confident in our three-year financial targets.\"\nCiena's actual results, performance or events may differ materially from these forward-looking statements made or implied due to a number of risks and uncertainties relating to Ciena's business, including: the effect of broader economic and market conditions on our customers and their business; changes in network spending or network strategy by customers; seasonality and the timing and size of customer orders, including our ability to recognize revenue relating to such sales; the level of competitive pressure we encounter; the product, customer and geographic mix of sales within the period; supply chain disruptions and the level of success relating to efforts to optimize Ciena's operations; changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting revenue and operating expense; the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, changes in estimates of prospective income tax rates and any adjustments to Ciena's provisional estimates whether related to further guidance, analysis or otherwise, and the other risk factors disclosed in Ciena's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on March 7, 2018 and its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 22, 2017. Ciena assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information included in this press release.\nNon-GAAP Presentation of Quarterly and Annual Results. This release includes non-GAAP measures of Ciena's gross profit, operating expense, income from operations, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA, and measures of net income and net income per share. In evaluating the operating performance of Ciena's business, management excludes certain charges and credits that are required by GAAP. These items share one or more of the following characteristics: they are unusual and Ciena does not expect them to recur in the ordinary course of its business; they do not involve the expenditure of cash; they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course; or their magnitude and timing is largely outside of Ciena's control. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures below provide management and investors useful information and meaningful insight to the operating performance of the business. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to Ciena's GAAP results and these measures are not intended to be a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Ciena's non-GAAP measures and the related adjustments may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies and should only be used to evaluate Ciena's results of operations in conjunction with our corresponding GAAP results. To the extent not previously disclosed in a prior Ciena financial results press release, Appendix A and B to this press release set forth a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures contained in this release.\nAbout Ciena.

The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 is primarily related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These amounts are provisional and reflect managementâs current estimates and current interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These amounts may require adjustment in future periods as additional guidance under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becomes available and analysis of its provisions is completed. As of April 30, 2018, Ciena has net deferred tax assets of approximately $734.8 million, and consequently, over the near term, Ciena's cash taxes will continue to be primarily related to state taxes and tax expense of Ciena's foreign subsidiaries, which amounts have not historically been significant. Ciena's foreign and domestic income tax expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017 expected to be paid using cash was $2.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively. Ciena's foreign and domestic income tax expense for the six months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 expected to be paid using cash was $3.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\n2. The calculation of GAAP diluted net income per common share for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 requires adding back interest expense of approximately $0.5 million associated with Ciena's 0.875% convertible senior notes, which were paid at maturity during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and approximately $3.6 million associated with Ciena's \"Original\" 3.75% convertible senior notes, due October 15, 2018 to the GAAP net income in order to derive the numerator for the diluted earnings per common share calculation.\nThe calculation of GAAP diluted net income per common share for the first six months of fiscal 2017 requires adding back interest expense of approximately $1.1 million associated with Ciena's 0.875% convertible senior notes, which were paid at maturity during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, to the GAAP net income in order to derive the numerator for the diluted earnings per common share calculation.\n3. Weighted average dilutive potential common shares outstanding used in calculating GAAP diluted net income per common share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 includes 1.3 million shares underlying certain stock options and restricted stock units and 2.7 million shares underlying Ciena's \"New\" 3.75% convertible senior notes, due October 15, 2018.\nWeighted average dilutive potential common shares outstanding used in calculating GAAP diluted net income per common share for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 includes 1.3 million shares underlying certain stock options and restricted stock units, 4.9 million shares underlying Ciena's 0.875% convertible senior notes, which were paid at maturity during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 17.4 million shares underlying Ciena's \"Original\" 3.75% convertible senior notes, due October 15, 2018.\nWeighted average dilutive potential common shares outstanding used in calculating GAAP diluted net income per common share for the first six months of fiscal 2017 includes 1.4 million shares underlying certain stock options and restricted stock units and 5.2 million shares underlying Ciena's 0.875% convertible senior notes, which were paid at maturity during the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nCIENA CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share data)\n(unaudited)\nApril 30,\n2018 October

Amortization of intangible assets - a non-cash expense arising from the acquisition of intangible assets, principally developed technologies and customer-related intangibles, that Ciena is required to amortize over its expected useful life. Significant asset impairments and restructuring costs - costs incurred as a result of restructuring activities taken to align resources with perceived market opportunities. Non-cash interest expense - a non-cash debt discount expense amortized as interest expense during the term of Ciena's 4.0% senior convertible notes due December 15, 2020 relating to the required separate accounting of the equity component of these convertible notes. Modification of debt - costs incurred as a result of the modification of debt to refinance then existing term loans.

This rate may be subject to change in the future, including as a result of changes in tax policy or tax strategy.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180531005345/en/\nCiena Corporation\nPress Contact:\nNicole Anderson, 877-857-7377\npr@ciena.com\nor\nInvestor Contact:\nGregg Lampf, 877-243-6273\nir@ciena.com\nSource: Ciena Corporation",
