    "text": "WELLINGTON, Fla., May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KLX Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:KLXI), a leading distributor and value added service provider of aerospace fasteners and consumables, and a provider of services and products to the oil and gas exploration and production industry, today reported its first fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2018 financial results.\nOn a GAAP basis, for the three-month period ended April 30, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior year, revenues increased 21.3 percent to $499.1 million, while operating earnings increased 25.9 percent to $61.2 million. GAAP net earnings of $31.7 million and net earnings per diluted share of $0.62, increased 72.3 percent and 72.2 percent, respectively, as compared to the three-month period ended April 30, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company incurred approximately $14.3 million of one-time costs associated with the strategic alternatives review, which resulted in the Company’s announcement that it has reached an agreement to sell its Aerospace Solutions Group (“ASG”) business to The Boeing Company and to spin-off its Energy Services Group (“ESG”) business to shareholders, and the transition to ASG’s new global distribution and operations center. The costs associated with the announced review of strategic alternatives and the new facility transition are collectively referred to as “Costs as Defined.”\nFIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nConsolidated revenue growth of 21.3 percent to $499.1 million Consolidated Adjusted operating earnings of $75.5 million increased 55.3 percent 1 Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share were $57.0 million and $1.12 per diluted share, respectively, representing increases of 63.8 percent and 67.2 percent, respectively\n1 Excludes approximately $14.3 million of costs and expenses related to the strategic alternatives review and the transition to ASG’s new global distribution and operations center\nWe have presented Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share to reflect net earnings before Costs as Defined and amortization and non-cash compensation expense, and to include the tax benefit from the amortization of tax-deductible goodwill (“Adjusted Net Earnings” and “Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share”). This release includes “Adjusted operating earnings,” “ASG Adjusted operating earnings” and “ESG Adjusted operating earnings,” which exclude Costs as Defined. This release also includes “Adjusted EBITDA,” “ASG Adjusted EBITDA” and “ESG Adjusted EBITDA” which exclude Costs as Defined and non-cash compensation expense. Each of the aforementioned metrics are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nFIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nOn a consolidated basis, revenues increased 21.3 percent to $499.1 million, driven by an approximate 11.7 percent increase in ASG revenues and an approximate 74.0 percent increase in ESG revenues. Adjusted operating earnings and Adjusted operating margin were $75.5 million and 15.1 percent, respectively. Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share increased 63.8 percent and 67.2 percent, to $57.0 million and $1.12 per diluted share, respectively.\n“We are pleased to report that 2018 is off to a strong start as both consolidated revenues and operating earnings increased strongly in the first quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year. Our ASG segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth, driven by an approximate double-digit percentage increase in both commercial aerospace manufacturing and aftermarket revenues, while our ESG segment continued to generate strong revenue growth and margin expansion on both a year-over-year and sequential quarterly basis,” said Amin J. Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX.\nFIRST QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2018, our ASG segment generated revenues of $388.1 million, an increase of approximately 11.7 percent compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by approximately 5.9 percent organic revenue growth. On a channel basis, aftermarket organic revenue growth of 6.6 percent was particularly strong, driven by a substantial increase in aircraft maintenance activity among MROs, repair shops and airlines in the Americas, Asia and Europe. Revenues from our OEM channel increased 5.4 percent on an organic basis, driven by an increase in activity from commercial aerospace manufacturing customers and initial revenues from the ramp-up of new programs. On a GAAP basis, ASG operating earnings were $54.7 million and operating margin was 14.1 percent. ASG’s Adjusted operating earnings, adjusted to exclude one-time costs related to the strategic alternatives review and the transition to ASG’s new global distribution and operations center, were $65.2 million, or 16.8 percent of revenues. ASG Adjusted EBITDA of $76.1 million was 19.6 percent of revenues.\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior year, ESG revenues of $111.0 million reflected organic revenue growth of approximately 74.0 percent. GAAP operating earnings increased $16.6 million, from a loss of $(10.1) million during the first quarter of last year, to a positive $6.5 million in the current quarter, which includes the aforementioned one-time costs. Exclusive of such costs, ESG’s Adjusted operating earnings were $10.3 million in the first quarter, a $20.4 million improvement over the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA of $22.0 million improved by $20.7 million. As compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, revenues increased by 17.8 percent, Adjusted operating earnings improved by $9.1 million from $1.2 million to $10.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA improved by $9.3 million, or 73.2 percent, to $22.0 million, or approximately 20 percent of revenues.\nOUTLOOK\nAs a result of the pending sale of the Aerospace Solutions Group (ASG) to Boeing, the Company will no longer be providing ASG segment level guidance.\nThe Company increased its 2018 ESG guidance for revenues, Adjusted operating earnings and Adjusted EBITDA. The Company’s Fiscal 2018 ESG outlook excludes costs related to the strategic alternatives review, including spin-off related expenses.\n2018 revenues are expected to increase by approximately 55 percent to approximately $500 million Adjusted operating earnings are expected to increase approximately $84 million to approximately $65 million Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase approximately 300 percent to approximately $110 million, or 22 percent of revenues The Company expects continued strong organic growth in revenues and earnings in 2019\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

This release includes “Adjusted operating earnings,” “ASG Adjusted operating earnings” and “ESG Adjusted operating earnings,” which excludes Costs as Defined.

The Company believes these financial measures are relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to have a better understanding of the Company’s actual operating performance unaffected by the impact of the Costs as Defined. These financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, operating earnings, net earnings or net cash flows provided by operating activities (each as defined under GAAP), the most directly comparable GAAP measures, as a measure of the Company’s operating performance.\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation G of the Exchange Act, we are providing the following tables that reconcile the above mentioned non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\nKLX INC.
