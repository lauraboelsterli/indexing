Limited, a supplier of waterproofing products\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GCP Applied Technologies Inc. (NYSE:GCP) today announced first quarter 2018 results.\nTotal GCP Applied Technologies\n( $ Millions )\n1Q 2018 1Q 2017 % Change Net sales $250.2 $225.3 11.1% Net Sales, Constant Currency* $242.9 $225.3 7.8% Gross margin 34.9% 37.8% (290) bps Adjusted Gross Margin* 35.1% 38.7% (360) bps Loss from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders $(13.8) $(25.0) 44.8% Net loss attributable to GCP shareholders $(6.6) $(16.9) 60.9% Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders $(0.19) $(0.35) 45.7% Adjusted EPS* $0.01 $(0.06) NM Adjusted EBIT* $13.2 $11.0 20.0% Adjusted EBIT Margin* 5.3% 4.9% 40 bps “GCP had strong sales growth in the first quarter of 2018,\" said President and Chief Executive Officer Gregory E. Poling. \"Net sales rose 11% due to healthy global construction markets, contributions from our acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted EBIT grew 20% on higher sales volumes and savings from our restructuring program. GCP's gross margin was negatively impacted by higher inflation. We started to see the positive impact of price late in the quarter and expect this trend to continue through 2018.\"\n\"We continue to execute on our bolt-on acquisition strategy with the purchase of U.K.-based R.I.W. Limited. The company is a supplier of specialty waterproofing products for commercial and residential construction applications in the U.K. waterproofing market.\"\nFirst quarter 2018:\nNet sales increased 11.1% and Net Sales, Constant Currency increased 7.8% due to growth in both Specialty Construction Chemicals and Specialty Building Materials Gross margin of 34.9% decreased 290 basis points primarily due to increased raw materials and logistics costs. Price increases have been implemented to recover higher costs and recapture margins. Adjusted EBIT of $13.2 million increased 20.0% and Adjusted EBIT margin increased 40 basis points due to improved operating leverage from higher sales volumes and cost savings associated with our restructuring plan, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses from our acquisitions Net loss from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders was $13.8 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of $25.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The change was primarily due to lower interest expense, lower restructuring and repositioning expenses and an increase in other (income) expense. Net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 includes a $12.5 million increase to the provisional net charge related to the 2017 Tax Act.\nFirst Quarter Segment Performance\nSpecialty Construction Chemicals\n( $ Millions )\n1Q 2018 1Q 2017 % Change Net sales $147.0 $134.0 9.7% Net Sales, Constant Currency* $142.8 $134.0 6.6% Gross margin 31.3% 35.7% (440) bps Segment operating income $5.9 $8.6 (31.4)% Segment operating margin 4.0% 6.4% (240) bps Net sales increased 9.7% and Net Sales, Constant Currency increased 6.6% due to higher volumes in our Concrete and Cement businesses Gross margin declined 440 basis points primarily due to raw material inflation and increases in logistics costs Segment operating income decreased 31.4% and segment operating margin decreased 240 basis points primarily due to lower gross margin, partially offset by cost savings associated with our restructuring plan Comparisons with first quarter 2017 results for SCC were impacted by GCP's deconsolidation of its Venezuela operations on July 3, 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, GCP's Venezuela operations contributed net sales of $3.1 million, gross profit of $2.3 million and operating income of $2.0 million.\nSpecialty Building Materials\n( $ Millions )\n1Q 2018 1Q 2017 % Change Net sales $103.2 $91.3 13.0% Net Sales, Constant Currency* $100.1 $91.3 9.6% Gross margin 40.6% 43.3% (270) bps Segment operating income $18.1 $15.2 19.1% Segment operating margin 17.5% 16.6% 90 bps Net sales increased 13.0% and Net Sales, Constant Currency increased 9.6% primarily due to higher volumes in our Building Envelope and Residential businesses Gross margin declined 270 basis points due to increases in raw material costs and the timing of price increases as projects were shipped at previously committed pricing Segment operating income increased 19.1% to $18.1 million. Segment operating margin increased 90 basis points to 17.5% due to improved operating leverage from higher sales volumes and cost savings associated with our restructuring plan, partially offset by lower gross margin.\n﻿ *Non-GAAP financial measures. See the tables herein for important information regarding these measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nNM - Not meaningful.\nSale of Darex Packaging Technologies\nOn July 3, 2017, GCP completed the sale of Darex to Henkel for $1.06 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments. Darex has been reclassified and reflected as \"discontinued operations\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.\nRestructuring and Repositioning Expenses\nOn June 28, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a restructuring and repositioning plan. Upon completion of the plan, the Company expects to achieve a net annualized cost reduction of approximately $24 million to $28 million. The Company expects approximately $9 million to $13 million to benefit continuing operations, while approximately $15 million relates to discontinued operations.\nRestructuring and asset impairments from continuing operations were $(0.5) million for the first quarter of 2018. Repositioning expenses related to the plan were $0.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, substantially all of which represent professional fees and employee-related costs.\nInterest Expense and Related Financing Costs\nInterest expense and related financing costs were $13.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $17.0 million for the prior-year quarter. The decrease reflects the repayment and extinguishment of the Company's Term Loan in the third quarter of 2017.\nRefinancing Transactions\nOn April 10, 2018, the Company announced the closing of several refinancing transactions including the issuance of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2026, an amendment to its Credit Agreement that, among other things, increases the aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments available to $350.0 million, and the redemption of $525.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 9.5% Senior Notes due 2023.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense attributable to continuing operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $13.5 million compared to $11.6 million for the prior year quarter, representing effective tax rates of 6,750.0% and 86.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was impacted by a $12.5 million increase to the provisional net charge related to the 2017 Tax Act provisions. The difference between the provision for income taxes at the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21.0% and GCP’s overall income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily due to changes in estimates related to the 2017 Tax Act.\nFull-Year 2018 Outlook 1\nGuidance Prior Current Net Sales, Constant Currency Growth of 5% to 10% Growth of 5% to 10% Adjusted EBIT $135 million to $150 million $135 million to $150 million Adjusted EPS (2)(3) $0.84 to $1.03 $0.99 to $1.18 Adjusted Free Cash Flow $35 million to $45 million $35 million to $45 million 1 GCP guidance figures assume average 2017 FX rates carried forward into the guidance period.\n2 Includes effective tax rate of 28% to 31%, which reflects the Company's current estimate of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n3 Assumes 72 million shares outstanding.\nInvestor Call\nGCP has scheduled a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET today to review its first quarter 2018 results and full-year outlook.

In the table, the Company presents financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, which it describes below in further detail. GCP believes that the non-GAAP financial information supplements its discussions about the performance of its businesses, improves period-to-period comparability and provides insight to the information that management uses to evaluate the performance of its businesses. Management uses non-GAAP measures in financial and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting, and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes, as these measures provide additional transparency to GCP's core operations.\nIn the table, the Company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the financial results that the Company calculates and presents in the table in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as the corresponding reconciliations from those results, should be carefully evaluated.\nConstant currency means current period revenue in local currency translated using prior period exchange rates. GCP uses constant currency in assessing trends in sales excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBIT (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders adjusted for gains and losses on sales of businesses, product lines and certain other investments; currency and other financial losses in Venezuela; costs related to legacy product, environmental and other claims; restructuring expenses, repositioning and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs/credits; third-party and other acquisition-related costs; other financing costs associated with the modification or extinguishment of debt; amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustments; tax indemnification adjustments; interest income, interest expense and related financing costs; income taxes; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends (such as legal settlements). GCP uses Adjusted EBIT to assess and measure its operating performance and in determining performance-based compensation. GCP uses Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure because it provides improved period-to-period comparability for management's decision-making and compensation purposes and because it allows management to measure the ongoing earnings results of the Company's strategic and operating decisions.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization. GCP uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure in making significant business decisions.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be earnings per share (\"EPS\") from continuing operations on a diluted basis adjusted for costs related to gains and losses on sales of businesses, product lines and certain other investments; currency and other financial losses in Venezuela; legacy product, environmental and other claims; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs/credits; third-party and other acquisition-related costs; other financing costs associated with the modification or extinguishment of debt; amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustments; tax indemnification adjustments; certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends (such as legal settlements); and certain discrete tax items. GCP uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure to review its diluted earnings per share results on a consistent basis.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be gross profit adjusted for pension-related costs included in cost of goods sold; loss in Venezuela included in cost of goods sold; and amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment. The Company defines Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by net sales. Management uses this performance measure to understand trends and changes and to make business decisions regarding core operations.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be net cash provided by or used for operating activities minus capital expenditures plus cash paid for restructuring and repositioning; capital expenditures related to repositioning; cash paid for third-party and other acquisition-related costs; cash taxes paid for repositioning, restructuring, third-party and other acquisition-related costs; accelerated payments under defined benefit pension arrangements; and expenditures for legacy items. GCP uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure to evaluate its ability to generate cash to support its ongoing business operations, to invest in its businesses, to provide a return of capital to shareholders and to determine payments of performance-based compensation.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital (a non-GAAP financial measure) to be Adjusted EBIT (on a trailing four quarters basis) divided by the sum of net working capital, properties and equipment and certain other assets and liabilities. Management uses Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital as a performance measure to review investments and to make capital allocation decisions.\nAdjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted EBIT Return on Invested Capital do not purport to represent income measures as defined under U.S. GAAP. These measures are provided to improve the period-to-period comparability and peer-to-peer comparability of GCP's financial results and to ensure that investors understand the information GCP uses to evaluate the performance of its businesses.\nAdjusted EBIT has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes costs related to income and expenses from restructuring and repositioning activities, which historically has been a material component of our net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA also has material limitations as an operating performance measure because it excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. GCP's business is substantially dependent on the successful deployment of capital, and depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of its costs. GCP compensates for the limitations of these measurements by using these indicators together with net income (loss) as measured under GAAP to present a complete analysis of its results of operations. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated together with net income (loss) measured under GAAP for a complete understanding of GCP's results of operations.\nThe Company does not provide GAAP earnings on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to estimate with reasonable certainty unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.\nGCP Applied Technologies Inc.\nAnalysis of Operations (unaudited) Analysis of Operations\n(In millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Net sales: Specialty Construction Chemicals $ 147.0 $ 134.0 9.7 % Specialty Building Materials 103.2 91.3 13.0 % Total GCP net sales $ 250.2 $ 225.3 11.1 % Net sales by region: North America $ 123.0 $ 111.9 9.9 % Europe Middle East Africa (EMEA) 58.3 45.5 28.1 % Asia Pacific 52.0 51.2 1.6 % Latin America 16.9 16.7 1.2 % Total net sales by region $ 250.2 $ 225.3 11.1 % Net Sales, Constant Currency: Specialty Construction Chemicals $ 142.8 $ 134.0 6.6 % Specialty Building Materials 100.1 91.3 9.6 % Total GCP Net Sales, Constant Currency (non-GAAP) $ 242.9 $ 225.3 7.8 % Profitability performance measures: Adjusted EBIT(A): Specialty Construction Chemicals segment operating income $ 5.9 $ 8.6 (31.4 )% Specialty Building Materials segment operating income 18.1 15.2 19.1 % Corporate costs(B) (8.9 ) (10.2 ) 12.7 % Certain pension costs(C) (1.9 ) (2.6 ) 26.9 % Adjusted EBIT (non-GAAP) 13.2 11.0 20.0 % Repositioning expenses (0.9 ) (2.0 ) 55.0 % Restructuring and asset impairments 0.5 (1.1 ) NM Third-party and other acquisition-related costs (0.8 ) (0.4 ) (100.0 )% Amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment — (1.5 ) NM Tax indemnification adjustments — (2.4 ) NM Interest expense, net (12.3 ) (17.0 ) 27.6 % Income tax expense (13.5 ) (11.6 ) (16.4 )% Loss from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders (GAAP) $ (13.8 ) $ (25.0 ) 44.8 % Diluted EPS from continuing operations (GAAP) $ (0.19 ) $ (0.35 ) 45.7 % Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) $ 0.01 $ (0.06 ) NM\nGCP Applied Technologies Inc.\nAnalysis of Operations (unaudited) (continued) Analysis of Operations\n(In millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Adjusted profitability performance measures: Gross Profit: Specialty Construction Chemicals $ 46.0 $ 47.8 (3.8 )% Specialty Building Materials 41.9 39.5 6.1 % Adjusted Gross Profit (non-GAAP) 87.9 87.3 0.7 % Amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment — (1.5 ) NM Corporate costs and pension costs in cost of goods sold (0.4 ) (0.5 ) 20.0 % Total GCP Gross Profit (GAAP) 87.5 85.3 2.6 % Gross Margin: Specialty Construction Chemicals 31.3 % 35.7 % (4.4) pts Specialty Building Materials 40.6 % 43.3 % (2.7) pts Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP) 35.1 % 38.7 % (3.6) pts Amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment — % (0.7 )% 0.7 pts Corporate costs and pension costs in cost of goods sold (0.2 )% (0.2 )% 0.0 pts Total GCP Gross Margin (GAAP) 34.9 % 37.8 % (2.9) pts Adjusted EBIT(A)(B)(C): Specialty Construction Chemicals segment operating income $ 5.9 $ 8.6 (31.4 )% Specialty Building Materials segment operating income 18.1 15.2 19.1 % Corporate and certain pension costs (10.8 ) (12.8 ) 15.6 % Total GCP Adjusted EBIT (non-GAAP) 13.2 11.0 20.0 % Depreciation and amortization: Specialty Construction Chemicals $ 6.0 $ 5.1 17.6 % Specialty Building Materials 3.4 2.9 17.2 % Corporate 0.8 0.4 100.0 % Total GCP depreciation and amortization 10.2 8.4 21.4 % Adjusted EBITDA: Specialty Construction Chemicals $ 11.9 $ 13.7 (13.1 )% Specialty Building Materials 21.5 18.1 18.8 % Corporate and certain pension costs (10.0 ) (12.4 ) 19.4 % Total GCP Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) 23.4 19.4 20.6 % Adjusted EBIT Margin: Specialty Construction Chemicals 4.0 % 6.4 % (2.4) pts Specialty Building Materials 17.5 % 16.6 % 0.9 pts Total GCP Adjusted EBIT Margin (non-GAAP) 5.3 % 4.9 % 0.4 pts Adjusted EBITDA Margin: Specialty Construction Chemicals 8.1 % 10.2 % (2.1) pts Specialty Building Materials 20.8 % 19.8 % 1.0 pts Total GCP Adjusted EBITDA Margin (non-GAAP) 9.4 % 8.6 % 0.8 pts\nAnalysis of Operations\n(In millions) Four Quarters Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Calculation of Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital (trailing four quarters): Adjusted EBIT $ 129.6 $ 125.3 Invested Capital: Trade accounts receivable 194.6 169.4 Inventories 114.6 101.3 Accounts payable (133.7 ) (104.7 ) Invested working capital 175.5 166.0 Other current assets (excluding income taxes) 38.4 35.0 Properties and equipment, net 220.1 191.5 Goodwill 202.9 115.1 Technology and other intangible assets, net 91.1 51.0 Other assets (excluding capitalized financing fees) 26.7 19.7 Other current liabilities (excluding income taxes, restructuring, repositioning, accrued interest and liabilities incurred in association with the Darex divestiture) (95.7 ) (81.4 ) Other liabilities (excluding other postretirement benefits liability and liabilities incurred in association with the Darex divestiture) (18.6 ) (13.8 ) Total invested capital $ 640.4 $ 483.1 Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital (non-GAAP) 20.2 % 25.9 %",
