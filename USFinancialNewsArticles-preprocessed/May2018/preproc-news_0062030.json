    "text": "Cincinnati outfielders Adam Duvall and Scott Schebler homered, and the Reds overcame a four-run deficit to salvage the finale of a three-game series with a 7-4 victory over the host Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field on Wednesday afternoon.\nSchebler’s two-run homer off Patrick Corbin (5-2) in the sixth inning broke a 4-4 tie after Duvall’s grand slam in the fourth inning knotted the score as the Reds broke a three-game losing streak.\nJohn Ryan Murphy had three hits and a homer, Jarrod Dyson had three hits and Paul Goldschmidt homered for the Diamondbacks, who had won two in a row after a stretch in which they lost 15 of 17. Goldschmidt’s homer was his seventh, though his first at Chase Field.\nEugenio Suarez had three hits and an RBI, Joey Votto had three hits and Raisel Iglesias recorded four outs for his ninth save on his first day back from the disabled list after a biceps injury.\nMurphy also doubled, singled and scored twice. Daniel Descalso and Dyson singled to open the ninth, but Iglesias got the next three, helped by a one-out sliding catch by the left fielder Duvall.\nCorbin gave up eight hits and six runs in six innings, with 10 strikeouts and one walk. He had not given up more than four runs or seven hits in his 11 previous starts and entered the game with a National League-leading 0.89 WHIP.\nReds right-hander Sal Romano (3-6) gave up seven hits and four runs in five innings, with three strikeouts and no walks. Romano had given up 18 runs in 12 2/3 innings in his previous three starts.\nDyson singled to lead off the first inning and Goldschmidt followed with his seventh homer into the Reds’ bullpen in the right field corner. Murphy doubled with one out and scored on David Peralta’s single for a 3-0 lead.\nMurphy’s homer with one out in the third inning made it 4-0. Murphy, the nominal third catcher, has a career-high seven homers, with four hit in his last five starts.\nThe Reds had only one hit off Corbin in the first three innings before Duvall tied it with his grand slam in the fourth. Tucker Barnhart and Votto singled and Suarez walked to load the bases. Duvall had eight RBIs in the three-game series.\nSchebler’s two-run homer in the sixth inning made it 6-4 and Suarez’s RBI single in the ninth closed the scoring.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
