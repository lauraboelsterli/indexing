    "text": "TEMPE, Ariz., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Insight Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:NSIT) (the “Company”) today reported record results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet sales increased 19% year over year to $1.76 billion Gross profit increased 15% year over year to $240.0 million Earnings from operations increased 119% year over year to $50.2 million\n-- Adjusted earnings from operations increased 69% year over year Diluted earnings per share of $0.90 increased 137% year over year\n-- Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.94 increased 68% year over year Cash flows provided by operations in the first quarter were $150.7 million compared to cash used in operations of $152.1 million in the first quarter of the prior year\nIn the first quarter of 2018, consolidated net sales increased 19% and consolidated gross profit increased 15% year over year, reflecting double digit growth in each of the Company’s operating segments. Overall, earnings from operations increased 119% year over year as a result of strong top line growth and the acceleration of certain partner incentives combined with effective cost control. Adjusted earnings from operations increased 69% year over year.\n“I am pleased to report strong top and bottom line financial results across each of our geographic operating segments,” stated Ken Lamneck, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The first quarter demonstrated yet again that global demand for IT products and solutions remains healthy with opportunity for share gains and growth. We are executing well on the sales front and are focused on controlling costs and improving the scalability of our business for the future,” stated Lamneck.\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\nConsolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2018 increased 19% compared to the first quarter of 2017 to $1.76 billion.\n-- Net sales in North America increased 18% year over year to $1.3 billion;\n-- Net sales in EMEA increased 21% year over year to $400.4 million; and\n-- Net sales in APAC increased 52% year over year to $55.1 million.\nExcluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, consolidated net sales increased 16% year over year, with net sales growth in North America, EMEA and APAC of 17%, 7% and 47%, respectively, year over year.\nConsolidated gross profit increased 15% compared to the first quarter of 2017 to $240.0 million, with consolidated gross margin contracting 50 basis points to 13.6% of net sales.\n-- Gross profit in North America increased 11% year over year to $175.4 million (13.4% gross margin);\n-- Gross profit in EMEA increased 31% year over year to $55.8 million (13.9% gross margin); and\n-- Gross profit in APAC increased 20% year over year to $8.8 million (16.1% gross margin).\nExcluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, consolidated gross profit increased 12% year over year, with gross profit growth in North America, EMEA and APAC of 11%, 16% and 16%, respectively, year over year.\nConsolidated earnings from operations increased 119% compared to the first quarter of 2017 to $50.2 million, or 2.8% of net sales.\n-- Earnings from operations in North America increased 82% year over year to $42.3 million, or 3.2% of net sales;\n-- Earnings from operations in EMEA increased year over year to $6.4 million, or 1.6% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a loss from operations of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017; and\n-- Earnings from operations in APAC increased 74% year over year to $1.5 million, or 2.6% of net sales.\nExcluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, consolidated earnings from operations also increased 119% year over year, with earnings from operations growth in North America and APAC of 81% and 71%, respectively, year over year.\nAdjusted consolidated earnings from operations increased 69% year over year to $51.8 million, or 2.9% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018.\nConsolidated net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 were $32.7 million and $0.90, respectively, at an effective tax rate of 26.0%.\nAdjusted consolidated net earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 were $34.1 million and $0.94, respectively.\nAs services have become a larger portion of the Company’s consolidated net sales, beginning with our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company began reporting net sales from the provision of services and the related costs of goods sold separately from net sales of products and the related costs of goods sold. The Company continued this presentation in the three months ended March 31, 2018, and expects to continue this presentation in future periods. For comparability purposes, net sales and costs of goods sold for the 2017 periods have been expanded to conform to the current year presentation. These changes in presentation had no effect on previously reported total net sales, total costs of goods sold or gross profit amounts.\nIn conjunction with these changes in presentation, because fees earned from activities reported net are now considered services revenues, the Company reclassified certain revenue streams for which the Company acts as the agent in the transaction to net sales from services. Previously, the Company included these net revenue streams within its software and, to a lesser extent, hardware sales mix categories based on the type of product being sold (e.g., fees earned for the sale of software maintenance and certain software licenses were included in software sales and fees earned for the sale of certain third-party provided training and warranty services were included in hardware sales when the Company historically disclosed and analyzed its sales mix). For comparability purposes, the Company’s sales mix among its hardware, software and services categories for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as presented in the Financial Summary Table in this press release, has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported total net sales amounts.\nIn discussing financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 in this press release, the Company refers to certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). When referring to non-GAAP measures, the Company refers to such measures as “Adjusted.” See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information. A tabular reconciliation of financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release.\nIn some instances the Company refers to changes in net sales, gross profit and earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In computing these changes and percentages, the Company compares the current year amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior year amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period.\nThe tax effect of Adjusted amounts referenced herein were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded, adjusted for the effects of valuation allowances on net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.\nGUIDANCE\nFor the full year 2018, the Company now expects to deliver sales growth in the mid- to high-single digit range compared to 2017. The Company also increased its expectations for Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2018 to between $4.35 and $4.45.\nThis outlook assumes:\nan effective tax rate of between 26% and 27% for the balance of 2018; capital expenditures of $15 to $20 million for the full year; and an average share count for the full year of approximately 36.0 million shares.\nThis outlook does not assume the completion of the Company’s currently authorized share repurchase program, assumes no current year acquisition-related expenses and excludes severance and restructuring expenses incurred during the first quarter of 2018 and those that may be incurred during the balance of 2018. Due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting these types of expenses, which impact net earnings and diluted earnings per share, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the related impact of such expenses, if any, to net earnings and diluted earnings per share. Accordingly, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the full year 2018 forecast.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nThe Company will host a conference call and live web cast today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss first quarter 2018 results of operations. A live web cast of the conference call (in listen-only mode) will be available on the Company’s web site at HTTP://INVESTOR.INSIGHT.COM/ , and a replay of the web cast will be available on the Company’s web site for a limited time following the call. To listen to the live web cast by telephone, call 1-877-402-8904 if located in the U.S., 678-809-1029 for international callers, and enter the access code 8034719. NSIT-F\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe non-GAAP financial measures (referred to as Adjusted consolidated earnings from operations, Adjusted consolidated net earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per share) exclude (i) severance and restructuring expenses, (ii) certain acquisition-related expenses, and (iii) the tax effects of each of these items, as applicable. The Company excludes these items when internally evaluating earnings from operations, tax expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the Company and earnings from operations for each of the Company’s operating segments. These non-GAAP measures are used to evaluate financial performance against budgeted amounts, to calculate incentive compensation, to assist in forecasting future performance and to compare the Company’s results to those of the Company’s competitors. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency, facilitate comparisons to prior periods and the Company’s competitors’ results and assist in forecasting performance for future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY TABLE (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) (UNAUDITED) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 change Insight Enterprises, Inc.
