    "text": "Continued improvement in stores and double-digit growth in digital business combine for strong profit and sales performance\nCompany raises earnings and sales guidance for fiscal 2018\nCINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) today reported first quarter 2018 earnings per diluted share of $0.45, or $0.48 excluding impairment and other costs. This compares to $0.26 per share in the first quarter of 2017 for both reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Also excluding asset sale gains, earnings per diluted share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. were $0.42 in the first quarter of 2018. This compares to $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe company also reported comparable sales on an owned basis that were up 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. On an owned plus licensed basis, comparable sales were up 4.2 percent for the first quarter of 2018.\n“Macy’s, Inc.'s results for the first quarter of 2018 reflect continuing momentum in the business. We exceeded our expectations and saw strong performance across all three brands—Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, and Bluemercury—as well as across all geographic regions and families of business. We are maintaining a healthy inventory position, which helped us deliver improved gross margin,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy’s, Inc. chairman and chief executive officer. “The winning formula for Macy’s, Inc. is a healthy brick & mortar business, robust e-commerce and a great mobile experience. While we have more work to do, the continuing improvement in our stores is encouraging and we once again achieved double-digit growth in the digital business. Our best customer is responding well to the improvements we’ve made to her experience in our stores, on .com and through the Macy’s app.”\n“Our first quarter performance reflects solid execution of our North Star Strategy, including merchandising and marketing activities. We also saw continued healthy consumer spending and significant improvements in international tourism. Taken together, these positive factors give us confidence to raise both our sales and earnings guidance for the fiscal year,” continued Gennette. “Heading into the second quarter, we are intensely focused on laying the foundation for our 2018 strategic initiatives to support improved performance in the back half of the year.”\nSales\nNet sales in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $5.541 billion, an increase of 3.6 percent, compared with sales of $5.350 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Comparable sales on an owned basis were up 3.9 percent in the first quarter and up 4.2 percent on an owned plus licensed basis.\nThe company estimates that comparable sales in the first quarter of 2018 benefited approximately 250 basis points from the shift of Friends and Family from the second quarter to the first. Excluding this, the company estimates that comparable sales were up 1.7 percent on an owned plus licensed basis.\nOperating Income and Net Income\nMacy’s, Inc.’s operating income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $238 million, or 4.3 percent of sales, compared to $219 million, or 4.1 percent of sales, for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $257 million, or 4.6 percent of sales, excluding impairment and other costs of $19 million, which primarily relate to the wind-down of Macy's China Limited as discussed below. The company anticipates recognizing additional charges of approximately $10 million related to the wind-down over the course of fiscal 2018. There were no impairment and other costs in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $139 million, or 2.5 percent of sales, compared to $78 million, or 1.5 percent of sales, for the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $149 million, or 2.7 percent of sales, excluding impairment and other costs. This compares to $80 million, or 1.5 percent of sales, in the first quarter of 2017, excluding premiums on the early retirement of debt. Also excluding asset sale gains, net income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $131 million, or 2.4 percent of sales, compared to $38 million, or 0.7 percent of sales, in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $322 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $237 million in the first quarter last year. Net cash used by investing activities in the first quarter of 2018 was $156 million, compared with $60 million a year ago. Net cash used by financing activities in the first quarter of 2018 was $99 million, compared with $273 million last year.\nChina Update\nMacy’s, Inc. has set a new approach to its business in China. The company has come to a mutual agreement to end the joint venture with Fung Retailing Limited. Macy’s will remain active on Alibaba’s e-commerce platform TMall, as well as social media channels. The Macy’s e-commerce team in San Francisco will manage the ongoing China business with operational support from Fung Omni in Shanghai.\nLooking Ahead - Raising Earnings and Sales Guidance\nMacy's, Inc. is updating its guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now expects adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.75 to $3.95 in fiscal 2018, excluding anticipated settlement charges related to the company’s defined benefit plans as well as impairment and other costs. This reflects an increase of 20 cents compared to the prior guidance. Total sales are expected to range from a 1 percent decline to a .5 percent increase in fiscal 2018. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis are expected to increase between 1 and 2 percent. Comparable sales on an owned basis are expected to be 20-30 basis points below comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis.\nTotal sales guidance is provided on a 52-week basis in 2018 compared to a 53-week basis in 2017. Comparable sales guidance is provided on a 52-week basis in both 2018 and 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 results, first quarter 2017 results and guidance for fiscal 2018 reflect the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition and retirement benefits. Macy's, Inc. has recast its quarterly income statements and balance sheets for 2016 and 2017 to reflect adoption of these new standards. These documents can be found on the investor relations page at www.macysinc.com .\nImportant Information Regarding Financial Measures\nPlease see the final pages of this news release for important information regarding the calculation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures.\nMacy’s, Inc. is one of the nation’s premier retailers.

Further, because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the results of operations for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017 (which do not include the Christmas season) are not necessarily indicative of such results for the fiscal year. (2) For the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018, impairment and other costs associated with the wind-down of Macy's China Limited amounted to $19 million on a pre-tax basis. The after tax effect of these charges during the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018 was $10 million after tax or $.03 per diluted share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. (3) The 13 weeks ended April 29, 2017 included $3 million, on a pre-tax basis, of premium expenses and fees associated with the early retirement of debt. The after tax impact during the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2017 was $2 million. (4) For the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018, federal, state and local income taxes differed from the company's federal income tax statutory rate of 21% because of the effects of state and local taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations. Further, the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018 and April 29, 2017 included the recognition of approximately $3 million and $11 million, respectively, of net tax deficiencies associated with share-based payment awards. These items as well as the enactment of U.S. federal tax reform in December 2017 resulted in an effective tax rate for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018 of 28.4% as compared to 46.9% for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2017.

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-18, restricted cash of $49 million and $37 million have been included with cash and cash equivalents above for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Further, certain reclassifications were made to the prior period's amounts to conform with the classifications of such amounts in the most recent period.\nMACY’S, INC.\nImportant Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, which includes adjusting for growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties and certain promotional events, assists in evaluating the company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items from operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders that are not associated with the company’s core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude period-to-period provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the company's ability to generate earnings and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods.\nThe reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis) is in the same manner as illustrated below, except that the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties is the only reconciling item. In addition, the company does not provide the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure of net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders excluding certain items because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.\nMACY’S, INC. Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(All amounts in millions except percentages and per share figures)\nChange in Comparable Sales\n13 Weeks Ended May 5, 2018 Increase in comparable sales on an owned basis (Note 1) 3.9 % Impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties (Note 2) 0.3 % Increase in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis 4.2 % Impact of quarterly timing shift associated with the Spring 2018 Friends and Family promotional event (2.5 )% Adjusted increase in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis 1.7 % Notes: (1) Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales, excluding commissions from departments licensed to third parties. Stores impacted by a natural disaster or undergoing significant expansion or shrinkage remain in the comparable sales calculation unless the store is closed for a significant period of time. Definitions and calculations of comparable sales differ among companies in the retail industry. (2) Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales in the calculation of comparable sales. The company licenses third parties to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented. MACY’S, INC.\nImportant Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Macy's, Inc. Shareholders, Excluding Certain Items\nThe following is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders, excluding certain items identified below, to GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc., shareholders, which the company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n13 Weeks 13 Weeks Ended Ended May 5, April 29, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders $ 139 $ 78 Add back the pre-tax impact of impairment and other costs (Note) 13 — Add back the pre-tax impact of premiums on the early retirement of debt — 3 Deduct the income tax impact of certain items identified above (3 ) (1 ) Net income attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders, excluding certain items identified above\n$ 149 $ 80 Deduct the pre-tax impact of gains on sale of real estate (24 ) (68 ) Add back the income tax impact of gains on sale of real estate 6 26 Net income attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders, excluding gains on sale of real estate\nand other certain items identified above\n$ 131 $ 38 Note: The above pre-tax adjustment excludes impairment and other costs attributable to the noncontrolling interest shareholder of $6 million.\n13 Weeks 13 Weeks Ended Ended May 5, April 29, 2018 2017 Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders $ 0.45 $ 0.26 Add back the pre-tax impact of impairment and other costs 0.04 — Add back the pre-tax impact of premiums on the early retirement of debt — 0.01 Deduct the income tax impact of certain items identified above (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders,\nexcluding certain items identified above\n$ 0.48 $ 0.26 Deduct the pre-tax impact of gains on sale of real estate (0.08 ) (0.22 ) Add back the income tax impact of gains on sale of real estate 0.02 0.08 Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders,\nexcluding gains on sale of real estate and other certain items identified above\n$ 0.42 $ 0.12\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180516005654/en/\nMacy’s, Inc.\nMedia\nBlair Fasbender Rosenberg, 646-429-6032\nmedia@macys.com\nor\nInvestors\nMonica Koehler, 513-579-7780\ninvestors@macys.com\nSource: Macy’s, Inc.",
