BOURSE: A new Czech market for small company listings had a mixed start on Tuesday, with one firm selling all the stock it had planned, but a second only finding buyers for a third of its offering and another abandoning its listing altogether. The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE), owned by the Vienna bourse, is hoping the START market, where stock will trade in quarterly auctions, will boost activity amid a dearth of listings.

CEE MARKETS: The forint hit a 22-month low against the euro on Tuesday as a rebound of the dollar and U.S. debt yields caused a renewed sell-off in Central European markets, even as first-quarter data confirmed strong economic growth in the region.
