    "text": "Thomson Reuters on Friday reported slightly higher-than-expected first-quarter sales and earnings, and forecast low-single-digit growth in 2018 revenue in its remaining business.\nThe news and information company announced earlier this year that it is selling a majority stake of its financial & risk unit to private-equity firm Blackstone .\nThomson Reuters reported quarterly revenue of $1.38 billion, up from $1.33 billion a year ago. Adjusted for special items, first-quarter earnings were 28 cents per share.\nAnalysts on average were expecting revenues of $1.36 billion and earnings of $0.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThomson Reuters, the parent of Reuters News, competes for financial customers with Bloomberg as well as News Corp.'s Dow Jones unit.\nThe company said it expects adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for the year in the remaining business.\nThe company's legal business reported revenue of $872 million in the first quarter, up 2 percent excluding currency. The Tax & Accounting unit reported revenue of $437 million, up 5 percent when factoring out currency.\nThomson Reuters's news division reported $72 million in revenue, down 7 percent from a year ago.\nAfter the Blackstone deal, Thomson Reuters will focus on expanding its Legal, Tax & Accounting and Regulatory businesses, the company has said.\nIn the quarter, the Financial and Risk business grew revenues 3 percent in constant currency to $1.58 billion. The unit is now counted as discontinued operations.\nUnder the agreement, the new F&R company will make minimum annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years to secure access to its news service, equating to almost $10 billion. The payments will be adjusted for inflation.\nThomson Reuters announced a new $500 million share repurchase program.",
