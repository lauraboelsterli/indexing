Visitors pass in front of the Chinese telecoms equipment group ZTE Corp booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman\nThe sources, who declined to be identified because the negotiations were confidential, also told Reuters the deal could include China removing tariffs on imported U.S. agricultural products as well as buying more of them.
