REUTERS/Leah Millis Hours before South Korean President Moon Jae-in was to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House, Pence told Fox News Radio: “Plans continue to go forward for a summit. We remain open to it, we remain hopeful.\n“But let me very clear: nothing has changed about the policy of the United States of America. There have been no concessions offered and none given.”\nReporting by Doina Chiacu and Makini Brice; Editing by Bill Trott\n ",
