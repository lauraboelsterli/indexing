    "text": "0 COMMENTS In mid-2017, the giant landlord Brookfield Property Partners L.P . BPY -0.55% was in advanced talks to buy the Lord & Taylor department store building in New York City for about $700 million, when an unexpected buyer swooped in and sealed a deal, according to people familiar with the matter.\nBehind the deal was WeWork Cos., which put together the $850 million purchase , a hefty premium and a surprising move for a firm that leases buildings and subleases the office space to other companies.\nWeWork didn’t put up the money. Instead, it came from a new real estate fund co-managed by WeWork and one of its early shareholders, private-equity firm Rhône Group. The fund aims to raise tens of billions of dollars from investors in coming years to buy buildings where WeWork would become a tenant, people familiar with the fund said.\nThe unusual arrangement effectively makes WeWork its own landlord using other investors’ money, raising questions about how it will make deals with itself as a tenant while co-managing the fund.\n“There’s huge potential for conflicts,” said Nori Lietz, a lecturer at Harvard Business School and longtime adviser to investors in real estate funds. “They’re using other people’s money, and they’re on both sides of the transaction at the end of day.”\nWeWork has made these ties clear to investors in offering documents, and the fund has established some measures to mitigate conflicts of interest, people familiar with the matter say; specifics couldn’t be learned. In other cases, real estate funds might have outside groups negotiate certain issues to avoid conflicts.\nWeWork’s pitch to investors is that its role as both tenant and landlord could yield better investment returns than conventional real estate funds. The fund largely aims to buy buildings that WeWork would then lease, at least in part, to itself. The value of a building with a tenant in place tends to be significantly higher than an empty building.\nWeWork rose from a tiny, one-office location in Manhattan to a global player in part by leasing property, rather than spending more to buy it. The company, valued at $20 billion by investors, is under pressure to secure more real estate after pledging continuing rapid expansion .\nLast year, it formed WeWork Property Investors, which has disclosed raising $400 million and has struck deals for at least four properties. It is seeking $767 million in debt to fund the purchase and renovations of the Lord & Taylor building, and expects to complete the purchase by the fall.\nWeWork has said it will make the Lord & Taylor building its headquarters and lease some of the office space to customers. The company also secured the ability to lease some other department stores owned by Lord & Taylor’s parent, Hudson Bay Cos.\nThe fund has sought to raise money from wealthy clients of Citigroup Inc., which circulated a presentation about the fund that stated a plan to “capitalize on the growing demand for flexible community-based office space,” according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\nThe fund is run by WeWork and Rhône executives including WeWork Chief Executive Adam Neumann and Rhône Chairman and Co-founder Steven Langman, according to the Citigroup presentation.\nMembers use a flexible workspace at the WeWork Embarcadero Center offices in San Francisco in October. Photo: Mike Short/Bloomberg News Real estate experts say WeWork’s involvement raises concerns the fund could tilt decisions on items like lease rates in favor of the company, or pursue riskier behavior than a normal landlord would in order to benefit WeWork.\nGenerally with conflicts, “you’re going to push profits to the side [where] you have the greatest financial interest,” said Joseph Pagliari, a professor at University of Chicago’s business school, who has studied real estate funds.\nThe Citigroup documents, listing risks about the fund, say WeWork and Rhône are “expressly permitted” to engage in activities that may be “adverse” to the fund.\nRhône executives are meant to take the lead when some conflicts arise, according to a person familiar with the fund. Rhône’s Mr. Langman sits on WeWork’s board, in a seat controlled by Mr. Neumann.\nEntities tied to Mr. Langman and Rhone held 2.2 million shares of WeWork private stock worth more than $100 million, based on the latest valuation, according to documents from a bond offering made public last month.\nOther similar investment funds in the real estate world—like the property ownership arm of a casino or a senior living company—typically have management that is independent of the operating business, said David De La Rosa, an adviser to real estate investors for Green Street Advisors. The layer of independence is meant to avoid conflicts that could hurt investors, he said.\nAnother well-funded private company, Airbnb Inc., considered a similar concept to WeWork’s fund last year. Under then-financial chief Laurence Tosi, Airbnb planned to create a real estate investment trust that would have rented its houses and apartments on Airbnb, according to people familiar with the matter.\nBut unlike the WeWork fund, that plan called for the fund’s management to report to an independent board, a measure meant to limit potential conflicts, the people said. An Airbnb spokesman said the company isn’t pursuing the fund plan.\nWeWork appears to have benefited from the fund with a low-interest loan. WeWork debt documents show it borrowed $26 million at 1.52% annual interest from its real estate fund last year.\nIt is uncommon for tenants to borrow millions from their landlords. The debt documents didn’t state the purpose of the loan.\nWeWork faces higher interest rates on the private market; the company borrowed $702 million at nearly 8% last month.\nWrite to Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com",
