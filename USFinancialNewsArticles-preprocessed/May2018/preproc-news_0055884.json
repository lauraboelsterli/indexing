    "text": "6 COMMENTS Jim Weddle and his wife, Stacey, on a recent drive in their 1937 Cord 812 Phaeton in Ladue, Mo. Photo: Whitney Curtis for The Wall Street Journal Jim Weddle, 64, the managing partner of Edward Jones, in St. Louis, Mo., on his 1937 Cord 812 Phaeton, as told to A.J. Baime.\nForty-two years ago, my wife Stacey and I moved to Connersville, Ind., to open a branch office of the investment company Edward Jones. I had been an intern at the St. Louis headquarters while getting my MBA, and this was my first “real” job. I’ve been a car guy since I can remember, and what we found in Connersville was not just a great community, but what was to me an amazing automotive history.\nIn the 1920s and 30s, an industrialist named Errett Lobban (E.L.) Cord built Auburn and Duesenberg cars in Indiana. In 1929, he set out to build a car with his own name on it. Cord created a state-of-the-art car factory in Connersville to produce Cord and Auburn cars. Historians have called the small town Indiana’s “Little Detroit.”\nWhen we moved there, my wife got a job at a company based in the old Cord assembly plant and you could see where the assembly line had once been.\nPhotos: An American Classic With a Rich History Produced in Indiana’s ‘Little Detroit,’ the Cord was a luxury vehicle on the cutting edge in the 1930s Jim and Stacey Weddle’s 1937 Cord 812 Phaeton. The Weddles fell for Cord cars in 1977 when they moved to Connersville, Ind., where Cords were built. Whitney Curtis for The Wall Street Journal 1 of 10 • • • • • Cord cars were luxurious and ahead of their time in terms of styling and engineering. Unfortunately, the Great Depression had a devastating effect on Indiana’s auto business. Auburn, Duesenberg, and Cord all ended production during the Depression.\nBut the people of Indiana still celebrate these cars. We would see Cords at July 4th parades in Connersville, and I remember saying to my wife years ago, “Someday we are going to own one of those cars.”\nIn 1984, we moved back to Edward Jones’ headquarters in St. Louis. Ten years ago, my wife and I fulfilled our goal of purchasing a Cord. We found our 812 Phaeton through a classic car broker, for $200,000—top dollar, but it was one of the best I have seen. E.L. Cord envisioned this car to be a “baby Duesenberg.” Coincidentally, our car was built during the final year of Cord’s production.\nThe car has front-wheel drive, retractable headlights controlled by cranks on either side of the dashboard, and a V-8 engine built by E.L. Cord’s Lycoming company. Our car had been restored before we bought it, and it is a delight to drive once you figure out its quirks. Our youngest son and his wife were driven from their wedding in our Cord, and our grandchildren delight in riding in the back seat with Gramps and Mimi.\nToday, I have a collection of cars, but the Cord is a sentimental favorite. At the end of this year I will retire from Edward Jones, and traveling back to Connersville with this car is on my retirement bucket list.\n—Contact A.J.
