    "text": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska, April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northrim BanCorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NRIM) (“Northrim” or the \"Company\") today reported profits grew 6% to $4.1 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in profits was supported by an increase in the net interest margin (\"NIM\"), which was boosted by the repricing of short-term investments at higher interest rates during the quarter, plus a significant benefit from lower tax rates effective for 2018.\n“Our first quarter financial results reflect the stability and strength of our Alaska banking franchise, the benefits of rising interest rates on our investment portfolio, and the lower corporate tax rates enacted last year,” said Joe Schierhorn, President and CEO.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, $56.0 million of investments matured or repriced at current market rates. An additional $141.1 million will mature or reprice this year, which is 47% of the $303.1 million investment portfolio at quarter end. Of those securities that repriced in the first quarter of 2018, the average yield increased to 2.87% from 2.07%. As of March 31, 2018, the average yield of the investments that will mature and be repriced in the remainder of the year is 1.68%. Rates for new investment opportunities continue to rise and are expected to have a positive impact on the Bank’s short duration portfolio, going forward.\n“As Alaska’s oil-price-driven recession begins to subside, the Northrim team continues to demonstrate the resilience of our banking model with solid profitability and moderate balance sheet growth,” Schierhorn continued. “We are pleased with our ability to expand the loan portfolio, despite normal maturities in the portfolio, as well as the lingering recession, and the seasonality of the Alaska economy. Growth of loans and deposits will continue to be a challenge, which we believe we can overcome with the planned investments in technology, recruiting and retaining business talent, and working to gain market share.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nTotal revenue, which includes net interest income plus other operating income, was $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $22.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $22.7 million in the first quarter a year ago.\n— Community Banking contributed 76% to total revenues and 86% to net income in the first quarter of 2018.\n— Home Mortgage Lending contributed 24% to total revenues and 14% to net income in the first quarter of 2018. Net interest income in the first quarter of 2018 increased 3% to $14.3 million from $13.8 million in the first quarter a year ago, mainly due to the higher yield on the investment portfolio, and was down 3% from $14.7 million in the preceding quarter due to a change in the mix of assets and a decline in average interest-earning assets. Operating net income* increased 28% to $4.1 million from $3.2 million in the preceding quarter and grew 1% from $4.0 million in the year ago quarter. Operating net income excludes one-time or non-operating items as detailed below. NIM tax equivalent* (\"NIMTE\") expanded to 4.33%, a 2 basis point improvement, compared to the preceding quarter and an 11 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter a year ago. Total portfolio loans grew 1% in both the quarter and year-over-year to $967.6 million with growth in commercial loans, which account for 33% of the portfolio. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, which account for 41% of the portfolio, also increased from the prior quarter. Total deposits held steady during the quarter and increased 1% year-over-year with demand deposits growing to 34% of the portfolio and time deposits declining to 8% of total deposits. Northrim paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share in March 2018, up from the $0.21 per share dividend paid in March 2017. The dividend provides an annual yield of approximately 2.73% at current market share prices. Book value per share increased 3% to $28.37 at the end of the first quarter of 2018 from $27.42 a year ago, while tangible book value per share* increased 4% to $26.01 at the end of the first quarter of 2018 from $25.06 a year ago. At quarter end total non-performing assets, net of government guarantees, decreased to $26.1 million, or 1.71% of assets compared to $28.7 million, or 1.89% of assets, at December 31, 2017, and increased from $18.4 million, or 1.22% of assets a year ago. Total adversely classified loans remained consistent at $34.9 million at quarter end, compared to $33.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $34.5 million a year ago. Following net charge-offs of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, the allowance for loan losses to portfolio loans grew to 2.11% at March 31, 2018, compared to 2.07% a year ago. Northrim remains well-capitalized with Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets of 14.88%, total shareholders' equity to total assets of 12.79%, and tangible common equity to tangible assets* of 11.85% at March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) March 31, 2018 December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 Total assets $1,524,741 $1,518,596 $1,522,784 $1,492,603 $1,506,356 Total portfolio loans $967,575 $954,953 $988,490 $990,380 $959,946 Average portfolio loans $955,718 $980,351 $1,003,751 $969,051 $970,493 Total deposits $1,260,790 $1,258,283 $1,258,317 $1,234,310 $1,247,073 Average deposits $1,233,745 $1,254,566 $1,262,808 $1,244,583 $1,230,947 Total shareholders' equity $194,973 $192,802 $194,427 $191,777 $189,452 Net income attributable to Northrim BanCorp $4,062 $214 $5,523 $3,589 $3,825 Operating net income* $4,062 $3,181 $3,100 $3,962 $4,005 Diluted earnings per share $0.58 $0.03 $0.79 $0.51 $0.55 Operating diluted earnings per share* $0.58 $0.46 $0.45 $0.57 $0.57 Return on average assets 1.10 % 0.06 % 1.44 % 0.96 % 1.04 % Operating return on average assets* 1.10 % 0.83 % 0.81 % 1.05 % 1.09 % Return on average shareholders' equity 8.43 % 0.43 % 11.25 % 7.43 % 8.30 % Operating return on average shareholders' equity* 8.43 % 6.40 % 6.32 % 8.21 % 8.69 % Net interest margin (\"NIM\") 4.28 % 4.25 % 4.28 % 4.20 % 4.15 % Tax equivalent NIM* 4.33 % 4.31 % 4.34 % 4.26 % 4.22 % Efficiency ratio 77.22 % 80.92 % 61.40 % 76.99 % 72.96 % Operating efficiency ratio* 77.22 % 78.74 % 71.26 % 74.36 % 71.62 % Total shareholders' equity/total assets 12.79 % 12.70 % 12.77 % 12.85 % 12.58 % Tangible common equity/tangible assets* 11.85 % 11.75 % 11.83 % 11.89 % 11.62 % Book value per share $28.37 $28.06 $28.37 $27.75 $27.42 Tangible book value per share* $26.01 $25.70 $26.00 $25.40 $25.06 Dividends per share $0.24 $0.22 $0.22 $0.21 $0.21 * References to operating net income, operating diluted earnings per share, operating return on average assets, operating return on average shareholders' equity, tax equivalent NIM, operating efficiency ratio, tangible book value per share, tangible common equity and tangible assets (all of which exclude intangible assets) represent non-GAAP financial measures.

Employment remains challenging, as February 2018 marked the 29 th consecutive month of job losses, with wages falling 3.6% in the third quarter of 2017 (the most recent data available). Despite falling wages and employment throughout most of the state, home values remain stable and foreclosure rates are among the lowest in the country.\n“We are concerned that the State continues to lose jobs, but heartened by recent oil discoveries on the North Slope that could result in meaningful increases in oil production in the future,” Schierhorn noted.\nNorthrim Bank sponsors the Alaskanomics blog to provide news, analysis, and commentary on Alaska’s economy.

These results were above the average 0.85% ROAA and the 7.96% ROAE posted by the 148 banks that make up the SNL U.S. Bank Index with assets between $1 billion and $5 billion as of December 31, 2017. NIM and NIMTE* for the first quarter of 2018 were 4.28% and 4.33%, respectively, compared to 3.62% NIMTE* for the index peers 1 .\n1 As of December 31, 2017, the SNL US Bank Index tracked 148 banks with assets between $1 billion and $5 billion with averages for the following ratios: NIM (tax equivalent) 3.62%, loan loss reserves to gross loans of 0.93%, return on average assets (ROAA) 0.85%, and return on average equity (ROAE) 7.96%. Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income grew 3% to $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $13.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 and was down 3% from $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNIMTE* was 4.33% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.31% in the preceding quarter and 4.22% from the same quarter a year ago. Higher total interest income, coupled with lower total interest expense, contributed to the increases in net interest income and NIMTE* in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Net interest income declined and NIMTE* increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower average earning-asset balances and a less favorable mix. The cost of funds was stable in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the preceding quarter and declined compared to the same quarter last year.\nIn August 2017, Northrim redeemed $8.0 million in junior subordinated debt held at Northrim Capital Trust 1. This liability bore interest at a floating rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 3.15%, or 4.33% at the time it was redeemed, and had a final maturity of May 15, 2033. Interest expense on this debt in 2017 through the date of redemption on August 15, 2017 averaged $84,800 per quarter. This redemption decreased Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets and Total Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets by 62 basis points each. An interest rate swap executed in September 2017 effectively converted the floating rate of interest on the remaining $10.0 million in outstanding junior subordinated debt from 90-day LIBOR plus 1.37%, or 3.4% as of March 31, 2018, to a fixed rate of 3.72% through the junior subordinated debt's final maturity date of March 15, 2036. In the first quarter of 2018, the hedge was effective in offsetting the unrealized losses on this debt.\n“As expected, the repayment of one of our higher-cost floating rate liabilities, completed in August of 2017, helped reduce interest expense on borrowings by 4% in the quarter and 14% year over year, and provided further benefits to the net interest margin,” said Jed Ballard, Chief Financial Officer.\n“As we anticipated at the beginning of the year, NIM has increased during the quarter, and we expect it will continue to increase throughout 2018. With the expectation of further interest rate increases, we anticipate benefiting from the repricing of our loan portfolio and also our short duration investment portfolio, where $141 million in securities will be either maturing or repricing during the remainder of 2018,\" Ballard continued.\nThe components of the change in NIMTE are detailed in the table below:\n1Q18 vs. 4Q17 1Q18 vs. 1Q17 Nonaccrual interest adjustments 0.01 % (0.01 )% Interest rates and loan fees 0.05 % 0.14 % Volume and mix of interest-earning assets (0.04 )% (0.02 )% Change in NIMTE* 0.02 % 0.11 % Provision for Loan Losses\nThere was no provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to decreases in nonperforming loans. The decrease in the reserve on impaired loans is the result of charge-offs, net of newly impaired loans.\nThe allowance for loan losses was 110% of nonperforming loans, net of government guarantees, at March 31, 2018.\nOther Operating Income\nIn addition to home mortgage lending, Northrim has interests in other businesses that complement its core community banking activities. It provides financial services to businesses and individuals through these interests, including purchased receivables financing and wealth management. Other operating income contributed $7.5 million, or 34% of total first quarter revenues. as compared to $8.0 million, or 35% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $8.9 million, or 39% of revenues in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal other operating income declined 6% to $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 16% year-over-year, reflecting the slowing mortgage market. Partially offsetting this decline was the improvement in purchased receivable income, which grew 11% to $840,000 from $758,000 in the preceding quarter and 22% from $689,000 in the first quarter a year ago.\nIn August 2017, Northrim sold its interest in Northrim Benefits Group (\"NBG\") recognizing a gain of $4.4 million, or $2.6 million net of tax. There was no income from NBG in either the first quarter of 2018 or the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $936,000 in the first quarter a year ago.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $16.8 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to $18.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $16.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Higher data processing expenses during the first quarter of 2018, compared to prior quarters, was offset by lower salaries and benefits. Items impacting the comparative periods include a $686,000 write down of the carrying value of the Company's minority ownership interest in another mortgage origination business in the fourth quarter of 2017, a $563,000 write down on one land development project included in other real estate owned (\"OREO\") in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the changes in compensation expense related to the acquisition of RML that fluctuate with expected earnings from RML for all periods. In addition, $131,000 of one-time costs related to the core conversion were recorded in the first quarter of 2017.\n“During the first quarter, we updated and enhanced our profit sharing program and increased the 401K matching benefit for all employees,” said Ballard. “These benefit programs improve our competitive position in the market for skilled banking professionals, and align our benefits to incentivize profitable growth, but will not materially increase overhead costs. We continue to work to be the employer of choice in our markets, and these benefit improvements are consistent with that goal.”\nCommunity Banking\n“We continue to invest in our Alaska franchise and are well positioned to capitalize on long-term opportunities in the market,” said Schierhorn. “We opened a loan production office in Soldotna on the Kenai Peninsula, expanding on the strong market presence established by our mortgage subsidiary. In addition, we have plans for additional branch enhancements in the future.”\nNet interest income in the Community Banking segment increased 4% to $14.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $13.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe following table provides highlights of the Community Banking segment of Northrim, and detail significant one-time and other non-operating items impacting the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Net interest income $14,036 $14,381 $14,566 $13,952 $13,549 Provision for loan losses — — 2,500 300 400 Other operating income 2,518 2,685 7,635 3,412 3,455 Compensation expense, net RML acquisition payments — (193 ) 149 — 174 Other operating expense 12,394 13,113 12,252 13,284 11,622 Income before provision for income taxes 4,160 4,146 7,300 3,780 4,808 Provision for income taxes 659 4,754 2,452 871 1,422 Net income 3,501 (608 ) 4,848 2,909 3,386 Less: net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest — — 78 152 97 Net income attributable to Northrim BanCorp $3,501 ($608 ) $4,770 $2,757 $3,289 Average diluted shares 6,968,082 6,963,125 6,959,035 6,997,727 6,993,726 Diluted earnings per share $0.50 ($0.09 ) $0.69 $0.39 $0.47\nThree Months Ended (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Net income attributable to Northrim BanCorp $3,501 ($608 ) $4,770 $2,757 $3,289 Impact of one-time and other non-operating items: Gain on sale of Northrim Benefits Group — (2 ) (4,443 ) — — Core conversion costs — — 179 633 131 Compensation expense, net RML acquisition payments — (193 ) 149 — 174 Provision for income taxes related to above items — 80 1,692 (260 ) (125 ) Provision for income taxes, change in DTA valuation — 3,411 — — — Operating net income* $3,501 $2,688 $2,347 $3,130 $3,469 Average diluted shares 6,968,082 6,963,125 6,959,035 6,997,727 6,993,726 Operating diluted earnings per share* $0.50 $0.39 $0.34 $0.45 $0.50 Home Mortgage Lending\n“The mortgage market continues to be a profitable segment in our business, although activity has slowed as the Alaska housing market normalizes. Loans funded in the first quarter of 2018 were down 18% in the quarter as compared to the prior quarter and 5% year-over year, reflecting the general slowing of the Alaska economy, rising interest rates and normal market cycles,” said Ballard. “As the recessionary pressures in the economy ease, we anticipate mortgage activity will gradually improve. In the meantime, the operating expenses are being actively and carefully controlled to improve efficiency and profitability in this part of our business.”\n“Our mortgage servicing business, which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 to service loans for the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, continues to grow,” Ballard continued. “Northrim now services 1,761 loans in its $439.6 million home mortgage servicing portfolio, which is a 43% increase from the $307.5 million serviced a year ago.” Mortgage servicing contributed $1.2 million to first quarter of 2018 and $1.4 million to the first quarter of 2017 revenues. Total mortgage servicing income fluctuates based on the amount of mortgage servicing rights originated during the period, and also based on changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which are driven by interest rate volatility and fluctuations in estimated prepayment speeds, which are based on published industry metrics.\nLastly, the $686,000 pre-tax write down of the carrying value of the Company's minority ownership interest in another mortgage origination business was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe following table provides highlights of the Home Mortgage Lending segment of Northrim:\nThree Months Ended (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Mortgage commitments $64,819 $43,602 $68,601 $80,068 $67,589 Mortgage loans funded for sale $109,069 $132,606 $162,470 $143,944 $115,058 Mortgage loan refinances to total fundings 18 % 17 % 12 % 12 % 24 % Mortgage loans serviced for others $439,561 $406,291 $362,983 $332,485 $307,502 Net realized gains on mortgage loans sold $3,346 $4,084 $5,218 $4,990 $3,721 Change in fair value of mortgage loan commitments, net 316 (551 ) (23 ) 299 128 Total production revenue 3,662 3,533 5,195 5,289 3,849 Mortgage servicing revenue 1,183 1,450 997 838 1,153 Change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net 2 (26 ) 64 (296 ) (48 ) 282 Total mortgage servicing revenue, net 1,157 1,514 701 790 1,435 Other mortgage banking revenue 125 220 323 272 166 Total mortgage banking income $4,944 $5,267 $6,219 $6,351 $5,450 Net interest income $227 $303 $352 $291 $284 Provision for loan losses — — — — — Other operating income 4,944 5,267 6,219 6,351 5,450 Other operating expense 4,401 5,417 5,290 5,226 4,819 Income before provision for income taxes 770 153 1,281 1,416 915 Provision for income taxes 209 (669 ) 528 584 379 Net income attributable to Northrim BanCorp $561 $822 $753 $832 $536 Average diluted shares 6,968,082 6,963,125 6,959,035 6,997,727 6,993,726 Diluted earnings per share $0.08 $0.12 $0.11 $0.12 $0.08 2 Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates, net of collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.\nThree Months Ended (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Net income attributable to Northrim BanCorp $561 $822 $753 $832 $536 Impact of one-time and other non-operating items: Writedown minority interest in equity method investment — 686 — — — Provision for income taxes related to above items — (282 ) — — — Provision for income taxes, change in DTA valuation — (733 ) — — — Operating net income* $561 $493 $753 $832 $536 Average diluted shares 6,968,082 6,963,125 6,959,035 6,997,727 6,993,726 Operating diluted earnings per share* $0.08 $0.07 $0.11 $0.12 $0.08 Balance Sheet Review\nNorthrim’s total assets were $1.52 billion at March 31, 2018, virtually unchanged from both preceding and year ago quarters. Average interest earning assets were also relatively unchanged from a year ago and down 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAverage investment securities increased 9% in the first quarter of 2018 from the year ago quarter and decreased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2017. The investment portfolio generated an average net tax equivalent yield of 1.85% for the first quarter of 2018, up from 1.77% in the preceding quarter and 1.59% a year ago. The average estimated duration of the investment portfolio was 22 months, at March 31, 2018, which is expected to generate improvement in yields as securities reprice in this rising interest rate environment.\nLoans held for sale decreased 6% to $41.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the preceding quarter and increased 46% from the same quarter a year ago, primarily reflecting the seasonality of the mortgage business and the volatility of demand for home loans in the Alaska marketplace.\nPortfolio loans were up 1% to $967.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to both the preceding and year ago quarters. Average portfolio loans in the first quarter of 2018 were $955.7 million, down 2% from a year ago and 3% from the preceding quarter. Seasonality, the slowing Alaska economy, and some larger loan payoffs contributed to moderate declines in average balances in all loan categories for the quarter.\nAlaskans account for substantially all of Northrim’s deposit base, which is primarily made up of low-cost transaction accounts. Balances in transaction accounts at March 31, 2018, represented 92% of total deposits. At March 31, 2018, total deposits were $1.26 billion, unchanged from the immediate prior quarter end and up from $1.25 billion a year ago. Average interest-bearing deposits were stable in the first quarter compared to the preceding quarter and up 2% from a year ago.\nShareholders’ equity increased 3% to $195.0 million, or $28.37 per share, at March 31, 2018, compared to $189.5 million, or $27.42 per share, a year ago. Tangible book value per share* was $26.01 at March 31, 2018, compared to $25.06 per share a year ago. Northrim continues to maintain capital levels in excess of the requirements to be categorized as “well-capitalized” under the Basel III and Dodd Frank regulatory standards with Tier 1 Capital to Risk Adjusted Assets of 14.88% at March 31, 2018. “The repayment of the $8 million in junior subordinated debt in August 2017 brought our capital ratios down, which is expected to improve profitability without reducing liquidity significantly,” said Schierhorn.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets (\"NPAs\"), net of government guarantees, decreased to $26.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $28.7 million at the end of the preceding quarter reflecting $2.0 million in payments and $1.1 million in charge-offs. NPAs increased from $18.4 million at March 31, 2017, primarily due to the addition of one $7.1 million commercial loan to nonaccrual loans. Of the NPAs, $17.9 million or 68% are nonaccrual loans related to four commercial relationships. Two of these relationships, which total $9.1 million at the end of the first quarter, are businesses in the medical industry.\nAdversely classified loans, net of government guarantees, were $34.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $33.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 and $34.5 million one year ago. Charge-offs in the first quarter of 2018 were $1.1 million compared to minimal charge-offs in prior quarters. “The charge-offs in the first quarter related primarily to loans in the health care industry and not the oil sector,” said Ballard.\nThe following table details loan charge-offs, by industry:\n(Dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30, 2017 March 31,\n2017 Charge-offs: Transportation and warehousing $— $24 $339 $— $250 Other services — 5 48 — — Retail trade — — — 202 12 News media — — 731 — — Health care and social assistance 965 — — — — Consumer 139 26 85 5 17 Total charge-offs $1,104 $55 $1,203 $207 $279 Performing restructured loans that were not included in nonaccrual loans at the end of the first quarter of 2018 were $9.2 million, up from $7.7 million in the preceding quarter and $6.3 million a year ago. The increase in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the year ago quarter is primarily due to the addition of two commercial relationships. Borrowers who are in financial difficulty and who have been granted concessions that may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, or payment alterations are categorized as restructured loans. The Company presents restructured loans that are performing separately from those that are classified as nonaccrual to provide more information on this category of loans and to differentiate between accruing performing and nonperforming restructured loans.\nAdversely classified loans are loans that Northrim has classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss, net of government guarantees. As of March 31, 2018, $29.1 million, or 83% of adversely classified loans net of government guarantees are attributable to six relationships in the following sectors; three commercial businesses, two medical businesses, and one oilfield services commercial business.\nNorthrim estimates that $63.6 million, or approximately 7% of portfolio loans as of March 31, 2018, had direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, and $4.1 million of these loans are adversely classified. Northrim has an additional $45.8 million in unfunded commitments to companies with direct exposure to the oil and gas industry in Alaska, and none of these unfunded commitments are considered to be adversely classified loans. “We continue to have no loans to oil producers or exploration companies,” added Ballard. “We define direct exposure to the oil and gas sector as loans to borrowers that provide oilfield services and other companies that we have identified as significantly reliant upon activity in Alaska related to the oil and gas industry, such as lodging, equipment rental, transportation and other logistics services specific to this industry.”\nAbout Northrim BanCorp\nNorthrim BanCorp, Inc. is the parent company of Northrim Bank, an Alaska-based community bank with 14 branches in Anchorage, the Matanuska Valley, Juneau, Fairbanks, Ketchikan, and Sitka serving 90% of Alaska’s population; and an asset based lending division in Washington; and a wholly-owned mortgage brokerage company, Residential Mortgage Holding Company, LLC.
