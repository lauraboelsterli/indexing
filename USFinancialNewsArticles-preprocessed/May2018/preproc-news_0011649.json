    "text": "CHICAGO, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Century Aluminum Company (NASDAQ:CENX) today announced first quarter 2018 results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet loss of $0.3 million, or $0.00 per diluted share Adjusted net loss 1 of $3.5 million, or $0.04 per share Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $21.8 million was down $38.4 million from Q4 2017, reflecting higher raw material costs, partially offset by higher LME and regional premiums Net sales of $454.5 million, a 5% increase over prior quarter\n$MM (except shipments and per share data) Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Shipments (tonnes) 189,000 187,238 Net sales $ 433.8 $ 454.5 Net income/(loss) 35.8 (0.3 ) Diluted earnings/(loss) per share 0.37 0.00 Adjusted net income/(loss) 1 24.8 (3.5 ) Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share 1 0.26 (0.04 ) Adjusted EBITDA 1 60.2 21.8 Notes: 1 - Non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures Century Aluminum Company reported a net loss of $0.3 million of 2018. Results were favorably impacted by a $3.2 million benefit from lower of cost or net realizable value (\"NRV\") inventory adjustments. This result compares to net income of $35.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, which included a $7.3 million non-cash gain related to the termination of certain legacy contractual obligations and a $3.1 million charge for lower of cost or NRV inventory adjustments. Also, the remaining volume under the 2017 LME hedge contracts matured in December and fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income reflected a reduction of $6.8 million for the final settlement of these hedges.\nAdjusted net loss of 2018 was $3.5 million compared to adjusted net income of $24.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFor 2018, Century reported adjusted EBITDA of $21.8 million, down $38.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher raw material costs, partially offset by higher LME and regional premiums.\nSales of 2018 were $454.5 million compared with $433.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Shipments of primary aluminum of 2018 were 187,238 tonnes compared with 189,000 tonnes shipped in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCentury's cash position at quarter end was $130.8 million and revolver availability was $160.9 million.\n“Industry fundamentals remain generally strong, with attractive demand growth persisting in most global regions,\" commented Michael Bless, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"In addition, the previously announced Section 232 tariffs became effective in late March, creating the opportunity for a fairly-traded environment in the U.S. for the first time in decades. This bold action by the U.S. administration has immediately had the intended effect of enabling the restart of U.S. primary production by Century and our industry peers. We remain confident that any exemptions from the tariffs will be limited and will be formulated to maintain the tariff regime’s effectiveness.”\nMr. Bless continued, “We see significant opportunity for Century in the U.S. market over the coming years. Within this context, we were pleased to announce our intention to restart the three potlines at Hawesville curtailed in late 2015. We will also complete several capital projects prudently required to support a return to the plant’s full production capacity. The process is proceeding on plan and according to budget. At this point, we intend to begin restarting cells in the first curtailed potline in June; we believe the plant will return to full capacity by early 2019.”\n“We have also seen a period of significant volatility in the alumina markets caused by a force majeure event at Alunorte, the largest alumina refinery in the western world, and the recent announcement regarding sanctions on certain Russian individuals and entities,” concluded Mr. Bless. “Century is safely supplied for the foreseeable future. That said, the alumina index price, which had fallen to normalized levels by early 2018 as we expected, briefly jumped to an all-time high. This development has more than offset the increase in the metal price over the same period. We do not believe this environment can persist and have already seen the alumina price begin to fall; we are confident this trend will continue. We thus intend to maintain the planned trajectory of our various projects, including most notably the restart of capacity at Hawesville. Of course, we will continue to monitor market conditions and maintain appropriate flexibility to adapt our plans as appropriate.”\nAbout Century Aluminum\nCentury Aluminum Company owns primary aluminum capacity in the United States and Iceland. Century's corporate offices are located in Chicago, IL. Visit www.centuryaluminum.com for more information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to evaluate Century's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of Century’s ongoing operating performance and ability to generate cash. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance an overall understanding of Century’s performance and our investors’ ability to review Century’s business from the same perspective as management. The tables below, under the heading \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, Century's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA included in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures.\nCautionary Statement\nThis press release and statements made by Century Aluminum Company management on the quarterly conference call contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
