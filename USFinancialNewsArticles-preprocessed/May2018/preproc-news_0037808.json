These individuals bring a wealth of knowledge and experience from a variety of industries. Our ability to attract this phenomenal talent is a testament to Choom's vision and strategic plan as we launch our brand in Canada's recreational use cannabis segment. As we rapidly execute our business model we have established an advisory team with extensive experience in Consumer Branding, Retail Supply Chain, Government Relations, Entrepreneurship, Operations, and Financial Services to provide guidance during our next phase of growth. We look forward to leveraging their experience and thought leadership to expedite Choom's retail launch,\" said Chris Bogart, Choom™ President & CEO.\nAppointments to Choom's Advisory Board include:\nDEREK CHAN\nDerek joins Choom™ after his previous role as CFO for Vega, North America's leading all-natural health and performance nutrition brand.

Mr. Chan brings over 20 years experience in senior finance roles across various industries spanning consumer packaged goods, hospitality, and technology.\nDerek holds a Chartered Professional Accountant designation and a Bachelor of Science from Simon Fraser University.

John has been a key official in developing the Alberta government's energy royalty review and climate-change legislation.\nJohn also worked at several law firms in British Columbia, most notably as a lawyer at Heenan Blaikie LLP. His expertise in legal counsel, strategic planning, and government relations is critical to Choom™ as it approaches the legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada.
