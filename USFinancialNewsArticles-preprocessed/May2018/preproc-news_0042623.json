A representative for Bain was not immediately available for comment.\nThe prolonged review has fuelled speculation that Toshiba might abandon the deal and pursue alternative plans such an IPO for the unit.\nAt its earnings briefing on Tuesday, Toshiba CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani said “we haven’t heard anything negative from Chinese regulators.” Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki and Taiga Uranaka in Tokyo; Additional reporting by Stella Qiu in Beijing; Editing by Edwina Gibbs",
