    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nMedical Marijuana, Inc. (OTC: MJNA), the first publicly traded cannabis company in the United States, today announced its subsidiary HempMeds® has partnered with Northshore Pharmacy to sell its Real Scientific Hemp Oil™ (RSHO™) CBD oil as a non-prescription product in Bermuda.\n\"Our international expansion isn't over until we're able to sell our cannabidiol (CBD) products in every country around the world,\" said Medical Marijuana, Inc. CEO Dr. Stuart Titus. \"We feel very fortunate to partner with this prestigious pharmacy to help expand CBD access throughout Bermuda.\"\nNorthshore Pharmacy is owned by the husband and wife team of Jonathan and Jennie Lightbourne. The pharmacy is situated within the Northshore Medical & Aesthetics Center , which was created to help the people of Bermuda improve their physical, visual, mental and sexual health with top health service offerings and physicians.\n\"Our pharmacy is pleased to offer HempMeds' CBD hemp oil products to our customers,\" said Northshore Pharmacy Co-Owner and Managing Pharmacist, Jennie Lightbourne. \"We've received a tremendous amount of positive feedback on these products and look forward to offering even more in the future.\"\nHempMeds® was the first company to ever bring hemp-based CBD oil products to market in the U.S. in 2012 -- and the first to both make CBD products available in bulk for U.S. consumers and provide high-quality CBD oil to customers around the world. HempMeds® was also the first-ever company to receive historic federal government import approvals for its CBD products in the nations of Brazil, Mexico and Paraguay.\nPrior to RSHO™ products becoming registered as official medicines in Paraguay in January 2018, in May of 2016 RSHO™ became the first medical cannabis product approved and imported for use in Paraguay for compassionate use with a prescription and government permission. This event marked the third time that RSHO™ was the first cannabis product approved in a Latin American country, following the lead of Brazil and Mexico.\nAbout Medical Marijuana, Inc.\nWe are a company of firsts®. Our mission is to be the premier cannabis and hemp industry innovators, leveraging our team of professionals to source, evaluate and purchase value-added companies and products, while allowing them to keep their integrity and entrepreneurial spirit.
