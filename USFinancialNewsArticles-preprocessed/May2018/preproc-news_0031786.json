    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea, May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Hanwha Q CELLS Co., Ltd. (\"Hanwha Q CELLS\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: HQCL), a global leading photovoltaic manufacturer of high-performance, high-quality solar modules, today reported its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company will host a conference call to discuss the results at 8:00 am Eastern Time (9:00 pm Korea Standard Time) on May 14, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet revenues were $443.0 million, compared with $636.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $432.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 17.8%, compared with 8.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 13.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income was $33.1 million, compared with operating loss of $33.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and operating income of $28.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to Company's ordinary shareholders was $31.0 million, compared with net loss of $53.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and net income of $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Income per fully diluted American Depositary Share (\"ADS\" and each ADS represents 50 of the Company's ordinary shares) was $0.37, compared with loss per fully diluted ADS of $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and income per fully diluted ADS of $0.21 in the first quarter of 2017.\nMr. Seong Woo Nam, CEO of Hanwha Q CELLS, announced that the Company has \"returned to profitability\" in the first quarter of 2018 due to a \"timely shift in the geographical mix of shipments, favorable raw material price movements\" and by realizing the effects of \"shutting down unprofitable operations.\"\nMr. Joo Yoon, Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing, noted that the Company's \"first quarter shipments were in-line with the Company's guidance set forth in the Q4 earnings call.\" Mr. Yoon stated that Europe has effectively replaced the U.S. as the Company's number one market following the trade barriers placed in the U.S., and that sales in Europe are expected to pick up once the half-cell mono PERC modules gain wider acceptance. Despite the slow global sales activities in the first quarter of 2018, Mr. Yoon remained positive about the full-year outlook, stating that market demand is expected to exceed 100 GW.\nMr. Jay Seo, the Company's CFO, noted that the Company was able to fundamentally improve its profitability following its strategic decision to discontinue wafer production. Mr. Seo stated that the Company's margins improved as a result of the Company's ability to maintain solid ASPs in a period in which major input prices, including but not limited to, wafers declined. Mr. Seo also added that the Company's margin improvements were partially attributable to the elimination of one-time losses associated with the discontinuation of wafer manufacturing operations.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results of Operations\nNet Revenues\nTotal net revenues were $443.0 million, down 30.4% from $636.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and up 2.5% from $432.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross Profit and Margin\nGross profit in the first quarter of 2018 was $78.9 million, up 44.5% from $54.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and up 31.9% from $59.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.
