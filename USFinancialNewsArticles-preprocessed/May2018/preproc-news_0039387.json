    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 12:23 PM / Updated an hour ago Egypt's President Sisi pardons over 330 mostly youth prisoners Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has pardoned more than 330 people, many of them youths jailed for demonstrating in recent years. FILE PHOTO: Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi speaks during a news conference after the talks with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Cairo, Egypt December 11, 2017. REUTERS/Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool\nSisi told a youth conference in Cairo broadcasted on state television, he had asked that the interior ministry ensure the pardoned youth prisoners be released within the coming hours.\n“We signed off on more than 330 (pardoned), and I ask of the interior minister that these youth spend tonight in their home,” Sisi said.\nWednesday’s pardon will secure the release of 332 people, including two members of Egypt’s Destour Party and a number of prisoners with health problems, state-run news website Al-Ahram Gate reported.\nA full list of those pardoned was not immediately available.\nSince coming to power in 2014, Sisi has presided over a sweeping crackdown on Islamist opponents and liberal activists that rights groups say is the worst in their history.\nHe has issued pardons several times a year, including on major national holidays, often releasing students and young protesters.\nEgypt in 2013 passed a law requiring interior ministry permission for any public gathering of more than 10 people, effectively ending the mass protests that helped unseat two presidents in the span of three years beginning in 2011.\nRights groups say the suppression of dissent continues.\nA state security prosecutor on Tuesday ordered the detention of prominent political activist Shady Ghazaly Harb, who may now face terrorism charges, and a female activist who posted a video complaining of sexual harassment was detained last week.\nSisi does not have the authority to interfere in Egypt’s judicial processes but can issue pardons.
