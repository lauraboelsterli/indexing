    "text": "NEW YORK, Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (NYSE American: BRG) (\"the Company\"), an owner of highly amenitized multi-family apartment communities, announced today its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nTotal revenues grew 49% to $41.9 million for the quarter from $28.2 million in the prior year period. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was ($0.40) per share, as compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of ($0.20) per share in the prior year period. Property Net Operating Income (\"NOI\") grew 31% to $21.0 million, from $16.0 million in the prior year period. Same store Revenue and NOI increased 5.4% and 3.5% respectively, as compared to the prior year period. Adjusted funds from operations attributable to common shares and units (\"AFFO\") grew 21% to $5.6 million, from $4.6 million in the prior year period. AFFO per share is $0.18 for the quarter as compared to $0.18 in first quarter 2017. Consolidated real estate investments, at cost, increased approximately $65 million to $1.5 billion. The Company invested approximately $61 million in a 264-unit highly amenitized community and grew development mezzanine loans by approximately $22 million. Repurchased 530,693 shares of stock during the first quarter at an average price of $7.92 per share, for a total cost of approximately $4.2 million. The Company entered into a $50 million junior credit facility agreement.\n\"We had an active start to the year as we produced strong results for the first quarter, and delivered AFFO which exceeded our dividend payment,\" said Ramin Kamfar, Company Chairman and CEO. \"We also closed on the acquisition of a multi-family community for $61 million and strengthened our balance sheet as we established a $50 million junior revolving credit facility. We enter the second quarter with greater financial flexibility and capacity in pursuing our strategy of owning highly amenitized communities in targeted knowledge-economy growth markets.\"\nFinancial Results\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.4 million, compared to a net loss of $5.0 million in the prior year period. Net loss attributable to common stockholders included non-cash expenses of $18.2 million or $0.59 per share in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $13.9 million or $0.55 per share for the prior year period.\nAFFO for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to $4.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in the prior year period. AFFO was primarily impacted by growth in property NOI of $5.0 million and interest income of $3.7 million arising from significant investment activity. This was primarily offset by a year-over-year rise in interest expense of $3.0 million, general and administrative expenses of $1.9 million, and preferred stock dividends of $2.4 million.\nTotal Portfolio Performance\n$ In thousands, except average rental rates\n1Q18\n1Q17\nVariance\nTotal Revenues (1)\n$\n41,871\n$\n28,183\n48.6%\nProperty Operating Expenses\n$\n15,658\n$\n10,619\n47.5%\nNOI\n$\n21,017\n$\n16,041\n31.0%\nOperating Margin\n57.3%\n60.2%\n(290)\nbps\nOccupancy Percentage\n93.5%\n94.3%\n(80)\nbps\nAverage Rental Rate\n$\n1,227\n$\n1,254\n-2.2%\n(1) Including interest income from related parties\nFor the first quarter of 2018, property revenues increased by 37.6% compared to the same prior year period primarily attributable to the increased size of the portfolio. Total portfolio NOI was $21.0 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 31.0%, compared to the same period in the prior year.\nProperty NOI margins were 57.3% of revenue for the quarter, compared to 60.2% of revenue in the prior year quarter. Property NOI margins were impacted by the sales of stabilized assets owned for longer time periods and the recent purchase of replacement properties that have not yet achieved the same level of operational efficiency. Property operating expenses were up primarily due to the increased size of the portfolio.\nSame Store Portfolio Performance\n$ In thousands, except average rental rates\n1Q18\n1Q17\nVariance\nRevenues\n$\n20,781\n$\n19,725\n5.4%\nProperty Operating Expenses\n$\n8,594\n$\n7,946\n8.2%\nNOI\n$\n12,187\n$\n11,779\n3.5%\nOperating Margin\n58.6%\n59.7%\n(110)\nbps\nOccupancy Percentage\n93.8%\n94.0%\n(20)\nbps\nAverage Rental Rate\n$\n1,284\n$\n1,225\n4.8%\nFor the first quarter of 2018, same store NOI was $12.2 million, an increase of $408,000, or 3.5%, compared to the same period in the prior year. Same store property revenues increased by 5.4% compared to the same prior year period, primarily attributable to a 4.8% increase in average rental rates, offset by average occupancy decreasing 20 basis points to 93.8%. Same store expenses were impacted by an approximate $400,000 increase in real estate taxes due to higher valuations by municipalities and lower 2017 tax expense as a result of 2016 real estate tax true-ups recorded in the 2017 period. The Company's same store portfolio for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included 16 properties.\nFirst Quarter Acquisition Activity\nOn March 26, 2018, acquired an 88% indirect interest in a 264-unit apartment community located in Castle Rock, Colorado, known as Links at Plum Creek. The total purchase price was approximately $61.1 million, funded in part with a $40.0 million mortgage loan on the Links at Plum Creek. On March 28, 2018, increased its mezzanine loan in the Flagler Village development by $21.0 million.\nBalance Sheet\nOn March 20, 2018, the Company, through its operating partnership, entered into a $50 million credit agreement (the \"Junior Credit Facility\") with KeyBank National Association and other lenders. The Junior Credit Facility matures in March 2019, and borrowings bear interest, at the Company's option, at LIBOR plus 4.00%, or the base rate plus 3.00%.\nThe Company raised gross proceeds of approximately $18.5 million through the sale of 18,531 shares of Series B preferred stock with associated warrants at $1,000 per unit.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $31.5 million of unrestricted cash on its balance sheet, approximately $23.2 million available among its revolving credit facilities, and $1.1 billion of debt outstanding.\nDividend Details\nThe Board of Directors authorized, and the Company declared, a quarterly dividend for the first quarter of 2018 equal to a quarterly rate of $0.1625 per share on its Class A common stock, payable to the stockholders of record as of March 23, 2018, which was paid in cash on April 5, 2018. A portion of each dividend may constitute a return of capital for tax purposes. There is no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or at this rate.\nOn April 13, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized, and the Company declared, a monthly dividend of $5.00 per share of Series B preferred stock, payable to the stockholders of record as of April 25, 2018, which was paid in cash on May 4, 2018, and as of May 25, 2018, and June 25, 2018, which will be paid in cash on June 5, 2018 and July 5, 2018, respectively.\n2018 Guidance\nBased on the Company's current outlook and market conditions, the Company reiterates 2018 AFFO in the range of $0.65 to $0.70 per share. For additional guidance details, please see page 28 of Company's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Supplement available under Investor Relations on the Company's website ( www.bluerockresidential.com ). Subsequent to issuing 2018 guidance in February 2018, the Company revised its presentation of AFFO attributable to common stockholders to reflect AFFO attributable to common shares and units. The estimated weighted average diluted shares and units outstanding used to calculate AFFO per share now includes noncontrolling interests â€“ operating partnership units. As the Company's presentation now also includes the impact of AFFO attributable to operating partnership units, and as shares and units are treated on a one-for-one basis, there is no change to projected AFFO per share for purposes of 2018 AFFO guidance.\nConference Call\nAll interested parties can listen to the live conference call at 11:00 AM ET on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 by dialing +1 (866) 843-0890 within the U.S., or +1 (412) 317-6597, and requesting the \"Bluerock Residential Conference.\"\nFor those who are not available to listen to the live call, the conference call will be available for replay on the Company's website two hours after the call concludes, and will remain available until June 8, 2018 at http://services.choruscall.com/links/brg180508.html, as well as by dialing +1 (877) 344-7529 in the U.S., or +1 (412) 317-0088 internationally, and requesting conference number 10119871.\nThe full text of this Earnings Release and additional Supplemental Information is available in the Investor Relations section on the Company's website at http://www.bluerockresidential.com .\nAbout Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc.\nBluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc.

Our definition and calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those of other REITs, and may, therefore, not be comparable.\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nFunds from operations attributable to common shares and units (\"FFO\") is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. We define FFO, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or (\"NAREIT's\") definition, as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.\nIn addition to FFO, we use adjusted funds from operations attributable to common shares and units (\"AFFO\"). AFFO is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company's operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations. To calculate AFFO, we further adjust FFO by adding back certain items that are not added to net income in NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as acquisition and pursuit costs, equity based compensation expenses, and any other non-recurring or non-cash expenses, which are costs that do not relate to the operating performance of our properties, and subtracting recurring capital expenditures (and when calculating the quarterly incentive fee paid to our former Manager only, we further adjusted FFO to include any realized gains or losses on our real estate investments).\nOur calculation of AFFO differs from the methodology used for calculating AFFO by certain other REITs and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs. Our management utilizes FFO and AFFO as measures of our operating performance after adjustment for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization expenses, and acquisition and pursuit costs that are required by GAAP to be expensed but may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance and that may not accurately compare our operating performance between periods. Furthermore, although FFO, AFFO and other supplemental performance measures are defined in various ways throughout the REIT industry, we also believe that FFO and AFFO may provide us and our stockholders with an additional useful measure to compare our financial performance to certain other REITs. We also used AFFO for purposes of determining the quarterly incentive fee paid to our former Manager in prior periods.\nNeither FFO nor AFFO is equivalent to net income, including net income attributable to common stockholders, or cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, FFO and AFFO do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Neither FFO nor AFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income, including net income attributable to common stockholders, as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\nWe have acquired interests in eleven additional operating properties and sold three properties subsequent to March 31, 2017. Therefore, the results presented in the table below are not directly comparable and should not be considered an indication of our future operating performance.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet loss attributable to common shares\n$\n(9,425)\n$\n(4,990)\nAdd back: Net loss attributable to operating partnership units\n(2,675)\n(56)\nNet loss attributable to common shares and units\n(12,100)\n(5,046)\nCommon stockholders and operating partnership units pro-rata share of:\nReal estate depreciation and amortization (1)\n14,831\n9,914\nGain on sale of real estate investments\nâ€”\n(7,481)\nFFO Attributable to Common Shares and Units\n2,731\n(2,613)\nCommon stockholders and operating partnership units pro-rata share of:\nAmortization of non-cash interest expense\n461\n478\nAcquisition and pursuit costs\n43\n3,040\nManagement internalization\nâ€”\n481\nNon-real estate depreciation and amortization\n64\nâ€”\nWeather-related losses, net\n165\nâ€”\nNon-cash preferred returns and equity in income of unconsolidated real estate joint\nventures\n(231)\nâ€”\nNormally recurring capital expenditures\n(517)\n(294)\nPreferred stock accretion\n1,112\n338\nNon-cash equity compensation\n1,780\n3,201\nAFFO Attributable to Common Shares and Units\n$\n5,608\n$\n4,631\nWeighted average common shares and units outstanding - diluted\n30,995,775\n25,273,480\nPER SHARE INFORMATION:\nFFO Attributable to Common Shares and Units - diluted\n$\n0.09\n$\n(0.10)\nAFFO Attributable to Common Shares and Units - diluted\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.18\n(1) The real estate depreciation and amortization amount includes our share of consolidated real estate-related depreciation and amortization of\nintangibles, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests â€“ partially owned properties, and our similar estimated share of unconsolidated\ndepreciation and amortization, which is included in earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint venture investments.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (\"EBITDAre\")\nNAREIT defines earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate (\"EBITDAre\") (September 2017 White Paper) as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and further adjusted for gains and losses from sales of depreciated operating properties, and impairment write-downs of depreciated operating properties.\nWe consider EBITDAre to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it eliminates depreciation, income taxes, interest and non-recurring items, which permits investors to view income from operations unobscured by non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, the cost of debt or non-recurring items.\nAdjusted EBITDAre represents EBITDAre further adjusted for non-comparable items and it is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as income tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and other fixed charges.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are not recognized measurements under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nBelow is a reconciliation of net loss attributable to common stockholders to EBITDAre (unaudited and dollars in thousands).\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders\n$\n(9,425)\n$\n(4,990)\nNet (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(2,890)\n8,729\nPreferred stock dividends\n8,248\n5,851\nPreferred stock accretion\n1,112\n338\nInterest expense, net\n10,117\n7,118\nDepreciation and amortization\n15,576\n10,944\nGain on sale of real estate investments\n-\n(16,466)\nEBITDAre\n$\n22,738\n$\n11,524\nAcquisition and pursuit costs\n43\n3,182\nManagement internalization\n-\n481\nNon-real estate depreciation and amortization\n64\n-\nWeather-related losses, net\n168\n-\nNon-cash equity compensation\n1,780\n3,201\nNon-cash preferred returns and equity in income of unconsolidated real estate joint\nventures\n(231)\n-\nAdjusted EBITDAre\n$\n24,562\n$\n18,388\nRecurring Capital Expenditures\nWe define recurring capital expenditures as expenditures that are incurred at every property and exclude development, investment, revenue enhancing and non-recurring capital expenditures.\nNon-Recurring Capital Expenditures\nWe define non-recurring capital expenditures as expenditures for significant projects that upgrade units or common areas and projects that are revenue enhancing.\nSame Store Properties\nSame store properties are conventional multifamily residential apartments which were owned and operational for the entire periods presented, including each comparative period.\nProperty Net Operating Income (\"Property NOI\")\nWe believe that net operating income, or NOI, is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and interest. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. We believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income. We use NOI to evaluate our performance on a same store and non-same store basis because NOI measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance and captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance.\nCertain amounts in prior periods, related to tenant reimbursements for utility expenses amounting to $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, have been reclassified to other property revenues from property operating expenses, to conform to the current period. In addition, property management fees have been reclassified from property operating expenses.\nThe following table reflects net loss attributable to common stockholders together with a reconciliation to NOI and to same store and non-same store contributions to consolidated NOI, as computed in accordance with GAAP for the periods presented (unaudited and amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended (1)\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet loss attributable to common shares\n$ (9,425)\n$ (4,990)\nAdd back: Net loss attributable to operating partnership units\n(2,675)\n(56)\nNet loss attributable to common shares and units\n(12,100)\n(5,046)\nAdd Common stockholders and operating partnership units pro-rata share of:\nDepreciation and amortization\n14,831\n9,914\nNon-real estate depreciation and amortization\n64\n-\nAmortization of non-cash interest expense\n461\n478\nProperty management fees\n939\n649\nManagement fees\n-\n2,768\nAcquisition and pursuit costs\n43\n3,040\nCorporate operating expenses\n4,669\n1,449\nManagement internalization\n-\n481\nWeather-related losses, net\n165\n-\nPreferred dividends\n8,248\n5,851\nPreferred stock accretion\n1,112\n338\nLess Common stockholders and operating partnership units pro-rata share of:\nPreferred returns and equity in income of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures\n2,461\n2,572\nInterest income from related parties\n5,196\n1,523\nGain on sale of real estate investments\n-\n7,481\nPro-rata share of properties' income\n10,775\n8,346\nAdd:\nNoncontrolling interest pro-rata share of partially owned property income\n607\n1,086\nTotal property income\n11,382\n9,432\nAdd:\nInterest expense\n9,635\n6,609\nNet operating income\n21,017\n16,041\nLess:\nNon-same store net operating income\n8,830\n4,262\nSame store net operating income\n$ 12,187\n$ 11,779\n(1) Same Store sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 related to the following properties: Enders Place at Baldwin Park, ARIUM Grandewood, Park & Kingston, ARIUM Palms, Ashton Reserve, Sovereign, Sorrel, ARIUM at Palmer Ranch, ARIUM Gulfshore, The Preserve at Henderson Beach, ARIUM Westside, ARIUM Pine Lakes, James on South First, ARIUM Glenridge, Roswell City Walk, and The Brodie.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluerock-residential-growth-reit-announces-first-quarter-2018-results-300644416.html\nSOURCE Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc.",
