    "text": "BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Juan Martin del Porto has suffered a groin strain and is a doubt for the French Open, the Argentine world number six said on Friday.\nFILE PHOTO: Mar 27, 2018; Key Biscayne, FL, USA; Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina hits a forehand against Filip Krajinovic of Serbia (not pictured) on day eight of the Miami Open at Tennis Center at Crandon Park. Del Potro won 6-4, 6-2. Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports via REUTERS Del Porto was forced to pull out of the Italian Open in Rome on Thursday after feeling a pain in his left groin. At the time, the 2009 U.S. Open champion was 2-6 5-4 down in his last 16 encounter to Belgian David Goffin.\n“After the medical examinations today, it has been determined that I have suffered a groin strain (grade 1) in Rome,” the 29-year-old Del Potro said on his verified Twitter account.\n“I have started to do rehab and will evaluate the situation in the upcoming days to decide whether I can play the French Open.”\nThe injury comes at a bad time for Del Potro, who has started the season well with tournament wins in Acapulco and Indian Wells. The French Open starts on May 27 in Paris.\nReporting by Ramiro Scandalo; Writing by Andrew Downie; Editing by John O'Brien\n ",
