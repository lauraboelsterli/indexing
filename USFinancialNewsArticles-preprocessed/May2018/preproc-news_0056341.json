    "text": "Justices allow Arkansas to enforce abortion restrictions The Supreme Court is allowing Arkansas to put in effect restrictions on how abortion pills are administered. Critics say the law could effectively end medication abortions in the state. The law says doctors who provide abortion pills must hold a contract with another physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital and who would agree to handle complications. Published 2 Hours Ago The Associated Press Getty Images Protesters on both sides of the abortion issue rally in front of the U.S. Supreme Court building June 20, 2016 in Washington, DC.\nThe Supreme Court is allowing Arkansas to put in effect restrictions on how abortion pills are administered. Critics of a challenged state law say it could effectively end medication abortions in the state.\nThe justices on Tuesday rejected an appeal from the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Arkansas that asked the court to review an appeals court ruling and reinstate a lower court order that had blocked the law from taking effect. The law says doctors who provide abortion pills must hold a contract with another physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital and who would agree to handle complications.\nThe law is similar to a provision in Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016.
