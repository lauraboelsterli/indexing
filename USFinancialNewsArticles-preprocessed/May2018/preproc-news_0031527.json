    "text": "SYDNEY, May 15 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean futures rose on Tuesday, extending two-day gains to more than 2 percent, as fears of dampened Chinese demand for North American supplies eased, though gains were checked as planting progress exceeded market forecasts. FUNDAMENTALS * The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade were up 0.6 percent at $10.24-1/4 a bushel by 0220 GMT, having firmed 1.5 percent on Monday. * The most active corn futures were up 0.8 percent at $3.99-3/4 a bushel, having closed unchanged in the previous session. * The most active wheat futures were up 0.9 percent at $4.95-3/4 a bushel, having closed down 1.5 percent on Monday. * The USDA said 62 percent of the corn crop was planted as of Sunday, surpassing market expectations. * The USDA said 35 percent of the soybean crop was planted as of Sunday, exceeding market forecasts. * The USDA said 36 percent of the U.S. wheat crop is in good to excellent condition, beating market forecasts. * The USDA said on Monday 688,195 tonnes have been inspected for export, much of which is destined for China, exceeding market forecasts. * Some traders have taken comfort from U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge on Sunday to help Chinese technology company ZTE Corp as a sign of an attempt to ease trade tensions between the two countries. * However, sources said China was willing in-principle to import more U.S. agriculture products in return for Washington smoothing out penalties against ZTE, but they did not offer details. MARKET NEWS * The dollar inched higher against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, having pulled up from its lowest level in more than a week as hopes for easing global trade tensions pushed U.S. bond yields higher. * Oil prices held firm on Tuesday as ongoing production cuts by OPEC and looming U.S. sanctions against Iran tightened the market amid strong demand. * Wall Street ended a choppy session slightly higher on Monday as weakness in defensive stocks offset optimism following U.S. President Donald Trump's conciliatory remarks toward China's ZTE Corp that calmed the waters of U.S.-China trade tensions.
