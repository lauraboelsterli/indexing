REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\nThis year’s clay-court slam will award prize money totalling 39.20 million euros (34.33 million pounds). That trumps the Australian Open and Wimbledon, though it will almost certainly be knocked off the top spot by the U.S. Open.\nIn a year in which Swiss great Roger Federer said he was “bored” with having to push the Grand Slams to increase the levels of prize money, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) is increasing its overall pot by 8 percent on 2017.\nFirst round losers will see the biggest rise of 14.3 percent and take home 40,000 euros. Winners of the men’s and women’s singles tournaments will each receive a cheque for 2.2 million euros - just shy of a five percent increase.\nNonetheless, the FFT acknowledges it will be difficult in what is a gruelling wage battle to maintain the near double-digit increases in the coming years.\nThe modernisation of Roland Garros, including a new centre court with retractable roof, will cost up to 400 million euros, according to Le Monde, financed by the federation itself.

But it is on prize money where rivalries are perhaps the hardest fought.\nAs the smallest of the four Grand Slam venues, Roland Garros has the lowest attendance and generates the least revenue. A decade-long stalemate over expansion plans have left it trailing its peers.\nIn 2015, the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadows pipped Wimbledon as the most lucrative Grand Slam event, with the French Open trailing a distant fourth.\nHowever, Britain’s vote in 2016 to exit the European Union battered the pound, and wiped some 12 percent off the grass-court tournament’s prize money in U.S. dollar terms.\nTwo years on, the pound remains under pressure and it is Wimbledon that now trails the French Open, and almost certainly the U.S. Open, in the wage race.\nAustralian Open prize money rose by 10 percent this year to A$55 million (31.17 million pounds), while Wimbledon, the oldest Grand Slam, has a prize fund of 34 million pounds for 2018, up 7.6 percent from last year.\nThe U.S. Open, the final Grand Slam of the year starting in August, has yet to announce its prize money. Last year it became the first tennis tournament to top $50 million (37.56 million pounds) following a nine percent rise in the total purse.\nThe All England Lawn Tennis Club, which runs Wimbledon, said in an emailed statement: “The value of sterling has always been one of the factors we take into account when setting prize money and this year is no different.\n“We feel this year’s offering reflects our competitive positioning.” Reporting by Richard Lough; additional reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris",
