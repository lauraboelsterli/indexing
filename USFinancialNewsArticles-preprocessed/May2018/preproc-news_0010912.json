May 1, 2018; Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Washington Capitals right wing Tom Wilson (43) moves the puck ahead of Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby (87) during the first period in game three of the second round of the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs at PPG PAINTS Arena. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\nWilson delivered the hit midway through the second period, connecting with Aston-Reese’s head and leaving the Penguins forward with a broken jaw and concussion that will keep him out of the remainder of the playoffs.\nWilson was not penalized during the game, but received the punishment after a hearing.\nWashington leads the best-of-seven series 2-1 with Game Four set for Thursday in Pittsburgh.
