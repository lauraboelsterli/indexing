    "text": "PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A bomb blast ripped through a bus terminal in a Pakistani region bordering Afghanistan on Friday, killing one policeman and wounding 13, officials said, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility.\nThe device, apparently rigged to a motorcycle, exploded when a police patrol passed by the bus terminal in the northwestern city of Kohat, said police official Nauman Khan.\nPolice were investigating whether it was a remote controlled or a timed device, he added.\nFive of the 13 wounded were in critical condition, said Ahsan Khan, an official at a district hospital.\nKohat is on the edge of Pakistan’s lawless tribal regions along the Afghan border, which have long been home to domestic and foreign Islamist militants.\nPakistan has launched several military operations there, disrupting the militants’ infrastructure and networks and substantially reducing violence, although the militants remain potent enough to launch attacks.\nReporting by Jibran Ahmad; Writing by Asif Shahzad\n ",
