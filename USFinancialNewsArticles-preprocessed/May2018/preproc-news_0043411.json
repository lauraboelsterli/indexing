    "text": "16 COMMENTS Denise Morrison was the biggest champion of Campbell Soup Co.’s CPB -1.12% yearslong push into fresh and refrigerated foods, telling investors earlier this year that management was urgently pressing to transform Campbell into a health-oriented snacking company.\nMs. Morrison’s abrupt departure on Friday as U.S. soup sales and Campbell’s fresh-food business falter suggests that the strategy flopped.\nThe company needs a new plan , analysts and industry executives say. Campbell could stay the course and try to build on the fresh-food business Ms. Morrison assembled over the past six years. Or it could spin off the fresh business and sell off older brands like V8 juice and SpaghettiOs, to focus on reviving its core soup business . It could also merge with a bigger food company to help it cut costs and widen its reach.\n“Everything is on the table,” said interim chief and board member Keith McLoughlin on a conference call Friday. He said Campbell would conduct a strategic review of its brands and would discuss the details in late August. During an all-employee meeting Friday, Mr. McLoughlin said that as a public company, Campbell was for sale every day, but that his strategy was not to sell the company, according to a person who was there.\nRepresentatives for Campbell declined to provide details of their potential strategic direction or make Ms. Morrison available for comment.\n“It’s clear given the market dynamics and how they’ve performed that something has to be done,” said Thomas Davenport, an investment banker at Sikich, an investment bank and advisory firm. “First, they need to figure out first who is going to lead the charge, and then ask ‘what are we charging after?’”\nThe uncertainty, as well its resulting drop in stock price, with shares down 29% this year, could make Campbell an acquisition target for larger packaged-food rivals.\nSome analysts and bankers have pointed to Kraft Heinz Co. as a potential suitor as pressures in the canned- and packaged-food industry have made consolidation a necessity in recent years. Kraft Foods Group Inc. experienced vulnerability back in December 2014 when its chief stepped down suddenly. A few months later it struck a deal with H.J. Heinz Co. Kraft Heinz declined to comment.\nTrouble with Big Food—namely, Campbell, Kellogg Co., Mondelez International Inc. and more—has been mounting for years, as slower sales led companies to slash spending and close factories in North America. Campbell said in January it would close a Toronto soup plant because of weak demand in the U.S. Before that, Ms. Morrison had closed several other factories since she became chief in 2011, eliminating thousands of jobs.\nCampbell’s challenges are similar to those burdening the rest of the industry, which has faced the proliferation of niche, smaller brands and private-label products that have been chipping away at shelf space long dominated by Big Food.\nCampbell hasn’t been the only company to pay a high price to acquire a small but growing brand— like its recent $700 million acquisition of organic-soup maker Pacific Foods . Its peers have made similar bets while they simultaneously try to stabilize their core business, whether that is soup, cereal or soda. Some companies have turned to bigger deals to help them survive. By pairing up like Kraft and Heinz did in 2015, companies can eliminate costs and boost profit margins.\nTo cut it on its own, Campbell may need to undo a lot of what it has done in the past few years, analysts said.\nDenise Morrison, who became chief in 2011, later persuaded a skeptical board of directors to approve a $1.55 billion acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, a seller of baby carrots and refrigerated juices. Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg News Ms. Morrison’s decision to focus on building a fresh-food business at the expense of profit margin dates to the beginning of her tenure, when she persuaded a skeptical board in 2012 to approve a $1.55 billion acquisition of Bolthouse Farms , a seller of baby carrots and refrigerated juices. Since then, Campbell’s management team touted its refrigerated juices and salad dressings as its foothold in the faster-growing part of the grocery store. But it has been a consistent drag on earnings.\n“Campbell’s has put an amazing amount of effort and time into getting the supply chain right [in its fresh business], and it just feels like we just keep hearing problems,” Citigroup analyst David Driscoll said Friday.\nIn December, Campbell diverged from its plan to further expand in fresh foods when Ms. Morrison orchestrated the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance pretzels and nuts for $6.1 billion , including debt, Campbell’s largest purchase ever. She started talking about the company becoming a snacking giant in general, no longer narrowly eyeing fresh, refrigerated foods.\nPivoting the Portfolio Denise Morrison, 64, was named Campbell Soup CEO in 2011, and she led the acquisition of several brands to expand the company's offerings for customers.

Snacks now make up more than 40% of Campbell’s sales.\nBut the focus on snacks and fresh may have kept Campbell from successfully reviving its U.S. soup business, which it pioneered in the early years of the company’s formation. Campbell’s 150-year history—and the continued involvement of heirs of its founders—set it apart from its peers in the industry.\nDeals might be tougher with family members maintaining significant ownership of the company and positions on the board. Since the company was formed, Campbell has remained largely a family business, with descendants of Arthur Dorrance, who joined Campbell in 1882 and was a key player in the creation of the canned-soup business. They are still involved in overall decisions.\nThey allowed Campbell’s to broaden its reach beyond soup, buying V8 vegetable juices in 1948 and Pepperidge Farm cookies in 1961. Campbell expanded Pepperidge Farm from fewer than 60 items to nearly 600, such as different flavors of Goldfish crackers. Campbell also started coming out with dozens of new soup flavors and various formats like soups in sipping cups and pouches, hoping to revive sales.\nBut Phil Kafarakis, president of the Specialty Food Association and a packaged-food industry veteran, said Campbell’s leaders seem to have “lost their way.”\nSelling older brands that have been a drag on sales and setting the fresh business aside should be priorities of the new management team, he said. “They are going to be forced to decide whether to sell brands and what business they are going to be.”\nCorrections & Amplifications\nKeith McLoughlin is interim chief executive of Campbell Soup Co.
