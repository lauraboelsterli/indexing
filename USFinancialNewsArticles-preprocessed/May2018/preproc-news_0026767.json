    "text": "May 12, 2018 / 10:21 AM / Updated an hour ago Neymar hints at PSG stay after social media picture post Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nPARIS (Reuters) - Brazil forward Neymar posted a picture of himself wearing the 2018-19 Paris St Germain home shirt on Saturday amid growing speculation that he could leave the French champions at the end of the season. Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - Paris St Germain vs RC Strasbourg - Parc des Princes, Paris, France - February 17, 2018 Paris Saint-Germain’s Neymar during the match REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n“Proud to wear the new jersey and to continue giving you joy,” the 26-year-old striker, who is recovering from foot surgery, posted on his verified Twitter account.\nMedia reports claim that Neymar, who joined the Ligue 1 club from Barcelona for a world record 222 million euros (195.80 million pounds) last August, has told PSG directors he wanted to leave the club after only one season.\nThe most recent articles say the Brazilian wants to move to Spanish giants Real Madrid, who originally tried to sign him in 2013 before he opted to join Barcelona from Santos.\nSpanish newspaper Marca reported on Friday that the player’s father and agent, Neymar Sr, had told PSG his son wanted to leave immediately.\nIt said his father met Real directors in December on the day Cristiano Ronaldo received the Ballon d’Or in Paris.\nNeymar has been out of action since spraining his ankle and fracturing his fifth metatarsal on Feb. 25, which led him to undergo surgery in Brazil as he bids to regain fitness in time for the June-July World Cup in Russia.
