(NYSE: NRE) (\"NorthStar Realty Europe\" or \"NRE\"), a European office REIT, today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nU.S. GAAP net loss to common stockholders: $(1.3) million, or $(0.02) per diluted share for the first quarter 2018. U.S. GAAP total equity was $621.2 million, or $11.31 per diluted share as of March 31, 2018 Cash available for distribution (\"CAD\"): $12.7 million, or $0.23 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 EPRA 1 net asset value (\"NAV\"): $20.50 per share as of March 31, 2018 Same store year-over-year net operating income (\"NOI\") increased by $1.5 million, or 6.3%, and same store quarter-over-quarter NOI increased by $1.4 million, or 5.8% In March 2018, NRE repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $13.4 million. Subsequent to the first quarter, through May 7, 2018, NRE repurchased an additional 2.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $32.9 million Subsequent to the first quarter, NRE completed its exit from the Netherlands with the disposal of the Maastoren tower releasing approximately $60 million of net proceeds Cash dividend of $0.15 per share declared for the first quarter 2018\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nDuring the first quarter 2018, U.S. GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(1.3) million, Adjusted EBITDA was $18.1 million and CAD was $12.7 million. NOI was $27.0 million and same store NOI was $26.1 million during the first quarter 2018.

NRE believes these metrics can be a useful measure of its performance which is further defined below.\nCash Available for Distribution\nWe believe that CAD provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance. We also believe that CAD is useful because it adjusts for a variety of items that are consistent with presenting a measure of operating performance (such as transaction costs, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, realized gain (loss) on sales and other, asset impairment and non-recurring bad debt expense). We adjust for transaction costs because these costs are not a meaningful indicator of our operating performance. For instance, these transaction costs include costs such as professional fees associated with new investments, which are expenses related to specific transactions. Management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes CAD as one of several metrics it reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders. The definition of CAD may be adjusted from time to time for our reporting purposes in our discretion, acting through our audit committee or otherwise. CAD may fluctuate from period to period based upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and amount of investments, new leases, repayments and asset sales, capital raised, use of leverage, changes in the expected yield of investments and the overall conditions in commercial real estate and the economy generally.\nWe calculate CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-controlling interests and the following items: depreciation and amortization items including straight-line rental income or expense (excluding amortization of rent free periods), amortization of above/below market leases, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of discount on financings and other and equity-based compensation; unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and other; realized gain (loss) on sales and other (excluding any realized gain (loss) on the settlement on foreign currency derivatives); impairment on depreciable property; acquisition gains or losses; transaction costs; foreign currency gains (losses) related to sales; impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets; the incentive fee relating to the Amended and Restated Management Agreement 6 and one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain other non-recurring items. These items, if applicable, include any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nCAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating CAD involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to CAD for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss) attributable to common\nstockholders\n$\n(1,281)\n$\n(15,350)\nNon-controlling interests\n4\n(176)\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization items (1)(2)\n13,160\n29,571\nUnrealized (gain) loss on derivatives and other\n1,189\n941\nRealized (gain) loss on sales and other (3)(4)\n(868)\n(4,153)\nTransaction costs and other (5)(6)\n481\n1,175\nCAD\n$\n12,685\n$\n12,008\nCAD per share (7)\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.22\n(1) Three months ended March 31, 2018 represents an adjustment to exclude depreciation and amortization of $11.7 million, amortization expense of capitalized above/below market leases of $0.2 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.7 million and amortization of equity-based compensation of $0.6 million.\n(2) Three months ended March 31, 2017 represents an adjustment to exclude depreciation and amortization of $12.6 million, amortization of above/below market leases of $0.3 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.9 million and amortization of equity-based compensation of $15.9 million.\n(3) Three months ended March 31, 2018 CAD includes a $1.4 million net loss related to the settlement of foreign currency derivatives.\n(4) Three months ended March 31, 2017 CAD includes a $0.8 million net gain related to the settlement of foreign currency derivatives.\n(5) Three months ended March 31, 2018 represents an adjustment to exclude $0.5 million of transaction costs.\n(6) Three months ended March 31, 2017 represents an adjustment to exclude $0.3 million of transaction costs and $0.9 million of payroll taxes associated with the acceleration of equity awards due to the tri-party merger completed on January 10, 2017.\n(7) CAD per share is based on 55.8 million weighted average shares (common shares outstanding including operating partnership units and RSUs not subject to performance hurdles) for the the three months ended March 31, 2018. Based on 55.7 million weighted average shares (common shares outstanding, including LTIPs and RSUs not subject to performance hurdles) for the three months ended March 31, 2017. CAD per share does not take into account any potential dilution from restricted stock units subject to performance metrics not currently achieved.\nNet Operating Income\nWe believe NOI is a useful metric for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate portfolio in the aggregate. Portfolio results and performance metrics represent 100% for all consolidated investments. Net operating income represents total property and related revenues, adjusted for: (i) amortization of above/below market leases; (ii) straight-line rent (except with respect to rent free period); (iii) other items such as adjustments related to joint ventures and non-recurring bad debt expense and less property operating expenses. However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, transaction costs, depreciation and amortization expense, realized gains (losses) on sales and other and other items under U.S. GAAP and capital expenditures and leasing costs, all of which may be significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating NOI involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of NOI of our real estate equity and preferred equity segments to property and other related revenues less property operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nRental income\n$\n27,224\n$\n25,536\nEscalation income\n5,341\n5,161\nOther income\n278\n29\nTotal property and other income\n32,843\n30,726\nProperties - operating expenses\n6,802\n7,322\nAdjustments:\nInterest income\n729\n窶能nAmortization and other items (1)(2)\n220\n280\nNOI (3)\n$\n26,990\n$\n23,684\n(1) Three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily excludes $0.2 million of amortization of above/below market leases.\n(2) Three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily excludes $0.3 million of amortization of above/below market leases.\n(3) The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI of our real estate equity segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(1,277)\n$\n(15,526)\nRemaining segments (i)\n9,737\n22,844\nReal estate equity and preferred equity segment adjustments:\nInterest expense\n5,955\n6,119\nOther expenses\n1,424\n2,000\nDepreciation and amortization\n11,651\n12,563\nUnrealized (gain) loss on derivatives and other\n117\n(331)\nRealized (gain) loss on sales and other\n(1,214)\n(4,156)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n39\n(273)\nOther items\n558\n444\nTotal adjustments\n18,530\n16,366\nNOI\n$\n26,990\n$\n23,684\n(i) Represents the net (income) loss in our corporate segment to reconcile to net operating income.\nSame store Net Operating Income\nWe believe same store NOI is a useful metric for evaluating the operating performance as it reflects the operating performance of the real estate portfolio and provides a better measure of operational performance for a quarter-over-quarter comparison. Same store net operating income is presented for the same store portfolio, which represents all properties that were owned by us at the end of the reporting period. We define same store net operating income as NOI excluding (i) properties that were acquired or sold during the period, (ii) impact of foreign currency changes and (iii) amortization of above/below market leases. We consider same store NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure. Same store NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating same store net operating income involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. Same store portfolio is defined as properties in operation throughout the full periods presented under the comparison, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, and included 25 properties.\nThe following table presents our same store analysis for the real estate equity segment which represents 25 properties (323,458 rentable square meters) and excludes properties that were acquired or sold at any time during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nIncrease (Decrease)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017 (1)\nAmount\n%\nOccupancy (end of period)\n85.5%\n86.1%\nSame store\nRental income (2)\n$\n27,360\n$\n27,176\n$\n184\n0.7%\nEscalation income\n5,243\n5,372\n(129)\nOther income\n242\n555\n(313)\nTotal revenues\n32,845\n33,103\n(258)\n(0.8)%\nUtilities\n1,467\n1,657\n(190)\nReal estate taxes and insurance\n1,317\n1,263\n54\nManagement fees\n534\n536\n(2)\nRepairs and maintenance\n2,454\n2,567\n(113)\nOther (2)(3)\n943\n2,392\n(1,449)\nProperties - operating expenses\n6,715\n8,415\n(1,700)\n(20.2)%\nSame store NOI\n$\n26,130\n$\n24,688\n$\n1,442\n5.8%\nSame store NOI excl.
