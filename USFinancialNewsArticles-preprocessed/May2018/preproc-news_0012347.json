    "text": "CONCORD, Mass., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Technical Communications Corporation (Nasdaq:TCCO) today announced its results for the three and six month periods ended March 31, 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of $(313,000), or $(0.17) per share, on revenue of $930,000, compared to net income of $128,000, or $0.07 per share, on revenue of $1,385,000 for the quarter ended April 1, 2017. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of $(365,000), or $(0.20) per share, on revenue of $2,046,000, compared to a net loss of $(567,000), or $(0.31) per share, on revenue of $2,017,000 for the six months ended April 1, 2017.\nCommenting on corporate performance, Carl H. Guild, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of TCC, said, “During the Company’s second quarter ended March 31, 2018, we did not achieve our desired financial performance for fiscal 2018. Several international opportunities have made significant progress but have not yet closed due to delays in the evaluation and procurement process. TCC’s products go through rigorous field and laboratory testing, which ensures that all customer requirements are met prior to procurement. We expect that some customer evaluations will be completed during the next quarter, thereby allowing associated procurements to proceed.”\n“TCC is committed to returning to profitability over the remainder of fiscal 2018. We continue to closely monitor and reduce operating expenses as appropriate, while strategically investing in business development efforts, developing productive relationships and expanding our sales channel network.”\nAbout Technical Communications Corporation\nFor over 50 years, TCC has specialized in superior-grade secure communications systems and customized solutions, supporting our CipherONE ® best-in-class criteria, to protect highly sensitive voice, data and video transmitted over a wide range of networks.
