    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 12:16 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago Bulgaria charges two Corpbank supervisors with mismanagement Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nSOFIA, May 11 (Reuters) - Bulgarian prosecutors have charged two supervisors of bankrupt Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) with alleged deliberate mismanagement, the Sofia City Court said on Friday.\nThe court said Elena Kostadincheva and Stanislav Lyutov were charged with alleged intentional failure to properly manage and protect the property in their care between August 20 and November 6 2014, which resulted in a loss of more than 1 million levs ($610,649.73) to the Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund.\nKostadincheva and Lyutov were not immediately available for comment.\nThe two were “conservators” of Corpbank, who were appointed by the central bank to supervise Corbank, with the right to inspect all its operations.\nCorpbank went bankrupt in 2014 after a run on deposits and an international audit showing two thirds of its assets had to be written off due to major failings in the way the bank was run. This triggered the biggest banking crisis in the European Union member country since the 1990s.\nLast year, Bulgarian prosecutors said they had indicted the main shareholder of Corpbank Tsvetan Vassilev, two former deputy central bank governors and others over the demise of the Balkan country’s fourth largest lender.\nVassilev has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and blamed Corpbank’s collapse on a plot hatched by business rivals.\nThe collapse badly hurt confidence in the banking system and its regulation, prompting the central bank, under a new governor, to tighten supervision rules and carry out an asset quality review of all lenders. $1 = 1.6376 leva Reporting by Angel Krasimirov.
