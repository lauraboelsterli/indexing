    "text": "80 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The White House will send a proposal to the House Tuesday to cut federal spending by $15 billion, roughly half of which would come from the Children’s Health Insurance Program, a senior administration official said Monday.\nMuch of the so-called rescissions to be requested by President Donald Trump involve money that was authorized by Congress but not spent, the official said, arguing that those “unobligated balances” should go back to the Treasury.\nThe plan is a shift from earlier discussions about rescinding funds that had been approved as part of a sweeping, $1.3 trillion spending bill enacted in March. This proposal would instead seek to rescind funds that had been authorized in previous fiscal years, but not spent.\nThe official said Mr. Trump plans to propose rescinding money from the March deal in a future proposal, the official said. Mr. Trump had threatened to veto the March spending measure but decided to sign it and avoid shutting down the government . The senior administration official said Monday the rescissions proposal headed for Capitol Hill Tuesday would be the first in a series of proposals to cut funding.\nThe most controversial element of the proposal coming Tuesday is likely to be $7 billion in proposed cuts to the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which enjoys strong, bipartisan support. The federal-state program provides health coverage to more than eight million low-income, uninsured children whose family incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid.\nThe White House proposal would rescind $7 billion from that program, of which $5 billion would come from funds where the authority to spend them has expired. An additional $2 billion would come from a contingency fund that isn’t projected to be tapped by states, the senior administration official said.\nThe White House said it believed the cuts wouldn’t affect the insurance program’s operations, but Democrats didn’t agree.\nDemocrats said that the contingency funds were necessary in case CHIP enrollment were to surge unexpectedly and the program, whose funding isn’t open ended, suddenly needed more money.\n“President Trump and Republicans in Congress are looking to tear apart the bipartisan Children’s Health Insurance Program, hurting middle-class families and low-income children, to appease the most-conservative special interests and feel better about blowing up the deficit to give the wealthiest few and biggest corporations huge tax breaks,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said in a statement.\nUnder the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, Mr. Trump will be able to temporarily freeze funding for 45 days, but can’t rescind it on his own unless Congress agrees.\nHis proposal will head first to the House. Once drafted into a bill, the rescissions package can be considered under an expedited process and would only need a simple majority to pass both chambers. Most bills need 60 votes to pass the Senate, where Republicans hold only 51 of the chamber’s 100 seats. Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who was diagnosed with brain cancer last year, has been recuperating at home since December.\nSenate Republicans said they were more optimistic the new rescissions proposal could pass the Senate, since the White House isn’t currently seeking to roll back the spending bill, which was negotiated by the top congressional leaders from both parties. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) had said he wasn’t interested in reversing spending that had been previously agreed to and signed into law.\n“My understanding is it doesn’t attempt to repeal anything that was part of the agreed-to package, so I think it has a better chance, taking that approach,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R., Texas) said Monday.\nCongress isn’t required to take action in response to Mr. Trump’s proposal of spending cuts. If lawmakers haven’t taken any action, the funding would remain intact, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nThe White House also will propose cutting funds that were previously authorized for two technology loan programs.\nIn addition, the administration is hoping to roll back funds set aside for responding to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, now declared over, for a railroad unemployment-insurance-benefits program that expired and for Hurricane Sandy-related emergency watershed programs. Hurricane Sandy was the most-destructive storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. An administration official said the federal Sandy funds were designed to match local funds, which never materialized.\nSome lawmakers doubted that rolling back funds that haven’t been spent wouldn’t affect agencies.\n“As a general rule, once Congress has agreed to appropriate funds, they should remain available to those agencies for their intended purposes,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.), but he said he wanted to look at the specifics of Mr. Trump’s proposal.",
