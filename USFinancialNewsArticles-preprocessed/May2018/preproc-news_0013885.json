    "text": "LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) (“AMC” or “the Company”), today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, include the following:\nAMC set first quarter records for the three months ended March 31 period for all revenue categories: admissions, food and beverage and other. Much of the growth in revenue is due to the acquisition of Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”). Total revenues increased 8.0% to $1,383.6 million compared to total revenues of $1,281.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Total revenues in the quarter included approximately $401.5 million of revenues from our international theatres as compared to $289.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Admissions revenues increased 7.0% to $875.0 million compared to $817.5 million for the same period a year ago. Food and beverage revenues increased 2.1% to $405.8 million, compared to $397.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Earnings (loss) before income taxes grew $23.2 million to $22.4 million, compared to loss of $0.8 million for the same quarter a year ago. Net earnings increased $9.3 million to net earnings of $17.7 million compared to net earnings of $8.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Diluted earnings per share (“diluted EPS”) increased by $0.07 to $0.14 per share compared to earnings of $0.07 per share for the same period a year ago. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 5.5% compared to the first quarter last year as a result of the successful completion of an equity offering in February 2017, less the effect of 3.2 million shares repurchased during 2017. Total Adjusted EBITDA (1) increased 10.7% to $277.9 million compared to $251.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. International Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter grew $16.4 million to $69.5 million compared to $53.1 million a year ago.\n\"We are truly heartened by AMC's start to 2018 and couldn’t be more excited about the prospects for the year after the record-breaking success of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR early in the second quarter,\" said Adam Aron, CEO and President of AMC. \"AMC's strategy is working. We have invested wisely for our shareholders, especially in creating a better movie-going experience for our guests. We have developed more premium large format screens, with IMAX, Dolby Cinema and our proprietary brands, and have equipped theatres both in the U.S. and abroad with our much sought-after signature recliner seats. Our food and beverage initiatives offer an increased variety of menu options that far exceed traditional concession fare. More of our guests are booking their tickets directly on our web site and smartphone app than from any other online source, and our AMC Stubs loyalty membership has now soared to more than 13 million U.S. households. Adding to all of AMC's progress this year, the crowning achievement in 2018 so far has been our opening of the first movie theatre in Saudi Arabia in 37 years. This is a story that has been noted all across the globe, and there are many more theatres to come in the 16th country now served by AMC.”\nAron continued, \"But equally important as our own success, is the success of the movie industry. With record setting movies like IT, STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, BLACK PANTHER, and most recently, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, it is clear and unmistakable that movie fans overwhelmingly flock to theatres when tempted by great cinematic storytellers. We are confident that the pedigree of franchises from which a dazzling array of films will be released over the next several months has the potential to propel the industry and AMC even higher.”\n(1) Reconciliations and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial schedules accompanying this press release.\nCFO Commentary\nCommentary on the quarter by Craig Ramsey, AMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, is available at http://investor.amctheatres.com .\nAdditional information detailing select unaudited pro forma financial data for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 is included in the first quarter 2018 CFO Commentary. The select unaudited pro forma data for the period ended March 31, 2017 combines the historical financial data of AMC and Nordic, giving effect to the acquisition, financings and theatre divestitures as if they had been completed on January 1, 2017. The historical consolidated financial information for Nordic has been adjusted to comply with U.S. GAAP. The classification of certain items presented by Nordic under IFRS has been modified in order to align with the presentation used by AMC under U.S. GAAP. In addition to the U.S. GAAP adjustments and the reclassifications, amounts have also been translated to U.S. Dollars. The unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations would actually have been had the acquisitions occurred on the date indicated. Please refer to the August 1, 2017 Form 8-K and 8-K/A on December 4, 2017 for additional information on pro forma financial statement adjustments. The historical results for the period ended March 31, 2018 have been adjusted for constant currency. Constant currency amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rate for the corresponding pro forma period ended March 31, 2017.\nUpdate of Share Repurchase Program\nOn August 3, 2017, AMC announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of the Company’s Class A common stock over a two-year period.\nAs of May 1, 2018, the Company has repurchased approximately 50% of the authorized $100 million, having purchased more than 3.2 million shares of AMC’s Class A common stock for approximately $47.5 million, representing an average share price of $14.86.\nDividends\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, payable on March 26, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 12, 2018. The total dividends paid in the first quarter of 2018 were approximately $25.8 million.\nOn May 3, 2018, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, payable on June 25, 2018 to stockholders of record on June 11, 2018.\nConference Call / Webcast Information\nThe Company will host a conference call via webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 4:00 p.m. CDT/5:00 p.m. EDT on Monday, May 7, 2018.
