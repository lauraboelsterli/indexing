Send links of surveys and reports to ben.dipietro@wsj.com .\nIt Takes a Catastrophe: A survey of 151 IT and operational technology professionals at energy, oil and gas companies by security firm Tripwire Inc. found 70% expressed worry a cyberattack could cause a catastrophic event such as an explosion. Despite that, 56% said it would take a significant attack to compel their organization to invest the appropriate resources in their industrial control systems. Sixty-two percent said they lack resources to meet their security goals.\n“It’s concerning that more than half would wait for an attack to happen before investing properly, given what’s at stake with critical infrastructure,” said Tim Erin, vice president of product management and strategy at Tripwire. “The energy industry should invest in establishing more robust cybersecurity strategies, with a proper foundation of critical security controls and layers of defense.”\nProtect the Jewels: A survey of 634 IT practitioners by law firm Kilpatrick Townsend and Ponemon Institute found 58% said their boards now require assurances their organization’s most important information assets are properly protected and managed, up from 50% in 2016.\nIs That Really You?: A survey of around 800 IT decision-makers and C-suite executives by data security firm Mimecast and research firm Vanson Bourne found 40% said they’ve noticed an uptick in trusted third-party impersonation attacks .\nProcurement Risk: A survey of around 2,000 chief procurement officers at more than 300 organizations globally by consulting firm AT Kearney and financial analysis company RapidRatings found 78% said they expect their procurement teams to take a larger role in managing risk in the next two years.\nInconsistent on Consistency: A survey of 124 senior financial executives by advisory firm Duff & Phelps found 29% said regulators have created consistent global standards , though 52% said regulators are improving coordination.\nWhere Are Your Priorities?: A survey of around 2,300 security professionals by technology advocacy group Isaca found 31% said their board of directors doesn’t place the proper priority on enterprise security.\nTraffic Blind Spots: A survey of 2,700 IT managers in 10 countries by security firm Sophos found 45% admitted they couldn’t identify their organization’s network traffic and 52% worry about productivity loss from a lack of network visibility.\nInside Scoop: A survey of around 700 IT and security professionals by threat-management firm ObserveIT and Ponemon Institute found it takes on average more than two months to curb an insider threat , with just 16% contained in 30 days or fewer.\nAttacks & AI: A survey of around 4,500 enterprise security professionals in 15 countries by professional services firm Accenture found that while respondents said their organizations are preventing 87% of all focused attacks— up from 70% in 2017—they are suffering on average 30 successful security breaches a year.\nAnd an Accenture survey of around 800 banking executives in 25 countries found 71% indicated the biggest benefit of using artificial intelligence would be in building customer trust.\nMuddled Measures: A survey of around 250 senior procurement executives by risk-management software firm Riskmethods Inc. found 49% said they have no structured assessment for measuring supplier impact.\nCyber on My Mind: A survey of risk managers from the Society of Actuaries found 53% ranked cybersecurity as their top risk , followed by terrorism at 39% and technology at 38%.\nAll for One?: A survey of 450 IT professionals world-wide by Oracle and KPMG found 26% listed a lack of unified policies and disparate infrastructure as a top cybersecurity challenge.\nWrite to Ben DiPietro at ben.dipietro@wsj.com , and follow him on Twitter @BenDiPietro1.\nShare this: artificial intelligence catastrophic event cyber cybersecurity enterprise security focused attacks industrial control systems infrastructure insider threat knowledge assets network traffic procurement Standards supplier impact Survey Roundup third-party impersonation attacks Previous Corruption Currents: Ukraine Halted Probes Into Manafort as It Sought U.S. Missiles Content from our sponsor Deloitte Risk management, strategy and analysis from Deloitte Boards: Understand the Rules for Ethics and Compliance Oversight Executives, boards of directors, and audit committees have special responsibilities for the oversight and management of their organization’s ethics and compliance programs, as discussed in Deloitte’s 2018 Audit Committee Resource Guide. There are numerous rules set by regulators and others that are critical to understand. Moreover, scrutiny of boards’ oversight of ethics and compliance has increased in recent years, and boards’ oversight responsibilities have been highlighted by several court rulings and the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines for organizations.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
