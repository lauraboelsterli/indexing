    "text": "First quarter 2018 net income of $24 million and EBITDA of $86 million Diluted earnings per share of $0.38; 153 percent increase from prior year Pulp contributed significant EBITDA; Forest Products delivered solid profitability despite duties on U.S. sales; High Purity Cellulose impacted by production issues in two facilities and a spike in energy costs Integration of Tembec progressing as planned with significant contributions to first quarter profitability $7 million of transformation and synergy savings achieved; on track to meet 2018 target of $40 million\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE:RYAM) today reported first quarter 2018 net income of $24 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share compared to $10 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2017, a 153 percent increase in diluted earnings per share. Increased earnings are primarily due to the impact of the November 2017 acquisition of Tembec Inc. (“Tembec”).\n“Our first full quarter of operations following the acquisition of Tembec clearly demonstrates the accretive benefits of the enhanced scale and diversity of our combined business, as strength in our commodity segments offset temporary challenges in our High Purity Cellulose segment. While I am disappointed with the production issues in our Jesup and Tartas facilities and an unexpected spike in natural gas distribution costs during the unusually cold January in the southeast U.S., I am confident that these issues are behind us,” said Paul Boynton, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Importantly, robust pricing and profitability in our high yield pulp and lumber businesses are now expected to remain at elevated levels through the near term. The integration of Tembec’s operations are proceeding in line with our expectations as we delivered over $7 million of savings during the quarter and anticipate that these results will accelerate through the year as we work to reach our $40 million target. Looking forward, I am confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plan for the full year.”\nFirst Quarter Operating Results\nIn the following tables, the Company’s 2018 first quarter net sales and operating results are compared against the prior year comparable period results which preceded the acquisition of Tembec. In addition, the 2018 first quarter net sales and operating results are compared against the combined net sales and operating results which assume that the Company’s prior year comparable period had been combined with Tembec’s.\nNet sales and operating income were comprised of the following for the three months ended:\nNet sales (in millions) March 31, 2018 March 25, 2017 Combined 1 March 25, 2017\nHigh Purity Cellulose $ 282 $ 201 $ 301 Forest Products 99 — 83 Pulp 85 — 64 Paper 76 — 72 Eliminations (20 ) — (18 ) Total net sales $ 522 $ 201 $ 502 Operating income (loss) (in millions) March 31, 2018 March 25, 2017 Combined 1 March 25, 2017\nHigh Purity Cellulose $ 21 $ 34 $ 50 Forest Products 10 — 6 Pulp 23 — 5 Paper 3 — 11 Corporate (11 ) (7 ) (14 ) Total operating income $ 46 $ 27 $ 58 1\nCombined net sales and operating income (loss) represents the combination of Tembec’s net sales and operating earnings as of March 25, 2017, adjusted to reflect the estimated conversion from International Financial Reporting Standards to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for certain material amounts and translated at the historical quarterly average exchange rate of 0.7552, with the Company’s March 25, 2017 net sales and operating income. The adjustments represent the Company’s best estimates and are subject to change should additional information become available. The combined net sales and operating results of the Company and Tembec are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the net sales or operating results that would have resulted had the acquisition occurred for the period, nor project the results of operations for any future date or period. High Purity Cellulose\nFirst quarter 2018 sales were $282 million compared to $201 million for the 2017 comparable period, an increase of $81 million. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by increased sales volumes as a result of the acquisition of Tembec. Operating income for the quarter was $21 million compared to $34 million for the 2017 comparable period, a decrease of $13 million primarily driven by increased costs offset by additional contributions from Tembec.\nOn a combined basis, sales declined $19 million as sales price increases were offset by a 12 percent decline in sales volumes. The lower sales volumes were largely driven by production issues in Jesup and Tartas, both of which have been addressed. Operating income combined with Tembec declined $29 million driven by decreased sales volumes and increased raw material costs. Costs were impacted by a January spike in distribution costs for natural gas, because of unusually cold weather in the U.S. Southeast, along with increases to chemical pricing. The combination of the production issues and the spike in energy prices negatively impacted operating earnings by $15 million in the quarter.\nForest Products\nFirst quarter 2018 net sales and operating income were $99 million and $10 million, respectively, as a result of the Tembec acquisition.\nOn a combined basis, first quarter 2018 net sales increased $16 million from the $83 million 2017 combined amount primarily due to a 30 percent increase in lumber prices. First quarter 2018 operating income increased $4 million from the $6 million 2017 combined amount primarily due to higher sales prices partially offset by duties for lumber exports to the U.S. and higher raw material costs.\nPulp\nFirst quarter 2018 net sales and operating income were $85 million and $23 million, respectively, as a result of the Tembec acquisition.\nOn a combined basis, first quarter 2018 net sales increased $21 million from the $64 million 2017 combined amount primarily due to higher sales prices. First quarter 2018 operating income increased $18 million from the $5 million 2017 combined amount primarily due to higher sales prices slightly offset by higher costs.\nPaper\nFirst quarter 2018 net sales and operating income were $76 million and $3 million, respectively, as a result of the Tembec acquisition.\nOn a combined basis, first quarter 2018 net sales increased $4 million from the $72 million 2017 combined amount primarily due to higher sales prices. First quarter 2018 operating income decreased $8 million from the $11 million 2017 combined amount primarily due to higher pulp costs, a raw material in the production of paperboard, as well as, increased depreciation & amortization and duties for newsprint exports to the U.S.\nTransformation and Synergy Savings\nDuring the first quarter of 2018 the Company achieved approximately $7 million of its $40 million cost transformation target for 2018, excluding one-time costs, split roughly evenly between legacy actions and acquisition synergies. Savings were primarily driven by reduced corporate expenses and enhanced procurement practices. Synergy savings required approximately $1 million in one-time costs to achieve these results.\nNon-Operating Expenses\nInterest expense was $15 million for the first quarter 2018, an increase over the prior year of $6 million due to higher debt balances and interest rates associated with the debt used to finance the acquisition of Tembec.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 28.7 percent for the first quarter of 2018, which compares to 45.3 percent during the prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to lower tax rates in the United States as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. Additionally, the first quarter of 2017 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the accounting for 2014 employee incentive stock program, which did not pay out as a result of not meeting the required performance criteria.\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company generated operating cash flows of $33 million and adjusted free cash flows of $13 million. Working capital used $39 million of cash in the quarter as a result of planned seasonal build to wood inventories in the Forest Products segment. Working capital is expected to moderate beginning in the second quarter. The Company ended the first quarter with adjusted net debt of $1,153 million and $306 million of total liquidity, including $89 million of cash and $217 million available under the revolving credit facility after taking into account outstanding letters of credit.\nOutlook\nHigh Purity Cellulose\nCellulose specialties prices are anticipated to decline 4 to 5 percent in 2018 with flat to slightly lower sales volumes. However, with the significant production issues resolved and energy prices returning to normal levels along with typical seasonality in the business, the Company expects improved profitability for the segment through the remainder of the year.\nForest Products\nLumber prices are expected to remain consistent with first quarter levels in the second quarter as seasonal demand and duties, imposed on Canadian lumber imports to the U.S., support prices. Increases in lumber prices have been offsetting the impact of duties. These duties are anticipated to affect approximately 50 percent of the sales in this segment and reduce EBITDA by approximately $30 million during 2018 with no impact to sales volumes.\nPulp\nHigh-yield pulp prices are currently at historically high levels due to increased Chinese demand driven primarily by the reduction of imports of recycled fiber. Demand and prices are expected to remain strong in the second quarter before moderating in the back-half of the year.\nPaper\nIn paperboard, markets are expected to remain stable to slightly improved though peak pulp prices, which benefit our high-yield pulp, will negatively impact the cost of raw materials. In newsprint, reduced industry production capacity and duties have led to higher prices. However, profitability is expected to remain flat due to the impact of duties.\nCapital Allocation and Investment\nThe Company anticipates that it will spend approximately $100 to $110 million in maintenance capital expenditures across its businesses in 2018. In addition, the Company anticipates spending approximately $45 million on high-return strategic projects in 2018. These strategic opportunities are predominantly focused in the High Purity Cellulose and Forest Products segments with an average pay-back of less than 2 years.\n“With strong pricing in high-yield pulp and lumber, the resolution of our production issues and energy prices reverting to normal levels, we expect results to improve significantly in the second quarter. As we continue through the year, financial results will be augmented by our integration efforts as transformation and synergy savings will provide additional benefits.” Boynton continued, “Lastly, we remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy focused on reducing debt, investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders.”\nConference Call Information\nRayonier Advanced Materials Inc.
