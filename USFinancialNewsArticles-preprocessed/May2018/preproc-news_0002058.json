    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Navigant (NYSE: NCI) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 financial summary:\nRevenues and revenues before reimbursements (RBR) of $264.5 million and $243.9 million, respectively were both up 3% compared to first quarter 2017 Net income was $11.9 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to $11.1 million, or $0.23 per share, for first quarter 2017 Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS) of $0.30 increased $0.03 compared to first quarter 2017 Repurchased $11.4 million of common stock in the quarter, significantly higher than the $5.0 million repurchased in the prior year period Management affirms previously provided 2018 financial guidance targets\n“We are pleased with our first quarter results which reflect improving trends in several areas of our business,” said Julie Howard, chairman and CEO of Navigant. “In the quarter, our DFLT and Energy segments produced solid year-over-year and sequential RBR improvements. We also realized strong growth in our Financial Services Advisory and Compliance segment. In each of these three segments, revenue improvement translated to margin gains in the period. In Healthcare, as expected, performance for the segment was down in the quarter, however, we see early signs of demand recovery for strategic, provider-related engagements. Additionally, we are excited about future growth opportunities related to our recently announced joint venture with Baptist Health South Florida. All-in-all, after the solid start to the year, we remain well positioned to achieve our full-year 2018 guidance targets.”\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nThe quarter ended March 31, Increase / (Dollars in millions, excluding per share data)\n2018 2017 (Decrease) Revenue $ 264.5 $ 257.8 $ 6.7 RBR $ 243.9 $ 236.2 $ 7.7 Net Income $ 11.9 $ 11.1 $ 0.8 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 29.9 $ 31.5 $ (1.6 ) Adjusted Net Income per Share (1) $0.30 $0.27 $0.03 (1) See definition and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures elsewhere in this release. Navigant reported first quarter 2018 revenues and RBR of $264.5 million and $243.9 million, respectively, up 3% compared to the first quarter 2017 reflecting higher revenue in three of the Company’s four segments. On an organic, exchange rate neutral basis, RBR growth for the quarter was up 2% compared to the first quarter 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $29.9 million, down $1.6 million from the same prior year period as lower margins in the Healthcare segment and higher bad debt expense, due to receivable aging and client specific reserves in the current year period and the absence of bad debt expense in the prior year period, contributed to decreased performance. When excluding bad debt, general and administrative cost as a percent of RBR were 16.9%, a 70bps improvement compared to the first quarter 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 net income of $11.9 million was up $0.8 million compared to first quarter 2017 as the operating performance discussed above was more than offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense, as well as lower taxes due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the current year period. GAAP EPS and Adjusted EPS were $0.25 and $0.30, respectively, for first quarter 2018, $0.02 and $0.03 higher, respectively, than the prior year period.\nCASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET\nFirst quarter 2018 net cash used in operating activities was $34.8 million compared to a use of $23.0 million for first quarter 2017 driven primarily by higher accounts receivable in the current year period. Days Sales Outstanding on March 31, 2018 was 91 days, a 6-day increase compared to December 31, 2017, driven by slower collections. Free Cash Flow, which as defined excludes working capital, increased to $20.1 million for first quarter 2018 compared to $13.3 million for the same period in 2017, primarily due to lower capital expenditures in the current year period.\nBank debt outstanding on March. 31, 2018 was $184.3 million, up $6.0 million compared to $178.3 million outstanding on March 31, 2017. Leverage (bank debt divided by trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA) was 1.48 times at March 31, 2018.\nNavigant continued executing its share repurchase program with an additional 569 thousand shares of common stock repurchased during the first quarter 2018 at an aggregate cost of $11.4 million and an average price of $19.95 per share. As of March 31, 2018, the company had $52.3 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization which expires on December 31, 2019.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 SEGMENT RESULTS\nThe quarter ended March 31, Increase / (Dollars in millions, numbers may not foot due to rounding)\n2018 2017 (Decrease) RBR Healthcare $ 90.1 $ 94.0 $ (3.9 ) Energy 33.7 32.5 1.2 Financial Services Advisory and Compliance 41.4 32.9 8.5 Disputes, Forensics, and Legal Technology 78.6 76.8 1.8 Total Company $ 243.9 $ 236.2 $ 7.7 Total Revenues Healthcare $ 98.7 $ 103.0 $ (4.3 ) Energy 37.6 37.7 (0.1 ) Financial Services Advisory and Compliance 45.6 36.9 8.7 Disputes, Forensics, and Legal Technology 82.6 80.2 2.4 Total Company $ 264.5 $ 257.8 $ 6.7 Segment Operating Profit Healthcare $ 20.4 $ 28.5 $ (8.1 ) Energy 10.7 8.9 1.8 Financial Services Advisory and Compliance 16.0 11.6 4.4 Disputes, Forensics, and Legal Technology 27.9 25.5 2.4 Total Company $ 75.1 $ 74.4 $ 0.7 Segment Operating Margin (% of RBR) Healthcare 22.6 % 30.3 % -7.7 % Energy 31.8 % 27.3 % 4.5 % Financial Services Advisory and Compliance 38.7 % 35.3 % 3.4 % Disputes, Forensics, and Legal Technology 35.5 % 33.2 % 2.3 % Total Company 30.8 % 31.5 % -0.7 % Healthcare segment RBR of $90.1 million decreased 4%, or 6% on an organic basis, for first quarter 2018 compared to the same prior year period. Consistent with 2017 and as anticipated, the demand environment for certain of our consulting services remained depressed and impacted revenue performance in the quarter. Segment operating profit of $20.4 million declined $8.1 million in first quarter 2018 compared to the first quarter 2017 as lower revenue, higher strategic development costs, increased headcount in managed services, as well as the maintenance of resources in consulting, in anticipation of improving demand for the remainder of 2018, contributed to the decline. Additionally, headcount reductions taken in the quarter to better position the segment for improved performance going forward increased severance expense in the current year period.\nEnergy segment RBR for first quarter 2018 of $33.7 million increased 4% compared to first quarter 2017 and was up 10% sequentially. Improving demand from commercial client engagements for services such as grid modernization and distributed energy resource planning helped drive the revenue improvement. Segment operating profit for the quarter was up 21% compared to the first quarter 2017 due to increased revenue and lower headcount driven by 2017 cost management actions.\nFinancial Services Advisory and Compliance segment RBR finished at $41.4 million, up 26% compared to first quarter 2017. Strong growth across the segment was driven by increased activity in financial crime, sanctions, and operational efficiency engagements across a number of our largest clients. Segment operating profit increased 38% as revenue performance more than offset increased headcount and higher incentive compensation costs.\nDisputes, Forensics, and Legal Technology segment RBR for first quarter 2018 of $78.6 million was up 2% compared to first quarter 2017 and increased 11% sequentially. The quarter benefited from continued demand for cyber security services, as well a robust market for commercial disputes expertise, particularly in construction, healthcare and intellectual property related matters. Lower mass tort claim volume in the current year period partially offset robust performance elsewhere in the segment. Segment operating profit for first quarter 2018 was up 10% compared to the first quarter 2017 driven primarily by higher revenue.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nManagement affirms full year 2018 financial outlook as originally communicated on February 20, 2018:\nTotal revenues estimated to be between $1.030 billion and $1.065 billion RBR expected to range between $940 million and $975 million Adjusted EBITDA expected to range between $125 million and $137 million Adjusted EPS estimated to be between $1.26 and $1.44 Capital expenditures estimated to be approximately $25 million Free Cash Flow expected to range between $75 million and $90 million\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are included in the financial schedules attached to this press release. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for, or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNavigant has provided guidance regarding Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, both of which exclude the impact of severance expense and other operating costs (benefit), as applicable. Navigant is not able to accurately forecast the excluded items at the level of precision that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nNavigant will host a conference call to discuss the company’s first quarter 2018 results at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (9 a.m. Central Time) on Wed., May 2, 2018. The conference call may be accessed via the Navigant website ( investors.navigant.com ) or by dialing 888.455.9733 (630.395.0358 for international callers) and referencing pass code “NCI.” An archived version of the webcast will also be available via the Navigant website. A report of financial and related supplemental information is also available via the Navigant website.\nDEFINITIONS\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS) Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA – earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization – excluding the impact of severance expense and other operating costs (benefit), as applicable. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share exclude the net income and per share net income impact of severance expense, other operating costs (benefit), and the benefit recognized in the fourth quarter 2017 related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as applicable. Severance expense and other operating costs (benefit) are not considered to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual to our business. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with enhanced comparability of Navigant’s results of operations across periods. Free Cash Flow is calculated as net cash provided by (used in) operations excluding the change in asset, liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts less cash payment for property, equipment and deferred acquisition liabilities. Free Cash Flow does not represent cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayment. However, management believes that Free Cash Flow provides investors with an indicator of cash available for on-going business operations and long-term value creation.\nABOUT NAVIGANT\nNavigant Consulting, Inc.

(2) EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of severance expense and other operating costs (benefit), as applicable. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share exclude net income and per share net income impact of severance expense and other operating costs (benefit), and the benefit recognized in the fourth quarter 2017 related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as applicable. Severance expense and other operating costs are not considered to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual to our business. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with enhanced comparability of Navigant's results of operations across periods. (3) Effective income tax expense has been determined based on specific tax jurisdiction. (4) Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided from operations excluding changes in assets and liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable less cash payments for property and equipment and deferred acquisition related payments. Free cash flow does not represent discretionary cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayment. However, management believes that it provides investors with an indicator of cash flows available for on-going business operations and long-term value creation. (5) Leverage ratio is calculated as bank debt at the end of the period divided by adjusted EBITDA for the prior twelve-month period. Management believes that leverage ratio provides investors with an indicator of the cash flows available to repay the Company's debt obligations. (6) Organic growth represents revenues before reimbursements adjusted to include the impact of our acquisitions as if we owned them from the beginning of each comparable period and adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that organic growth reflects the growth of our existing business and is, therefore, useful in analyzing the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502005322/en/\nNavigant\nKyle Bland\nNavigant Investor Relations\n312.573.5624\nkyle.bland@navigant.com\nor\nBelia Ortega\nNavigant Corporate Communications\n312.583.2640\nbelia.ortega@navigant.com\nSource: Navigant",
