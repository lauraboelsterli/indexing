    "text": "(Reuters) - The United States and North Korea are worlds apart in economic, political and cultural ways, but the two officials meeting in New York to explore a possible historic summit both have military backgrounds and are known as political hard-liners.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testifies that North Korea has not responded in recent days to queries by the United States to prepare logistics for an upcoming summit during his appearance at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Toya Sarno Jordan/File Photo The following are some facts about U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean senior official Kim Yong Chol:\nMIKE POMPEO Pompeo, U.S. President Donald Trump’s first CIA director, became his second secretary of state on April 26, replacing the fired Rex Tillerson.\nA former Republican congressman from Kansas, Pompeo made his reputation in the U.S. House of Representatives as a hard-right “Tea Party” conservative with hawkish world views. He is now a Trump loyalist and close adviser to the president.\nAsia experts have debated whether Pompeo, 54, with his Trump-style partisanship, will help foster or hinder this year’s overtures between Washington and Pyongyang. He has said North Korea was just months away from being able to fire a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the United States.\nOn other fronts, the former U.S. Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate has been known to play down U.S. intelligence agency conclusions of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which Moscow denies.\nMeanwhile, according to some U.S. officials, he has chosen to stress Iran’s missile development and role in Middle East conflicts instead of its adherence to the 2015 international nuclear deal.\nNorth Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol arrives at a hotel in New York, U.S., May 30, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Pompeo made back-to-back trips to North Korea in April and May to meet with leader Kim Jong Un as prospects grew for a summit with Trump.\nHe returned to the United States from the May trip with three American prisoners who had been freed by Pyongyang in a gesture aimed at paving the way for a summit.\nKIM YONG CHOL He is a four-star general who is vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee and a close aide to Kim Jong Un. As director of the United Front Department, he steers Pyongyang’s relations with South Korea.\nKim Yong Chol, thought to be about 72-years-old, was accused by Seoul of planning deadly attacks on a South Korean navy ship and an island in 2010. He was also linked by U.S. intelligence to a cyber attack on Sony Pictures in 2014.\nNorth Korea denied involvement in both incidents.\nMore recently, however, he has played a role in the easing of relations between the two Koreas and with the United States following months of belligerent rhetoric between Trump and leader Kim.\nKim Yong Chol played a role, along with South Korean intelligence chief Suh Hoon, in arranging a surprise meeting in April between Pompeo and Kim Jong Un in North Korea.\nCompiled by Richard Cowan; editing by Grant McCool\n ",
