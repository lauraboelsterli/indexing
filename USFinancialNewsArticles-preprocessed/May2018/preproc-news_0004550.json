    "text": "HOUSTON, Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $2.42 billion, compared to revenues of $2.18 billion in the first quarter of 2017, and net common stock was $37.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to net common stock of $48.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $0.40 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.39 for the first quarter of 2017.\n\"We are pleased with how Quanta has started the year. The electric power segment performed particularly well, with strong revenue and margin growth due to excellent execution across our operations,\" said Duke Austin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quanta Services. \"As a result of our solid first quarter results, strengthening end markets and confidence in our ability to safely execute, we are raising our full year revenue and earnings per share expectations. With the largest specialized workforce in our industry, as well as our scope and scale, innovative solutions and ability to execute complex projects while providing cost certainty, we remain well positioned in our markets and believe our visibility into opportunities for multi-year growth are strengthening.\"\nNegatively impacting the quarter and reflected as adjustments in Quanta's adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation were acquisition and integration costs of $7.2 million ($6.2 million net of tax), or $0.04 per diluted share attributable to common stock, primarily associated with two acquisitions completed during the quarter.\nRECENT HIGHLIGHTS\nSelected for Large Metro Fiber Build - In the first quarter of 2018, Quanta was selected by a large telecommunications company for turnkey engineering and construction services for fiber deployment throughout a tier 2 market in Texas. This deployment is designed to support the customer's existing 4G and developing 5G wireless networks and the delivery of high-speed broadband services. Quanta anticipates beginning this project later this year with completion anticipated by the end of 2020. Secured Large Diameter Pipeline Project - In April 2018, Quanta entered into a contract to build a large diameter pipeline project in Oklahoma, which is designed to transport natural gas from the SCOOP and STACK plays to end users in support of LNG export, industrial demand, electric power generation, local distribution companies and downstream users. Quanta's scope of work includes the construction and installation of approximately 80 miles of new 36-inch diameter mainline pipe. Quanta's construction on the project is anticipated to begin in the third quarter of this year with completion anticipated in mid-2019. Repurchased Stock - During the first quarter of 2018, Quanta repurchased $173.9 million of its outstanding common stock, acquiring 5.0 million shares through open market repurchases. Taking into account stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2017, Quanta has acquired 6.4 million shares of its common stock for $223.9 million under its current $300 million stock repurchase program.\nQuanta completed two acquisitions during the first three months of 2018 and three acquisitions during the full-year 2017. Therefore, Quanta's results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include the results of the acquired businesses from the acquisition dates and are compared to the historical results for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For further information on the items that impacted comparability in 2018 and 2017, see the footnotes to the Supplemental Segment Data table and the non-GAAP reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock below.\nOUTLOOK\nThe long-term outlook for Quanta's business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, project timing, execution challenges and other factors have impacted the company's historical results, and may impact Quanta's future financial results. Therefore, Quanta's financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management's effort to properly align these uncertainties with the backlog that the company is executing on and the opportunities that are expected to materialize during 2018. The following are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially.\nPrior to the company's conference call, management will post a summary of updated 2018 guidance expectations with additional commentary in the \"Investors & Media\" section of Quanta's website at http://investors.quantaservices.com . For the full-year 2018, Quanta now expects revenues to range between $9.95 billion and $10.55 billion, net common stock to range between $321.0 million and $383.0 million and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to range between $2.07 and $2.47. Additionally, for the full-year 2018, Quanta now expects adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) to be between $2.55 and $2.95, EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) to be between $756.5 million and $858.1 million, and adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) to be between $815.4 million and $917.0 million. See the attached tables for reconciliations of estimated adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to estimated GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock and estimated EBITDA and estimated adjusted EBITDA to estimated GAAP net common stock for the full-year 2018.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe non-GAAP measures in this press release are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta's performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta's operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with GAAP.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nQuanta Services has scheduled a conference call for 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 3, 2018, which will also be broadcast live over the Internet.

Included in the three months ended March 31, 2017 were attorneys' fees and related expenses of approximately $4.2 million associated with certain litigation that was resolved in the first quarter of 2017.\nQuanta Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSupplemental Data\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\n(Unaudited)\nPerformance Obligations and Backlog (a non-GAAP measure)\nEffective January 1, 2018, Quanta adopted the new revenue recognition guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Pursuant to the new guidance, Quanta is required to disclose, as of the end of each interim and annual period, the aggregate amount of the remaining performance obligations under its contracts with customers. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service. Quanta's remaining performance obligations represent management's estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders for fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun. For purposes of calculating remaining performance obligations, Quanta includes all estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to occur and revenues from change orders to the extent management believes additional contract revenues will be earned and are deemed probable of collection.\nQuanta has also historically disclosed its backlog, and while backlog is not a defined term under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), it is a common measurement used in Quanta's industry. Quanta also believes this non-GAAP measure enables it to more effectively forecast its future results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Quanta's remaining performance obligations, as described above, are a component of Quanta's backlog calculation, which also includes estimated orders under master service agreements (MSAs), including estimated renewals, and non-fixed price contracts expected to be completed within one year. Quanta's methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles Quanta's total remaining performance obligations to its backlog (a non-GAAP measure) as of March 31, 2018, along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months of March 31, 2018 (in millions):\n12 Month\nTotal\nRemaining performance obligations\n$\n4,153.2\n$\n5,193.4\nEstimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts\n2,729.6\n6,463.8\nBacklog\n$\n6,882.8\n$\n11,657.2\nThe following table presents Quanta's backlog by reportable segment as of March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, along with an estimate of the backlog amounts expected to be realized within 12 months of each balance sheet date (in millions):\nBacklog (a non-GAAP measure) as of\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\n12 Month\nTotal\n12 Month\nTotal\n12 Month\nTotal\nElectric Power Infrastructure Services\n$\n4,214.8\n$\n7,596.1\n$\n4,032.4\n$\n7,359.2\n$\n3,573.0\n$\n6,757.3\nOil and Gas Infrastructure Services\n2,668.0\n4,061.1\n2,413.8\n3,818.5\n1,878.3\n2,481.9\nTotal\n$\n6,882.8\n$\n11,657.2\n$\n6,446.2\n$\n11,177.7\n$\n5,451.3\n$\n9,239.2\nQuanta Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table presents the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, which, when used in connection with net common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta's performance. EBITA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates and certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent when including the excluded items. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta's acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; and (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta's ongoing acquisition activity. Because EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net common stock, such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet common stock (GAAP as reported)\n$\n37,614\n$\n48,267\nInterest expense\n6,778\n3,965\nInterest income\n(146)\n(287)\nProvision for income taxes\n18,003\n22,592\nAmortization of intangible assets\n10,405\n6,562\nEquity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates\n13,343\n603\nEBITA\n$\n85,997\n$\n81,702\nDepreciation expense\n48,719\n42,693\nEBITDA\n$\n134,716\n$\n124,395\nNon-cash stock-based compensation\n14,687\n11,866\nAcquisition and integration costs\n7,178\n窶能nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n156,581\n$\n136,261\nQuanta Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nAttributable to Common Stock\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\n(In thousands, except per share information)\n(Unaudited)\nThe non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, when used in connection with diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta's performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta's acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; and (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta's ongoing acquisition activity. Because adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, as defined, excludes some, but not all, items that affect net common stock, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock as presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Free (negative free) cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as additions to property and equipment less proceeds from sale of property and equipment and proceeds from insurance settlements related to property and equipment. Management believes that free (negative free) cash flow provides useful information to Quanta's investors because free (negative free) cash flow is viewed by management as an important indicator of how much cash is provided or used by routine business operations, including the impact of net capital expenditures. Management uses free (negative free) cash flow for capital allocation purposes as it is viewed as a measure of cash available to pay debt, acquire businesses, repurchase common stock and transact other investing and financing activities.

Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta's acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; and (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta's ongoing acquisition activity.

EBITA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates and certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent when including the excluded items. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta's acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; and (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta's ongoing acquisition activity. Because EBITA, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net common stock, such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
