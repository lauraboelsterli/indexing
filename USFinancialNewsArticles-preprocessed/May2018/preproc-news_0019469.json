    "text": "MEXICO CITY, May 8 (Reuters) - Mexican negotiators have proposed a 70 percent regional content requirement for the auto industry under a reworked NAFTA trade deal in response to a U.S. proposal for a 75 percent level, four sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\nMexicoâ€™s economy ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Canadian, Mexican and U.S. officials were in Washington on Tuesday to rework NAFTA as efforts focused on crafting new rules for the auto sector.
