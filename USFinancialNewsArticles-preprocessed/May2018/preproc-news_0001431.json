Photo: AP Photo/Matt York\nInvestigations of misappropriated funds at a Hong Kong-listed unit of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. could lead to sanctions against it under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. antibribery law.\nThe company is a publicly traded unit of iHeartMedia Inc. It earlier said several employees of Clear Media Ltd., an indirect subsidiary listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, are under investigation by Chinese police.\nClear Channel Outdoor said Monday the misappropriation resulted in a gap between the amount of cash Clear Media actually held and the total listed on its books. The accounting issue would force it to delay filing its annual results with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Clear Channel said early last month.\nClear Channel said it determined there was a “material weakness” in controls over financial reporting with respect to Clear Media. A Clear Media probe conducted by forensic accountants and an outside law firm found three unauthorized bank accounts had been opened in the name of Clear Media entities and “certain transactions” were recorded in those accounts.\nThe outdoor-ad company said it informed both the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice and intends to cooperate with any investigations authorities may conduct. The SEC and Justice Department declined to comment.\nThe Clear Media matter “could implicate” both accounting and antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars paying bribes to foreign government officials to win, or keep, a business advantage, Clear Channel said.\nThe accounting provisions operate in tandem with the antibribery part of the law, requiring companies to maintain accounts that reflect their actual activities. They also require companies to develop internal systems sufficient to let management maintain control of a company’s assets.\nWrite to Henry Cutter at Henry.Cutter@wsj.com.
