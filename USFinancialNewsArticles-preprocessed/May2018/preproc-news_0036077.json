U.S. President Donald Trump meets with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 17, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nTrump’s remarks came at a Cabinet meeting attended by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg.\nStoltenberg praised Trump’s work on shoring up NATO, whose continued purpose Trump questioned while campaigning in the 2016 election.\nSitting at Trump’s right hand, Stoltenberg said: “Your leadership on defence spending has really helped to make a difference.”\n“It is impacting allies because now all allies are increasing defence spending,” he said. “No allies are cutting their budgets anymore.” Reporting by James Oliphant; Writing by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Frances Kerry and Peter Cooney",
