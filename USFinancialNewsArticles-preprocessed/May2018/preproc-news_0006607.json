    "text": "As student debt grows, so do the plans to squelch it.\nSome of the ideas are pretty creative: New Jersey, for example, is considering establishing a lottery for borrowers burdened by student debt. Other ways of garnering money to eliminate your education debt don't rely on luck, but rather require rolling up your sleeves or knowing historical facts.\nKeep in mind, however, that these endeavors aren't free aid. The funds are taxable, even money from an organization in return for volunteer work.\n\"All money you receive for volunteering or win on a trivia app or lottery is considered income by the IRS,\" said Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert.\nHere are some of the ways to get other people to pay off your debt.\n1) At your job Currently, just 4 percent of employers offer student debt assistance. But that's changing as more employers come to realize education debt is a problem for many of their workers, said Katie Berliner, account executive at YouDecide, a benefits firm.\n\"In order to attract and retain talent, employers are looking at offering contributions to people's student loans,\" Berliner said.\nCompanies that have offered their employees help with their student loans include Fidelity, Aetna, Penguin Random House, Nvidia and Staples. \"Do a quick Google search and find the employers who are out there doing this,\" Berliner said.\nMost likely the company you're interviewing with won't offer the benefit, but that shouldn't stop you from asking about it, Berliner said.\n\"In the course of the interview, there comes a point where the interviewer says, 'Do you have any questions?'\" Berliner said. \"It would not be out of line to say: 'I want to get your perspective on whether you think this a valuable benefit.'\"\n2) By volunteering Some organizations will help you pay off your student loans if you offer to do volunteer work.\nCheck out sponsorchange.org , where you can search to help in fields like disaster relief or politics, and will receive payments to put toward your education debt in return.\nStarting in June, borrowers can enroll with Shared Harvest Fund . Users create a profile and list the social causes they're interested in, such as gender equality or homelessness. You'll work on projects for nonprofits and businesses and receive a monthly stipend of $250 to $1,000.\nAlthough the work will start off in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, \"eventually, people can live in Arkansas and do work for a nonprofit in Los Angeles,\" said NanaEfua B.A.M, founder of Shared Harvest Fund.\n3) Apps Givling is an app that lets student loan borrowers play trivia, with the winning team each week earning roughly $5,000 per person. \"Some people are not the best trivia players, but they're motivated to get help with their student loans,\" said Seth Beard, Givling's chief marketing officer.\nThe app ChangeEd will put your spare change toward your student loan payments. For example, if you buy a coffee for $1.75, 25 cents will go toward your debt.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHere's how to retire abroad â€” without any tax surprises\nTax cuts trump the market's recent volatility for most Americans, new study finds\nTax bill will slash by half the number of homeowners claiming the mortgage deduction",
