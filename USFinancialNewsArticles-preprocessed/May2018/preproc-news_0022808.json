(NYSE: MTW), a leading global manufacturer of cranes and lifting solutions, today reported first-quarter net sales of $386.1 million and diluted EPS (“DEPS”) on a GAAP basis of $(0.28) and $(0.12) on an adjusted basis.\nFirst-quarter orders of $536.0 million were up 10% from the comparable period in 2017. Backlog totaled $756.6 million at March 31, 2018, up 49% from the first-quarter 2017.\nFirst-quarter 2018 net sales were $386.1 million versus $305.8 million in the comparable period in 2017; a year-over-year increase of 26%. The increase was attributable to improved crane shipments across all regions, with the U.S. and European markets generating the majority of the increase.\nThe Company reported a net loss of $(10.0) million, or $(0.28) per diluted share, in the first-quarter 2018 versus a net loss of $(36.0) million, or $(1.03) per diluted share, in the first-quarter 2017. Adjusted net loss (1) was $(4.1) million, or $(0.12) per diluted share, in the first-quarter 2018 versus an adjusted net loss of $(24.2) million, or $(0.69) per diluted share, in the comparable period of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (1) for the first-quarter 2018 was $17.1 million compared to $1.1 million in the same period last year.\n“We began 2018 by delivering another quarter of solid financial results using the principles of The Manitowoc Way. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in financial performance, culminating in a 400 basis-point improvement in adjusted EBITDA percentage over the comparable period. Our enhanced product portfolio is delivering new levels of differentiation and value demonstrated by increases in customer demand for our extensive range of products,” commented Barry L. Pennypacker, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Manitowoc Company, Inc.\n“The global crane market is reaching an inflection point, and it shows in our order rates year-to-date. However, like many capital goods companies, we are beginning to see headwinds in terms of materials inflation and supply chain challenges. Also, foreign currency exchange rates are putting pressure on our margins, most notably on European produced cranes that we sell in the U.S. We are actively managing these challenges and aggressively taking pricing actions to ensure that we deliver our full-year EBITDA guidance of $100 to $120 million.\n“We are clearly making meaningful progress in transforming Manitowoc into a leaner, more profitable crane company. In June we will be showcasing our transformation to customers, dealers and investors at our Crane Days event in Shady Grove. This event will highlight our industry-leading products and service solutions, including the introduction of five new innovative cranes,” added Pennypacker.\nFull-Year 2018 Guidance\nManitowoc updates its’ full-year 2018 financial guidance as follows:\nRevenue - approximately $1.775 to $1.850 billion; Adjusted EBITDA - approximately $100 to $120 million; Depreciation - approximately $39 million; Restructuring expense - approximately $13 to $15 million; Capital expenditures - approximately $25 to $30 million; and Income tax expense - approximately $14 to $20 million, excluding discrete items.\nInvestor Conference Call\nOn Tuesday, May 8th, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. ET (9:00 a.m. CT), The Manitowoc Company’s senior management will discuss its first-quarter 2018 earnings results during a live conference call for security analysts and institutional investors. A live audio webcast of the call, along with the related presentation, can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of Manitowoc’s website at www.manitowoc.com . A replay of the conference call will also be available at the same location on the website.\nAbout The Manitowoc Company, Inc.\nFounded in 1902, The Manitowoc Company, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of cranes and lifting solutions with manufacturing, distribution, and service facilities in 20 countries. Manitowoc is recognized as one of the premier innovators and providers of crawler cranes, tower cranes, and mobile cranes for the heavy construction industry, which are complemented by a slate of industry-leading aftermarket product support services. In 2017, Manitowoc’s net sales totaled $1.6 billion, with over half generated outside the United States.\nFootnote\n(1) Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) (“adjusted net income (loss)”) and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (“adjusted EBITDA”) are financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP numbers please see schedule of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release. Manitowoc believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends used in assessing its results of operations. Manitowoc believes excluding specified items provides a more meaningful comparison to the corresponding reporting periods and internal budgets and forecasts, assists investors in performing analysis that is consistent with financial models developed by investors and research analysts, provides management with a more relevant measure of operating performance and is more useful in assessing management performance.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release includes “ ” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability under the Private 1995.
