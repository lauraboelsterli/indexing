    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE: TMHC) today reported first quarter total revenue of $752 million and home closings gross margin, inclusive of capitalized interest, of 18.8 percent leading to diluted earnings per share of $0.41.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nSales per outlet were 2.8 Net sales orders were 2,443 Home closings were 1,547 Total revenue was $752 million Home closings gross margin, inclusive of capitalized interest, was 18.8 percent Net income was $47 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.41\n\"I'm proud of our strong first quarter performance and delighted that we exceeded our expectations in several operating metrics including sales, home closings gross margin and earnings per share,\" said Sheryl Palmer, Chairman and CEO of Taylor Morrison. \"We closed the quarter with a sales pace of 2.8—our best pace since the first half of 2013—representing a 40 percent two-year growth rate. We recognized these strong paces across our portfolio touching each market, consumer segment and price point. The momentum continued into April which had a sales pace of 2.9.\"\nFor the first quarter, net sales orders were 2,443 with an average community count of 288. The Company ended the quarter with 4,392 units in backlog, a year-over-year increase of 12 percent, with a sales value of more than $2.1 billion.\n\"Our performance in the quarter drove $0.41 of EPS, a home closings gross margin of 18.8 percent and an EBT margin of 7.9 percent, both improving 80 basis points from this quarter last year,\" said Palmer. \"I'm pleased to see this accretion in margin rate which is due in part to mix and attributable to the strengthening of our operational efficiencies and cost savings practices.\"\n\"For the quarter, closings totaled 1,547, three less than our stated guidance,\" added Palmer. \"Although we over delivered on our expectations in Q4 despite the hurricanes, we underestimated the length of time it would take our impacted markets to recover the lost time on our construction starts. With local access to the trades tightening and the shift in focus to rebuilding efforts, our ability to close and deliver homes to our 100 percent standard of completion was affected. We are not changing our guidance for the year, as this is purely a first-half timing issue.\"\n\"Our earnings before income taxes were $59 million, or 7.9 percent of revenue, and income taxes totaled about $12 million for the quarter, representing an effective rate of 19.8 percent,\" said Dave Cone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"This is significantly lower than the first quarter of 2017 due in large part to tax reform. In addition, our Q1 tax rate came in more favorable due to legislation passed this February which extended energy tax credits retroactively through the end of 2017. The energy credits resulted in a one-time benefit of $3.8 million in the first quarter.\"\nHomebuilding inventories were $3.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including 5,053 homes in inventory, compared to 4,396 homes in inventory at the end of the prior year quarter. Homes in inventory at the end of the quarter consisted of 3,132 sold units, 384 model homes and 1,537 inventory units, of which 201 were finished.\nThe Company finished the quarter with $288 million in cash and a net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio of 33.1 percent. As of March 31, 2018, Taylor Morrison owned or controlled approximately 37,000 lots, representing 4.7 years of supply, and is focused on securing land for 2020 and beyond.\nQuarterly Financial Comparison\n($ thousands)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nTotal Revenue\n$752,333\n$769,090\n(2.2)\n%\nHome Closings Revenue\n$732,959\n$751,485\n(2.5)\n%\nHome Closings Gross Margin\n$138,053\n$135,190\n2.1\n%\n18.8\n%\n18.0\n%\n80 bps increase\nSG&A\n% of Home Closings Revenue\n$87,016\n$88,745\n(1.9)\n%\n11.9\n%\n11.8\n%\n10 bps increase\nSecond Quarter and Full Year 2018 Business Outlook\nSecond Quarter 2018:\nAverage active community count is expected to be between 295 to 300 Home closings are expected to be between 1,800 to 1,900 Home closings margin, inclusive of capitalized interest is expected to be approximately 18 percent\nFull Year 2018:\nAverage active community count is expected to be flat compared to 2017 Monthly absorption pace is expected to be between 2.4 to 2.5 per outlet on average Home closings are expected to be between 8,400 to 8,800 Home closings gross margin, inclusive of capitalized interest, is expected to be accretive to 2017 and be in the mid to high 18 percent range SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenue is expected to be in the low 10 percent range Income from unconsolidated joint ventures is expected to be between $8 million to $10 million Land and development spend is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion Effective tax rate is expected to be between 24 and 26 percent Diluted share count is expected to be about 114 million\nEarnings Webcast\nA public webcast to discuss the first quarter 2018 earnings will be held later today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.

Net homebuilding debt to capitalization is a non-GAAP financial measure we calculate by dividing (i) total debt, less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, by (ii) total capitalization (the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders' equity).\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis, as well as the performance of our regions, and to set targets for performance-based compensation. We also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry. In the future, we may include additional adjustments in the above described non-GAAP financial measures to the extent we deem them appropriate and useful to management and investors.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it allows investors to evaluate our performance without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Adjusted EBITDA also provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization, or non-recurring items. Because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry, we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures of our operating performance or liquidity. Although other companies in the homebuilding industry may report similar information, their definitions may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures before comparing their measures to ours.\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNet income before allocation to non-controlling interests\n$\n47,532\n$\n35,601\nInterest income, net\n(343)\n(90)\nAmortization of capitalized interest\n14,848\n20,297\nIncome tax provision\n11,706\n18,873\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,033\n1,071\nEBITDA\n$\n74,776\n$\n75,752\nNon-cash compensation expense\n3,543\n3,012\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n78,319\n$\n78,764\nNet Homebuilding Debt to Capitalization Ratio Reconciliation\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAs of\nMarch 31, 2018\nTotal debt\n$\n1,405,045\nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n9,638\nLess mortgage warehouse borrowings\n41,522\nTotal homebuilding debt\n$\n1,373,161\nLess cash and cash equivalents\n287,970\nNet homebuilding debt\n$\n1,085,191\nTotal equity\n2,195,630\nTotal capitalization\n$\n3,280,821\nNet homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio\n33.1\n%\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taylor-morrison-reports-first-quarter-sales-pace-of-2-8-and-earnings-per-share-of-0-41--300640643.html\nSOURCE Taylor Morrison",
