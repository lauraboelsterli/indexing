    "text": "0 COMMENTS Photo: Sean Gallup/Getty Images\nEvery week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications.\nThe push to hack back. The New Yorker’s Nicholas Schmidle reports on the legal effort to allow victims of cybercrimes, including companies and private citizens, the freedom to hack their attackers. Proponents include researchers at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, authors of a report comparing today’s internet to the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. The region was riddled with piracy until recently when ships started hiring armed guards. Others think that allowing companies to hack back is a setup for disaster. “An epically stupid idea,” Richard Ledgett, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, tells Mr. Schmidle. Former NSA Director Keith Alexander agrees: “You can’t have companies starting a war.”\nAgile at scale. Agile teams are the commandos of the enterprise, achieving high-profile outcomes outside the usual chain-of-command. Not long ago, scaling this kind of effort across the enterprise sounded preposterous…until Amazon.com Inc. , Facebook Inc. , Tesla Inc. , etc. “Scaling up shifts the mix of work so that the business is doing more innovation relative to routine operations,” write Darrell K. Rigby, Jeff Sutherland and Andy Noble in Harvard Business Review . But to scale agile, a number of executives moves must take place, starting with educating the enterprise on agile values, establishing new operating architectures where work streams can be modularized, and dropping the annual planning and budgeting cycles.\nDo unto your virtual assistant. Slate’s Rachel Withers worries that the rise of virtual assistants threatens basic civility, as more of the help people receive comes from algorithms that don’t care if they are being yelled at. And for the record, she’s not interested in being with anyone who rudely barks orders at Alexa or Cortana. Writes Ms. Withers: “The tone of voice that we use in a growing percentage of our daily interactions matters—not for Alexa, not for Amazon, not for Apple, but for us.”\nShare this: AGILE HACKING VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS Previous Amid Blockchain Hype, Few Deployments, Limited Interest, Survey Finds",
