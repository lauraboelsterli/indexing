This technique enables the transformation of tissue into a nanoporous, hydrogel-hybridized form that is crosslinked to a three-dimensional network of hydrophilic polymers. The process produces a fully assembled, intact tissue, which is permeable to macromolecules and optically transparent, thus allowing for robust three-dimensional imaging of subcellular components (DNA, RNA and protein) and heterogeneous cellular interactions within the microenvironment of a tissue. This technology, paired with the development of a multi-sample tissue imaging/image analysis platform that will enable a better of normal and diseased tissue.\nVisit us at www.clearlightdx.com .\nContact:\nLaurie Goodman, PhD, Interim CEO, CSO\n194710@email4pr.com\n(800) 251-8905\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clearlight-diagnostics-announces-the-appointment-of-laurie-goodman-phd-as-interim-chief-executive-officer-and-the-close-of-an-additional-round-of-funding-300644449.html\nSOURCE ClearLight Diagnostics, LLC",
