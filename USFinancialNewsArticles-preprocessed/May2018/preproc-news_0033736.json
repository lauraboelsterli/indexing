    "text": "May 15, 2018 / 8:41 AM / Updated 8 hours ago Rugby Union: World Cup stadium a 'beacon of hope and inspiration', says Beaumont Jack Tarrant 2 Min Read\nTOKYO, Japan (Reuters) - When the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium opens for the first time in August it will be a landmark moment for rugby in Japan as well as for the regions ravaged by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont said on Tuesday.
