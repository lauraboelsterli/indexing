    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 11:25 PM / Updated an hour ago Xerox names John Visentin as CEO after scrapping Fujifilm deal Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) has appointed John Visentin as chief executive officer and set July 31 for its annual shareholders meeting, the U.S. photocopier maker said on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Xerox company is seen on a building in Minsk, Belarus, March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko/File Photo\nVisentin was also elected vice chairman of the board with Keith Cozza elected as chairman, Xerox said in a statement.\nVisentin replaces CEO Jeff Jacobson, the main architect of a proposed $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp ( 4901.T ) which was scrapped this week in a settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason that handed control of the U.S. company to new management.\nFive other directors would step down as well under the settlement.\nIn January, Xerox and Fujifilm had agreed to the complex deal to merge Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and give Fujifilm control.\nIcahn and Deason, who own a combined 15 percent of Xerox, had launched a proxy fight arguing that the deal undervalued the U.S. company.\nVisentin, who had also been under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, had been hired by Icahn to assist in his campaign against Xerox.
