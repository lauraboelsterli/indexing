McCormack, Senior Vice President & CFO, commented, “Our year to date free cash flow was affected by an increase in accounts receivable principally derived from domestic sonobuoy production.

On May 3, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 to its credit facility which provided for, among other things, increased permitted total funded debt to EBITDA ratio to 4.5x for fiscal quarters ending April 1, 2018 and July 1, 2018 and a reduction of the facility from $125 million to $120 million. The Company has met this covenant for the quarter ended April 1, 2018 and anticipates compliance for the quarter ended July 1, 2018. Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018 and thereafter, the funded debt to EBITDA ratio will be 3.0x. The covenant relief was provided as the Company completes its exploration of a potential sale transaction. In the event that the Company does not consummate a sale transaction prior to September 30, 2018, the Company believes that it will be able to restructure its long-term debt in order to provide for sufficient liquidity for its anticipated needs for the next 12 months.\nPotential Sale Transaction\nOn March 5, 2018, Sparton Corporation (\"Sparton\") announced the termination by Sparton and Ultra Electronics Holdings plc (“Ultra”) of their July 7, 2017 merger agreement as a result of the staff of the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) informing the parties that it intended to recommend that the DOJ block the merger. At that time, the Company announced that it will seek to re-engage with parties that previously expressed an interest in acquiring all or a part of Sparton and that are in a position to expeditiously proceed to effect such a transaction. The Company is currently in active discussions with interested parties. There can be no assurance these discussions will result in the execution of a definitive agreement or the completion of a transaction.\nERAPSCO Joint Venture\nOn March 5, 2018, Sparton announced that, during the DOJ’s review of Sparton’s proposed merger with Ultra, the United States Navy (the “Navy”) expressed the view that instead of the parties proceeding with the merger, each of Sparton and Ultra should enhance its ability to independently develop, produce and sell sonobuoys and over time work toward the elimination of their use of Sparton’s and Ultra’s joint venture for such activities. Since that time, Sparton has been in communication with the Navy to better understand its expectations with respect to the timing, funding and terms of current and future sonobuoy IDIQ production contracts. While no deadlines have been established nor funding decisions agreed upon, we believe the Navy would find it desirable if Sparton and Ultra were in a position to eliminate the use of the ERAPSCO joint venture for the sale of sonobuoys to the Navy by September 2024, which is the end of the GFY19-GFY23 IDIQ contract. Due to the significance of the effort and expenditures required, there can be no assurance that Sparton, or both of the ERAPSCO joint venture partners, will be able to independently develop, produce and sell fully qualified sonobuoys by that time, or at an earlier date if so required by the Navy. The GFY19-GFY23 IDIQ contract is currently under evaluation, and we anticipate that an award will be made by the Navy in GFY19 and that final delivery will be scheduled to occur in 2024. Additionally, we understand that there will be no impact on the existing GFY14-GFY18 IDIQ contract which provides for final delivery to occur in 2019.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), Sparton Corporation has provided certain non-GAAP financial measures as additional information for its operating results. These measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from measures used by other companies. Whenever we use non-GAAP financial measures, we designate these measures, which exclude the effects of certain expenses and income, as “adjusted” and provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP financial measures eliminate or add certain items of expense and income from or to operating expense and income taxes. Management believes that this presentation is helpful to investors in evaluating the current operational and financial performance of our business and facilitates comparisons to historical results of operations. Management discloses this information along with a reconciliation of the comparable GAAP amounts to provide access to the detail and nature of adjustments made to GAAP financial results. While some of these excluded items have been periodically reported in our statements of operations, their occurrence in future periods depends on future business and economic factors, among other evaluation criteria, and the occurrence of such events and factors may frequently be beyond the control of management.\nWhen we calculate adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and other adjustments to the statements of income, we exclude certain expenses and income because we believe that they are not related directly to the underlying performance of our fundamental business operations. We exclude these measures when reviewing financial results and for business planning. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these transactions may limit the comparability of our fundamental operations with prior and future periods. We believe EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by financial analysts and others in the industries in which the Company operates and, thus, provides useful information to investors. The Company does not intend, nor should the reader consider, EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA to be an alternative to operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with other companies. Accordingly, the measurement has limitations depending on its use.\nAbout Sparton Corporation\nSparton Corporation (NYSE:SPA), now in its 118th year, is a provider of complex and sophisticated electromechanical devices with capabilities that include concept development, industrial design, design and manufacturing engineering, production, distribution, field service and refurbishment.
