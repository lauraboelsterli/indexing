    "text": "AndreyPopov | Getty Images A warning about a \"new\" international scam targeting Chinese students in Australia was issued by the Australian Federal Police on May 14, 2018.\nIn a typical scenario, students are contacted by someone pretending to be from the Chinese Embassy or Consulate telling them that they have been implicated in a serious crime in China or Taiwan, and asking them to collaborate with investigations.\nThe target is told to hide themselves for a few days and cut off all contact, including with family members in China or Taiwan. The families then receive calls telling them their child studying in Australia has been kidnapped, and a ransom demand is made.\nMore from the Conversation:\nWhy the victim can also become the offender in online fraud",
