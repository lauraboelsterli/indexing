    "text": "TORONTO, May 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IBI Group (TSX:IBG), a global design and technology firm, announced today that it has completed the asset purchase of Ontario-based GreenOwl Mobile, including all intellectual property. The GreenOwl technical team will also be joining IBI Group as part of the acquisition. Founded in 2010, GreenOwl Mobile is a leader in mobile technologies for smart cities. It has developed and deployed numerous award-winning solutions for transportation authorities, cities, municipalities, and private media corporations. The closing of the asset purchase supports the ongoing integration of technology in all IBI Group practice areas, and is a key next step in achieving this important objective of the firm’s new Strategic Plan.\n“This acquisition supports our competitive edge in the market as a technology-driven design firm. Having worked closely with the GreenOwl Mobile team for many years, we’re excited about the skillset that they bring to the table. From traveler information systems, to the internal processes required to support the development of new communities, mobile technology continues to evolve, and there are opportunities to rethink the way we are delivering our solutions across all disciplines within the firm,” said Scott Stewart, IBI Group CEO.\n“GreenOwl shares a similar vision to IBI Group, of using technology to solve the world's most pressing issues, like the impact that rapid urbanization will have on cities. We are ecstatic to join IBI and be part of this bigger vision. We are also glad that IBI sees the value GreenOwl will bring to their digital transformation,” said Matt Man, GreenOwl Mobile Founder.\nGreenOwl Mobile specializes in the design of mobile and IoT product experiences for both the public and private sectors. Its core offering supports the collection and dissemination of geo-location information. With offices in Toronto and California, the company has implemented more than 45 iOS, Android, HTML5, and Blackberry mobile apps for clients including transportation authorities, municipalities and media corporations.
