Overall student interest is strong and we remain committed to further improving retention and delivering quality academic outcomes while executing against our objectives of sustainable and responsible growth.”\nREVENUE\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, total revenue was $148.1 million, representing an 8.7 percent decrease from $162.1 million in comparison to the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by declining revenues within our teach-out campuses. As of March 31, 2018, there are six campuses remaining to complete their teach-outs during the remainder of 2018 as compared to 28 campuses as of March 31, 2017.\nFor The Quarter Ended March 31, Revenue ($ in thousands) 2018 2017 Increase\n(Decrease)\nCTU $ 94,607 $ 94,035 0.6 % AIU 53,121 54,253 -2.1 % Total University Group 147,728 148,288 -0.4 % Corporate and Other — — NM Subtotal 147,728 148,288 -0.4 % All Other Campuses (1) 337 13,821 -97.6 % Total $ 148,065 $ 162,109 -8.7 % (1) Campuses included in All Other Campuses are in the process of being taught out or have completed their teach-out as of March 31, 2018. Previously, these campuses were reported within two segments, the former Transitional Group and Culinary Arts segments. TOTAL AND NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total student enrollments for the University Group were 33,100 compared to 34,100 in the prior year quarter, representing a 2.9 percent decrease . The decrease in enrollments at AIU was primarily driven by the timing impact of the academic calendar redesign.\nAs of March 31, Total Student Enrollments 2018 2017 Increase\n(Decrease)\nCTU 22,200 21,600 2.8 % AIU 10,900 12,500 -12.8 % Total University Group 33,100 34,100 -2.9 % All Other Campuses (1) 60 2,100 NM Total 33,160 36,200 -8.4 % For The Quarter Ended March 31, New Student Enrollments 2018 2017 Increase\n(Decrease)\nCTU 5,260 5,030 4.6 % AIU 2,390 4,930 -51.5 % Total University Group 7,650 9,960 -23.2 % (1) All Other Campuses no longer enroll new students. OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded operating income of $20.5 million compared to operating income of $9.8 million in the prior year quarter. The University Group and Corporate recorded operating income of $26.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to operating income of $23.1 million in the prior year quarter.\nOperating income reported for the current year improved by $10.7 million primarily driven by reduced operating expenses associated with the substantial completion of the teach-out of the All Other Campuses segment, as well as continued efficiencies of marketing and advertising costs within the University Group.\nFor The Quarter Ended March 31, Operating Income (Loss) ($ in thousands) 2018 2017 Increase\n(Decrease)\nCTU $ 27,185 $ 23,020 18.1 % AIU 4,136 4,656 -11.2 % Total University Group 31,321 27,676 13.2 % Corporate and Other (4,542 ) (4,549 ) 0.2 % Subtotal 26,779 23,127 15.8 % All Other Campuses (6,250 ) (13,346 ) 53.2 % Total $ 20,529 $ 9,781 109.9 % ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\nThe Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant and non-cash items, as a means to understand the performance of its operations. (See tables below and the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation attached to this press release for further details.)\nAs shown in the table below, adjusted operating income for the University Group and Corporate was $29.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to adjusted operating income of $25.7 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating loss for All Other Campuses was $3.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to an adjusted operating loss of $9.8 million in the prior year quarter.\nFor The Quarter Ended March 31, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)\n2018 2017 University Group and Corporate:\nOperating income $ 26,779 $ 23,127 Depreciation and amortization 2,467 2,531 Adjusted Operating Income -- University Group and Corporate $ 29,246 $ 25,658 Increase (Decrease) 14.0 % All Other Campuses\nOperating loss $ (6,250 ) $ (13,346 ) Depreciation and amortization 115 1,379 Unused space charges (1) (751 ) 2,157 Significant legal settlements 3,491 — Adjusted Operating Loss -- All Other Campuses $ (3,395 ) $ (9,810 ) Increase (Decrease) 65.4 % (1) Unused space charges represent the net present value of remaining lease obligations for vacated space less an estimated amount for sublease income. As terminations or subleases for leased spaces occur, estimated amounts may be reversed or increased. BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $11.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $39.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The improvement in cash flow from operations was primarily driven by $32.0 million of legal settlement payments in the prior year quarter and reduced operating losses at our teach-out campuses in the current quarter.\nFor The Quarter Ended March 31, Selected Cash Flow Items\n2018 2017 Increase\n(Decrease)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 11,096 $ (39,053 ) 128.4 % Capital expenditures $ 1,360 $ 735 85.0 % As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale short-term investments (“cash balances”) totaled $187.6 million and $180.1 million, respectively.\nOUTLOOK\nConsistent with the objective of sustainable and responsible growth, the Company is affirming its previously provided full year outlook for adjusted operating income and ending cash balances for 2018 and 2019. The Company currently expects the following results, subject to the key assumptions identified below (see the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for adjusted operating income (loss) attached to this press release for further details):\nFinancial Outlook:\nFull year 2018: total company adjusted operating income in the range of $99 million to $106 million and University Group and Corporate in the range of $110 million to $115 million. Second quarter 2018: total company adjusted operating income in the range of $19.5 million to $21.5 million and University Group and Corporate in the range of $22.5 million to $24 million. Year end 2018 cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments to be in the range of $220 million to $225 million. Adjusted operating income for the total company to grow in 2019 as compared to 2018 and our ending cash balance for 2019 to increase as compared to 2018.\nUniversity Group Enrollment Outlook:\nCTU New student enrollments for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to increase as compared to the prior year quarter. AIU: We expect growth in new student enrollments in the second and third quarter. This growth is expected to approximately offset the decline in the first quarter of 2018. We expect 2018 full year revenue growth at AIU.\nOperating income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to adjusted operating income (loss), may not follow the same trends as discussed in the outlook above because of adjustments made for unused space charges that represent the present value of future remaining lease obligations for vacated space less an estimated amount for sublease income as well as depreciation, amortization, asset impairment charges and significant legal settlements. The operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss), enrollment and cash outlook provided above for 2018 and 2019 are based on the following key assumptions and factors, among others: (i) prospective student interest in the Company’s programs continues to trend in line with recent experiences, (ii) initiatives and investments in student-serving processes and initiatives continue to positively impact enrollment trends within the University Group, (iii) achievement of anticipated recovery rates for the Company’s real estate obligations and timing of any associated lease termination payments in line with current expectations, (iv) no material changes in the current legal or regulatory environment, and excludes legal and regulatory liabilities and other related impacts which are not probable and estimable at this time, and any impact of new or proposed regulations, including the “borrower defense to repayment” and gainful employment regulations and any modifications thereto, and (v) no material changes in the estimated amount of compensation expense that could be impacted by changes in the Company’s stock price. Although these estimates and assumptions are based upon management’s good faith beliefs regarding current events and actions that may be undertaken in the future, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nCareer Education Corporation will host a conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 5:30 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.

$21.5M $100M - $105M Depreciation and amortization ~2.5 ~10M Adjusted Operating Income $22.5M - $24M $110M - $115M (1) The Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain significant and non-cash items as a means to understand the performance of its operations. As a general matter, the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP to help analyze the performance of its operations, assist with preparing the annual operating plan, and measure performance for some forms of compensation. In addition, the Company believes that non-GAAP financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company’s historical results and to provide estimates of future performance. The Company believes adjusted operating income (loss) allows it to analyze and assess its ongoing operations and compare current operating results with the operational performance of other companies in its industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by items it does not consider reflective of underlying operating performance, such as unused space charges and significant legal reserves. In evaluating adjusted operating income (loss), investors should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to the adjustments presented above. The presentation of adjusted operating income (loss) should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine or non-recurring. Adjusted operating income (loss) has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), or any other performance measure derived in accordance and reported under GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in a reconciliation to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide an additional way of viewing the Company’s results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. (2) Operating income for the University Group and Corporate and operating loss for All Other Campuses make up the components of operating income. A reconciliation of these components for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is presented below: For The Quarter Ended March 31, ACTUAL 2018 2017 Operating income for University Group and Corporate $ 26,779 $ 23,127 Operating loss for All Other Campuses (6,250 ) (13,346 ) Operating income $ 20,529 $ 9,781 (3) Amounts relate to the University Group and Corporate. (4) Unused space charges represent the net present value of remaining lease obligations for vacated space less an estimated amount for sublease income. These charges relate to exiting leased space as the Company continues to right-size the organization and therefore are not considered representative of ongoing operations. (5) Management assesses results of operations for the University Group and Corporate separately from All Other Campuses. As All Other Campuses have been announced for teach-out or have been taught out, management views these operations as not reflective of the ongoing business. As a result, management views adjusted operating income from the University Group and Corporate separately from the remainder of the organization, to assess results and make decisions. (6) Amounts relate to All Other Campuses.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006644/en/\nInvestors:\nAlpha IR Group\nChris Hodges or Sam Gibbons\n(312) 445-2870\nCECO@alpha-ir.com\nOr\nMedia:\nCareer Education Corporation\n(847) 585-2600\nmedia@careered.com\nSource: Career Education Corporation",
