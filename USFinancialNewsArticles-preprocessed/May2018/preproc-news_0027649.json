    "text": "20 COMMENTS Now that this year’s Nobel Prize for Literature has been canceled, I wonder if the unused money shouldn’t be used to establish a wholly new but long-needed award—one for marriage. The Nobel Prize for Marriage would go to men or women who have long suffered in difficult unions and stuck it out to the lugubrious end. Certain standards would have to be met: All candidates for the prize must have been married to the same person for 10 years or more; evidence of egregious behavior on the part of the offending spouse must be ample; and physical abuse does not qualify, for the punishment undergone by all candidates must have been psychological.\nTo set the standard, many of the early prizes would have to be awarded retroactively to historical figures. Surely Socrates, married to that many-years-younger harridan Xanthippe, would be in line for a Nobel. She regularly embarrassed him by showing up with their children to drag him home from the agora. Modern feminists, perhaps, would say that Xanthippe is more deserving of the prize, having stood by a man who spent every available hour away from home attempting to teach the young men of Athens that they didn’t know what they thought they did. But then nobody said that the committee’s selections for the Marriage Nobels figure to be any less controversial than the awards in literature or other fields.\nCountess Sophia Tolstoy is a shoo-in for the prize. When her marriage to Leo began, he presented his old diaries for her to read, diaries filled with accounts of his lust, whoring and toppling female serfs on Yasnaya Polyana, his estate 120 miles from Moscow. Then there were all those annoying Tolstoyans—vegetarians, fruit-juice drinkers, utopians of every stripe—her husband encouraged to hang around the house. A few even moved in. To top it all, at the close of their lives together her Lev ran off to die alone at a small railway station in the middle of Russia. Well, not quite alone, since no death before his was covered, on the scene, so thoroughly as his by journalists of nearly every nation. Yes, Countess, it may not make up for all the inconvenience, irritation, embarrassment and sheer selfishness you suffered, but the hope is that a gold medallion from the king of Sweden might nonetheless be some small recompense.\nThe next logical candidate for the Marriage Nobel is Leonard Woolf, husband of Virginia. This patient Jewish man, a socialist of the heart, married a woman who was not only an anti-Semite but also quite nuts. We cannot know what Leonard felt when word reached him that his wife, on March 29, 1941, had filled up her pockets with rocks and walked into the River Ouse. Relief, though, seems a distinct possibility. Even in death she was a pain in the neck, for her body floated down river and wasn’t discovered until it washed up nearly three weeks later. Her last note to him, assuring him of his patience and goodness to her, couldn’t have been much help. One likes to think a posthumous Nobel Prize would be.\nSome Marriage Nobels will surely have to be split between spouses. One thinks first of the Carlyles, Thomas and Mary, whose tempestuous and possibly never consummated marriage caused Samuel Butler to remark: “It was very good of God to let Carlyle and Mrs. Carlyle marry one another, and so make only two people miserable and not four.” But the joint Nobelists are not likely to be few. The Trillings, Lionel and Diana, might well be in for one; devout Freudians both, they were said to be unable to go off on holiday without a therapist riding in the back seat. A pity Edmund Wilson and Mary McCarthy’s marriage didn’t make the 10-year qualifying limit, since wedlock between two of the cruelest put-down artists in the business would have been an odds-on favorite. When their divorce proceedings were eventually published in the New York Times long after their deaths—citing in detail the insults, physical violence and general contempt each accused the other of perpetrating—my friend Hilton Kramer remarked that he was certain both parties were telling the absolute truth.\nAs for contemporary candidates for the Marriage Nobel, Hillary Clinton will be on everybody’s list. One likes to think the award might be some small compensation for the 2016 election, though given how that loss has put Mrs. Clinton into a perpetual snit, it is possible that Bill Clinton’s own candidacy for the prize has to be seriously considered. Mrs. Harvey Weinstein’s Nobel goes quite without saying. Is Melania Trump a serious candidate for the prize? You would have to ask Stormy Daniels.\nThe Nobel Prize for Marriage, if established, would be the ultimate consolation prize, recognition and reward for those all those years of mental suffering. And let’s not forget the money. With it in hand, the winners could cry all the way to the bank.\nMr. Epstein is author of the forthcoming “The Ideal of Culture and Other Essays” (Axios Press) and “Charm: The Elusive Enchantment” (Taylor Trade), both to be published in 2018.",
