    "text": "Executes Record Number of New Leases and Delivers Strong Same-Center NOI Growth\nCINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II, Inc. , a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on the acquisition and management of well-occupied grocery-anchored shopping centers, reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and increased its estimated value per share to $22.80 as of March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights (vs. First Quarter 2017)\nAcquired one grocery-anchored shopping center for a total cost of $18.5 million Net loss totaled $1.3 million Funds from operations (FFO) increased 4.6% to $18.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share Modified funds from operations (MFFO) increased 7.7% to $16.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share Same-center net operating income (NOI) increased 4.8% to $25.2 million Net Debt to Total Enterprise Value was 42.9% at quarter-end Outstanding debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.5% and 89.7% was fixed-rate debt\nEstimated Value per Share Update\nOn May 9, 2018, the company’s board of directors increased the estimated value per share of its common stock to $22.80 as of March 31, 2018, based on the range of $21.27 to $24.17 provided by Duff & Phelps, an independent third-party valuation firm.\nManagement Commentary\n“Our portfolio of well-occupied grocery-anchored shopping centers produced strong results during the first quarter of 2018, as illustrated by our 7.7% increase in MFFO and 4.8% increase in same-center NOI,” said Jeff Edison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II. “Our strategy of owning centers in strong demographic markets that provide necessity-based goods and services continues to yield strong results.”\n“We increased the estimated value per share to $22.80 because of the continued successful execution of our business strategy, which is producing increases in both revenue and cash flow – in spite of recent adverse retail headlines. We believe the current disconnect in the private and public market valuations of retail real estate to be unfounded considering the positive operating fundamentals we are seeing at our centers.”\nFirst Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 Financial Results\nNet Loss\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, net loss totaled $1.3 million compared to net loss of $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The results were primarily driven by a $1.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to owning an additional eight properties when compared to March 31, 2017.\nFunds from Operations (FFO) as Defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT)\nFor the first quarter of 2018, FFO totaled $18.2 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to $17.4 million, or $0.37 per share, during the first quarter of 2017. The improvement in FFO was driven by an increase in net operating income generated by additional properties owned and the 4.8% increase in same-center NOI.\nModified Funds from Operations (MFFO)\nFor the first quarter of 2018, MFFO increased 7.7% to $16.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $15.5 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in MFFO was directly correlated to the increase in FFO.\nSame-Center Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, same-center NOI increased 4.8% to $25.2 million, compared to $24.1 million during the first quarter of 2017. The improvement was driven by a 0.9% increase in same-center occupancy to 95.0% as well as a $0.05 increase in minimum rent per square foot versus the comparable period.\nContributing to same-center NOI were 74 properties that were owned and operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods.\nFirst Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 Portfolio Results\nPortfolio Statistics\nAt quarter-end, the portfolio consisted of 86 properties, totaling approximately 10.3 million square feet located in 24 states. This compares to 78 properties, totaling approximately 9.6 million square feet located in 24 states as of March 31, 2017.\nLeased portfolio occupancy totaled 95.1%, an improvement from 94.5% as of March 31, 2017.\nLeasing Activity\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, 68 leases (new, renewal and options) were executed totaling approximately 305,000 square feet. This compares to 52 leases (new, renewal and options) executed totaling 159,000 square feet during the first quarter of 2017.\nComparable rent spreads during the quarter, which compare the percentage increase (or decrease) of new or renewal leases to the expiring lease of a unit that was occupied within the past 12 months, were 9.9% for new leases and 9.8% for renewal leases.\nAcquisition Activity\nOne grocery-anchored shopping center was acquired for a total cost of $18.5 million during the first quarter of 2018. The property, located in Arlington, Texas, is anchored by Walmart Neighborhood Market and totals 113,742 square feet.\nBalance Sheet Highlights at March 31, 2018\nAt quarter-end, the company had $267.4 million of borrowing capacity available on its $350.0 million revolving credit facility.\nNet debt to total enterprise value was 42.9% at March 31, 2018. Please see the Net Debt to Total Enterprise Value table for additional disclosure.\nThe company’s outstanding debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.5%, a weighted-average maturity of 3.2 years, and 89.7% of its total debt was fixed-rate debt at March 31, 2018. This compared to a weighted-average interest rate of 3.5%, a weighted average maturity of 3.5 years, and 92.6% fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2017.\nEstimated Value Per Share\nEffective May 9, 2018, the company’s board of directors increased the estimated value per share of its common stock to $22.80 as of March 31, 2018.\nDuff & Phelps was engaged to provide a calculation of the range in estimated value per share of the company’s common stock as of March 31, 2018. Duff & Phelps prepared a valuation report based substantially on its estimate of the “as is” market values of the company’s portfolio, adjusted to reflect balance sheet assets and liabilities provided by company management as of March 31, 2018, before calculating a range of estimated per share values based on the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of quarter end. These calculations produced an estimated value per share in the range of $21.27 to $24.17.\nFor a full description of the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the estimated value per share, see the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to be filed with the SEC, which will be accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Distributions\nGross distributions of $19.1 million were paid during the first quarter of 2018, including $8.8 million reinvested through the distribution reinvestment plan, for net cash distributions of approximately $10.3 million.\nDuring the quarter, FFO was $18.2 million, which was 95% of the company's gross distributions, marking an improvement from 89% during the previous quarter.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, the company’s board of directors authorized distributions for June 2018, July 2018, and August 2018 in the amount of $0.13541652 per share to the shareholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2018, July 16, 2018, and August 15, 2018, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Program (SRP)\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, approximately 259,000 shares of common stock, totaling $5.9 million, were repurchased at $22.75 per share under the SRP during the quarter.\nSubsequent to the quarter end, in April 2018, approximately 293,000 shares of common stock, totaling $6.7 million, were repurchased at $22.75 per share under the SRP. Standard repurchase requests surpassed the funding limits under the SRP resulting in the company processing standard repurchase requests on a pro rata basis.\nThe company will continue to fulfill repurchases sought upon a stockholder’s death, “qualifying disability,” or “determination of incompetence” in accordance with the terms of the SRP.\nDue to the program’s funding limits, repurchases during the remainder of 2018 are expected to be limited. Cash available for standard repurchases on any particular date under the SRP is generally limited to the proceeds from the dividend reinvestment plan during the preceding four quarters, less amounts already used for repurchases during the same time period.\nStockholder Update Call\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer Mark Addy will host a presentation addressing the company’s results on Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\nInterested parties will be able to access the listen-only presentation online or by telephone. If dialing in, please call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time as an operator will register your name and organization. Participants should ask to join the Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II call.\nDate: Thursday, May 10, 2018\nTime: 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time\nWebcast link: https://services.choruscall.com/links/peco180510reit2.html\nU.S. listen-only: (888) 346-2646\nInternational listen-only: (412) 317-5249\nA webcast replay will be available approximately one hour after the conclusion of the presentation in the Events & Presentations section of the Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II website at http://investors.grocerycenterreit2.com/event .\nFor investor-related updates on Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II, please visit www.grocerycenterreit2.com/investors .\nFor more information on the company’s quarterly results, please refer to the company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which will be filed with the SEC and available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nNon-GAAP Disclosures\nSame-Center Net Operating Income\nSame-Center NOI is presented as a supplemental measure of the company’s performance. NOI is defined as total operating revenues less property operating expenses, real estate taxes, and non-cash revenue items. Same-Center NOI represents the NOI for the 74 properties that were wholly-owned and operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods. The company believes that NOI and Same-Center NOI provide useful information to its investors about its financial and operating performance because each provides a performance measure of the revenues and expenses directly involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income. Because Same-Center NOI excludes the change in NOI from properties acquired after December 31, 2016, it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates, and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Same-Center NOI, and accordingly, the company’s Same-Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nSame-Center NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of the company’s financial performance since it does not reflect the operations of its entire portfolio, nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income, or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of its properties that could materially impact results from operations.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nFFO is a non-GAAP performance financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. The company uses FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) to be net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.\nMFFO is an additional performance financial measure used by us as FFO includes certain non-comparable items that affect the company’s performance over time. MFFO excludes the following items:\nacquisition fees and expenses; straight-line rent amounts, both income and expense; amortization of above- or below-market intangible lease assets and liabilities; amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments; gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; gains or losses on the extinguishment of derivatives, except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of our operations; gains or losses related to fair-value adjustments for derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting; gains or losses related to consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; and adjustments related to the above items for unconsolidated entities in the application of equity accounting.\nThe company believes that MFFO is helpful in assisting management and investors with the assessment of the sustainability of operating performance in future periods. Neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations under GAAP, nor as an indication of liquidity, nor is either of these measures indicative of funds available to fund the company’s cash needs, including the company’s ability to fund distributions. MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if the company does not continue to operate its business plan in the manner currently contemplated.\nAccordingly, FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements. FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as more prominent measures of performance than net income or cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. FFO and MFFO as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs.\nPHILLIPS EDISON GROCERY CENTER REIT II, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF MARCH 31, 2018 AND DECEMBER 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 ASSETS Investment in real estate: Land and improvements $ 525,500 $ 520,526 Building and improvements 1,062,353 1,047,758 Acquired in-place lease assets 160,261 158,510 Acquired above-market lease assets 15,017 14,742 Total investment in property 1,763,131 1,741,536 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (176,411 ) (157,290 ) Net investment in property 1,586,720 1,584,246 Investment in unconsolidated joint venture 15,463 16,076 Total investment in real estate assets, net 1,602,183 1,600,322 Cash and cash equivalents 2,998 1,435 Restricted cash 4,748 4,382 Other assets, net 54,244 46,178 Total assets $ 1,664,173 $ 1,652,317 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Liabilities: Debt obligations, net $ 799,651 $ 775,275 Acquired below-market lease liabilities, net of accumulated amortization of $12,123 and $10,959, respectively 54,394 54,994 Accounts payable – affiliates 1,772 1,808 Accounts payable and other liabilities 35,504 36,961 Total liabilities 891,321 869,038 Commitments and contingencies (Note 7) — — Equity: Preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, 10,000 shares authorized, zero shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively — — Common stock, $0.01 par value per share, 1,000,000 shares authorized, 46,713 and 46,584 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively 470 468 Additional paid-in capital 1,034,636 1,031,685 Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) 12,472 6,459 Accumulated deficit (274,726 ) (255,333 ) Total equity 772,852 783,279 Total liabilities and equity $ 1,664,173 $ 1,652,317 PHILLIPS EDISON GROCERY CENTER REIT II, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues: Rental income $ 31,979 $ 28,476 Tenant recovery income 11,885 10,209 Other property income 296 116 Total revenues 44,160 38,801 Expenses: Property operating 7,326 6,603 Real estate taxes 7,023 6,121 General and administrative 4,337 4,613 Depreciation and amortization 18,888 17,022 Total expenses 37,574 34,359 Other: Interest expense, net (7,468 ) (4,474 ) Other expense, net (372 ) (55 ) Net loss $ (1,254 ) $ (87 ) Earnings per common share: Net loss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.03 ) $ (0.00 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic and diluted 46,693 46,512 Comprehensive loss: Net loss $ (1,254 ) $ (87 ) Other comprehensive income: Change in unrealized gain on interest rate swaps 6,013 913 Comprehensive income $ 4,759 $ 826 The table below is a comparison of the Same-Center NOI and 2017 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Revenues: Rental income (1) $ 27,060 $ 26,323 $ 737 Tenant recovery income 10,562 10,071 491 Other property income 240 91 149 Total revenues 37,862 36,485 1,377 3.8 % Operating expenses: Property operating expenses 6,534 6,395 139 Real estate taxes 6,101 6,017 84 Total operating expenses 12,635 12,412 223 1.8 % Total Same-Center NOI $ 25,227 $ 24,073 $ 1,154 4.8 % (1) Excludes straight-line rental income, net amortization of above- and below-market leases, and lease buyout income.
