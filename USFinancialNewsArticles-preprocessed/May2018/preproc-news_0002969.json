    "text": "ST. LOUIS, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Express Scripts Holding Company (Nasdaq: ESRX) announced consolidated 2018 first quarter net income of $623.2 million or $1.10 per diluted share. Consolidated 2018 first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.77.* The Company reaffirms its core business¹ 2018 adjusted EBITDA* guidance in the range of $5,250 million to $5,400 million, which represents growth of 8% over core business 2017 adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of the range.\n\"Our first quarter results reflect our success in driving greater value for clients, delivering better health outcomes for patients and growth in earnings for shareholders,\" said Tim Wentworth, President and CEO. \"Express Scripts' focused business model, our innovative solutions and unmatched clinical care showcase our ability to be a leader in drug trend management and deliver the healthcare changes our country needs to improve care, increase choice and reduce cost. With our expected combination with Cigna, and the addition of eviCore, we are uniquely well positioned to transform healthcare for years to come.\"\nBusiness Outlook\nOn March 8, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Cigna Corporation (\"Cigna\") and certain subsidiaries of Cigna, whereby Cigna will acquire Express Scripts in a cash and stock transaction. The merger is expected to be completed by December 31, 2018. Until the closing, Express Scripts will continue to operate as an independent company.\nThe Company is reaffirming its expected 2019 retention rate range for the 2018 selling season of 96% to 98%. \"Across the board, we are demonstrating strength: our retention rate, continued client uptake of new solutions, and strong selling season results. Over the past several weeks, as I have talked to many clients, one clear theme has emerged: we are a trusted partner, our solutions are in demand, and our approach to managing benefits produces exceptional and sustainable results. Express Scripts' commitment to service excellence is at the heart of everything we do and the positive feedback we receive gives us continued confidence in our ability to attract and retain clients,\" said Wentworth. \"Additionally, with our strong retention and year-to-date sales results, we are confident in achieving positive claims growth in the core business in 2019.\"\nConsolidated First Quarter 2018 Review\nThe following compares consolidated first quarter 2018 and 2017 operating results **:\nAdjusted claims of 340.1 million, down 3% GAAP net income of $623.2 million, up 14% GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.10, up 22% Adjusted EBITDA of $1,540.4 million, up 3% Adjusted net income of $1,001.7 million, up 24% Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.77, up 33% Net cash flow provided by operating activities of $1,511.6 million, up 51%\nTotal adjusted claims in the first quarter of 2018 were down 3% from the comparable quarter in 2017 due primarily to the loss of certain public sector clients in the core business during last year's selling season, but were consistent with the Company's previously provided guidance for the quarter.\nNet income, on a GAAP and an adjusted basis, in the first quarter of 2018 was up from the comparable quarter in 2017 primarily due to reduced income tax expense.\nEarnings per diluted share, on a GAAP and an adjusted basis, in the first quarter of 2018 was up from the comparable quarter in 2017 primarily due to reduced shares outstanding and reduced income tax expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 was up 3% from the comparable quarter in 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of eviCore in the 2018 quarter, and to supply chain initiatives, including continued strong performance from the Company's SafeGuardRx suite of solutions and growth in our Accredo specialty pharmacy.\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 was up 51% from the comparable quarter in 2017 due to higher net income and changes in working capital primarily related to timing of accounts payable payments.\nAs previously announced, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company committed to fund $30.0 million in charitable contributions and awarded $23.2 million in non-executive bonuses as a result of federal tax reform legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. The charitable contributions are excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share. However, the Company did not adjust its reported results for the $23.2 million in one-time bonuses.\nThe Company repurchased a total of 5.4 million shares under its share repurchase program for an aggregate of $411.3 million during the first quarter of 2018. The Company has currently suspended its share repurchase program pursuant to the Merger Agreement with Cigna.\nCore Business First Quarter 2018 Review\nThe following compares core business first quarter 2018 and 2017 operating results**:\nAdjusted claims of 284.0 million, down 3% Adjusted EBITDA of $1,060.3 million, up 12%\nAs described above, total adjusted claims were down 3% from the comparable quarter in 2017 due primarily to the previously disclosed losses of certain public sector clients.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company generated $1,060.3 million of core business adjusted EBITDA, representing growth of 12% over comparable 2017 core business adjusted EBITDA. The core business grew earnings primarily due to the inclusion of eviCore in the quarter, as well as supply chain initiatives, specifically continued strong performance from the Company's SafeGuardRx suite of solutions and growth in our Accredo specialty pharmacy.\n2018 Guidance\nAll previously provided guidance remains the same except for consolidated adjusted earnings per diluted share and diluted weighted average shares outstanding guidance due to the suspension of the Company's share repurchase program.\nCurrent Estimated\nGuidance Ranges\nPrevious Estimated\nGuidance Ranges\nChange\nvs. Previous\nGuidance\n(in millions, except per share data)\nYear Ending December\n31, 2018\nYear Ending December\n31, 2018\nCONSOLIDATED GUIDANCE:\nTotal adjusted claims²\n1,345 to 1,395\n1,345 to 1,395\nNo change\nRevenue\n$99,000 to $102,000\n$99,000 to $102,000\nNo change\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$7,600 to $7,800\n$7,600 to $7,800\nNo change\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding during the period\n565 to 575\n540 to 560\nUpdated due to suspension of share repurchase program\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share\n$9.00 to $9.14\n$9.27 to $9.47\nUpdated due to suspension of share repurchase program\nCash flow from operations\n$5,775 to $6,275\n$5,775 to $6,275\nNo change\nCORE BUSINESS GUIDANCE:\nTotal adjusted claims²\n1,125 to 1,165\n1,125 to 1,165\nNo change\nRevenue\n$80,500 to $83,000\n$80,500 to $83,000\nNo change\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$5,250 to $5,400\n$5,250 to $5,400\nNo change\nThe Company expects total adjusted claims for the second quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 335 million to 345 million, of which 280 million to 290 million are attributable to the core business. Consolidated adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018 are estimated to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.22, which represents growth of 26% to 28% over the second quarter of 2017. Consistent with recent years, the Company expects to receive certain revenues related to the structure of its Anthem contract which will be realized in the second quarter of 2018.\n\"Our enterprise value initiative remains a top priority for us and our plans have not changed,\" said Wentworth. Express Scripts' enterprise value initiative is estimated to cost approximately $600 million to $650 million and to deliver cumulative savings of nearly $1.2 billion by 2021, with an annual run rate of between $550 million to $600 million thereafter.\nAdditional details on the consolidated and core business guidance can be found in Table 6. For a description of the financial measures presented herein which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, see \"Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nManagement will not be holding a conference call to review results. A copy of the earnings release will be available at the Investor Information section of Express Scripts' web site at http://www.express-scripts.com/corporate .\nAbout Express Scripts\nExpress Scripts is leading the way for tens of millions of people by aligning with plan sponsors, taking bold action and delivering patient-centered care to make better health more affordable and accessible.\nHeadquartered in St. Louis, Express Scripts provides a full range of integrated pharmacy benefit management services, including home delivery pharmacy care, specialty pharmacy care and benefit management, benefit-design consultation, drug utilization review, formulary management and medical and drug data analysis, that guide patients and plans toward better health by prioritizing quality care at competitive rates.

Adjusted earnings per diluted share (adjusted EPS), EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA per adjusted claim, adjusted net income, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted gross profit and adjusted selling, general and administrative are non-GAAP financial measures presented herein, are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide management and investors with useful information about the earnings impact of certain expenses and are useful for (i) comparison of our earnings to those of other companies; (ii) a better understanding of the Company's ongoing core business performance; (iii) planning and forecasting for future periods; and (iv) assessing period-to-period performance trends. Management assesses the Company's core business operating performance using adjusted EBITDA in order to better isolate the impact of certain expenses that may not be comparable between periods or indicative of the ongoing performance of the business. Adjusted EBITDA per adjusted claim provides management and investors with useful information about the earnings and performance of the Company on a per unit basis.\n2018 Guidance Information: Due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of certain items that would impact EPS and net income, including discrete tax and other items, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the related impact of such items to EPS and net income, the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, respectively. Accordingly, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of 2018 guidance for either adjusted EPS to EPS or adjusted EBITDA to net income. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a significant impact on the Company's second quarter and full-year 2018 GAAP financial results. With respect to consolidated adjusted EPS, amortization of intangible assets is expected to be approximately $0.55 and $2.19 per share for the second quarter and full-year 2018, respectively.\nFinancial Information for our Core Business and Transitioning Clients: The financial measures attributable to our core business and the transitioning clients presented herein, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per adjusted claims are also non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures represent operating results attributable to specific clients of the Company; however, they are not regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer to assess the performance of any of these clients or make decisions about resources to be allocated to any such client. These measures also reflect management's estimates as to allocation of costs of its PBM business to each of the transitioning clients and may not be indicative of costs actually incurred as a result of servicing each of these clients. However, management is unable to reasonably estimate the allocation of certain key items that would impact net income attributable to each of the transitioning clients, including interest and depreciation and amortization. Accordingly, the Company is unable to provide net income attributable to any of the transitioning clients or its core business excluding the transitioning clients, and is therefore also unable to provide a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to transitioning clients or core business. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a significant impact on the Company's long-term outlook for the core business, as discussed above.\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT\nThis press release contains , including, but not limited to, our 2018 guidance, business outlook and our statements related to the Company's plans, objectives, expectations (financial and otherwise) or intentions.

Both direct and indirect costs were allocated based on management's best estimates of costs attributable to servicing each of the Transitioning Clients, and, where appropriate, are based on actual cost or adjusted claims attributable to each of the Transitioning Clients.\n(2) Total adjusted network claims includes an adjustment to reflect non-specialty network claims filled through our 90-day programs. These claims are multiplied by three, as these claims, on average, typically cover a time period three times longer than other network claims.

Intangible amortization of $55.4 million ($42.3 million net of tax) and $55.4 million ($35.0 million net of tax) is included as a reduction to revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSelling, general, and administrative expense includes the amortization of other intangible assets and computer software acquired through business combinations, of $355.4 million ($271.6 million net of tax) and $307.0 million ($194.2 million net of tax) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(5) Transaction costs include those costs directly related to the acquisition of eviCore and the proposed transaction of Cigna. Costs of $35.4 million ($27.0 million net of tax) are primarily composed of professional fees and other compensation costs, and are included in selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n(6) Costs included in cost of revenues (gross profit), primarily comprised of professional fees, severance and other business activity charges in connection with the enterprise value initiative, are $5.3 million ($4.0 million net of tax) for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nCosts included in selling, general and administrative, primarily comprised of professional fees, severance and other business activity charges in connection with the enterprise value initiative, are $12.4 million ($9.5 million net of tax) for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n(7) Costs included in selling, general and administrative, related to charitable contributions made as a result of the tax savings received as part of the 2017 federal tax reform, are $30.0 million ($22.9 million net of tax) for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n(8) Provision for income taxes includes discrete income tax charges of $1.2 million and $29.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2018 net discrete income tax charge primarily relates to change in unrecognized tax benefits. The 2017 net discrete income tax charge primarily relates to changes in unrecognized tax benefits and a revaluation of our net deferred tax attributes.\n(9) Represents adjustment for the tax impact related to non-GAAP items excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. See Table 5 and 5A for calculation of adjusted effective income tax rate.\n(10) Consolidated revenues and Transitioning Clients revenues include intangible amortization related to the customer contract with Anthem of $55.4 million for each of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nInformation included or incorporated by reference in this communication, and information which may be contained in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and press releases or other public statements, contains or may contain These include, among other things, statements of plans, objectives, expectations (financial or otherwise) or intentions.\nForward-looking statements, including as they relate to Express Scripts Holding Company or Cigna Corporation, the management of either such company or the transaction, involve risks and uncertainties.
