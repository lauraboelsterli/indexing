    "text": "9 COMMENTS The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday sought to defend itself from mounting accusations it had irresponsibly relied on inflated statistics about the number of encrypted phones investigators were unable to access last year, saying there was no evidence the error was due to impropriety.\n“There is no indication that this was misconduct,” an FBI official said during a news briefing at the bureau’s headquarters, adding that the error appeared to be the result of a computational mistake.\nFBI Director Christopher Wray and other senior officials repeatedly told Congress and the public in recent months that law-enforcement investigators were unable to unlock nearly 7,800 devices last year due to strong encryption. That figure was significantly overstated, the agency said late Tuesday.\nMr. Wray has ordered an independent review of the miscalculation by the FBI’s inspection division, and the bureau’s technology division is also reviewing the problem, FBI officials said Wednesday.\nFrom the Archives The debate between privacy and national security has never been more heated, with Apple and other tech firms going up against the government. So how are text messages encrypted, and what are the controversial \"backdoors\" that could allow access to them? FBI officials declined to comment on the size of the encryption error, but said it was “significant.” They said they hoped to identity or publish a corrected count soon, but wouldn’t provide more details. The Washington Post reported the error on Tuesday.\nAn internal FBI estimate has calculated the true number of locked devices to be closer to 1,200, according to people who have seen the estimate.\nNews of the error, discovered by the agency in late April, comes as the FBI faces continued criticism from President Donald Trump and some Republicans in Congress, who have accused the bureau of improperly surveilling the Trump presidential campaign in connection to the Russia investigation.\nIt also threatens to further impede the bureau’s largely unsuccessful effort in recent months to kick-start a debate over whether technology companies should be required to provide a way for investigators to lawfully access encrypted devices during a criminal investigation.\nThe miscalculation stemmed from a change the FBI introduced in April 2016 to the way it counted encrypted devices, the bureau said. The new method culled data from three separate databases and contained an undetected coding error that led to some duplicative counting, officials said.\nThe disclosure prompted swift backlash from privacy advocates, who have long questioned the FBI’s claims about the so-called Going Dark problem , a term law-enforcement officials use to describe their inability to unlock encrypted devices seized from criminal suspects, even when makers like Apple are presented with a court order .\nTechnology companies and digital security experts say requiring companies to weaken encryption or provide a means to access the devices would harm overall internet security and empower malicious actors. They also frequently fault the FBI and local law enforcement for not trying other means to pry open devices, including working with third-party firms to hack phones.\nNewsletter Sign-up The decades-old encryption fight exploded into public view in 2016, when the Justice Department sought to force Apple to help open an iPhone connected to a dead gunman involved in a shooting in San Bernardino , Calif. Apple refused, prompting a high-stakes legal showdown . The Justice Department withdrew its demand after finding a way to unlock the iPhone with the help of a third-party vendor.\nIn a letter to Mr. Wray on Wednesday, Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) faulted the FBI for having “repeatedly misled” lawmakers and the public about the scope of the encryption issue.\n“Now we see that the FBI is struggling with basic arithmetic—clearly it should not be in the business of dictating the design of advanced cryptographic algorithms,” wrote Mr. Wyden.\nThe FBI on Wednesday sent a letter to leaders of the House Judiciary Committee notifying lawmakers of the error. The letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, didn’t provide a new estimate or a timetable for when one would be calculated.\nSenior FBI officials said that regardless of the degree of error involved, they don’t expect to retreat from lobbying on the Going Dark issue.\n“Whatever that number is…we still think it is a critical and serious problem,” Paul Abbate, the FBI’s associate deputy director, said at a cybersecurity event Wednesday.",
