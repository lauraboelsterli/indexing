    "text": "Global cash collections of $489 million sets new record\nEstimated Remaining Collections of $7.1 billion establishes new all-time high Announces agreement to acquire the remaining interest in Cabot\nSAN DIEGO, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Encore Capital Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ECPG), an international specialty finance company providing debt recovery solutions for consumers across a broad range of assets, today reported consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nIn a separate press release today, the Company announced an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in Cabot Credit Management.\n“The first quarter for Encore was a period of solid financial and operational performance. In the U.S., our largest market, the supply of charged-off credit card debt continues to grow and we are purchasing large amounts of receivables at the highest returns we’ve seen in several years. We’re in a strong position from a collections capacity perspective and we expect to continue to benefit from these favorable buying conditions for some time,” said Ashish Masih, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We continued investment spending to further build capacity for our U.S. business and accelerated legal spending in the quarter to benefit from consumer liquidity, which in part is a result of the new domestic tax reform. In Europe, Cabot’s liquidation improvement initiatives helped drive a record level of cash collections in the quarter.”\nKey Financial Metrics for the First Quarter of 2018:\nEstimated Remaining Collections (ERC) grew 21% compared to the same period of the prior year, to a record $7.1 billion. Investment in receivable portfolios was $277 million, including $179 million in the U.S. and $87 million in Europe, compared to $219 million deployed overall in the same period a year ago. Gross collections grew 11% to a record $489 million, compared to $441 million in the same period of the prior year. Total revenues, adjusted by net allowance reversals, were $327 million, including revenue associated with Wescot, a leading U.K. contingency debt collection and business process outsourcing (BPO) services company, acquired by Encore’s Cabot subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2017. Total revenues were $272 million in the first quarter of 2017. Total operating expenses were $238 million, compared to $196 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses increased 13% to $188 million, compared to $167 million in the same period of the prior year. Incremental operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 included spending related to collections capacity expansion and accelerated legal spending in the U.S., as well as expenses associated with Wescot. Total interest expense increased to $57.5 million, compared to $49.2 million in the same period of the prior year, principally as a result of larger investments in receivables. GAAP net income attributable to Encore was $21.8 million, or $0.83 per fully diluted share, as compared to $22.3 million, or $0.85 per fully diluted share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted income attributable to Encore was $25.8 million, compared to $24.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted income attributable to Encore per share (also referred to as Economic EPS) was $0.98, compared to $0.95 in the same period of the prior year. Available capacity under Encore’s domestic revolving credit facility, after taking into account borrowing base and applicable debt covenants, was $238 million as of March 31, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast\nEncore will host a conference call and slide presentation today, May 8, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific / 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, presenting and discussing the reported quarterly results, as well as Encore’s agreement to acquire the remaining interest in Cabot Credit Management, which was announced in a separate press release today.\nMembers of the public are invited to access the live webcast via the Internet by logging on at the Investor Relations page of Encore's website at www.encorecapital.com .

A replay of the webcast will also be available shortly after the call on the Company's website.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release includes certain financial measures that exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company has included adjusted income attributable to Encore and adjusted income attributable to Encore per share (also referred to as economic EPS when adjusted for certain shares associated with our convertible notes that will not be issued but are reflected in the fully diluted share count for accounting purposes) because management uses this measure to assess operating performance, in order to highlight trends in the Company’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included information concerning adjusted operating expenses in order to facilitate a comparison of approximate cash costs to cash collections for the portfolio purchasing and recovery business in the periods presented. Adjusted income attributable to Encore, adjusted income attributable to Encore per share/economic EPS, and adjusted operating expenses have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, net income per share, and total operating expenses as indicators of the Company’s operating performance. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures, as presented by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company has attached to this news release a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Encore Capital Group, Inc.\nEncore Capital Group is an international specialty finance company that provides debt recovery solutions for consumers across a broad range of assets.

restructuring related expenses. We adjust for this amount because we believe these expenses are not indicative of ongoing operations; therefore adjusting for these expenses enhances comparability to prior periods, anticipated future periods, and our competitors’ results. Amount represents the net gain recognized as a result of fair value adjustments to contingent considerations that were established for our acquisitions of debt solution service providers in Europe. We have adjusted for this amount because we do not believe this is indicative of ongoing operations. As we continue to acquire debt solution service providers around the world, the acquired intangible assets, such as trade names and customer relationships, have grown substantially. These intangible assets are valued at the time of the acquisition and amortized over their estimated lives. We believe that amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, especially the amortization of an acquired company’s trade names and customer relationships, is the result of pre-acquisition activities. In addition, the amortization of these acquired intangibles is a non-cash static expense that is not affected by operations during any reporting period. As a result, the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets is excluded from our adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore and adjusted income from continuing operations per share. Amount represents expenses related to our process to assess options in relation to a potential initial public offering by our subsidiary Cabot. We adjust for this amount because we believe these expenses are not indicative of ongoing operations; therefore adjusting for these expenses enhances comparability to prior periods, anticipated future periods, and our competitors’ results. Amount represents the total income tax effect of the adjustments, which is generally calculated based on the applicable marginal tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the portion of the adjustment occurred. Certain of the above pre-tax adjustments include expenses recognized by our partially-owned subsidiaries. This adjustment represents the portion of the non-GAAP adjustments that are attributable to noncontrolling interest.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 GAAP total operating expenses, as reported $ 238,336 $ 196,100 Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense (2,276 ) (750 ) Operating expenses related to non-portfolio purchasing and recovery business (1) (46,614 ) (27,946 ) Acquisition, integration and restructuring related expenses (2) (572 ) (855 ) Net gain on fair value adjustments to contingent consideration (3) 2,274 — Expenses related to Cabot IPO (4) $ (2,984 ) $ — Adjusted operating expenses related to portfolio purchasing and recovery business $ 188,164 $ 166,549",
