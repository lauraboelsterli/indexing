Don’s leadership will allow us to manage our growth while enhancing the exceptional reputation Aldevron has built over the past 20 years.”\nDr. Kania brings more than 25 years of experience that includes scientific research and development, global operations, and manufacturing. He served as Chief Executive Officer and President of FEI Company (FEIC) from August 2006 until its sale to Thermo-Fisher in 2016 for $4.2 billion. Prior to FEI, Dr. Kania served as the Chief Operating Officer of Veeco Instruments Inc (VECO), which provides manufacturing and development tools for semiconductors, disk drives, LEDs and academic research. Before serving as COO he had served in roles of increasing responsibility at Veeco since January 1998.\nBeginning in 1993, Dr. Kania served as a Senior Manager of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He served as Research Director of Crystallume, a venture funded thin film diamond company, from 1991 to 1993.
