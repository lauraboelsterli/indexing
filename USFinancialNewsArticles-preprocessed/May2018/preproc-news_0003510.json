    "text": "- Total Revenue Grew 29.1% to $99.1 Million -\n- System-wide Year-Over-Year Unit Growth of 32% -\n- Same-Shack Sales Increased 1.7% -\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Shake Shack Inc. (“Shake Shack” or the “Company”) (NYSE: SHAK) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 28, 2018, a period that included 13 weeks.\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter 2018:\nTotal revenue increased 29.1% to $99.1 million. Shack sales increased 29.6% to $96.1 million. Same-Shack sales increased 1.7%. Operating income increased 15.7% to $6.5 million, or 6.6% of total revenue. Shack-level operating profit*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 28.5% to $24.0 million, or 25.0% of Shack sales. Net income increased 28.9% to $5.0 million and net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. was $3.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 32.8% to $16.2 million. Adjusted pro forma net income*, a non-GAAP measure, increased 54.0% to $5.7 million, or $0.15 per fully exchanged and diluted share. Nine system-wide Shack openings, comprising five domestic company-operated Shacks and four licensed Shacks.\n* Shack-level operating profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted pro forma net income are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, adjusted EBITDA to net income, and adjusted pro forma net income to net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nRandy Garutti, Chief Executive Officer of Shake Shack, stated, “2018 is off to a strong start as we built upon our fourth quarter momentum, reporting another quarter of robust top and bottom-line growth. We delivered year over year revenue growth of approximately 29%, including a 1.7% increase in same-Shack sales and grew adjusted EBITDA by over 30%. These results were supported by the continued evolution of our digital initiatives and the strength of new and existing Shacks as we executed on our development plans.\"\nGarutti concluded, \"Our team is executing the plan to open 32 to 35 new domestic company-operated Shacks in 2018, our biggest year of openings to date. Our domestic pipeline is stronger than ever as we build towards our goal of 200 domestic company-operated Shacks by the end of 2020 and our long-term target of 450. We expect 16 to 18 net new licensed Shacks for the year, with a focus on Asia including our first Shack in Hong Kong which opened on May 1st . Additionally, we are committed to digital innovation to better connect with our guests, delivering ongoing menu innovation, and investing in our people and infrastructure to execute on the significant long-term opportunity ahead.\"\nDevelopment Highlights\nDuring the quarter, the Company opened five domestic company-operated Shacks, including its first Shack in the RINo District in downtown Denver, as well as additional Shacks in the existing markets of Houston, LA, South Florida and New Jersey. The Company also opened four international licensed Shacks; one in each of Saudi Arabia, South Korea and two in Japan.\nLocation Type Opening Date Riyadh, KSA — Riyadh Gallery International Licensed January 4 Incheon, South Korea — Incheon Airport International Licensed January 18 Tokyo, Japan — Tokyo Dome International Licensed February 1 Tokyo, Japan — Futako Tamagawa International Licensed February 28 Houston, TX — Rice Village Domestic Company-Operated February 28 Los Angeles, CA — Downtown LA Domestic Company-Operated March 9 Rino Denver, CO — RiNo Domestic Company-Operated March 21 Marlton, NJ — Marlton Common Domestic Company-Operated March 22 Aventura, FL — Aventura Mall Domestic Company-Operated March 23 Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company opened its first Shack in Charlotte, North Carolina and its first Shack in Hong Kong at the IFC Mall.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Review\nTotal revenue, which includes Shack sales and licensing revenue, increased 29.1% to $99.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, from $76.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Shack sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $96.1 million compared to $74.2 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of $21.9 million, or 29.6%, due primarily to the opening of 24 new domestic company-operated Shacks, as well as same-Shack sales growth. Licensing revenue for the first quarter was $3.0 million, an increase of 16.7% from $2.6 million in the same quarter last year, due primarily to the opening of new licensed Shacks, and the strong performance of the Company's newer Shacks in South Korea and Japan, balanced by continued softness in the Middle East.\nSame-Shack sales increased 1.7% for the first quarter of 2018 versus a 2.5% decline in the first quarter last year. The increase in same-Shack sales, consisted of a combined increase in price and sales mix of 5.9% offset by a 4.2% decrease in guest traffic. Excluding all transactions associated with the free burger promotion in the prior year, same-Shack sales would have been 2.1% in the first quarter with traffic declining by only 2.2%. The comparable Shack base includes those restaurants open for 24 full fiscal months or longer. For the first quarter of 2018, the comparable Shack base included 44 Shacks versus 32 Shacks for the first quarter of 2017.\nAverage weekly sales for domestic company-operated Shacks decreased to $81,000 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $86,000 for the same quarter last year, primarily due to the addition of Shacks at lower volumes to the system.\nOperating income increased 15.7% to $6.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $5.6 million in the same quarter last year. Operating income margins decreased 70 basis points to 6.6%. Shack-level operating profit, a non-GAAP measure, increased 28.5% to $24.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $18.7 million in the same quarter last year. As a percentage of Shack sales, Shack-level operating profit margins decreased 20 basis points to 25.0%. These decreases were primarily due to increased labor and related expenses resulting from ongoing increases in minimum wages, prior year costs associated with the free burger promotion, offset in part by the menu price increase implemented at the end of the prior year. A reconciliation of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $11.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $8.5 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to the addition of headcount to support the Company's ongoing growth, technology development costs related to its digital products and costs associated with the Company's new Home Office. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 11.9% for the first quarter of 2018 from 11.0% in the first quarter last year.\nNet income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. was $3.5 million, or 3.5% of total revenue, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.3 million, or 3.0% of total revenue, for the same period last year. Earnings per diluted share was $0.13 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.09 for the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 32.8% to $16.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins increased approximately 40 basis points to 16.3% compared to 15.9% for the year ago period. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nAdjusted pro forma net income, a non-GAAP measure, increased 54.0% to $5.7 million, or $0.15 per fully exchanged and diluted share during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.7 million, or $0.10 per fully exchanged and diluted share during the first quarter of 2017. A reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nUpdated 2018 Outlook\nFor the fiscal year ending December 26, 2018, the Company is providing the following financial outlook:\nTotal revenue between $446 million and $450 million (vs. $444 million to $448 million). Licensing revenue to be between $12 million and $13 million. Same-Shack sales to be 0% to 1% year over year (vs. flat). Between 32 and 35 new domestic company-operated Shacks to be opened in fiscal 2018. Between 16 and 18 net new licensed Shacks to be opened in fiscal 2018. Average annual sales volume for total domestic company-operated Shacks is expected to be between $4.1 million and $4.2 million. Shack-level operating profit margin between 24.5% and 25.5%. General and administrative expenses between $49 million and $51 million, excluding approximately $4 to $6 million of costs related to Project Concrete, the Company's operational and financial systems upgrade initiative. Depreciation expense of approximately $32 million. Pre-opening costs of between $12 million and $13 million. Interest expense between $2.0 million and $2.2 million. Adjusted pro forma effective tax rate between 26% and 27%.\nEarnings Conference Call\nAs previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results today at 5:00 p.m. ET.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing (800) 239-9838 or for international callers by dialing (323) 794-2551.

The Company does not recognize the sales from licensed Shacks as revenue. Of these amounts, revenue is limited to Shack sales from domestic company-operated Shacks and licensing revenue based on a percentage of sales from domestic and international licensed Shacks, as well as certain up-front fees such as territory fees and opening fees.\n(2)\nShack-level operating profit and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Shack-level operating profit to operating income and adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nSHAKE SHACK INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: Shack-level operating profit, Shack-level operating profit margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share (collectively the \"non-GAAP financial measures\").\nShack-Level Operating Profit\nShack-level operating profit is defined as Shack sales less Shack-level operating expenses including food and paper costs, labor and related expenses, other operating expenses and occupancy and related expenses.\nHow This Measure Is Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are supplemental measures of operating performance that the Company believes are useful measures to evaluate the performance and profitability of its Shacks. Additionally, Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are key metrics used internally by management to develop internal budgets and forecasts, as well as assess the performance of its Shacks relative to budget and against prior periods. It is also used to evaluate employee compensation as it serves as a metric in certain performance-based employee bonus arrangements. The Company believes presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin provides investors with a supplemental view of its operating performance that can provide meaningful insights to the underlying operating performance of the Shacks, as these measures depict the operating results that are directly impacted by the Shacks and exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the ongoing operations of the Shacks. It may also assist investors to evaluate the Company's performance relative to peers of various sizes and maturities and provides greater transparency with respect to how management evaluates the business, as well as the financial and operational decision-making.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of this Measure\nShack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Shack-level operating profit excludes certain costs, such as general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs, which are considered normal, recurring cash operating expenses and are essential to support the operation and development of the Company's Shacks. Therefore, this measure may not provide a complete understanding of the Company's operating results as a whole and Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin should be reviewed in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is set forth below.\nThirteen Weeks Ended March 28 March 29 (dollar amounts in thousands)\n2018 2017 Operating income $ 6,514 $ 5,628 Less: Licensing revenue 3,027 2,594 Add: General and administrative expenses 11,809 8,470 Depreciation expense 6,498 4,748 Pre-opening costs 2,029 2,415 Loss on disposal of property and equipment 190 13 Shack-level operating profit $ 24,013 $ 18,680 Total revenue $ 99,116 $ 76,749 Less: licensing revenue 3,027 2,594 Shack sales $ 96,089 $ 74,155 Shack-level operating profit margin 25.0 % 25.2 % SHAKE SHACK INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense (net of interest income), income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding equity-based compensation expense, deferred rent expense, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, as well as certain non-recurring items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations and may not be indicative of the Company's recurring business operations.\nHow These Measures Are Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that the Company believes are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to historical performance and competitors' operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used internally by management to develop internal budgets and forecasts and also serves as a metric in its performance-based equity incentive programs and certain bonus arrangements. The Company believes presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a supplemental view of the Company's operating performance that facilitates analysis and comparisons of its ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of These Measures\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA exclude certain normal recurring expenses. Therefore, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of the Company's performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below.\nThirteen Weeks Ended March 28 March 29 (in thousands) 2018 2017 Net income $ 4,979 $ 3,862 Depreciation expense 6,498 4,748 Interest expense, net 558 283 Income tax expense 1,198 1,658 EBITDA 13,233 10,551 Equity-based compensation 1,437 1,249 Deferred rent 69 225 Loss on disposal of property and equipment 190 13 Executive transition costs (1) — 134 Project Concrete (2) 239 — Costs related to relocation of Home Office (3) 998 — ADJUSTED EBITDA $ 16,166 $ 12,172 Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.3 % 15.9 %\n(1)\nRepresents costs incurred in connection with the search for the Company's chief financial officer, including fees paid to an executive recruiting firm.\n(2)\nRepresents consulting and advisory fees related to the Company's operational and financial system upgrade initiative called Project Concrete.\n(3)\nCosts incurred in connection with the Company's relocation to a new Home Office, which is comprised of: (i) $326 of duplicative non-cash deferred rent and (ii) $672 net loss on the sublease of the Company's prior Home Office, including the write-off of certain fixed assets.\nSHAKE SHACK INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\nAdjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share\nAdjusted pro forma net income represents net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. assuming the full exchange of all outstanding SSE Holdings, LLC membership interests (\"LLC Interests\") for shares of Class A common stock, adjusted for certain non-recurring items that the Company doesn't believe directly reflect its core operations and may not be indicative of recurring business operations. Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pro forma net income by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based awards.\nHow These Measures Are Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that the Company believes are useful measures to evaluate performance period over period and relative to its competitors. By assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, the Company believes these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies that have different organizational and tax structures, as well as comparisons period over period because it eliminates the effect of any changes in net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. driven by increases in its ownership of SSE Holdings, which are unrelated to the Company's operating performance, and excludes items that are non-recurring or may not be indicative of ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of These Measures\nAdjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share should not be considered alternatives to net income and earnings per share, as determined under GAAP. While these measures are useful in evaluating the Company's performance, it does not account for the earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest holders and therefore does not provide a complete understanding of the net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. Adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share should be evaluated in conjunction with GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are set forth below.\nThirteen Weeks Ended March 28 March 29 (in thousands, except per share amounts)\n2018 2017 Numerator: Net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. $ 3,508 $ 2,267 Adjustments: Reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from the assumed exchange of LLC Interests (1) 1,471 1,595 Executive transition costs (2) — 134 Project Concrete (3) 239 — Costs related to relocation of Home Office (4) 998 — Tax effect of change in tax basis related to the adoption of ASC 606 (311 ) — Income tax expense (5) (246 ) (321 ) Adjusted pro forma net income $ 5,659 $ 3,675 Denominator: Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding—diluted 27,822 25,955 Adjustments: Assumed exchange of LLC Interests for shares of Class A common stock (1) 9,761 11,084 Adjusted pro forma fully exchanged weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding—diluted 37,583 37,039 Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged share—diluted $ 0.15 $ 0.10",
