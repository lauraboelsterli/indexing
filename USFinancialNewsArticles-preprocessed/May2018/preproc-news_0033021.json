evaluating our results, the non-GAAP measures of \"Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses\", \"Non-GAAP net income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd. stockholders\", \"Non-GAAP basic earnings per share\", and \"Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share\" serve as additional indicators of our operating performance and not as a replacement for other measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as they exclude the non-cash share-based compensation expenses, which is calculated based on the number of shares or options granted and the fair value as of the grant date, amortization of acquired intangible assets, fair value adjustments of acquisition-related consideration, and fair value adjustments of a bifurcated derivative. They will not result in any cash inflows or outflows. We believe that using non-GAAP measures help our shareholders to have a better understanding of our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, given the business nature of the Company, it has been a common practice for investors to use such non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated:\n(In USD thousands, except for number of shares and per share data)\nThree months ended\nNine months ended\nMar 31,\nMar 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nCost of integrated contracts\n$\n73,297\n$\n59,126\n$\n229,295\n$\n196,936\nLess: Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n-\n-\n279\n263\nNon-GAAP cost of integrated contracts\n$\n73,297\n$\n59,126\n$\n229,016\n$\n196,673\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$\n7,874\n$\n6,847\n$\n31,333\n$\n29,177\nLess: Share-based compensation expenses\n257\n(1,907)\n581\n(70)\nNon-GAAP general and administrative expenses\n$\n7,617\n$\n8,754\n$\n30,752\n$\n29,247\nNet income attributable to Hollysys Automation\nTechnologies Ltd.\n$\n21,842\n$\n15,623\n$\n79,433\n$\n47,280\nAdd:\nShare-based compensation expenses\n257\n(1,907)\n581\n(70)\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n-\n-\n279\n263\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd.\n$\n22,099\n$\n13,716\n$\n80,293\n$\n47,473\nWeighted average number of basic ordinary shares\n60,436,871\n60,408,369\n60,431,201\n60,112,281\nWeighted average number of diluted ordinary shares\n61,296,907\n61,225,248\n61,245,982\n60,909,201\nNon-GAAP basic earnings per share\n$\n0.37\n$\n0.23\n$\n1.33\n$\n0.79\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share\n$\n0.36\n$\n0.22\n$\n1.32\n$\n0.78\n : releases/hollysys-automation-technologies-reports-unaudited-financial-results-for-the-first-nine-months-and-the-third-quarter-ended-march-31-2018-300647509.html\nSOURCE Hollysys Automation Technologies, Ltd",
