    "text": "Partnership Accelerates Growth, Product Investment of SaaS Leader in Digital Learning & Safer Schools\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GoGuardian, a leading education technology SaaS provider that powers K-12 personalized learning and enhances student safety, announced that Sumeru Equity Partners (“SEP”)—a growth-focused technology investment firm—has made a strategic investment in the company to accelerate growth and product innovation. Alongside the investment, GoGuardian has appointed Tony Miller—accomplished technology executive and former Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education—to the company’s Board.\nGoGuardian currently serves over 5 million students in 10,000 schools across all 50 states, and is uniquely positioned to help educators support student growth. “Since our inception, GoGuardian’s mission has been entirely focused on helping educators, students, and school administrators leverage technology to improve the teaching and learning experience,” said GoGuardian co-founder, CEO and Board Director Advait Shinde. “We are excited to partner with SEP to expand our reach and invigorate classrooms across the country with innovative tools that meet the evolving needs of today’s educators and students,” said Shinde.\n“SEP’s emphasis on investing in customer-centric technology and track record of helping companies scale is aligned with our approach of serving schools in increasingly transformative ways. We welcome the partnership with SEP and Tony Miller as we look to make student-driven learning and holistic well-being the norm in K-12 education,” Shinde said. \"Research on schools’ needs defines GoGuardian’s product roadmap. This partnership will expedite the research and development process - helping us further support educators’ goals of creating dynamic, interactive and safe learning environments.\"\nSEP Managing Directors George Kadifa and Sanjeet Mitra added, “Over the last decade, we have observed the meaningful impact that innovative technologies have in significant enhancement of the student learning experience. GoGuardian’s technologies are fulfilling this mission while supporting districts, teachers, and school administrators in ensuring productive K-12 classrooms and safe learning environments. From its founding, GoGuardian has taken a sincerely differentiated, school-centric approach and made significant investments to create a leading, modern platform. We are highly enthusiastic about partnering with Advait, the GoGuardian team, and Tony to contribute to the growth of the company going forward.”\nTony Miller is an accomplished education and business leader, recently serving as Deputy Secretary and Chief Operating Officer for the U.S. Department of Education. He said, “More and more school districts, teachers, and students are using devices to improve learning in the classroom and at home. As the market leader in supporting the safe and effective use of these education technologies, GoGuardian plays a critically important role today and is uniquely positioned to deliver unprecedented value to schools, teachers, students, and parents going forward.”\nAs part of the investment, majority shareholder SEP will add principals Kadifa, Mitra and Sean Kendra to GoGuardian’s Board of Directors. The transaction closed in May 2018 and financial details were not disclosed. Vista Point Advisors, a San Francisco-based boutique investment bank, acted as the exclusive financial advisor to GoGuardian.\nAbout GoGuardian\nGoGuardian has changed the way K-12 schools maximize the learning potential of every student.
