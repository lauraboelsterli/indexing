    "text": "TEHRAN, May 19 (Reuters) - Iran’s nuclear chief said on Saturday that the European Union had promised to save the nuclear deal with major powers despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to exit the accord and reimpose sanctions on Tehran.\n“We hope their efforts materialise ... America’s actions ... show that it is not a trustworthy country in international dealings,” Ali Akbar Salehi told a joint news conference in Tehran with the European Commissioner for Energy and Climate, Miguel Arias Canete.
