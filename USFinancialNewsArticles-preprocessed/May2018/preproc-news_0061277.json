    "text": "Injured forward Andre Iguodala continues to search for ways to return from a leg injury in time for the NBA Finals.\nMay 14, 2018; Houston, TX, USA; Golden State Warriors forward Andre Iguodala (9) battles Houston Rockets guard James Harden (13) and guard Chris Paul (3) for a loose ball during the fourth quarter in game one of the Western conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports Iguodala was missing for the final four games of the Western Conference finals as the Golden State Warriors outlasted the Houston Rockets on Monday night in the finale of a seven-game series.\nHead coach Steve Kerr said the injury, originally described as a bone bruise, had no defined timetable for recovery and is typically a matter of an individual’s pain threshold.\n“He’s frustrated,” Kerr said. “His body has not responded at this point.”\nWithout Iguodala, the Warriors are squeezing more minutes out of Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney. Bell, in particular, is helping the Warriors defensively and bringing energy at both ends of the court, Kerr said Monday.\n“We’re thrilled with the way he’s played,” Kerr said.\nIguodala received a second opinion on the injury, which the Warriors are now classifying as a lateral (left) leg contusion. He was injured in Game 3 of the series with the Rockets when he bumped knees with Houston Rockets guard James Harden.\nThe MVP of the 2015 Finals, Iguodala and Klay Thompson shared the responsibility of defending LeBron James in the 2017 meeting between the teams. Golden State won the series last summer four games to one.\nAccording to ESPN, Iguodala is actively seeking any remedy to the knee discomfort, but will be questionable for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
