    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Strongbow Exploration Inc. (TSX-V) (“Strongbow” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Matthew Hird as Chief Financial Officer, commencing with immediate effect.\nMr. Hird is an experienced finance professional from the natural resources sector who brings a wealth of expertise in driving the strategic analysis, financing, reporting and governance of mining companies. He spent over eight years at Kaz Minerals plc, the FTSE 250 copper producer, including six years as Chief Financial Officer. Prior to his appointment at Kaz Minerals plc, he was Company Secretary and Group Reporting Manager at Vedanta Resources plc. He has also served as Chief Financial Officer at African Minerals Limited and more recently, as Chief Financial Officer at Sierra Rutile Limited until its acquisition by Iluka Resources Limited. Prior to his work in the natural resources sector, he spent nine years at Deloitte. He is a Chartered Accountant and holds an MA in Natural Sciences (Geological Sciences) from the University of Cambridge.\nMr. Richard Williams, Strongbow’s CEO commented: “We are very pleased to welcome Matthew to the Strongbow management team at such an important time in the Company’s growth, as we advance the South Crofty tin project to a production decision and, more immediately, towards a dual listing on London’s AIM market.”\nABOUT SOUTH CROFTY\nSouth Crofty is an iconic former producing copper and tin mine located in the towns of Camborne and Pool, Cornwall, England. The first documented production history from South Crofty dates back to 1592, and it was the last tin mine to close in Cornwall in 1998.\nStrongbow published a NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate on the project on April 19, 2016 (see Technical Report here ), and published a NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment on the project on February 16, 2017 (see Technical Report here ).\nThe project received an Underground Permission (mining licence) in 2013, which is valid until 2071, and Planning Permission to construct a new process plant in 2011. In October 2017, Strongbow was successful in securing a Water Discharge Permit allowing for the dewatering of the now flooded mine workings. In January 2018, the Company completed the sale of a 1.5% Net Smelter Returns Royalty to its largest shareholder, Osisko Gold Royalties, for C$7,170,000. These proceeds are being used to construct a water treatment plant, which is expected to be completed by the end of September 2018.\nFor additional information please contact: Irene Dorsman at +1 604 210 8752 or by e-mail at idorsman@strongbowexploration.com or Sherman Dahl of Pretium Communications at +1 250 558 8340.\nBlytheweigh (Financial PR/IR-London) Tel: +44 207 138 3204\nTim Blythe tim.blythe@blytheweigh.com\nCamilla Horsfall camilla.horsfall@blytheweigh.com\nNick Elwes nick.elwes@blytheweigh.com\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n“Richard D.
