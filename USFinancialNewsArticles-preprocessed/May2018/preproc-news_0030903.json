Non-GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders excluding certain non-cash expenses was ¥5.1 million ($0.8 million), or ¥0.35 ($0.06) per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of FY2018, compared to non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of ¥2.3 million, ¥0.26 per basic and diluted share, for the same period of last fiscal year.\nFirst Nine Months of Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Highlights (all comparable to the prior year period):\nTotal revenues for the first nine months of FY2018 increased by 58.7% to ¥69.8 million ($11.1 million). Gross profit for the first nine months of FY2018 was ¥7.8 million ($1.2 million).

Furthermore, our construction of waste-water and waste oil sludge treatment facilities has also advanced as scheduled. We believe this will help improve our operations and profit in the coming year.\"\nRecent Developments\nOn April 09, 2018, the Company announced procurement bidding results from Shenhua Group Corporation Limited (\"Shenhua Group\") through Shenhua Logistics Group Corporation Limited (\"Shenhua Logistics\"), during the first 3 months of FY2018, to provide specified equipment and maintenance services for contracts with amount above ¥6.8 million, or approximately $1.1 million.

Gross profit margin decreased to 10.3% from 18.3% for the same period of last year. The significant decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of furnaces which usually generates lower gross margin. The management believes that our gross margin will increase after the construction and test-run stage of our new plants and equipment, when our equipment is expected to be sold at the normal price.\nNet Loss\nLoss from operations was ¥10.5 million ($1.7 million) during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to ¥7.0 million for the same period of last year. The increase in net loss is largely due to an increase in selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses, partly offset by an increase in gross profit and a decrease in research and development expenses.\nNet loss attributable to Recon for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was ¥10.1 million ($1.6 million), or ¥0.70 ($0.11) per basic and diluted share based on 14.6 million basic and diluted shares outstanding, compared to ¥7.2 million, or ¥0.81 per basic and diluted share based on 8.9 million basic and diluted shares outstanding for the same period of last year.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Net Loss\nNon-U.S. GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders excluding certain non-cash expenses such as restricted shares issued for consulting services and non-cash stock compensation expense was ¥5.1 million ($0.8 million), or ¥0.35 ($0.06) per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to adjusted net loss attributable to common shareholders of ¥2.3 million, ¥0.26 per basic and diluted share, for the same period of last year. Please see the note about non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation table at the end of this press release.\n9 MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenue\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nPercentage\n2017\n2018\nIncrease\nChange\nHardware and software\n¥\n43,940,560\n¥\n69,649,711\n¥\n25,709,151\n58.5\n%\nService\n72,170\n182,551\n110,381\n152.9\n%\nTotal revenues\n¥\n44,012,730\n¥\n69,832,262\n¥\n25,819,532\n58.7\n%\nTotal revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 were approximately ¥69.8 million ($11.1 million), representing an increase of approximately ¥25.8 million or 58.7% from ¥44.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The overall increase in revenue was accomplished through Recon's expansion of new clients and development of new business. See below for more details:\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease /\nPercentage\n2017\n2018\n(Decrease)\nChange\nAutomation product and software\n¥\n18,901,400\n¥\n15,915,595\n¥\n(2,985,805)\n(15.8)\n%\nEquipment and accessories\n22,301,456\n53,302,419\n31,000,963\n139.0\n%\nWaste water treatment products\n2,737,704\n431,697\n(2,306,007)\n(84.2)\n%\nServices\n72,170\n182,551\n110,381\n152.9\n%\nTotal revenues\n¥\n44,012,730\n¥\n69,832,262\n¥\n25,819,532\n58.7\n%\n(1)\nRevenue from automation product and software decreased by ¥3.0 million or 15.8% from the same period of last\nyear. Affected by less expenditure on surface projects of our clients for the last two years, requirements of\nautomation related projects maintained at a lower level and fluctuated. Revenue from this product line may\nfluctuate from time to time. Management is confident on further development on this business because it\nbelieves oil companies will continue to invest in automation products. In addition, during this period,\nmanagement also expanded new market of automation business to coal chemical industry.\n(2)\nAs shown above, the overall increase in revenue was primarily due to increased equipment business, including\nfurnaces and related accessories.\n(3)\nRevenue from waste water treatment products decreased by ¥2.3 million or 84.2% as most of Recon's\nwastewater treatment projects were not finished thus less revenue was recorded in the nine months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of last year.\n(4)\nRevenue from services for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 consisted mainly of maintenance\nservices, which were provided upon request by customers. Revenue from services increased by ¥0.1 million or\n152.9% from the same period of last year mainly because maintenance requests outpaced the purchase of new\nequipment due to industry softness, and we believe the margin level is reasonable.\nCost and Margin\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease /\nPercentage\n2017\n2018\n(Decrease)\nChange\nTotal revenues\n¥\n44,012,730\n¥\n69,832,262\n¥\n25,819,532\n58.7\n%\nCost of revenues\n30,322,003\n62,077,072\n31,755,069\n104.7\n%\nGross profit\n¥\n13,690,727\n¥\n7,755,190\n¥\n(5,935,537)\n(43.4)%\nMargin %\n31.1\n%\n11.1\n%\n(20.0)\n%\n-\nCost of Revenues. Recon's cost of revenues increased from ¥30.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 to ¥62.1 million ($9.9 million) for the same period in 2018, representing an increase of ¥31.8 million ($5.1 million), or 104.7%. This increase was mainly caused by significant growth in revenue generated from equipment and accessories with lower gross profit margin.\nGross Profit. Recon's gross profit decreased to ¥7.8 million ($1.2 million) for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 from ¥13.7 million from the same period of last year. Recon's gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11.1% for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 from 31.1% from the same period of last year. This was mainly due to the increased equipment business with lower margin during this period, which led to the increase in cost of revenues in proportion to the increase in Recon's revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease /\nPercentage\n2017\n2018\n(Decrease)\nChange\nSelling and distribution expenses\n¥\n3,311,070\n¥\n4,283,601\n¥\n972,531\n29.4\n%\n% of revenue\n7.5\n%\n6.1\n%\n(1.40)%\n-\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n20,973,292\n28,569,378\n7,596,086\n36.2\n%\n% of revenue\n47.7\n%\n40.9\n%\n(6.80)%\n-\nProvision for (reversal of) doubtful accounts\n(876,530)\n504,498\n1,381,028\n(157.6)%\n% of revenue\n(2.0)%\n0.7\n%\n2.70\n%\n-\nResearch and development expenses\n6,547,582\n2,356,406\n(4,191,176)\n(64.0)%\n% of revenue\n14.9\n%\n3.4\n%\n(11.50)%\n-\nOperating expenses\n¥\n29,955,414\n¥\n35,713,883\n¥\n5,758,469\n19.2\n%\nSelling and Distribution Expenses. Selling and distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenditures of Recon's sales and marketing organization, sales commissions, costs of Recon's marketing programs including traveling expenses, advertising and trade shows, and rental expense, as well as shipping charges. Selling expenses increased by ¥1.0 million ($0.2 million) for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 from the same period of last year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in traveling expense and service and testing fees as we expanded our market to new basements of Changqing oilfield and new industries. Selling expenses were 6.1% of total revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 7.5% of total revenues for the same period of last year.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs in human resources, facilities costs, depreciation expenses, professional advisor fees, audit fees, stock-based compensation expense and other miscellaneous expenses incurred in connection with general operations. General and administrative expenses increased by 36.2% or ¥7.6 million ($1.2 million), from ¥21.0 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2017 to ¥28.6 million ($4.5 million) for the same period of 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in performance-based compensation, consulting fees, rent expenses and investor relationship expenses. General and administrative expenses accounted 40.9% of total revenues in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 47.7% of total revenues for the same period of last year. In December 2016, the Company's board approved the grants of restricted stock to management plan based on performance targets for the coming three fiscal years from FY2017 to FY2019. During the nine months ended March 31, 2018, because of the grant of certain restricted stock to management as the target for the FY2018 achieved, compensation expenses increased ¥2.5 million.\nProvision for doubtful accounts. Provision for doubtful accounts is the estimated amount of bad debt that will arise as a result of lower collectability from accounts receivables, other receivables and purchase advances. We reversed provision for doubtful accounts of ¥0.9 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of ¥0.5 million ($0.1 million) for the same period in 2018. Management will continue to monitor accounts receivable to maintain the provision at a lower level.\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenditures for Recon's research and development projects. Research and development expenses decreased from ¥6.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 to ¥2.4 million ($0.4 million) for the same period of 2018. This decrease was primarily due to less research and development expense spent on design of chemical products used for waste water treatment and digital oilfield models and platform. The Company was focusing on the transformation of advanced R&D results into projects, which were undertaken by Gansu BHD and Qinghai BHD.\nNet Loss\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease /\nPercentage\n2017\n2018\n(Decrease)\nChange\nLoss from operations\n¥\n(16,264,687)\n¥\n(27,958,693)\n¥\n(11,694,006)\n71.9\n%\nOther expense, net\n(185,591)\n(280,752)\n(95,161)\n51.3\n%\nLoss before income taxes\n(16,450,278)\n(28,239,445)\n(11,789,167)\n71.7\n%\nIncome tax expenses\n264,344\n11,018\n(253,326)\n(95.8)\n%\nNet loss\n(16,714,622)\n(28,250,463)\n(11,535,841)\n69.0\n%\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling\ninterest\n284,649\n(1,131,067)\n(1,415,716)\n(497.4)%\nNet loss attributable to Recon Technology, Ltd\n¥\n(16,999,271)\n¥\n(27,119,396)\n¥\n(10,120,125)\n59.5\n%\nLoss from operations. Loss from operations was ¥28.0 million ($4.5 million) for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a loss of ¥16.3 million for the same period of last year. This ¥11.7 million ($1.9 million) increase in loss from operations was primary due to a decrease in gross profit, as well as an increase in general and administrative expenses and partly offset by a decrease in research and development expenses as discussed above.\nBasic and diluted loss per share. Basic and diluted loss per share attributable to common shareholders was ¥2.73, as compared to ¥2.43 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Net Loss\nNon-U.S. GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders excluding certain non-cash expenses (non-GAAP) such as restricted shares issued for consulting services and non-cash stock compensation expense was ¥10.5 million ($1.7 million), or ¥1.06 ($0.17) per diluted share, for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, compared to non-U.S. GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders of ¥3.2 million, or ¥0.46 per basic and diluted share, for the same period of last year. Please see the note about non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation table at the end of this press release.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSelected Balance Sheet Highlights in RMB\nConversion US$1.0: RMB6.28 at March 31, 2018\n3/31/2018\n6/30/2017\nPercentage\nChange\nCash and cash equivalent\n52,415,897\n3,809,279\n1,276.01\n%\nTotal Current Assets\n120,424,984\n68,387,075\n76.09\n%\nTotal Assets\n135,712,689\n71,155,045\n90.73\n%\nWorking Capital\n93,554,270\n38,941,318\n140.24\n%\nTotal Current Liabilities\n26,870,714\n29,445,757\n(8.75)\n%\nTotal Stockholders' Equity\n88,687,587\n33,244,445\n166.77\n%\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity\n135,712,689\n71,155,045\n90.73\n%\nCash from Operating Activities.

This represents an increase of ¥23.7 million ($3.8 million) compared to net cash provided by operating activities of ¥9.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the net loss available to the Company of the amount of ¥28.3 million ($4.5 million), and reconciled by share based compensation of ¥5.1 million ($0.8 million), restricted shares issued for management of ¥8.0 million ($1.3 million) as well as restricted shares issued for services of ¥2.8 million ($0.5 million); and an increase in other receivables and purchase advances, partly offset by an decrease in trade accounts receivable.\nCash from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was ¥13.6 million ($2.2 million) for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, representing an increase in cash used in investing activities of ¥13.3 million ($2.1 million) compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was due to an increase in the Company's payments for a land use right of 50 years, payments for construction in progress and investment in unconsolidated entity.\nCash from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to ¥76.8 million ($12.2 million) for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of ¥6.2 million for the same period of last year.

We also received ¥3.7 million ($0.6 million) capital contribution by non-controlling shareholders. Moreover, this increase in net cash provided by financing activities was due to net proceeds from issuance of common stock of ¥65.0 million ($10.3 million) for the nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nSTATEMENT REGARDING UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe unaudited financial information set forth above is subject to adjustments that may be identified when audit work is performed on the Company's year-end financial statements, which could result in significant differences from this unaudited financial information.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Recon's unaudited condensed consolidated financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), Recon uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: certain non-cash expenses such as restricted shares issued for consulting services and non-cash stock compensation expense, basic and diluted earnings (losses) per common share excludes non-cash expenses such as restricted shares issued for consulting services and non-cash stock compensation expense.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
