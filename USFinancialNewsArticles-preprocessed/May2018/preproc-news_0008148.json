Ocwen reported GAAP net income of $2.6 million, or $0.02 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a net loss of $(32.6) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a $35.2 million improvement. Ocwen generated revenue of $260.3 million and Cash Flows from Operating Activities of $99.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and ended the quarter with $285.7 million of cash.\n“The first quarter of 2018 was an important one for Ocwen, and we accomplished a great deal. In addition to starting out the year with a $2.6 million profit, we received $280 million in cash from New Residential (NRZ), we announced an agreement to acquire PHH Corporation (PHH), and we helped almost 11,600 struggling families remain in their homes through loan modifications that included $59 million of debt forgiveness,” commented Ron Faris, President and CEO of Ocwen. Mr. Faris further stated, “Just as importantly, we continued to make progress on the regulatory front, we began the process of deploying our excess liquidity, we largely completed the liquidation of Automotive Capital Services (ACS), and we saw our GAAP stockholders’ equity increase by $85 million to $630 million, or $4.73 per share during the quarter.” Mr. Faris concluded by saying, “We are also making steady progress towards closing our acquisition of PHH, which we expect to occur in the second half of the year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nPre-tax income for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.0 million, a $35.5 million improvement from the first quarter of 2017. Pre-tax results for the quarter were impacted by a number of significant items, the largest of which was $20.5 million in favorable Ginnie Mae and GSE MSR fair value adjustments as a result of the rising interest rates in the quarter, offset by $(21.0) million of costs related to ongoing strategic transactions and restructuring costs, regulatory-related legal fees, and other litigation and regulatory settlement expenses. Adjusting for these significant items, our adjusted pre-tax income for the quarter was $5.5 million.\nThe Servicing segment recorded $20.5 million of pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2018, the seventh consecutive profitable quarter for the business.\nThe Lending segment recorded $8.8 million of pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2018, a $7.7 million increase over the first quarter of 2017. Our reverse mortgage lending business recorded $9.8 million of pre-tax income and our forward lending recapture business incurred a $(1.1) million pre-tax loss.\nThe Corporate segment recorded a $(24.3) million pre-tax loss for the first quarter of 2018 primarily driven by $(13.2) million of corporate interest expense, $(5.5) million of CFPB and state regulatory-related legal fees and other litigation and regulatory-related settlement expenses, and a $(2.9) million loss related to the Automotive Capital Services business which was largely liquidated in the quarter.\nAdditional First Quarter 2018 Business Highlights\nCompleted 11,598 modifications in the quarter to help struggling families stay in their homes, 17% of which included debt forgiveness totaling $59 million. Announced agreement to purchase PHH Corporation for $360 million. Delinquencies decreased from 9.3% at December 31, 2017 to 9.0% at March 31, 2018, primarily driven by loss mitigation efforts. The constant pre-payment rate (CPR) decreased from 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 12.9% in the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, prime CPR was 15.4%, and non-prime CPR was 11.6%. In the first quarter of 2018, Ocwen originated forward and reverse mortgage loans with unpaid principal balances of $215.8 million and $163.9 million, respectively. Our reverse mortgage portfolio ended the quarter with an estimated $114.5 million in undiscounted future gains from forecasted future draws on existing loans. Neither the anticipated future gains nor the future funding liability are included in the Company’s financial statements. We have now resolved all of the state cease and desist orders (but not all of the legal actions) taken against us on April 20, 2017 and shortly thereafter. GAAP stockholders’ equity increased by $85 million to $630 million, or $4.73 per share, primarily as a result of our decision to elect fair value accounting, effective as of January 1, 2018, on our remaining portfolio of MSRs that was previously accounted for using the Lower of Cost or Market and amortization method.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nOcwen will host a webcast and conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time, to discuss its financial results for the first quarter of 2018. The conference call will be webcast live over the internet from the Company’s website at www.Ocwen.com , click on the “Shareholders” section.

These may be identified by a reference to a future period or by the use of forward-looking terminology. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe”, “expect”, “foresee”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “goal”, “strategy”, “plan” “target” and “project” or conditional verbs such as “will”, “may”, “should”, “could” or “would” or the negative of these terms, although not all contain these words. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Our business has been undergoing substantial change which has magnified such uncertainties. Readers should bear these factors in mind when considering such statements and should not place undue reliance on such statements.\nForward-looking statements involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In the past, actual results have differed from those suggested by forward looking statements and this may happen again.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to those suggested by the include, but are not limited to, the following: uncertainty related to claims, litigation, cease and desist orders and investigations brought by government agencies and private parties regarding our servicing, foreclosure, modification, origination and other practices, including uncertainty related to past, present or future investigations, litigation, cease and desist orders and settlements with state regulators, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), State Attorneys General, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Department of Justice or the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and actions brought under the False Claims Act by private parties on behalf of the United States of America regarding incentive and other payments made by governmental entities; adverse effects on our business as a result of regulatory investigations, litigation, cease and desist orders or settlements; reactions to the announcement of such investigations, litigation, cease and desist orders or settlements by key counterparties, including lenders, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), together known as the GSEs and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae); our ability to comply with the terms of our settlements with regulatory agencies and the costs of doing so, increased regulatory scrutiny and media attention; any adverse developments in existing legal proceedings or the initiation of new legal proceedings; our ability to effectively manage our regulatory and contractual compliance obligations; our ability to comply with our servicing agreements, including our ability to comply with our agreements with, and the requirements of, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae and maintain our seller/servicer and other statuses with them; our ability to contain and reduce our operating costs, the adequacy of our financial resources, including our sources of liquidity and ability to sell, fund and recover advances, repay borrowings and comply with our debt agreements, including the financial and other covenants contained in them; our ability to timely transfer mortgage servicing rights under our July 2017 agreements and January 2018 agreements with NRZ; our ability to maintain our long-term relationship with NRZ under these new arrangements; our ability to realize anticipated future gains from future draws on existing loans in our reverse mortgage portfolio; our servicer and credit ratings as well as other actions from various rating agencies, including the impact of prior or future downgrades of our servicer and credit ratings; our ability to complete the proposed acquisition of PHH, to successfully integrate its business, and to realize the strategic objectives and other benefits of the acquisition at the time anticipated or at all, including our ability to integrate, maintain and enhance PHH’s servicing, subservicing and other business relationships; our ability to execute an effective chief executive officer leadership transition; as well as other risks detailed in Ocwen’s reports and filings with the SEC, including its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and any current and quarterly reports since such date.

Ocwen’s speak only as of the date they are made and, we disclaim any obligation to update or revise whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains references to adjusted pre-tax income, a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides a useful supplement to discussions and analysis of our financial condition. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide an alternative way to view certain aspects of our business that is instructive. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, Ocwen's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Other companies may use non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar titles that are calculated differently to our non-GAAP financial measures. As a result, comparability may be limited. For a full reconciliation of adjusted pre-tax income to GAAP pre-tax income, please see slides 21 and 23 of the Company’s first quarter 2018 investor presentation, which may be found in the “Shareholder Relations” section of the Company’s website at www.Ocwen.com .\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nInvestors: Media: Stephen Swett John Lovallo T: (203) 614-0141 T: (917) 612-8419 E: shareholderrelations@ocwen.com E: jlovallo@levick.com\nResidential Servicing Statistics (Dollars in thousands) At or for the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30, 2017 March 31,\n2017 Total unpaid principal balance of loans\nand REO serviced $ 173,388,876 $ 179,352,554 $ 187,468,318 $ 194,798,424 $ 202,369,014 Non-performing loans and REO\nserviced as a % of total UPB (1) 9.0 % 9.3 % 9.4 % 9.6 % 10.7 % Prepayment speed (average CPR) (2) (3) 12.9 % 14.4 % 14.7 % 15.0 % 14.0 % (1) Performing loans include those loans that are less than 90 days past due and those loans for which borrowers are making scheduled payments under loan modification, forbearance or bankruptcy plans.
