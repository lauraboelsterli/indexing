    "text": "BRIDGEVIEW, Ill., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Manitex International, Inc. (Nasdaq:MNTX) , a leading international provider of truck and knuckle boom cranes, today announced First Quarter 2018 results. Net revenues for the first quarter were $56.7 million, compared to $40.1 million in the prior year’s period*, and net loss from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of Manitex was $(1.5) million, or $(0.09) per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of Manitex of $(3.3) million, or $(0.21) per share, in the first quarter of 2017*. Adjusted net income** from continuing operations in the first quarter 2018 was $0.8 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to adjusted net loss of $(2.3) million, or $(0.14) per share, for the first quarter of 2017*.\nHighlights (versus prior year, unless otherwise noted):\nNet revenues of $56.7 million, up 41.3% Adjusted EBITDA** increased to $3.7 million, or 6.5% of sales, from $0.3 million, or 0.8% of sales Adjusted earnings per share** improved to $0.05 compared to an adjusted loss per share of $(0.14) Backlog increased $26 million to $88 million, representing growth of 43% year to date, and 75% from September 30, 2017 First quarter book to bill ratio increased to 1.44 vs 1.25 for the fourth quarter of 2017\n*All references in this release to financial results of periods ending prior to the third quarter of 2017 reflect such results as restated pursuant to the recently completed restatement of such periods.\n**Adjusted Numbers are discussed in greater detail and reconciled under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items” at the end of this release.\n“In the quarter we saw a 41% improvement in sales, driven by strengthening global demand across our product lines and geographies, led by Manitex straight-mast cranes, where we estimate our market share has risen from 39% at the end of last year, to over 50%,” commented David J. Langevin, Chief Executive Officer of Manitex. “Gross margins were closer to our 20%-plus target, but legal and accounting expenses of approximately $1.0 million related to our restatements were a significant drain of earnings and an offset to the benefits of the sales increase and other improvements to margins and produced a net loss for the quarter. A backlog of over $85 million and continued positive order flow in April gives us visibility for higher sales throughout the year, and we’re targeting significant gross and EBITDA margin improvements as well. We are positioned to benefit from manufacturing throughput and efficiency gains, as well as repricing actions already implemented to offset steel cost increases, to get us to sustainable profitability, with EBITDA margins of 10%, likely by the end of the year. Recovery fundamentals in the industrial equipment market and for our company look strong, and we’re working hard to take advantage of the opportunities that are available to us.”\nSteve Kiefer, President and Chief Operating Officer of Manitex stated, “During the first-quarter of 2018, we saw an increase in orders, industry activity and market share in each of our key product categories. Our book to bill ratio in the first quarter increased to 1.44 versus 1.25 in the fourth quarter of 2017, and orders for our PM knuckle-boom cranes again represented a significant portion of our growing backlog. From a product and end-market perspective, the recovery in the straight mast crane market strengthened during the first quarter with industry orders reaching a level not observed since the 2012 – 2014 period, and early indications are that the trend is continuing into Q2. We also began initial shipments of the A62 truck mounted aerial work platform and trolley boom loader during the quarter.”\nOutlook:\nBased on the current visibility and production plans the company anticipates revenues in the second quarter in the range of $60 million to $65 million with EBITDA margins in the range of 8.0% to 8.5%, with sales and margins continuing to expand throughout the year.\nOther Matters :\nAs previously disclosed, the Company has received an inquiry from the SEC requesting certain information in connection with the Company’s recently completed restatement of prior financial statements and is continuing to comply with such request.\nConference Call :\nManagement will host a conference call at 4:30 PM Eastern Time today to discuss the results with the investment community.

All per share amounts are on a fully diluted basis. In this press release, Manitex refers to various non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures which management uses to evaluate operating performance, to establish internal budgets and targets, and to compare the Company’s financial performance against such budgets and targets. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being disclosed by other companies. While adjusted financial measures are not intended to replace any presentation included in our consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered an alternative to operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our operating results, capital expenditure and working capital requirements and the ongoing performance of its underlying businesses. The amounts described below are unaudited, are reported in thousands of U.S. dollars, and are as of, for three month period ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, unless otherwise indicated. A reconciliation of Adjusted GAAP financial measures for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is included with this press release below and with the Company's related Form 8-K.\nAbout Manitex International, Inc.\nManitex International, Inc. is a leading worldwide provider of highly engineered specialized equipment including boom truck, truck and knuckle boom cranes.
