These statements reflect management’s expectations regarding objectives, plans, goals, strategies, future growth, results of operations, performance and business prospects and opportunities of the REIT including expectations for the current financial year, and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to management’s beliefs, plans, estimates and intentions, and similar statements concerning anticipated future events, results, circumstances, performance or expectations that are not historical facts. Statements that contain words such as “could”, “should”, “would”, “anticipate”, “expect”, “believe”, “plan”, “intend”, “will”, “may”, “might” and similar expressions or statements relating to matters that are not historical facts constitute forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future events or performance and, by their nature, are based on the REIT’s current estimates and assumptions, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as the date hereof and accordingly are subject to change after such date. The REIT does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are contained herein except as expressly required by applicable securities laws.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nWe disclose a number of financial measures in this news release that are not measures used under IFRS, including NOI, same-property NOI, FFO, FFO payout ratio, Core-FFO, Core-FFO payout ratio, AFFO, AFFO payout ratio, adjusted EBITDA, net debt to adjusted EBITDA and the interest coverage ratio, in addition to certain measures on a per unit basis.\nNOI is defined as rental revenue less operating property expenses and IFRIC 21 property tax adjustments, prior to straight-line rent and other changes. Same-property NOI includes those properties owned by the REIT for each of the current period and the relevant comparative period. FFO is defined as net income adjusted for certain items including leasing costs amortized to revenue, change in fair value of properties, change in fair value of financial instruments, disposition costs, depreciation of hotel asset, deferred income taxes, IFRIC 21 property tax adjustments, change in fair value of Class B LP units, distributions to Class B LP unitholders and subscription receipts equivalent amount. Core-FFO is defined as FFO adjusted for the REIT's share of lease payments received for its Data Centre asset, which for IFRS purposes is accounted for as a finance lease and removes the impact of mortgage discharge fees (if any). AFFO is defined as FFO adjusted for certain items including guaranteed income supplements, amortization of deferred transaction costs, de-recognition and amortization of mark-to-market adjustments on mortgages refinanced or discharged, adjustments for interest rate subsidies received, recognition of the REIT's share of lease payments received for its Data Centre asset, which for IFRS purposes is accounted for as a finance lease, amortization of straight-line rent and normalized direct leasing and capital costs. FFO payout ratio, Core-FFO payout ratio and AFFO payout ratio are defined as distributions declared divided by FFO, Core-FFO and AFFO, respectively. FFO per unit, Core-FFO per unit and AFFO per unit are defined as FFO, Core-FFO and AFFO divided by the weighted average diluted number of units outstanding, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, IFRCI 21 property tax adjustments, depreciation, fair value gains (losses) from both financial instruments and investment properties, while also excluding non-recurring items such as transaction costs from dispositions, acquisitions or other events and adjusting income received from the Data Centre to cash received as opposed to finance income recorded for accounting purposes. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing the aggregate amount of debt outstanding, less cash on hand, by annualized adjusted EBITDA. Interest coverage ratio is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by cash interest paid.\nWe utilize these measures for a variety of reasons, including measuring performance, managing the business, capital allocation and the assessment of risk. Descriptions of why these non-IFRS measures are useful to investors and how management uses each measure are included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis, which readers should read when evaluating the measures included herein. We believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our IFRS results is helpful to investors in assessing the overall performance of our businesses in a manner similar to management. These financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. We caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures may differ from the calculations disclosed by other businesses, and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by others.\nFor Further Information\nInvestor Relations\nTel: +1 416 644 4264\nSlate Office REIT\nE-mail: ir@slateam.com\nCalculation and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures\nThe tables below summarize a calculation of non-IFRS measures based on IFRS financial information.\nThe calculation of NOI is as follows:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018\n2017 Rental revenue $ 44,289 $ 32,318 Property operating expenses (23,533 ) (17,693 ) IFRIC 21 property tax adjustments (528 ) — Straight-line rents and other changes (116 ) (450 ) NOI $ 20,112 $ 14,175 The reconciliation of net income to FFO, Core-FFO and AFFO is as follows: Three months ended December 31, (thousands of dollars, except per unit amounts) 2018\n2017 Net income $ 7,904 $ 8,442 Add (deduct): Leasing costs amortized to revenue 408 222 Change in fair value of properties 9,230 (227 ) Change in fair value of financial instruments (5,048 ) (862 ) Disposition costs 54 — Depreciation of hotel asset 222 189 Deferred income tax recovery (790 ) — IFRIC 21 property tax adjustment (1) (528 ) — Change in fair value of Class B LP units (2,748 ) 740 Distributions to Class B unitholders 991 991 Subscription receipts equivalent amount (1) 1,597 — FFO (1) $ 11,292 $ 9,495 Finance income on finance lease receivable (955 ) (990 ) Finance lease payments received 1,525 1,525 Core-FFO (1) $ 11,862 $ 10,030 Amortization of deferred transaction costs 795 331 Amortization of debt mark-to-market adjustments (150 ) (126 ) Amortization of straight-line rent (524 ) (672 ) Interest rate subsidy 108 108 Guaranteed income supplements 40 634 Normalized direct leasing and capital costs (2,023 ) (1,463 ) AFFO (1) $ 10,108 $ 8,842 Weighted average number of diluted units outstanding (000s) 62,874 46,101 FFO per unit (1) $ 0.18 $ 0.21 Core-FFO per unit (1) 0.19 0.22 AFFO per unit (1) 0.16 0.19 FFO payout ratio (1) 110.4 % 91.0 % Core-FFO payout ratio (1) 105.1 % 86.1 % AFFO payout ratio (1) 123.4 % 97.7 % (1) Refer to \"Non-IFRS measures\" section above.
