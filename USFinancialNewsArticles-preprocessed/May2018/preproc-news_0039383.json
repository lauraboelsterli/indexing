Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City v Brighton & Hove Albion - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - May 9, 2018 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola applauds fans after the match REUTERS/Andrew Yates\nCity, owned by billionaire Sheikh Mansour, spent more than 300 million pounds on players last season.\nThat heavy investment paid off with City winning the Premier League and League Cup, but Guardiola said fans should not expect similar spending.\n“(We will sign) one or two more,” Guardiola told Sky Sports, adding. “... maybe people don’t believe me but we don’t have the money to invest 300 million pounds every season.\n“We invested a lot of money and will invest less in the future, because instead of doing it in two or three transfer windows, we did it in one.\n“The fundamental success of this season is the quality of the players. People say you won because you invest a lot, they are right.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
