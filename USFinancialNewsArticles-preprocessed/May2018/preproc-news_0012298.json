    "text": "BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - German engineering orders fell by 4 percent in March from a year ago on weak foreign demand, the VDMA industry group said on Friday, adding that the decline was no reason for alarm given that overall demand in the first-quarter remained strong. Demand from domestic customers rose by 3 percent in real terms and foreign orders fell by 7 percent, VDMA said. Euro zone order were 2 percent lower and demand from countries outside the single-currency bloc slumped by 8 percent. In the less volatile January-March comparison, orders were up 7 percent on the year, VDMA said. Domestic demand surged 9 percent and foreign orders edged 6 percent higher. \"Despite the decline the results for March are entirely respectable,\" said VDMA economist Olaf Wortmann.
