    "text": "May 8 (Reuters) - Antofagasta said on Tuesday it had uncovered and cleared a blockage in its Los Pelambres pipeline, which moves copper concentrates from Chileâ€™s Coquimbo region to ports, with some knock on effects for sales and production.\nThe company said it expected production, measured as the quantity filtered at the port, to be impacted by about 10,000 tonnes of copper due to the blockage and sales to be impacted by some 15,000 tonnes in the six months ending June 30.\nIt said its full-year guidance for production remained unchanged at 705,000 tonnes to 740,000 tonnes.
