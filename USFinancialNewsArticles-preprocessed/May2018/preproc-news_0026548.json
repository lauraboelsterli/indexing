(Nasdaq: RMR) today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAdam Portnoy, President and Chief Executive Officer, made the following statement regarding the second quarter fiscal 2018 results:\n\"During the second quarter we increased revenues by 9%, net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. by 21% and Adjusted EBITDA by 6% as compared to a year ago. These operating results are even more noteworthy considering the headwinds facing REIT share prices and the $0.02 per share impact this quarter from one-time items associated with separation costs and share award accelerations.\nThis quarter, we continued positioning ourselves for further growth by helping Select Income REIT complete the IPO of our fifth Managed Equity REIT, Industrial Logistics Properties Trust, which is an industrial REIT. With more than $250 million of cash on hand and no debt, we are well positioned to consider a number of new opportunities for growth in the future.\"\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights:\nTotal revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $59.3 million, compared to total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $54.3 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net income was $19.6 million and net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. was $8.4 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to net income of $17.7 million and net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. of $6.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income this quarter included $0.9 million, or $0.02 per share, for the accelerated vesting of The RMR Group Inc. share awards and separation expenses related to former employees and officers. Net income in the second quarter last year included $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share, of transaction and acquisition related costs. The RMR Group Inc. earned management services revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 from the following sources (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Managed Equity REITs (1) $ 39,460 84.8 % $ 36,715 84.9 % Managed Operators (2) 6,339 13.6 % 6,091 14.1 % Other 760 1.6 % 452 1.0 % Total Management Services Revenues 46,559 100.0 % 43,258 100.0 % (1) Managed Equity REITs collectively refers to: Government Properties Income Trust (GOV), Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT), Industrial Logistics Properties Trust (ILPT), Select Income REIT (SIR) and Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH).

(FVE), Sonesta International Hotels Corporation and TravelCenters of America LLC (TA).

Adjusted EBITDA Margin equals Adjusted EBITDA divided by the contractual management and advisory fees earned from The RMR Group LLC’s client companies. These contractual management and advisory fees are calculated pursuant to The RMR Group LLC’s contracts with its client companies and do not deduct non-cash asset amortization recognized in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, as a reduction to management services revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are calculated on recurring revenues and do not include incentive business management fees earned. As of March 31, 2018, The RMR Group Inc. had approximately $30.0 billion of total assets under management, compared to total assets under management of $27.6 billion as of March 31, 2017.

Also, comparisons of The RMR Group Inc.'s revenues, Adjusted net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc., EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, net income and net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 to the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 are presented later in this press release.\nTotal Assets Under Management:\nThe calculation of total assets under management includes: (i) the gross book value of real estate and related assets, excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or other non-cash reserves, of the Managed Equity REITs and ABP Trust, plus (ii) the gross book value of real estate assets, property and equipment of the Managed Operators, excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or other non-cash reserves, plus (iii) the fair value of investments of Affiliates Insurance Company, the managed assets of RMR Real Estate Income Fund and the equity of Tremont Mortgage Trust (TRMT), plus (iv) the contributed capital of and outstanding principal of loans serviced for certain private clients. This calculation of total assets under management may include amounts in respect of the Managed Equity REITs that are higher than the calculations of assets under management used for purposes of calculating fees under the terms of the business management agreements, which are based, in part, upon the lesser of the historical cost of real estate assets or total market capitalization.

The RMR Group Inc. considers EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to be appropriate supplemental measures of its operating performance, along with net income, net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. and operating income. The RMR Group Inc. believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain amounts, such as income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, other asset amortization, operating expenses paid in The RMR Group Inc.'s common shares, separation costs, transaction and acquisition related costs, business email compromise fraud costs, tax receivable agreement remeasurement due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, incentive business management fees earned, and certain other net adjustments, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may facilitate a comparison of current operating performance with The RMR Group Inc.’s historical operating performance and with the performance of other asset management businesses. In addition, The RMR Group Inc. believes that providing Adjusted EBITDA Margin may help investors assess The RMR Group Inc.’s performance of its business by providing the margin that Adjusted EBITDA represents to its contractual management and advisory fees (excluding any incentive business management fees). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. or operating income as an indicator of The RMR Group Inc.’s financial performance or as a measure of The RMR Group Inc.’s liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. and operating income as presented in The RMR Group Inc.'s condensed consolidated statements of income. Also, other asset management businesses may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than The RMR Group Inc. does. (2) These contractual management fees are the base business management fees, property management fees and advisory fees The RMR Group Inc. earns pursuant to its management and investment advisory agreements with its client companies. These amounts are calculated pursuant to the contractual formulas and do not deduct other asset amortization of $2,354 for each of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and $4,708 for each of the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, required to be recognized as a reduction to management services revenues in accordance with GAAP and do not include the incentive business management fees of $155,881 and $52,407 that The RMR Group Inc. recognized under GAAP during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which were earned for the calendar years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
