Slideshow (3 Images)\nEverton boss Sam Allardyce responded with the introduction of midfielder Davy Klaassen at the break, but it was West Ham who doubled their lead with a fierce shot from Marko Arnautovic.\nThe visitors pulled one back through striker Oumar Niasse before Lanzini applied the finishing touches to a West Ham victory five minutes from time with a curling finish.\nWest Ham secured a 13th-placed finish as David Moyes celebrated his first league victory as manager over his former club Everton in six attempts.
