    "text": "MAJURO, Marshall Islands, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pioneer Marine Inc. and its subsidiaries (OSLO-OTC:PNRM) (\"Pioneer Marine,\" or the \"Company\") a leading shipowner and global drybulk handysize transportation service provider announced its financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights:\nNet Income - $1.3 Million Net income of $1.3 million or $0.04 per share for Q1 2018, increased by $6.2 million compared to a loss of $4.9 million for Q1 2017.\nTime Charter equivalent (TCE) revenue - $12.8 Million $12.8 million for Q1 2018, increased by $2.8 million or 28% compared to $10 million for Q1 2017; Similarly, TCE per day was increased by 29% to $8,994 per day for Q1 2018 as compared to $6,997 per day for Q1 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA* - $4.6 Million $4.6 million positive Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2018, increased by $3.4 million compared to $1.2 million for Q1 2017.\nRecent Events:\nOn April 4 th , 2018, Pioneer Marine entered into an agreement with clients of Interorient Navigation Company Limited of Cyprus, to acquire three 37,000 dwt Korean bulk carriers built at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. Ltd. (years built 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively) at attractive price levels, with anticipated delivery dates within June 2018. Pioneer has secured bank financing for these three vessels, subject to completion of documentation.\nOn April 18 th , 2018 Pioneer Marine and BaltNav A/S (“BaltNav”) mutually agreed to cease their cooperation on an amicable basis. The commercial management of the eight (8) vessels performed by BaltNav will be undertaken gradually by the Company and is expected to be completed by June 2018.\nWithin April 2018, the Company purchased for treasury 637,122 of its ordinary shares at a discount compared to Net Asset Value (“NAV”).\nLiquidity & Capital Resources:\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had a total liquidity of $76 million inclusive of $14.4 million in restricted cash. The Company has no capital commitments as of March 31, 2018 .\n*For reconciliation and definition of Adjusted EBITDA refer to “Summary of Operating Data (unaudited)” section within this press release.\nTorben Janholt, Chief Executive Officer commented: “Pioneer concluded a successful 2018 first quarter, with a positive Adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million and a Net Profit of $1.3 million. The implementation of cost reduction measures that were undertaken by the new Executive Management Team, after the restructuring, as well as the improved drybulk market are the key reasons that led Pioneer to these positive results.\n“The average BHSI stood at $8,480 per day for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $6,599 per day for the same prior year period, reflecting a 29% increase. Considering that the first quarter is often the weakest quarter of the year due to seasonal factors such as the Chinese New Year, there is optimism going forward. There is still an acceptable balance between supply and demand in the market, however looming trade wars could influence the market going forward in a negative way.\n“Company’s Executive Management along with the support of a young, efficient and committed team is continuously exploring and taking advantage of market opportunities aiming to further reduce costs, increase revenues and maximise efficiencies. We are pleased for the successful deals in line with our strategy for fleet expansion and optimization.\n“Looking forward, we have a strong balance sheet and we aim to further take advantage of the positive momentum to maximize our shareholders wealth.”\nFinancial Review: Three months ended March 31, 2018\nTime Charter Equivalent (\"TCE\") revenue amounted to $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $10 million for the first quarter of 2017. TCE per day for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 29% to $8,994 per day as compared to $6,997 per day for the first quarter of 2017. The increase of the TCE revenue is attributable to the improved market rates and the more efficient operation of the chartering department.\nThe Company continues to keep vessels operating expenses (“OPEX”) under control at $7.2 million or $4,992 per day for the first quarter of 2018 reduced by 5% as compared to $7.6 million or $4,997 per day for the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring first quarter of 2018 no vessels were drydocked and the amount of approximately $0.1 million relates to initial expenses for the upcoming Drydocks of Eden Bay and Paradise Bay. During the corresponding period of 2017 five vessels completed their special surveys and drydock expense amount to $2.6 million.\nDepreciation expense for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $2 million from $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease of $0.1 million in depreciation expense is due to the decreased number of fleet vessels during first quarter of 2018.\nGeneral and administration expenses for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $0.9 million or $605 per day, which is significantly reduced by 18% as compared to same quarter in 2017. The decrease in G&A expenses per day is attributed to the successful restructuring of the Company which took place during second quarter of 2017 and the overall better control the Company has over General and Administrative Expenses due to the centralization of company’s key departments in Greece.\nInterest expense and finance cost for the first quarter of 2018 amounted to $1.4 million, reduced by $0.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2017. The slight reduction is due to the decreased indebtedness despite the increased floating rates as compared to same period in previous year.\nInterest Income for the first quarter of 2018 amounted to $0.2 million, increased by $0.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase is attributable to the improved market rates compared to first quarter of 2017 as well as the continuous monitoring of treasury management opportunities available in the market.\nCurrent Fleet List\nA/A Vessel Yard DWT Year Built Handysize 1 Calm Bay Saiki Heavy Industries 37,534 2006 2 Reunion Bay Kanda Shipbuilding 32,354 2006 3 Fortune Bay Shin Kochijyuko 28,671 2006 4 Ha Long Bay Kanda Kawajiri 32,311 2007 5 Teal Bay Kanda Kawajiri 32,327 2007 6 Eden Bay Shimanami Shipyard 28,342 2008 7 Emerald Bay Kanda Shipbuilding 32,258 2008 8 Mykonos Bay Jinse Shipbuilding 32,411 2009 9 Resolute Bay Hyundai Vinashin 36,767 2012 10 Jupiter Bay Tsuji Heavy Industries 29,997 2012 11 Venus Bay Tsuji Heavy Industries 30,003 2012 12 Orion Bay Tsuji Heavy Industries 30,009 2012 13 Falcon Bay Yangzhou Guoyu Shipbuilding 38,464 2015 14 Kite Bay Yangzhou Guoyu Shipbuilding 38,419 2016 Handymax 15 Paradise Bay Oshima Shipbuilding 46,232 2003 Supramax 16 Tenacity Bay Jiangsu Hantong Ship Heavy Industry 56,842 2008 Vessels to be delivered\n17 TBN Alsea Bay Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co.

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. We believe that including Adjusted EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) or cash flow from operations, as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.\nVessel Utilization: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Ship days (2) 1,440 1,530 Less: Off-hire days 15 17 Less: Off-hire days due to drydock - 85 Operating days (3) 1,425 1,428 Fleet Utilization (4) 99 % 93 % TCE per day- $ (1) 8,994 6,997 OPEX per day- $ (6) 4,992 4,997 G&A expenses per day- $ (7) 605 727 Vessels at period end 16 17 Average number of vessels during the period (5) 16 17 (1) Time Charter Equivalent, or TCE revenue, are non-GAAP measures. Our method of computing TCE revenue is determined by voyage revenues less voyage expenses (including bunkers and port charges). Such TCE revenue, divided by the number of our operating days during the period, is TCE per day, which is consistent with industry practice. TCE revenue is included because it is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance irrespective of changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters and time charters), and it provides useful information to investors and management.\n(2) Ship days: We define ship days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ship days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period.\n(3) Operating days: We define operating days as the number of our ship days in a period less days required to prepare vessels acquired for their initial voyage and off-hire days associated with off-hire for undergoing repairs, drydocks or special surveys. The Company uses operating days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues.\n(4) Fleet utilization is defined as the ratio of operating days to ship days.\n(5) Average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of ship days divided by the number of calendar days in that period.\n(6) Opex per day is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ship days for the relevant time period.\n(7) G&A expenses per day is calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses by ship days for the relevant time period.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)\n(In thousands of U.S. Dollars)\nAs at March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 ASSETS Cash & cash equivalents 61,637 61,354 Restricted cash (current and noncurrent) 14,360 12,468 Vessels, net 169,437 171,387 Other receivables 7,701 5,449 Other assets 297 62 Total assets 253,432 250,720 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 5,725 4,249 Deferred revenue 969 656 Total debt, net of deferred finance costs 92,173 92,535 Total liabilities 98,867 97,440 Shareholders' equity 154,565 153,280 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity 253,432 250,720\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (Unaudited)\n(In thousands of U.S. Dollars)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Cash flows from operating activities Net income/(loss) 1,300 (4,880 ) Adjustments to reconcile net income/(loss) to net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities: Depreciation 2,035 2,139 Amortization of deferred finance fees 185 212 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (743 ) 856 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities 2,777 (1,673 ) Cash flows from investing activities Payments for vessel acquisition and vessels improvements (42 ) (144 ) Purchase of other fixed assets (13 ) (3 ) Increase in short Term Investment - (15,083 ) Net cash used in investing activities (55 ) (15,230 ) Cash flows from financing activities Loan repayments (547 ) (2,699 ) Payment of deferred finance fees and other loan fees - (10 ) Net cash used in financing activities (547 ) (2,709 ) Net increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 2,175 (19,612 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the beginning of the period 73,822 81,822 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at period end 75,997 62,210\nAbout Pioneer Marine Inc.\nPioneer Marine is a leading ship owner and global drybulk handysize transportation service provider.
