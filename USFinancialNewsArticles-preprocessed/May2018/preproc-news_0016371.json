FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion vs Tottenham Hotspur - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - May 5, 2018 West Bromwich Albion caretaker manager Darren Moore during the lap of honour after the match Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff\nMoore replaced Alan Pardew at the start of April, taking over with the club seven points adrift at the bottom of the table and 10 short of safety with six matches to play.\nHe drew his first game in charge against fellow strugglers Swansea City before overseeing wins against Manchester United and Newcastle United and a draw with Liverpool.\nThe 44-year-old said the team’s recent success was down to togetherness.\n“I am really delighted,” he told the Premier League website. “It’s been a wonderful joint-effort by everybody here. We’ve just brought some unity here and it’s helped the players put the performances together on the pitch.”\nMoore fended off competition from Everton’s Sam Allardyce, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, Crystal Palace’s Roy Hodgson and Manchester United’s Jose Mourinho to win the award.\nHis West Brom team beat fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur in their first match this month on Saturday to lift themselves off the bottom of the table for the first time since January.
