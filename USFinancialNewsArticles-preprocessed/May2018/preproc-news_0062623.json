    "text": "0 COMMENTS U.S. government bonds rallied Tuesday, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to its biggest one-day decline since the aftermath of the Brexit vote, as political turmoil in Italy fueled concerns about the stability of the European Union.\nThe 10-year yield fell to 2.772% from 2.931% Friday, its biggest single-session decline since June 24, 2016. Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, have posted their biggest four-session slump since November 2011. The 30-year yield fell below 3% to 2.971%, its lowest closing level since April 2.\nYields fell after Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, on Sunday blocked the formation of a euroskeptic government, reviving longstanding European fears that Italy, with €2.3 trillion ($2.67 trillion) in debt and a sluggish economy, could trigger a new existential crisis in the eurozone.\nThe 10-year yield had climbed above 3% this year to its highest levels since July 2011, boosted by expectations for an acceleration in the pace of growth and inflation, along with tax cuts and a surge in government spending that have increased borrowing and the supply of new bonds.\n“Italy is a big deal,” said Donald Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies at Federated Investors .\nThough the risk of Italy leaving the European Union or abandoning the euro currency remains small, he said, investors now need to consider the possibility that people will pull money from banks in Italy and other trouble spots and move those assets to Germany or other safer places.\nA full-blown return to runs on Italian debt that threatened the survival of the eurozone in 2011 and 2012 isn’t visible so far, with analysts and investors saying that this time the concerns are primarily political rather than economic. The yield on the Italian 10-year bond posted its biggest one-day surge in more than five years Tuesday, rising to 3.104% from 2.682% Monday. That is its highest close since May 2014, although far from a crisis-era peak of more than 7% in late 2011.\nYet the moves in Italy underscore some of the difficulties the European economy has had in sustaining the growth rate it achieved last year. Those difficulties have increased concerns that global growth will slow, and eventually hinder the pace of the U.S. expansion—worries reflected in federal-funds futures, which investors use to bet on central-bank policy.\nLate Tuesday, those suggested that the probability of four Federal Reserve rate increases this year had fallen to 13% from 51% a week ago, according to CME Group . The chances that the Fed raises rates two times or fewer this year rose to 47% from 8% during the week.\nThe yield on two-year Treasurys, which typically moves in line with expectations for Fed interest-rate policy, fell to 2.319% from 2.480% Friday, the biggest drop since March 18, 2009, the day the Fed announced its round of Treasury-bond purchases under its quantitative-easing program.\nInvestors also are looking to see how Fed Chairman Jerome Powell approaches the concerns about how Italian turmoil affects Europe and the global economy.\n“The Fed has to send a clear message that they want to slow down” the pace of rate increases, said Jack McIntyre, who manages global bond portfolios with Brandywine Global Investment Management. While Mr. Powell’s predecessor, Janet Yellen, was known for factoring concerns about the global economy into rate decisions, “Powell has given mixed signals,” Mr. McIntyre said.\nAt the same time investors are focusing on the Italian political situation, the foundation for global growth is being rattled by rising concerns about policies that could impede trade.\nThe Trump administration caught Chinese officials off-guard Tuesday morning, sending a message that the U.S. was moving forward with its threat to apply tariffs on Chinese imports and other moves to restrict Beijing from accessing sensitive U.S. technology. That follows on the heels of last week’s announcement that the administration is pushing to impose new tariffs on auto imports, which could lead to slower growth by inviting retaliatory moves from Germany, Japan and South Korea.\n“That can’t be good for U.S. economic growth,” said Andrew Brenner, head of global fixed-income at NatAlliance Securities. With the problems in Italy appearing persistent, yields on 10-year U.S. government debt may continue to fall as low as 2.65%, he said.\nEvents in Europe also threaten to overshadow significant data releases later in the week, particularly Friday’s nonfarm-payrolls report, investors said. Though the labor market has been the most consistent sign of strength in the U.S. economy, gains in workers’ wages haven’t kept pace with the decline in the unemployment rate, which fell to 3.9% in April, the lowest since 2000.\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com",
