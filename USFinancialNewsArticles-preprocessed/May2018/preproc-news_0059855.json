    "text": "SHANGHAI, May 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jupai Holdings Limited (\"Jupai\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: JP), a leading third-party wealth management service provider, focusing on distributing wealth management products and providing quality product advisory services to high-net-worth individuals in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nNet revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were RMB433.2 million (US [1] $69.1 million), a 17.5% increase from the corresponding period in 2017.\n(RMB '000, except percentages)\nQ1 2017\nQ1 2017 %\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2018 %\nYoY Change %\nOne-time commissions\n234,759\n63.70%\n276,435\n63.80%\n17.80%\nRecurring management fees\n67,617\n18.30%\n122,908\n28.40%\n81.80%\nRecurring service fees\n26,225\n7.10%\n15,058\n3.50%\n-42.60%\nOther service fees\n40,139\n10.90%\n18,816\n4.30%\n-53.10%\nTotal net revenues\n368,740\n100.00%\n433,217\n100.00%\n17.50%\nIncome from operations in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB152.5 million (US$24.3 million), a 21.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2017. Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB115.9 million (US$18.5 million), a 27.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2017. Non-GAAP [2] net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB126.1 million (US$20.1 million), a 24.7% increase from the corresponding period in 2017.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 OPERATIONAL UPDATES\nTotal number of active clients [3] during the first quarter of 2018 was 4,167. The aggregate value of wealth management products distributed by the Company during the first quarter of 2018 was RMB10.9 billion (US$1.7 billion), a 23.2% decrease from the corresponding period in 2017.\n[1] The U.S. dollars (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release, except for those transaction amounts that were actually settled in U.S. dollars, are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. The conversion of Renminbi (RMB) into U.S. dollars (US$) in this press release is based on the noon buying rate on March 30, 2018, as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which was RMB6.2726 to US$1.00. The percentages stated in this press release are calculated based on the Renminbi amounts.\n[2] Jupai's non-GAAP financial measures are derived from adjusting the corresponding GAAP financial measures by excluding the effects of share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets resulted from business acquisitions.\n[3] \"Active clients\" for a given period refers to clients who purchase wealth management products distributed by Jupai at least once during that given period.\nWealth management products distributed by the Company - breakdown by product type\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2018\nProduct type\n(RMB in millions, except percentages)\nFixed income products\n11,218\n79%\n3,933\n36%\nPrivate equity products\n2,332\n16%\n6,043\n56%\nSecondary market equity fund products\n20\n1%\n691\n6%\nOther products\n628\n4%\n231\n2%\nAll products\n14,198\n100%\n10,898\n100%\nJupai's coverage network as of March 31, 2018 included 73 client centers covering 48 cities, as compared to 72 client centers covering 44 cities as of March 31, 2017. Total assets under management [4] as of March 31, 2018 were RMB54.5 billion (US$8.7 billion), a 5.3% decrease from December 31, 2017 and a 26.5% increase from March 31, 2017.\n[4] \"Assets under management\" or \"AUM\" of Jupai refers to the amount of capital contributions made by investors to the funds managed by the Company, for which the Company is entitled to receive management fees. The amount of AUM of Jupai is recorded and carried based on the historical cost of the contributed assets instead of fair market value of assets for almost all AUM of Jupai. For assets denominated in currencies other than Renminbi, the AUM are translated into Renminbi upon their contribution, without interim value adjustments solely due to changes in foreign exchange rates. As a result, Jupai's management fees for almost all its AUM are calculated based on the historical cost balance of the AUM.\nAssets under management â€“ breakdown by product type\nAs of\nMarch 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2018\nProduct type\n(RMB in millions, except percentages)\nFixed income products\n22,856\n53%\n27,385\n51%\nPrivate equity products\n16,774\n39%\n24,098\n44%\nSecondary market equity fund products\n2,997\n7%\n2,246\n4%\nOther products\n451\n1%\n772\n1%\nAll products\n43,078\n100%\n54,501\n100%\n\"Jupai had a solid first quarter of 2018, with both top and bottom-line results surpassing expectations,\" said Mr. Jianda Ni, Jupai's chairman of the board and chief executive officer. \"While net revenues for the quarter increased to RMB433.2 million at a year-over-year growth rate of 17.5%, the aggregate value of wealth management products distributed by Jupai saw a year-over-year decrease to RMB10.9 billion due to the Chinese New Year holiday as well as regulatory changes. We benefited, however, from enhanced bargaining power with real estate companies which have been facing higher cost of capital due to the recent policy changes. As a result, Jupai's average one-time commission rate for the quarter rose to approximately 2.5%, as compared to approximately 2% for the full year of 2017. Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter reached RMB115.9 million, up 27.8% year-over-year, with net profit margin rising to 26.7% from 24.6% in the same period of last year.\"\n\"To adapt to the newly introduced industry regulations, in the first quarter of 2018, Jupai leveraged our rich experience and resources in the real estate industry to accelerate development of our real estate equity related products, including mezzanine investments, convertible bonds and M&A funds. We have received very positive feedback on these products, with our total assets under management reaching RMB54.5 billion as of March 31, 2018, representing a 26.5% year-over-year increase.\"\n\"We believe that the solid performance Jupai achieved in the first quarter reflects our team's capability to adapt to market changes and launch new products which satisfy both regulatory requirements and customer needs. Leveraging our rigorous risk control system, Jupai will further broaden our product portfolio to better fulfill customers' wealth management and asset allocation needs. We are optimistic that Jupai will maintain healthy growth in 2018 as management focuses on building China's leading wealth and asset management brand.\"\nMs. Min Liu, Jupai's chief financial officer, said, \"Over the first quarter of 2018, Jupai's business continued to grow steadily as we further optimized the company's cost structure and operating efficiency, which helped to drive our operating margin to 35.2%. As we look to achieve additional cost efficiencies, we remain confident in our bottom-line growth outlook for 2018.\"\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB433.2 million (US$69.1 million), a 17.5% increase from the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to increases in one-time commissions and recurring management fees.\nNet revenues from one-time commissions for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB276.4 million (US$44.1 million), a 17.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in fee rates. Net revenues from recurring management fees for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB122.9 million (US$19.6 million), an 81.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in the value of assets under management. The Company recognized RMB20.7 million (US$3.3 million) and RMB1.7 million carried interest in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net revenues from recurring service fees for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB15.1 million (US$2.4 million), a 42.6% decrease from the corresponding period in 2017, primarily because the Company provided ongoing services to fewer product suppliers. The Company recognized nil and RMB1.4 million variable performance fees in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net revenues from other service fees for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB18.8 million (US$3.0 million), a 53.1% decrease from the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to decreases in sub-advisory fees collected from other companies.\nStarting from January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), on a modified-retrospective basis. The adoption has no material impact on the Company's financial positions, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOperating costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB280.7 million (US$44.8 million), an increase of 15.3% from the corresponding period in 2017.\nCost of revenues for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB130.4 million (US$20.8 million), a 3.2% decrease from the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to a reduction in performance-based compensation as a result of a decline in the aggregate value of wealth management products distributed. Selling expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB85.4 million (US$13.6 million), a 43.4% increase from the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to the increase in marketing expenses. G&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB65.0 million (US$10.4 million), a 23.6% increase from the corresponding period in 2017, mainly due to the increase in both the numbers of managerial and administrative personnel and their average compensation. Other operating income (government subsidies) received by the Company in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB0.1 million (US$0.02 million), a 95.9% decrease from the corresponding period in 2017. Government subsidies were recorded when received, with their availability and amount dependent upon government administrative policies.\nOperating margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 35.2%, compared to 34.0% for the corresponding period in 2017.\nIncome tax expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB39.1 million (US$6.2 million), a 32.0% increase from the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in taxable income.\nNet Income\nNet Income\n- Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB115.9 million (US$18.5 million), a 27.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2017.\n- Net margin attributable to ordinary shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was 26.7%, as compared to 24.6% for the corresponding period in 2017.\n- Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders per basic and diluted American depositary share (\"ADS\") for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB3.50 (US$0.56) and RMB3.30 (US$0.53), respectively, as compared to RMB2.81 and RMB2.69, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2017.\nThe industry regulations newly introduced on March 28, 2018 emphasize that asset management businesses conducted through the internet are subject to oversight from financial regulatory authorities. Pursuant to these regulations, Shanghai Runju Financial Information Service Co., Ltd. (\"Runju\"), a non-controlling investee of Jupai, has formulated a new business plan to adjust its business model. Based on management's latest evaluation, no impairment loss needs to be recorded for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Future impairment analysis will be performed at each quarter end.\nNon-GAAP Net Income\n- Non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB126.1 million (US$20.1 million), a 24.7% increase from the corresponding period in 2017.\n- Non-GAAP net margin attributable to ordinary shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was 29.1%, as compared to 27.4% for the corresponding period in 2017.\n- Non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders per diluted ADS for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB3.59 (US$0.57), as compared to RMB3.00 for the corresponding period in 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had RMB824.2 million (US$131.4 million) in cash and cash equivalents , compared to RMB1,527.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the first quarter of 2018 was RMB150.6 million (US$24.0 million).\nNet cash used in investing activities during the first quarter of 2018 was RMB557.0 million (US$88.8 million).\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the first quarter of 2018 was RMB4.0 million (US$0.6 million).\nBUSINESS OUTLOOK\nThe Company estimates that its net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the full year of 2018 will be in the range of RMB532.3 million to RMB573.3 million, an increase of 30.0% to 40.0% compared to 2017. This forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nJupai's management will host an earnings conference call on May 28, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (8:00 p.m. Beijing/Hong Kong time).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nU.S./International:\n+1-845-675-0437 or +1-866-519-4004\nHong Kong:\n+852-3018-6771 or 800-906-601\nMainland China:\n400-620-8038 or 800-819-0121\nSingapore\n+65-6713-5090 or 800-101-2868\nPasscode:\n3688852\nPlease dial in 10 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin and provide the passcode to join the call.\nA replay of the conference call may be accessed by phone at the following numbers until June 5, 2018:\nU.S./International:\n+1-855-452-5696\nHong Kong:\n800-963-117\nMainland China:\n400-632-2162\nSingapore\n800-616-2305\nPasscode:\n3688852\nAdditionally, a live and archived webcast will be available at http://jupai.investorroom.com .\nDISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of all forms of share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP measures as set forth in the table captioned \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" below.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company may be prepared differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWhen evaluating the Company's operating performance in the periods presented, management reviewed non-GAAP net income results reflecting adjustments to exclude the impacts of share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition to supplement U.S. GAAP financial data. As such, the Company believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shares per diluted ADS and non-GAAP net margin attributable to ordinary shareholders provides important supplemental information to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations in a manner consistent with that used by management. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, the Company recognized significant amounts of expenses for the restricted shares and share options, and amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition in the periods presented. The Company utilized the non-GAAP financial results to make financial results comparable period to period and to better understand its historical business operations.\nABOUT JUPAI HOLDINGS LIMITED\nJupai Holdings Limited (\"Jupai\") (NYSE: JP) is a leading third-party wealth management service provider focusing on distributing wealth management products and providing quality product advisory services to high-net-worth individuals in China.
