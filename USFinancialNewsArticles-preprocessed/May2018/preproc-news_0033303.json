A picture illustration taken with the multiple exposure function of the camera shows a one Euro coin and a map of Europe, January 9, 2013. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nEurostat confirmed its earlier preliminary flash estimate that gross domestic product in the 19 countries that share the euro rose 0.4 percent quarter on quarter in the January-March period slowing from 0.7 percent in the previous quarters.\nYear-on-year, euro zone GDP grew 2.5 percent, in line with the preliminary estimate and down from 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2.7 percent in the third quarter.\nEurostat also said that industrial production rose 0.5 percent month-on-month in March, falling short of market expectations of a 0.7 percent rise. Year-on-year, production increased 3.0 percent in March against expectations of a rise of 3.7 percent.\nFebruary output numbers were revised down as well to -0.9 percent month-on-month from -0.8 and to 2.6 percent year-on-year from 2.9 percent.
