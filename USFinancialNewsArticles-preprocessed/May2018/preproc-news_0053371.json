    "text": "ATHENS, Greece, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- STEALTHGAS INC. (NASDAQ: GASS), a ship-owning company primarily serving the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sector of the international shipping industry, announced today its unaudited financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nOperational utilization of 93.3% in Q1 18’ (97.3% in Q1 17’) due to increased presence in the spot market and the positioning of several vessels in new trading areas. About 73% of fleet days secured on period charters for the remainder of 2018, with a total of about $171 million in contracted revenues. Successful delivery of our last 22K semi ref new build vessel, the Eco Freeze in April 2018, with which we concluded our new building program of 26 new vessels since 2011. Sale and delivery of the Gas Enchanted (2006 built) and sale of another two vessels, the Gas Legacy (1998 built) and the Gas Evoluzione (1996 built), with expected deliveries in Q3 ’18 - all for an aggregate price of $17.5 million. Revenues of $39.7 million in Q1 ‘18, an increase of 4.2% compared to Q1 ‘17 Adjusted EBITDA of $13.7 million in Q1 ‘18 compared to $ 15.4 million in Q1 ‘17. Low gearing as debt to assets stands at about 43%. Cash on hand of approximately $52.7 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results:\nRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $39.7 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 4.2%, compared to revenues of $38.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, mainly as a result of improved market conditions in the small LPG segment. Voyage expenses and vessels’ operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $5.6 million and $15.4 million respectively, compared to $3.6 million and $14.9 million respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $2.0 million increase in voyage expenses was mainly attributed to a quarter on quarter increase of average bunker prices by 20% and the ballasting costs of three of our vessels amounting to approximately $0.6 million. The 3.4% increase in vessels’ operating expenses compared to the same period of 2017 was mostly due to the operation of the large LPG semi refrigerated vessels that were not in our fleet in the same period of last year. Drydocking costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $1.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The costs for the first quarter of 2018 corresponded to the drydocking of two LPG vessels and one product tanker, while in the same period of 2017 the Company completed the drydocking of two LPG vessels. Depreciation for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $10.5 million, a $0.8 million increase from $9.7 million for the same period of last year due to the addition of the three new 22,000 cbm semi-refrigerated LPG vessels. Included in the first quarter 2018 results were net losses from interest rate derivative instruments of $0.05 million compared to net losses of $0.13 million in the same period of last year. Interest paid on interest rate derivative instruments amounted to $0.07 million compared to $0.14 million in the same period of last year. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $3.8 million for three of its vessels, one of which has been classified as held for sale, as of March 31, 2018. As a result of the above, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of $5.8 million, compared to a net income of $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The weighted average number of shares for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 39.9 million compared to 39.8 million for the same period of 2017. Loss per share, basic and diluted, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $0.14 compared to earnings per share of $0.05 for the same period of last year. Adjusted net loss was $2.0 million or $0.05 loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to adjusted net income of $2.0 million or $0.05 earnings per share for the same period of last year. EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $9.9 million. Reconciliations of Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss are set forth below. An average of 51.7 vessels were owned by the Company during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 53.0 vessels for the same period of 2017.\nFleet Update Since Previous Announcement\nThe Company announced the conclusion of the following chartering arrangements:\nA one year time charter extension for its 2006 built LPG carrier the Gas Alice, to an oil company until August 2019. A one year time charter for its 2018 built LPG carrier the Eco Freeze, to an international LPG trader until April 2019. A one year time charter for one of our chartered in, 2010 built, LPG carrier the Astrid, to an international LPG trader until April 2019. A one year time charter for its 2001 built LPG carrier the Gas Nemesis II to an international LPG operator until April 2019. A one year bareboat charter for its 2010 aframax carrier the Stealth Berana to an international tanker operator until August 2019. A one year bareboat charter extension for its 2012 built LPG carrier the Gas Esco, to a state owned shipping company until June 2019. A three months’ time charter for its 2001 built LPG carrier the Gas Spirit, to an international trading house until August 2018. A one year time charter for its 2008 built product tanker the Magic Wand, to an international trading house until May 2019. A one month time charter extension for its 1996 built LPG Carrier the Gas Evoluzione, to an oil international chemical products trader until July 2018. A one month time charter for its 2008 built LPG Carrier the Gas Imperiale, to an international trading house until June 2018.\nWith these charters, the Company has contracted revenues of approximately $171 million. Total anticipated voyage days of our fleet is 73% covered for the remainder of 2018 and 34% for 2019.\nBoard Chairman Michael Jolliffe Commented\nThe first quarter of 2018 was a busy period for our Company in terms of sale and purchase activity. We agreed to the sale of three additional vessels, two older ones and one fairly modern, all at an aggregate price of $17.5 million. More evidence that values are firming even on older vessels was provided by these sales, as we sold the Gas Legacy (1998 built) at 5.6 times demolition value and the Gas Evoluzione (1996 built) at 4.2 times demolition value.\nIn addition to this and as announced a month ago, we took delivery of the last 22,000 cbm semi-refrigerated new build LPG thus concluding our newbuilding programme which counts the delivery of 26 vessels since 2011, most built in Japan.\nBoth our net revenue and profitability were affected this quarter by the rise in oil prices which increased our voyage costs and the increase in LIBOR rates which affected our finance costs. In addition we saw a slower spot market for our LPG carriers in February in the weeks around Chinese New Year. These factors coupled with the weak earnings from our tankers led to lower than anticipated margins.\nThis quarter company specific factors deemed as one off events had an impact on our revenue and profitability as well. In particular costs related to the delivery and commencement of trading for vessels Eco Arctic and Eco Ice, the second and third vessels in our series of four handy sized new buildings, and in addition significant ballasting costs on another vessel which changed trading region, burdened our voyage costs within this quarter with about $0.6 million.\nWe continue to observe that our core market’s fundamentals have improved as rates for small LPG carriers are still on the rise, and the forecast is that they will continue to do so at least for the next couple of years.\nTaking this into account, our main focus is to take advantage of this positive market momentum to the fullest and calibrate our fleet management strategy so as to increase our profitability. We have so far in the second quarter of 2018 reduced our commercial idle days by about 90% compared to the first quarter of this year. With an asset base in excess of USD 1 billion, low leverage and ideal demand and supply conditions, combined with improving freight rates, gives reason for optimism for the future.\nConference Call details:\nOn May 24, 2018 at 11:00 am ET, the company’s management will host a conference call to discuss the results and the company’s operations and outlook.\nParticipants should dial into the call 10 minutes before the scheduled time using the following numbers:\n888-224-1005 (US Toll Free Dial In) or 0800 279 7204 (UK Toll Free Dial In).\nAccess Code: 9762390.\nIn case of any problems with the above numbers, please dial +1 929-477-0448 (US Toll Dial In), +44 (0)330 336 9411 (Standard International Dial In).\nAccess Code: 9762390.\nA telephonic replay of the conference call will be available until May 31, 2018 by dialing +1 719-457-0820 (US Local Dial In), +44 (0) 207 660 0134 (UK Local Dial In).\nAccess Code: 9762390.\nSlides and audio webcast:\nThere will also be a live and then archived webcast of the conference call, through the STEALTHGAS INC. website ( www.stealthgas.com ).

Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance and may include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although STEALTHGAS INC. believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, STEALTHGAS INC. cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. Important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including changes in charter hire rates and vessel values, charter counterparty performance, changes in demand that may affect attitudes of time charterers to scheduled and unscheduled drydockings, shipyard performance, changes in STEALTHGAS INC’s operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs, ability to obtain financing and comply with covenants in our financing arrangements, or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents and political events or acts by terrorists.\nRisks and uncertainties are further described in reports filed by STEALTHGAS INC. with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFleet List and Fleet Deployment\nFor information on our fleet and further information:\nVisit our website at www.stealthgas.com\nCompany Contact:\nFenia Sakellaris\nSTEALTHGAS INC.\n011-30-210-6250-001\nE-mail: info@stealthgas.com\nFleet D ata:\nThe following key indicators highlight the Company’s operating performance during the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018.\nFLEET DATA Q1 2017 Q1 2018 Average number of vessels (1) 53.0 51.7 Period end number of owned vessels in fleet 53 52 Total calendar days for fleet (2) 4,950 4,839 Total voyage days for fleet (3) 4,893 4,787 Fleet utilization (4) 98.8% 98.9% Total charter days for fleet (5) 4,238 3,781 Total spot market days for fleet (6) 655 1,006 Fleet operational utilization (7) 97.3% 93.3% 1) Average number of vessels is the number of owned vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of days each vessel was a part of our fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period.\n2) Total calendar days for fleet are the total days the vessels we operated were in our possession for the relevant period including off-hire days associated with major repairs, drydockings or special or intermediate surveys.\n3) Total voyage days for fleet reflect the total days the vessels we operated were in our possession for the relevant period net of off-hire days associated with major repairs, drydockings or special or intermediate surveys.\n4) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that our vessels were available for revenue generating voyage days, and is determined by dividing voyage days by fleet calendar days for the relevant period.\n5) Total charter days for fleet are the number of voyage days the vessels operated on time or bareboat charters for the relevant period.\n6) Total spot market charter days for fleet are the number of voyage days the vessels operated on spot market charters for the relevant period.\n7) Fleet operational utilization is the percentage of time that our vessels generated revenue, and is determined by dividing voyage days (excluding commercially idle days) by fleet calendar days for the relevant period.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income/(Loss), EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS:\nAdjusted net income/(loss) represents net income/(loss) before loss on derivatives excluding net swap interest paid, share based compensation and impairment. EBITDA represents net income/(loss) before interest and finance costs including net swap interest paid, interest income and other income/(expenses) and depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before share based compensation, loss on derivatives, excluding net swap interest paid and impairment loss. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income/(loss) and adjusted EPS are not recognized measurements under U.S. GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income/(loss) and adjusted EPS may not be comparable to that reported by other companies in the shipping or other industries. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income/(loss), you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income/(loss) and adjusted EPS are included herein because they are a basis, upon which we assess our financial performance. They allow us to present our performance from period to period on a comparable basis and provide additional information on fleet operational results to investors. We also believe that EBITDA represents useful information for investors regarding a company's ability to service and/or incur indebtedness.\n(Expressed in United States Dollars,\nexcept for number of shares) Three Months Period Ended March 31st, 2017 2018 Net Income - Adjusted Net Income/Loss) Net income/(loss) 2,003,704 (5,773,237 ) Loss on derivatives 127,131 46,755 Less net swap interest paid (136,375 ) (65,268 ) Impairment loss -- 3,818,268 Share based compensation 35,902 -- Adjusted Net Income/(Loss) 2,030,362 (1,973,482 ) Net income/(loss) – EBITDA Net income/(loss) 2,003,704 (5,773,237 ) Plus interest and finance costs incl. net swap interest paid 3,747,868 5,204,835 Less interest income and other income (77,579 ) (99,396 ) Plus depreciation 9,704,454 10,530,359 EBITDA 15,378,447 9,862,561 Net income/(loss) - Adjusted EBITDA Net income/(loss) 2,003,704 (5,773,237 ) Loss on derivatives 127,131 46,755 Impairment loss -- 3,818,268 Share based compensation 35,902 -- Plus interest and finance costs 3,611,493 5,139,567 Less interest income and other income (77,579 ) (99,396 ) Plus depreciation 9,704,454 10,530,359 Adjusted EBITDA 15,405,105 13,662,316 EPS - Adjusted EPS Net income/(loss) 2,003,704 (5,773,237 ) Adjusted net income/(loss) 2,030,362 (1,973,482 ) Weighted average number of shares 39,802,885 39,860,563 EPS - Basic and Diluted 0.05 (0.14 ) Adjusted EPS 0.05 (0.05 )\nStealthGas Inc.\nUnaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Expressed in United States Dollars, except for number of shares) For The Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 * 2018 Revenues Revenues 37,052,341 39,695,482 Revenues - related party 1,011,750 -- Total revenues 38,064,091 39, 695 , 482 Expenses Voyage expenses 3,087,714 5,151,251 Voyage expenses - related party 475,133 483,899 Charter hire expenses 881,937 969,147 Vessels' operating expenses 14,520,106 15,358,413 Vessels' operating expenses - related party 401,431 27,000 Drydocking costs 691,745 1,503,080 Management fees - related party 1,809,450 1,743,600 General and administrative expenses 715,959 572,527 Depreciation 9,704,454 10,530,359 Impairment loss -- 3,818,268 Other operating costs 150,000 146,667 Total expenses 32,437,929 40 , 304 , 211 Income/( Loss ) from operations 5,626,162 ( 608 , 729 ) Other (expenses)/income Interest and finance costs (3,611,493 ) (5,139,567 ) Loss on derivatives (127,131 ) (46,755 ) Interest income and other income 77,579 99,396 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) 38,587 (77,582 ) Other expenses, net (3,622,458 ) (5,1 64 , 5 0 8 ) Net income/(loss) 2,003,704 (5, 773 , 237 ) Earnings /(Loss) per share - Basic and Diluted 0.05 (0.14 ) Weighted average number of shares - Basic and Diluted 39,802,885 39,860,563 *We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (\"ASU 2014-09\" or \"ASC 606\") as of January 1, 2018 utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition.
