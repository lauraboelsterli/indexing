    "text": "A nurse has been charged in the death of President Donald Trump 's former national security advisor's father at a Philadelphia senior care facility.\nThirty-year-old Christann Shyvin Gainey was charged Thursday with involuntary manslaughter, neglect and records tampering in the death of H.R. McMaster Sr.\nMcMaster died April 13, about eight hours after falling and hitting his head at the Cathedral Village retirement community.\nThe Pennsylvania attorney general's office says surveillance video showed that Gainey failed to conduct a series of neurological evaluations of McMaster as required. Prosecutors say she falsified documents to make it seem she had.\nIt wasn't immediately known if the contract employee had an attorney to comment on her behalf.\nMcMaster was an 84-year-old retired U.S. Army officer. His son served as Trump's national security advisor from February 2017 until March this year.",
