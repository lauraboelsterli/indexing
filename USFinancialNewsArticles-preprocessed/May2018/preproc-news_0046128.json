    "text": "CENTENNIAL, Colo., May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VirtualArmour International Inc. (OTCQB:VTLR) (CSE:VAI) (3V3:F), a premier cybersecurity managed services provider, has promoted Russ Armbrust to chief executive officer (CEO) and Andrew Douthwaite to the new position of chief technology officer (CTO).\nArmbrust previously served as vice president of sales, with Douthwaite serving as vice president of managed services. The company has made these appointments in light of its expanding customer base and the rapidly-growing interest in its managed service offerings. They also better align its management structure to address customer service activities and prepare for future growth.\nSince Armbrust joined VirtualArmour, he demonstrated strong leadership skills and client service capabilities that have helped broaden the company’s market reach and accelerate product development. The company recently reported revenue grew by 18% in 2017 to $10.5 million, with managed and professional services revenue up 35% to $2.8 million. The record growth reflects the addition of 34 new enterprise clients across multiple industries while maintaining an industry-leading 100% customer retention rate.\n“Our growth also reflects how the threats to corporate cybersecurity are intensifying around the world, and our technology has and must continue to remain ahead of the curve,” commented Armbrust. “Appointing Andrew to the new position of CTO demonstrates our commitment to this critical effort. He has been instrumental in advancing the engineering activity at our U.S. and UK offices, and has been playing a key role in overseeing our security operations centers. Under Andrew’s leadership in this key area of our business, we can support stronger growth in our higher-margin managed services business as we expand into new geographic markets.”\nBefore joining VirtualArmour, Armbrust served as vice president of business development at Axis Technical Group, a Microsoft Gold Partner and trusted business IT advisor to leading companies in the mortgage, title, healthcare, oil and gas, and financial services industries. Earlier, he served as vice president of operations and later as vice president of business development at Seeing Machines, a world leader in computer vision technologies.\nAfter joining VirtualArmour in 2007 as a senior engineer, Douthwaite was promoted to director of engineering services in 2012 and then to vice president of managed services in 2015. Based out of VirtualArmour’s UK office, he has led the growth in the company’s managed services business from two to more than 30 managed service customers. Earlier, he was a web developer at TeleWare after beginning his career as a software developer at Intex. He holds a computing and software engineering degree from Leeds Beckett University.\nAbout VirtualArmour\nVirtualArmour is a global cybersecurity and managed services provider that delivers customized solutions to help businesses build, monitor, maintain and secure their networks.\nThe company maintains 24/7 client monitoring and service management with specialist teams located in its U.S. and UK-based security operation centers.
