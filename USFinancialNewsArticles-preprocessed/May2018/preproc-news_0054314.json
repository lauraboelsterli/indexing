    "text": "SAN RAFAEL, Calif., May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2019\nNote: Starting the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Autodesk reports its results under two new accounting standards. Revenue is now reported under Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 606 and sales commissions are now reported under ASC 340-40. We did not recast historical information as we elected to use the modified retrospective transition method. These new standards did not result in a change in timing or amount of revenue recognized for the majority of our maintenance and subscription offerings. However, we are required to capitalize and amortize sales commissions under the new standards. ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 do not affect cash flows or subscriptions.\nSubscription plan ARR was $1.40 billion, an increase of 103 percent compared to the first quarter last year as reported, and 101 percent on a constant currency basis. Under the prior revenue accounting standard, ASC 605, subscription plan ARR was $1.43 billion, an increase of 106 percent compared to the first quarter last year. Total ARR was $2.13 billion, an increase of 22 percent compared to the first quarter last year as reported, and on a constant currency basis. Under ASC 605, total ARR was $2.17 billion, an increase of 25 percent compared to the first quarter last year. Subscription plan subscriptions increased 307,000 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to 2.57 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Subscription plan subscriptions benefited from 154,000 maintenance subscribers that converted to product subscription under the maintenance-to-subscription (M2S) program. Total subscriptions increased 101,000 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to 3.82 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Deferred revenue was $1.81 billion, flat compared to the first quarter last year. Unbilled deferred revenue at the end of the first quarter was $412 million. Total deferred revenue (deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred revenue) was $2.22 billion, an increase of approximately 21 percent compared to the first quarter last year. Under ASC 605, total deferred revenue was $2.28 billion, an increase of approximately 24 percent compared to the first quarter last year. Revenue was $560 million, an increase of 15 percent compared to the first quarter last year as reported, and on a constant currency basis. Under ASC 605, total revenue was $574 million, an increase of 18 percent compared to the first quarter last year. Billings were $411 million, a decrease of 18 percent compared to the first quarter last year driven primarily by the initial impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Under ASC 605, billings were $561 million, an increase of 12 percent compared to the first quarter last year. Total GAAP spend (cost of revenue plus operating expenses) was $615 million, an increase of 2 percent compared to the first quarter last year. Absent ASC 340-40, total GAAP spend was $602 million, a decrease of 1 percent compared to the first quarter last year. Total non-GAAP spend was $531 million, an increase of 1 percent compared to the first quarter last year. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the accompanying tables. Absent ASC 340-40, total non-GAAP spend was $518 million, a decrease of 1 percent compared to the first quarter last year. GAAP diluted net loss per share was $(0.38), compared to GAAP diluted net loss per share of $(0.59) in the first quarter last year. Under ASC 605 and absent ASC 340-40, total GAAP diluted net loss per share was $(0.27). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.06, compared to non-GAAP diluted net loss per share of $(0.16) in the first quarter last year. Under ASC 605 and absent ASC 340-40, total non-GAAP diluted net income per share was $0.16.\nFor definitions, please view the Glossary of Terms later in this document.\n\"Our first quarter results are a good start to the new fiscal year and demonstrate Autodesk is firmly in the growth phase of our business model transition,\" said Andrew Anagnost, Autodesk president and CEO. \"Once again, our focus on driving growth in ARR has yielded strong results, which we believe will accelerate as we move through the year. Our focus and investment on our customers' experience continued to drive customers to migrate from maintenance to subscription during the quarter. We've now seen approximately half a million maintenance subscriptions convert to product subscriptions in less than a year and we expect that number to grow significantly in the coming quarters.\"\n\"Our growth in ARR was only part of the story during the first quarter, as we also delivered strong growth in billings, total deferred revenue, and ARPS,\" said Scott Herren, Autodesk CFO. \"This quarter also marked another milestone in our business model transition with our return to non-GAAP profitability. Overall, we remain confident in achieving the targets we set for this year and the long-term targets laid out at our recent investor day.\"\nFirst Quarter Operational Overview\nSubscription plan ARR was $1.40 billion, an increase of 103 percent compared to the first quarter last year as reported, and 101 percent on a constant currency basis.

A reconciliation between the fiscal 2019 GAAP and non-GAAP estimates is provided below or in the tables following this press release.\nStarting the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Autodesk reports its results under two new accounting standards. Revenue is now reported under Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 606 and sales commissions are now reported under ASC 340-40. We did not recast historical information as we elected to use the modified retrospective transition method. These new standards did not result in a change in timing or amount of revenue recognized for the majority of our maintenance and subscription offerings. However, we are required to capitalize and amortize sales commissions under the new standards. ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 do not affect cash flows or subscriptions.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2019\nQ2 FY19 Guidance Metrics\nQ2 FY19 under 606 (ending July 31,\n2018)\nRevenue (in millions)\n$595 - $605\nEPS GAAP\n$(0.38) - $(0.35)\nEPS non-GAAP (1)\n$0.13 - $0.16\n(1)\nNon-GAAP earnings per diluted share excludes $0.27 related to stock-based compensation expense, between $0.16 related to\nGAAP-only tax charges, $0.05 related to restructuring and other facility exit costs, and $0.03 for the amortization of acquisition-\nrelated intangibles.\nFull Year Fiscal 2019\nFY19 Guidance Metrics\nFY19 under 605 (ending\nJanuary 31, 2019)\nFY19 under 606 (ending\nJanuary 31, 2019) (1)\nBillings (in millions)\n$2,720 - $2,820\n$2,560 - $2,660 (2)\nRevenue (in millions)\n$2,495 - $2,545\n$2,455 - $2,505 (3)\nGAAP spend growth (cost of revenue plus operating expenses)\n(2.5)% - (1.5)%\n(2.5)% - (1.5)%\nNon-GAAP spend growth (cost of revenue plus operating expenses) (4)\n1 - 2%\n1 - 2%\nEPS GAAP\n$(0.58) - $(0.40)\n$(0.73) - $(0.55)\nEPS non-GAAP (5)\n$0.92 - $1.10\n$0.77 - $0.95\nNet subscription additions\n500k - 550k\n500k - 550k\nTotal ARR growth\n29% - 31%\n28% - 30%\n(1)\nThe move to the new revenue standard results in a net reduction to revenue and EPS of approximately $40 million and $0.15 respectively, compared to what would have been recognized under ASC 605, and a reduction of approximately $20M in ARR.\n(2)\nBillings guidance reflects the initial impact of the adoption of ASC 606. This adjustment does not impact cash flow.\n(3)\nExcluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and hedge gains/losses, revenue guidance would be $2,420 - $2,470 million.\n(4)\nNon-GAAP spend excludes $235 million related to stock-based compensation expense, $33 million related to restructuring and other facility exit costs, and $28 million for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.\n(5)\nNon-GAAP earnings per diluted share excludes $1.08 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.15 related to GAAP-only tax charges, $0.15 related to restructuring and other facility exit costs, $0.13 for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and ($0.01) related to gains on strategic investments and dispositions.\nThe second quarter and full year fiscal 2019 outlook assume a projected annual effective tax rate of (68) percent and 19 percent for GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. Assumptions for the annual effective tax rate are regularly evaluated and may change based on the projected geographic mix of earnings. At this stage of the business model transition, small shifts in geographic profitability significantly impact the annual effective tax rate.\nEarnings Conference Call and Webcast\nAutodesk will host its second quarter conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET.

Refer to the definition of recurring revenue below for more details on what is included within ARR. Recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation.\nARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items.\nAnnualized Revenue Per Subscription (ARPS): Is calculated by dividing our annualized recurring revenue by the total number of subscriptions.\nBillings: Total revenue plus the net change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period.\nCloud Service Offerings: Represents individual term-based offerings deployed through web browser technologies or in a hybrid software and cloud configuration. Cloud service offerings that are bundled with other product offerings are not captured as a separate cloud service offering.\nConstant Currency (CC) Growth Rates: We attempt to represent the changes in the underlying business operations by eliminating fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as eliminating hedge gains or losses recorded within the current and comparative periods. We calculate constant currency growth rates by (i) applying the applicable prior period exchange rates to current period results and (ii) excluding any gains or losses from foreign currency hedge contracts that are reported in the current and comparative periods.\nEnterprise Business Agreements (EBAs): These represent programs providing enterprise customers with token-based access or a fixed maximum number of seats to a broad pool of Autodesk products over a defined contract term.\nFree cash flow: Cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures.\nMaintenance Plan: Our maintenance plans provide our customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts. Under our maintenance plans, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, and technical support. We recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the agreements, generally between one and three years.\nOther Revenue: Consists of revenue from consulting, training and other services, and is recognized over time as the services are performed. Other revenue also includes software license revenue from the sale of our discontinued perpetual licenses.\nProduct Subscription: Provide customers the most flexible, cost-effective way to access and manage 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software tools. Our product subscriptions currently represent a hybrid of desktop and SaaS functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders.\nRecurring Revenue: Consists of the revenue for the period from our traditional maintenance plans and revenue from our subscription plan offerings. It excludes subscription revenue related to consumer product offerings, select Creative Finishing product offerings, education offerings, and third party products. Recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation.\nSubscription Plan: Comprises our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and enterprise business agreements (EBAs). Subscriptions represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. With subscription, customers can use our software anytime, anywhere, and get access to the latest updates to previous versions.\nSubscription Revenue: Includes subscription fees from product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and enterprise business agreements (EBAs).\nTotal Deferred Revenue: Is calculated by adding together total short term, long term, and unbilled deferred revenue.\nTotal Subscriptions: Consists of subscriptions from our maintenance plans and subscription plan offerings that are active and paid as of the fiscal year end date. For certain cloud service offerings and enterprise business agreements (EBAs), subscriptions represent the monthly average activity reported within the last three months of the quarter end date. Total subscriptions do not include education offerings, consumer product offerings, select Creative Finishing product offerings, Autodesk Buzzsaw, Autodesk Constructware, and third party products. Subscriptions acquired with the acquisition of a business are captured once the data conforms to our subscription count methodology and when added, may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation.\nUnbilled deferred revenue: Unbilled deferred revenue represents contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multi-year billing plans for subscription, services, license and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not been recognized. Under ASC 606, unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements in the paragraphs under \"Business Outlook\" above, statements regarding ARR growth acceleration and maintenance to subscription conversions, other statements about our short-term and long-term targets, statements regarding the impacts and results of our business model transition, expectations regarding the transition of product offerings to subscription and acceptance by our customers and partners of subscriptions, expectations for billings, revenue, subscriptions, spend, EPS and ARR, statements about the impact of ASC 606, and other statements regarding our strategies, market and product positions, performance and results. There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results statements made in this press release, including: failure to achieve our revenue and profitability objectives; failure to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets; failure to maintain cost reductions or otherwise control our expenses; the success of our restructuring activities; difficulty in predicting revenue from new businesses and the potential impact on our financial results from changes in our business models; general market, political, economic, and business conditions; any imposition of new tariffs or trade barriers; the impact of non-cash charges on our financial results; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates; the success of our foreign currency hedging program; our performance in particular geographies, including emerging economies; the ability of governments around the world to meet their financial and debt obligations, and finance infrastructure projects; weak or negative growth in the industries we serve; slowing momentum in subscription billings or revenues; difficulties encountered in integrating new or acquired businesses and technologies; the inability to identify and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions; the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels; dependence on and the timing of large transactions; failure to achieve sufficient sell-through in our channels for new or existing products; pricing pressure; unexpected fluctuations in our annual effective tax rate; significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; the timing and degree of expected investments in growth and efficiency opportunities; changes in the timing of product releases and retirements; and any unanticipated accounting charges. Our estimates as to tax rate and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our business are based on current tax law, including current interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and could be affected by changing interpretations of the Act, as well as additional legislation and guidance around the Act.\nFurther information on potential factors that could affect the financial results of Autodesk are included in Autodesk's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, which is on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update the provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\nAbout Autodesk\nAutodesk makes software for people who make things.

of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures\n(In millions, except per share data)\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Autodesk provides investors with certain non-GAAP measures including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, and non-GAAP diluted shares used in per share calculation. These non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including stock-based compensation expense, CEO transition costs, restructuring (benefits) charges and other facility exit costs, amortization of developed technology, amortization of purchased intangibles, gain and loss on strategic investments and dispositions, and related income tax expenses. See our reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures herein. We believe these exclusions are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and also our prospects for the future, as well as to facilitate comparisons with our historical operating results. These adjustments to our GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of Autodesk's underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance. For example, non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside our core operating results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods.\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States. Investors should review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables accompanying this press release.\nThe following table shows Autodesk's non-GAAP results reconciled to GAAP results included in this release.\nThree Months Ended April 30,\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited)\nGAAP cost of maintenance and subscription revenue\n$\n50.4\n$\n54.9\nStock-based compensation expense\n(2.7)\n(2.8)\nNon-GAAP cost of maintenance and subscription revenue\n$\n47.7\n$\n52.1\nGAAP cost of other revenue\n$\n12.8\n$\n18.6\nStock-based compensation expense\n(0.8)\n(1.1)\nNon-GAAP cost of other revenue\n$\n12.0\n$\n17.5\nGAAP amortization of developed technology\n$\n3.6\n$\n4.7\nAmortization of developed technology\n(3.6)\n(4.7)\nNon-GAAP amortization of developed technology\n$\n—\n$\n—\nGAAP gross profit\n$\n493.1\n$\n407.5\nStock-based compensation expense\n3.5\n3.9\nAmortization of developed technology\n3.6\n4.7\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n$\n500.2\n$\n416.1\nGAAP marketing and sales\n$\n276.4\n$\n255.7\nStock-based compensation expense\n(24.0)\n(26.4)\nNon-GAAP marketing and sales\n$\n252.4\n$\n229.3\nGAAP research and development\n$\n172.8\n$\n187.7\nStock-based compensation expense\n(17.8)\n(21.2)\nNon-GAAP research and development\n$\n155.0\n$\n166.5\nGAAP general and administrative\n$\n72.9\n$\n78.3\nStock-based compensation expense\n(9.1)\n(7.5)\nCEO transition costs (1)\n—\n(11.0)\nNon-GAAP general and administrative\n$\n63.8\n$\n59.8\nGAAP amortization of purchased intangibles\n$\n3.8\n$\n5.7\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n(3.8)\n(5.7)\nNon-GAAP amortization of purchased intangibles\n$\n—\n$\n—\nGAAP restructuring charges (benefits) and other facility exit costs, net\n$\n22.5\n$\n(0.3)\nRestructuring charges (benefits) and other facility exit costs, net\n(22.5)\n0.3\nNon-GAAP restructuring charges (benefits) and other facility exit costs, net\n$\n—\n$\n—\nGAAP operating expenses\n$\n548.4\n$\n527.1\nStock-based compensation expense\n(50.9)\n(55.1)\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n(3.8)\n(5.7)\nCEO transition costs (1)\n—\n(11.0)\nRestructuring charges (benefits) and other facility exit costs, net\n(22.5)\n0.3\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\n$\n471.2\n$\n455.6\nGAAP spend\n$\n615.2\n$\n605.3\nStock-based compensation expense\n(54.4)\n(59.0)\nAmortization of developed technology\n(3.6)\n(4.7)\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n(3.8)\n(5.7)\nCEO transition costs (1)\n—\n(11.0)\nRestructuring charges (benefits) and other facility exit costs, net\n(22.5)\n0.3\nNon-GAAP spend\n$\n530.9\n$\n525.2\nGAAP loss from operations\n$\n(55.3)\n$\n(119.6)\nStock-based compensation expense\n54.4\n59.0\nAmortization of developed technology\n3.6\n4.7\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n3.8\n5.7\nCEO transition costs (1)\n—\n11.0\nRestructuring charges (benefits) and other facility exit costs, net\n22.5\n(0.3)\nNon-GAAP income (loss) from operations\n$\n29.0\n$\n(39.5)\nGAAP interest and other expense, net\n$\n(8.5)\n$\n(1.8)\nGain on strategic investments and dispositions\n(2.7)\n(5.7)\nNon-GAAP interest and other expense, net\n$\n(11.2)\n$\n(7.5)\nGAAP provision for income taxes\n$\n(18.6)\n$\n(8.2)\nDiscrete GAAP tax items\n—\n(7.6)\nIncome tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments\n15.2\n28.0\nNon-GAAP (provision) benefit for income tax\n$\n(3.4)\n$\n12.2\nGAAP net loss\n$\n(82.4)\n$\n(129.6)\nStock-based compensation expense\n54.4\n59.0\nAmortization of developed technology\n3.6\n4.7\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n3.8\n5.7\nCEO transition costs (1)\n—\n11.0\nRestructuring charges (benefits) and other facility exit costs, net\n22.5\n(0.3)\nGain on strategic investments and dispositions\n(2.7)\n(5.7)\nDiscrete GAAP tax items\n—\n(7.6)\nIncome tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments\n15.2\n28.0\nNon-GAAP net income (loss)\n$\n14.4\n$\n(34.8)\nGAAP diluted net loss per share (2)\n$\n(0.38)\n$\n(0.59)\nStock-based compensation expense\n0.25\n0.27\nAmortization of developed technology\n0.02\n0.02\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n0.02\n0.03\nCEO transition costs (1)\n—\n0.04\nRestructuring charges and other facility exit costs, net\n0.09\n—\nGain on strategic investments and dispositions\n(0.01)\n(0.03)\nDiscrete GAAP tax items\n—\n(0.03)\nIncome tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments\n0.07\n0.13\nNon-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share (2)\n$\n0.06\n$\n(0.16)\nGAAP diluted shares used in per share calculation\n218.6\n219.9\nShares included in non-GAAP net income per share, but excluded from GAAP net loss per share as they would have been anti-dilutive\n3.0\n—\nNon-GAAP diluted weighted average shares used in per share calculation\n221.6\n219.9\n(1)\nCEO transition costs include stock-based compensation of $7.8 million related to the acceleration of eligible stock awards in the three months ended April 30, 2017.
