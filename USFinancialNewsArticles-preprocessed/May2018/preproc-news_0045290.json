    "text": "May 19, 2018 / 6:07 PM / in 12 minutes Reuters photographers pick their best royal wedding picture Reuters Staff 5 Min Read\nWINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Patience, meticulous preparation and a big dose of luck were among the elements that Reuters photographers were counting on when they took up their positions to cover the UK royal wedding. BritainÕs Prince Harry and his wife Meghan wave as they ride a horse-drawn carriage after their wedding ceremony at St GeorgeÕs Chapel in Windsor Castle in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Damir Sagolj: \"It's all about a couple of beautiful, happy people on their big day, and the picture of them smiling and waving to the crowd of well-wishers in a beautiful light is exactly what I was looking for. The UK flag was held by one of the royal fans who had been camping near the Cambridge gate for few days - that flag in the same frame is the bonus that would always make a picture special.\" REUTERS/Damir Sagolj/File photo\nHere, 12 Reuters photographers describe their favorite images from the nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\nDylan Martinez: “To say lots of planning went into this wedding would be like saying there’s lots of sand in the Sahara. I loved this picture as I had a hunch the royal brothers would do a little walkabout on the eve of Harry’s wedding and they did. Nice shot showing genuine fans.”\nMarko Djurica: “This is my favorite image as it shows the pure joy of children having fun during the wedding, which can be too straight and official for them. When covering events as big as this, you have to focus on small details, which can sometimes be very difficult to see among thousands of people. Also I would say you have to be very lucky.”\nToby Melville: “I like this frame because it has room to breathe. I like the shape of the carriage route and road curving and drifting off diagonally for the eye to follow up to the castle in the background. It gives a small taste of the scale and setting of this Disneyland wedding.” Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan ride a horse-drawn carriage after their wedding ceremony at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Benoit Tessier: \"After installing my equipment, I had a long wait before seeing the couple. After six hours, they finally passed by. Meghan seemed very excited.\" REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File photo\nPhil Noble: “This is my favorite frame as it was the only time I saw the couple and also the first time they had left the castle and been seen by the public. The most challenging thing was trying to transmit the pictures with so many people around making the network slow, and also the early start to avoid the crowds.”\nHannah McKay: “This is my favorite image because it captures a happy and relaxed moment between the couple as they are escorted in their carriage through Windsor. The most challenging thing was knowing precisely when to press the shutter to fill the frame perfectly: a second too late or a second too early can mean you miss the moment entirely.”\nDamir Sagolj: “It’s all about a couple of beautiful, happy people on their big day, and the picture of them smiling and waving to the crowd of well-wishers in a beautiful light is exactly what I was looking for. The UK flag was held by one of the royal fans who had been camping near the Cambridge gate for a few days - that flag in the same frame is the bonus that would always make a picture special.” Slideshow (10 Images)\nClodagh Kilcoyne: “For me, the bowler hat is such a quintessentially British look, especially when matched with the tweed jacket. I thought his choice of fan-paraphernalia of the U.S. and UK flags was as sartorially elegant as his outfit. It can be challenging covering the fans to find space for the principal in the image to stand out, as the location gets crowded quite quickly. Luckily here, a different angle, and a clear blue sky and tree cover, provided me with just that.”\nPeter Nicholls: “Most rewarding was being here painfully early ahead of the throngs — fully nine hours in advance — and ending up with a favorite picture that I hadn’t expected. The hope was I’d have beaming newlyweds looking straight at me. That wasn’t to be. But at least I was able to retire knowing I’d done all I could to be in the right place.”\nDarren Staples: “This was the first time in the day that Meghan would be seen so it was important to get it right and publish it quickly. It was technically difficult as the car was moving and I was using flash to remove the reflections off the glass. Being only 5 foot 7 inches tall, the most challenging thing I find about shooting a royal wedding is seeing over the crowd with their selfie sticks and flags. Step ladders are not allowed so I carry a plastic stool.”\nJohn Sibley: “After waiting in my position for more than eight hours, you get just a few seconds to capture a good photo as they pass. You can end up with nothing if they are both looking in the other direction. Luckily, Meghan was looking toward me, smiling and displaying her wedding ring.”\nMatthew Childs: “I spent 40 minutes working my way through the crowd to try and get a view of the big screen without pushing anyone out of the way. The closest I could get was a side view! It turned out to be a nice position to capture the overall feel of the crowd and their reactions to the service.”\nBenoit Tessier: “After installing my equipment, I had a long wait before seeing the couple. After six hours, they finally passed by. Meghan seemed very excited.”\nRelated photo essay reut.rs/2GzLVm6",
