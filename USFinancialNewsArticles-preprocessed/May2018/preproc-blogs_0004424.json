    "text": "David A. Grogan | CNBC Marcelo Claure speaking at eMerge Americas in Miami on June 12, 2017.\nSprint announced on Wednesday that its Board of Directors appointed CFO Michel Combes to the role of CEO. Acting CEO Marcelo Claure will fill the role of executive chairman at Sprint, as well as new roles at SoftBank .\nClaure and Combes are expected to assume their new roles on or before May 31. In the meantime, they will collaborate on Sprint's planned merger with T-Mobile .\n\"Marcelo has...positioned Sprint as a leader in the race to 5G, which promises to revolutionize the communications industry. He will continue to guide Sprint's strategy and momentum as Executive Chairman through a successful closing with T-Mobile,\" Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group said in a statement.\nAt SoftBank, Claure will assume the roles of COO at SoftBank Group and CEO at SoftBank Group International. There, he will continue to oversee SoftBank's investment in Sprint and the combined Sprint-T-Mobile company, should the merger be approved.\nClaure's responsibilities will include facilitating collaboration between Sprint and SoftBank's portfolio companies in IoT, automation and artificial intelligence - areas in which SoftBank is investing and that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile company will target as it moves to develop 5G.\nSprint has begun searching for an executive to fill the CFO position that will be left vacant after Combes assumes his new position.\nShares of Sprint jumped 1.35 percent after the announcement.\nThis story is developing.
