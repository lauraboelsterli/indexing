    "text": "YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia’s acting Minister of Culture Armen Amiryan resigned from his post on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the minister said, as a political crisis continued to engulf the small ex-Soviet state.\nThe announcement came immediately after a meeting between Amiryan and several activists who had been demonstrating outside the ministry, calling on him to join the protests that have swept the country in recent weeks and led to the resignation of the prime minister.\nAmiryan’s spokeswoman did not provide a reason for his resignation.\nReporting by Hasmik Mkrtchyan; Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Catherine Evans\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
