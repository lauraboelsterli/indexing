    "text": "TOKYO, May 28 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices rose on Monday, tracking gains by U.S. Treasuries as political turmoil in the euro zone enhanced demand for safe-haven debt.\nJune 10-year JGB futures rose 0.05 point to 150.96.\nThe 20-year JGB yield was unchanged at 0.515 percent , while the 30-year yield fell 1 basis point to 0.730 percent.\nThe super-long JGBs were seen to have attracted demand from index-following investors who tend to extend the duration of their portfolios at the turn of each month.\nU.S. Treasury yields fell to three-week lows on Friday as concerns about Italyâ€™s new government and a leadership challenge in Spain boosted demand for low-risk government bonds.
