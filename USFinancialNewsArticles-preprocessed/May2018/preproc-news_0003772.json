It should not be considered an alternative to GAAP-based net income or income from operations or operating cash flows. Further, because not all companies use identical calculations, amounts reflected by Hillman as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is included to satisfy a reporting obligation under our indenture. Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein does not include certain adjustments and pro forma run rate measures contemplated by our senior secured credit facilities and our indenture and may also include additional adjustments that were not applicable at the time of the offering of the senior notes governed by our indenture. Adjusted EBITDA is also one of the performance criteria for the Company's annual performance-based bonus plan.
