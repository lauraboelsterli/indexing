REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\nMillions in Venezuela suffer food and medicine shortages amid hyperinflation. Maduro blames Venezuela’s crisis on an “economic war” that he says is being waged by Washington, greedy businessmen and coup-mongers.\nHe is expected to win Sunday’s presidential election, described by the opposition as a sham.\nClorox ( CLX.N ), Kimberly-Clark ( KMB.N ), General Mills ( GIS.N ), General Motors ( GM.N ) and Harvest Natural Resources are the most recent big names to pull out of Venezuela in the face of economic conditions.\nOpposition critics scoffed that the government would quickly plunder the Kellogg plant and ruin its business.
