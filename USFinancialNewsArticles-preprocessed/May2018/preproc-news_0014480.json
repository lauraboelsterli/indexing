(NASDAQ:NCSM) (“NCS” or the “Company”), a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies, today announced its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Review\nRevenues were $70.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $12.1 million or 21% as compared to the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of sales of our completions products and services due to higher customer drilling and well completion activity, as well as the contributions from Repeat Precision, LLC (“Repeat Precision”), which was acquired on February 1, 2017, and Spectrum Tracer Services, LLC (“Spectrum”), which was acquired on August 31, 2017. Total revenues increased by 41% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 with increases of 9% in the U.S., 61% in Canada and 125% in other countries.\nNet income was $11.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which included a net benefit of $1.6 million ($1.2 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration and certain other items. Adjusted net income, which excludes these items, was $9.8 million or $0.21 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This compares to a net income of $6.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017, which included a net expense of $2.6 million ($2.0 million after tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) related to professional expenses incurred in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock (“IPO”) and acquisitions and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses. Adjusted net income, which excludes these items, was $8.6 million or $0.23 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $18.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $(0.6) million as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit, which we define as total revenues less total cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased to $37.1 million, or 52% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $29.3 million, or 50% of total revenues, in the year ago period. This was offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in the first quarter as compared to the prior year, primarily related to increases in personnel to support growth, the inclusion of Spectrum SG&A and public company costs. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 26%, as compared to 33% for the first quarter of 2017.\nCapital Expenditures and Liquidity\nThe Company spent $1.0 million in capital expenditures, net during the first quarter of 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $23.7 million in cash, total availability under its revolving credit facility of $55.0 million and $27.7 million in total debt.\nReview and Outlook\nNCS’s Chief Executive Officer, Robert Nipper, commented, “We are very pleased with our first quarter results. In Canada, we grew our revenue by 13% on a year-over-year basis during a period when the average rig count was lower by 9%. This reflects organic growth as well as the contribution from Spectrum. In the U.S., we grew our revenue by 46% on a year-over-year basis and by 9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. While our results were hampered by logistical issues impacting the broader U.S. completions market during the quarter, we are excited by the growth in our product sales in the U.S., which increased by 59% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, with sequential increases in sliding sleeve, Airlock and composite plug sales volumes. In our international business, we installed sliding sleeves in an offshore well for the first time during the quarter, with the well to be completed during the second quarter. This is an exciting first for NCS, and highlights the broad range of applications for our technology.\nWe are seeing continued positive results from cross-selling initiatives that leverage the full breadth of our capabilities, including completions systems, tracer diagnostics and reservoir solutions. While an exceptionally wet spring in Canada may lead to an extended Spring Break-up this year, impacting our Canadian revenue in the second quarter, we continue to expect that our annual revenues in 2018 will grow by 35% - 45%, primarily driven by growth in the U.S.”\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share are non-GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance or which, in the case of share-based compensation, are non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income attributable to NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance. Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by our diluted weighted average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share are important measures that exclude costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, certain costs associated with our capital structure. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share are key metrics that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations. We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share enables investors to assess our performance from period to period using the same metrics utilized by management and that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net per Diluted Share enable investors to evaluate our performance relative to other companies that are not subject to such factors.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share (our “non-GAAP financial measures”) are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), are not measures of net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and are subject to important limitations. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial performance as reported under GAAP and they should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity.\nThe tables below set forth reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measure of financial performance calculated under GAAP:\nADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Effect on\nNet Income\n(After-\nTax) Impact on\nDiluted Earnings\nPer Share Effect on\nNet Income\n(After-\nTax) Impact on\nDiluted Earnings\nPer Share Net income attributable to\nNCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. $ 10,978 $ 0.23 $ 6,550 $ 0.18 Adjustments (after tax) IPO-related professional expense (a) — — 1,120 0.03 Acquisition and merger costs (b) — — 232 0.01 Realized and unrealized (gains) losses (c) (156 ) — 648 0.01 Change in fair value of contingent consideration (d) (1,005 ) (0.02 ) — — Adjusted net income attributable\nto NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. $ 9,817 $ 0.21 $ 8,550 $ 0.23\n(a) Represents non-capitalizable costs of professional services incurred in connection with our IPO.\n(b) Represents costs of professional services incurred in connection with our acquisition of a 50% interest in Repeat Precision and Spectrum acquisition.\n(c) Represents realized and unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses primarily in respect of our indebtedness.\n(d) Represents the change in the fair value of the earn-outs associated with our acquisitions.\nNCS MULTISTAGE HOLDINGS, INC.
