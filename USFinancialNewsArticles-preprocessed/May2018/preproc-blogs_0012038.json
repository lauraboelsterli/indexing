Thirty-four percent said they had “no interest” in the technology.\nThe survey included businesses in a range of industries around the world, together representing a total of $13 trillion in annual revenue and $277 billion in IT spending, Gartner said.\nBest known as the record-keeping system behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Blockchain ledgers digitize the various hand-offs between trading partners, approving and recording transactions along the way.\nThat much-hyped capability has caught the attention of businesses across several industries that need to record financial transactions or track other assets as they progress to market or through the production process, from financial services firms, to manufacturers and retailers.\nWal-Mart Stores Inc., for instance, is testing a blockchain system developed by International Business Machines Corp technology to manage supply-chain data for mangoes, berries and a dozens of other products, aiming to identify bad-food sources during product recalls, CIO Journal reported .\nLikewise, British Airways last year began testing blockchain to maintain data on flights between London, Geneva and Miami.\nInternational Data Corp. has estimated that corporate spending on blockchain software will reach $2.1 billion in 2018, up from $945 million in 2017, led by distributors, retailers and manufacturers.\nDavid Furlonger, a Gartner fellow and vice president, said the promise of blockchain has attracted a spectrum of its clients, including “those that have been experimenting and deeply involved with core developers over several years, to those just coming to the topic.”\nBut, he added, the message was the same across every industry: With blockchain, “the incidence of turning proof of concept into anything close to resembling a minimum viable product is extremely low.”\nOf the 293 CIOs at organizations that have already launched blockchain projects or are in the short-term planning stage, 23% said the effort requires the “most new skills to implement” of any IT tool, according to the survey.\nAnother 18% said blockchain skills are the most difficult to find, while 14% said it requires the greatest change in the way IT departments run.\nMr. Furlonger said there were multiple issues preventing most companies from deploying blockchain technology, including the “immaturity of underlying technical components,” a lack of adequate technical and business governance models, and implementation and integration challenges, among others.\nAs such, rushing into blockchain implementation – amid mounting industry hype and competitive pressure – are likely to face failed innovation, wasted spending and rash decisions, he added.\nStill, Mr. Furlong warned that blockchain is a transformative technology, and businesses that give up on it entirely risked being left behind.\n“If business leaders wait for the hype cycle to run its course they may no longer have a business to operate in – at least nothing like they have previously experienced and profited from,” he said.\nShare this: Previous The Morning Download: GitHub Strategy Chief Says It’s Time for Tech to Offer Users New Deal Next What Your CEO Is Reading: Hacking Back; Agile at Scale; Virtual Assistant Etiquette",
