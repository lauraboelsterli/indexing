(NYSE: GMRE) (the “Company”), a Maryland corporation engaged primarily in the acquisition of licensed, state-of-the-art, purpose-built healthcare facilities and the leasing of these facilities to strong clinical operators with leading market share, today announces its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n2018 First Quarter and Other Highlights\nRental revenue increased to $10.5 million from $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to common stockholders increased to $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share, from a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(1.3) million, or $(0.07) per share in the first quarter of 2017. Funds from Operations (“FFO”) increased to $0.18 per share, from $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\") increased to $0.16 per share, from $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed five acquisitions comprising 383,044 leasable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $64.6 million. Based on rents in effect at the closing of each transaction, the five properties are expected to generate aggregate annual cash rent receipts of $5.5 million. See the acquisition table herein for additional details. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company completed a portfolio acquisition containing an aggregate of 155,600 leasable square feet for a total purchase price of $64.2 million. Based on rents in effect at the closing of the transaction, this acquisition is expected to generate aggregate annual cash rent receipts of $5.1 million. See the acquisition table herein for additional details. On March 6, 2018, the Company amended its revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate capacity of the facility by $90 million to $340 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $229.2 million of outstanding borrowings on this facility.\nJeff Busch, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We had an active first quarter on the acquisitions side despite depressed equity markets. Although we will continue to utilize our available acquisition capital to purchase properties that meet our investment criteria, we are also focused on managing our debt and interest expense and are pursuing various options in that regard. We believe the next step in our Company’s evolution is to establish long-term, fixed-rate debt solutions that will allow us to ‘term-out’ debt from our revolving credit facility on a regular basis.”\nAcquisition Activity\nCompleted Acquisitions in 2018\nFrom January 1, 2018 to date, the Company completed six acquisitions, encompassing an aggregate of 538,644 leasable square feet for a total purchase price of $128.8 million with annualized base rent of $10.6 million and a weighted average cap rate of 8.22%. Summary information about these acquisitions is presented in the table below:\nProperty City Leasable\nSquare Feet\nPurchase Price (1)\n(in 000s)\nAnnualized\nBase Rent (2)\n(in 000s)\nCapitalization\nRate (3)\nFirst Quarter 2018: Quad City Kidney Center Moline, IL 27,173 $ 6,706 $ 548 8.17% NOMS Fremont, OH 25,893 8,286 608 7.34% Gainesville Eye Gainesville, GA 34,020 10,400 776 7.46% City Hospital of White Rock Dallas, TX 236,314 23,000 2,230 9.70% Orlando Health Orlando, FL 59,644 16,200 1,340 8.27% Total First Quarter 2018 383,044 $ 64,592 $ 5,502 8.52% Second Quarter 2018 to Date: Memorial Health System Belpre, OH 155,600 $ 64,200 $ 5,087 7.92% Totals/Weighted Average 538,644 $ 128,792 $ 10,589 8.22% (1) Represents the contractual purchase price.

If we identify problems with the property or the operator of the property during our due diligence review, we may not close the transaction on a timely basis or we may terminate the purchase and sale agreement and not close the transaction.\n2018 First Quarter Financial Review\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, rental revenue increased to $10.5 million, compared to $4.7 million for the first quarter of the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of the Company’s larger property portfolio compared to the prior year quarter. Total expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $9.7 million, compared to $6.0 million for the first quarter of the prior year. Within total expenses, general and administrative expenses were $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, down from $1.6 million in the prior year quarter. This decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a reduction in non-cash LTIP expenses and corporate legal expenses compared to the prior year quarter. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(1.3) million, or $(0.07) per share, for the first quarter of the prior year. This increase was primarily due to significantly higher rental revenue compared to the prior year quarter.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $3.4 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $5.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s gross investment in real estate as of March 31, 2018 was $537.3 million compared to $471.5 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s total debt, which includes outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and notes payable (net of unamortized deferred financing costs), was $267.7 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $203.4 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s weighted-average interest rate and term of its debt was 3.95% and 2.44 years, respectively, as of March 31, 2018.\nEarnings Call\nThe Company will hold its first quarter 2018 conference call on May 9, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

The Company considers FFO and AFFO to be important supplemental measures of its operating performance and believes FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. In accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ (“NAREIT”) definition, FFO means net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP before non-controlling interests of holders of operating partnership units, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and extraordinary items, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company did not incur any gains or losses from the sales of property or record any adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Because FFO excludes real estate related depreciation and amortization (other than amortization of deferred financing costs), the Company believes that FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from the closest GAAP measurement, net income or loss.\nAFFO is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors and analysts to measure a real estate company’s operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations. Management calculates AFFO by modifying the NAREIT computation of FFO by adjusting it for certain cash and non-cash items and certain recurring and non-recurring items. For the Company these items include recurring acquisition and disposition costs, loss on the extinguishment of debt, recurring straight line deferred rental revenue, recurring stock-based compensation expense, recurring amortization of deferred financing costs, recurring capital expenditures, recurring lease commissions, recurring tenant improvements, and other items.\nManagement believes that reporting AFFO in addition to FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investment community to use when evaluating the operating performance of the Company on a comparative basis. The Company’s FFO and AFFO computations may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does, or that compute FFO and AFFO in a different manner.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ 1,901 $ (1,318) (1) Less: Preferred stock dividends (1,455) - Depreciation and amortization expense 3,671 1,690 Amortization of above (below) market leases 113 (8) FFO $ 4,230 $ 364 Acquisition fees 117 942 Straight line deferred rental revenue (1,173) (383) Stock-based compensation expense 182 420 Amortization of deferred financing costs 430 159 AFFO $ 3,786 $ 1,502 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share – basic and\ndiluted\n$ 0.02 $ (0.07) FFO per Share $ 0.18 $ 0.02 AFFO per Share $ 0.16 $ 0.09 Weighted Average Shares and Units Outstanding – basic and diluted 23,384 17,606 Reconciliation of Weighted Average Shares and Units Outstanding:\nWeighted Average Common Shares 21,631 17,606 Weighted Average OP Units 1,246 - Weighted Average LTIP Units 507 - Weighted Average Shares and Units Outstanding – basic and diluted 23,384 17,606 (1) This amount reflects the correction of $1,223 of costs incurred in connection with the Company’s amended revolving credit facility that were erroneously expensed and included in the “General and Administrative” expense line item within the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006495/en/\nGlobal Medical REIT Inc.\nDanica Holley\nChief Operating Officer\n202-524-6854\ndanicah@globalmedicalreit.com\nor\nINVESTOR RELATIONS:\nThe Equity Group Inc.\nJeremy Hellman\nSenior Associate\n212-836-9626\njhellman@equityny.com\nor\nAdam Prior\nSenior Vice-President\n212-836-9606\naprior@equityny.com\nSource: Global Medical REIT Inc.",
