Again, we want to express appreciation to all our shareholders who have supported us during this difficult time.\"\n2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights Compared to the Same Period in 2017\nRevenues decreased to $492,962 from $838,426; Net Loss decreased to ($210,773) from ($409,051) and Net Loss per share decreased, basic to ($0.02) from ($0.04) and fully diluted to ($0.02) from ($0.04).\nFieldPoint Petroleum Corporation is engaged in oil and natural gas exploration, production and acquisition, primarily in Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming.
