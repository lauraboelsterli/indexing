    "text": "(Reuters) - Since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, he and his administration have been swamped with lawsuits attacking his conduct and policies. The administration has lost more frequently in court than its challengers, but it has also had significant wins. And, since separate lawsuits on some issues have been filed in numerous courts, the administration has sometimes won a favorable ruling from one judge, only to have the policy blocked by another. Here are the key issues on which each side has scored wins.\nISSUES PRODUCING WINS FOR ADMINISTRATION - 11\nBorder wall\nVoter fraud commission\nDeregulation order\nObamacare birth control subsidy\nEmoluments\nSanctuary cities funding\nContraception rule\nTravel ban\nWithdrawal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)\nConsumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) leadership\nNatural gas waste rule\nISSUES PRODUCING WINS FOR CHALLENGERS â€“ 11 Emoluments\nSanctuary cities funding\nContraception rule\nTravel ban\nDACA withdrawal\nImmigrant detention/deportation\nTransgender military ban\nImmigrant teenagers/abortion\nNatural gas waste rule\nSmog\nMineral royalties\nISSUES PRODUCING WINS FOR BOTH SIDES - 6\nEmoluments\nSanctuary cities funding\nContraception rule\nTravel ban\nDACA withdrawal\nNatural gas waste rule\nPOLICIES BLOCKED BY COURTS DESPITE OTHER RULINGS FAVORING ADMINISTRATION - 4\nSanctuary cities funding\nContraception rule\nDACA withdrawal\nTravel ban (injunctions against ban were later lifted by the U.S. Supreme Court allowing policy to go into effect)\nReporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Sue Horton\n ",
