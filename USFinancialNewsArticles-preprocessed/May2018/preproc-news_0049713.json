    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 1:07 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Cyber firms, Ukraine warn of planned Russian attack Jim Finkle , Pavel Polityuk 4 Min Read\nTORONTO/KIEV (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc warned on Wednesday that hackers have infected at least 500,000 routers and storage devices in dozens of countries with sophisticated malicious software - activity Ukraine said was preparation for a future Russian cyber attack.\nCisco’s Talos cyber intelligence unit has high confidence that the Russian government is behind the campaign, according to Cisco researcher Craig Williams, because the hacking software shares code with malware used in previous cyber attacks that the U.S. government has attributed to Moscow.\nUkraine’s SBU state security service said the activity showed Russia was readying a large-scale cyber attack against Ukraine ahead of the Champions League soccer final, due to be held in Kiev on Saturday.\n“Security Service experts believe the infection of hardware on the territory of Ukraine is preparation for another act of cyber-aggression by the Russian Federation aimed at destabilising the situation during the Champions League final,” it said in a statement after Cisco’s findings were released.\nRussia has previously denied assertions by Ukraine, the United States, other nations and Western cyber-security firms that it is behind a massive global hacking program, which has included attempts to harm Ukraine’s economy and interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nThe Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment submitted by Reuters on Wednesday.\nCisco said the new malware, dubbed VPNFilter, could be used for espionage, to interfere with internet communications or launch destructive attacks on Ukraine, which has previously blamed Russia for massive hacks that took out parts of its energy grid and shuttered factories.\n“With a network like this you could do anything,” Williams told Reuters. CONSTITUTION DAY ATTACK\nThe warning about the malware - which includes a module that targets industrial networks like ones that operate the electric grid - will be amplified by alerts from members of the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), a nonprofit group that promotes the fast exchange of data on new threats between rivals in the cyber security industry.

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/File Photo\nMembers include Cisco, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd, Fortinet Inc Palo Alto Networks Inc, Sophos Group Plc and Symantec Corp.\n“We should be taking this pretty seriously,” CTA Chief Executive Officer Michael Daniel said in an interview.\nThe devices infected with VPNFilter are scattered across at least 54 countries, but Cisco determined the hackers are targeting Ukraine following a surge in infections in that country on May 8, Williams told Reuters.\nResearchers decided to go public with what they know about the campaign because they feared the surge in Ukraine, which has the largest number of infections, meant Moscow is poised to launch an attack there next month, possibly around the time the country celebrates Constitution Day on June 28, Williams said.\nSome of the biggest cyber attacks on Ukraine have been launched on holidays or the days leading up to them.\nThey include the June 2017 “NotPetya” attack that disabled computer systems in Ukraine before spreading around the globe, as well as hacks on the nation’s power grid in 2015 and 2016 that hit shortly before Christmas.\nVPNFilter gives hackers remote access to infected machines, which they can use for spying, launching attacks on other computers or downloading additional types of malware, Williams said.\nThe researchers discovered one malware module that targets industrial computers, such as ones used in electric grids, other infrastructure and in factories. It infects and monitors network traffic, looking for login credentials that a hacker can use to seize control of industrial processes, Williams said.
