    "text": "CORAL GABLES, Fla., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MasTec, Inc. (NYSE: MTZ) today announced higher than expected first quarter financial results, record backlog, and increased 2018 guidance.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue was $1.4 billion, a 21% increase compared with $1.2 billion for the same period last year. GAAP net income was $26.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $40.6 million or $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP results exceeded the Company's previously announced diluted earnings per share expectation by $0.15. First quarter 2018 adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $28.8 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.35 exceeding the Company's previously announced first quarter 2018 expectation by $0.15. First quarter adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP measure, was $107.8 million, exceeding the Company's previously announced 2018 first quarter guidance expectation by approximately $18 million. The Company also announced record 18-month backlog for the second consecutive quarter, with backlog as of March 31, 2018 at $7.6 billion, a $464 million sequential increase when compared to year end 2017, and a $1.9 billion increase or 33%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. 18-month backlog as of March 31, 2018 included record levels of Communications, Oil & Gas and Power Generation & Industrial segment backlog, as well as a sequential increase in Electrical Transmission segment backlog.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA, which are all non-GAAP measures, exclude certain items which are detailed and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP-reported measures in the attached Supplemental Disclosures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Disclosures.\nJose Mas, MasTec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are proud to once again report record backlog levels, demonstrating the strength in demand for our services across multiple markets.\"\nMr. Mas continued, \"We are pleased to increase our 2018 annual guidance expectations to another record level. More importantly, many items in our backlog represent multi-year programs that are initiating over the course of 2018. Thus, we have strong visibility for continued growth in 2019 and beyond.\"\nGeorge Pita, MasTec's Executive Vice President and noted, \"We have significant multi-year growth opportunities across multiple segments. Our confidence in the future is evidenced by the repurchase of approximately 2.6 million shares thus far in 2018 under authorized share repurchase programs. We continue to expect 2018 to be a record year of cash flow from operations as we complete several major projects and normalize our working capital. We expect to maintain a strong balance sheet giving us the financial flexibility and resources to take advantage of the significant multi-year growth opportunities ahead of us.\"\nBased on the information available today, the Company is providing initial second quarter guidance, and increasing full year 2018 guidance expectations. The Company currently estimates full year 2018 revenue of approximately $6.9 billion, a record level. Full year 2018 GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are expected to approximate $285 million and $3.53, respectively. Regarding full year 2018 expectations for non-GAAP measures, adjusted EBITDA is expected to approximate $700 million or 10.2% of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be $3.65, a 25% increase over 2017 with both non-GAAP measures representing record levels.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects revenue of approximately $1.78 billion. Second quarter 2018 GAAP net income is expected to approximate $81 million with GAAP diluted earnings per share expected to approximate $1.00. Second quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is expected to approximate $189 million with adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, expected to approximate $1.03.\nManagement will hold a conference call to discuss these results on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.
