The combination was generated by addition of comparable financial statement line items. However, because of various adjustments to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the application of fresh-start reporting, including asset valuation adjustments and liability adjustments, the results of operations for the Successor may not be comparable to those of the Predecessor. The quarters ended June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017 are Predecessor periods while the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 are Successor periods.\nTIDEWATER INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS (LOSS) – QUARTERLY DATA\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\nRevenues:\nVessel revenues\n$\n87,494\n101,313\n104,911\n112,257\n156,905\nOther operating revenues\n3,999\n3,140\n5,652\n2,849\n3,844\n91,493\n104,453\n110,563\n115,106\n160,749\nCosts and expenses:\nVessel operating costs\n61,364\n68,201\n84,966\n83,773\n80,845\nCosts of other operating revenues\n2,474\n1,519\n3,036\n1,585\n2,689\nGeneral and administrative (H)\n23,565\n30,373\n25,019\n33,059\n41,727\nVessel operating leases\n—\n91\n1,747\n5,542\n8,443\nDepreciation and amortization\n12,017\n12,195\n19,302\n36,287\n37,592\nGain on asset dispositions, net\n(1,919)\n(6,612)\n(376)\n(3,189)\n(6,064)\nAsset impairments\n6,186\n16,777\n21,325\n163,423\n64,857\n103,687\n122,544\n155,019\n320,480\n230,089\nOperating loss\n(12,194)\n(18,091)\n(44,456)\n(205,374)\n(69,340)\nOther income (expenses):\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\n(348)\n(349)\n(2,082)\n(1,157)\n664\nEquity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated companies\n(15,439)\n825\n1,574\n4,517\n2,841\nInterest income and other\n(128)\n1,898\n1,577\n1,680\n1,588\nReorganization items (H)\n—\n(2,419)\n(1,085,609)\n(313,176)\n—\nInterest and other debt costs\n(7,599)\n(7,769)\n(5,814)\n(10,605)\n(21,008)\n(23,514)\n(7,814)\n(1,090,354)\n(318,741)\n(15,915)\nLoss before income taxes\n(35,708)\n(25,905)\n(1,134,810)\n(524,115)\n(85,255)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n3,321\n(2,706)\n3,216\n295\n1,717\nNet loss\n$\n(39,029)\n(23,199)\n(1,138,026)\n(524,410)\n(86,972)\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests\n143\n374\n142\n24\n7,883\nNet loss attributable to Tidewater Inc.\n$\n(39,172)\n(23,573)\n(1,138,168)\n(524,434)\n(94,855)\nBasic loss per common share\n$\n(1.67)\n(1.02)\n—\n—\n—\nDiluted loss per common share\n$\n(1.67)\n(1.02)\n—\n—\n—\nWeighted average common shares outstanding (I)\n23,424,943\n23,137,909\n—\n—\n—\nDilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nAdjusted weighted average common shares\n23,424,943\n23,137,909\n—\n—\n—\nVessel operating margin\n$\n26,130\n33,112\n19,945\n28,484\n76,060\nNote (H): Restructuring-related items:\nRestructuring-related professional services\ncosts included in general and administrative\nexpenses\n$\n—\n—\n—\n6,709\n16,805\nRestructuring-related professional services\ncosts included in reorganization items\n—\n2,031\n23,494\n5,165\n—\nRestructuring-related sale leaseback vessel\nredelivery costs included in reorganization\nitems\n—\n388\n1,244\n—\n—\nTotal\n$\n—\n2,419\n24,738\n11,874\n16,805\nNote (I): Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 include 108,044 and 924,125 shares issuable upon the exercise of New Creditor Warrants held by U.S. citizens, respectively, at March 31 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Restructuring-related professional services costs incurred prior to May 17, 2017 were included in general and administrative expenses and such costs incurred subsequent to May 17, 2017 were included in reorganization items in the company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss).\nNote (W): Consolidated EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017 includes non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $2,956, $2,558, $2,554, $326, and $(888), respectively.\nNote (X): Consolidated EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017 includes vessel operating lease expense of $0, $91, $1,747, $5,542, and $8,443, respectively.\nNote (Y): Consolidated EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017 includes foreign exchange gains (losses) of $(348), $(349), $(2,082), $(1,157), and $664, respectively.\nNote (Z): Consolidated EBITDA and equity in net (earnings) losses of unconsol. companies for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017 includes foreign exchange gains (losses) of $(14,823), $(74), $758, $3,480, and $4,965, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe disclose and discuss EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure in our public releases, including quarterly earnings releases, investor conference calls and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We define EBITDA as earnings (net income) before interest and other debt costs, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, reorganization items, asset impairments, and restructuring-related professional services costs included in general and administrative expenses. Our measure of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nWe view EBITDA both as a performance and liquidity measure and, as such, we believe that the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to it are net income and net cash provided (used) in operating activities, respectively. Because EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or loss, cash provided (used) in operating activities, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA is widely used by investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental financial measure that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe EBITDA provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ability to service debt, pay taxes and fund drydocking and survey costs and capital expenditures. We also believe the disclosure of EBITDA helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our cash flow generating capacity from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nEBITDA is also a financial metric used by management (i) as a supplemental internal measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; (ii) to compare to the EBITDA of other companies when evaluating potential acquisitions; and (iii) to assess our ability to service existing fixed charges and incur additional indebtedness.\nFor illustrative purposes, the company has combined the Successor and Predecessor results to derive combined results for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The combination was generated by addition of comparable financial statement line items. However, because of various adjustments to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the application of fresh-start reporting, including asset valuation adjustments and liability adjustments, the results of operations for the Successor may not be comparable to those of the Predecessor.\nLogo - http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/563905/Tidewater_Inc_Logo.jpg\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tidewater-reports-results-for-the-three-months-ended-march-31-2018-300648017.html\nSOURCE Tidewater Inc.",
