Britain's Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, appears on the BBC's Marr Show in London, Britain, May 20, 2018.

Jeff Overs/BBC/Handout via REUTERS\n“At the same time I have been clear that we have to address the Wild West elements of the Internet through legislation, in a way that supports innovation. We strongly support technology companies to start up and grow, and we want to work with them to keep our citizens safe.”\nThere was little detail on what kind of regulation should be used to protect those using the internet, but Hancock told the BBC that as part of the data protection bill now in parliament, firms could be fined up to 4 percent of their global turnover.\nBut when asked whether the government would stop companies from allowing children to spend hours on the internet, Hancock told ITV television: “We want to have a broad consultation.”\nIn his statement, Hancock said the ministry for digital, culture, media and sport and the interior ministry would work with regulators, platforms and advertising companies to settle on legislation that tackles “both legal and illegal harms”.\n“I don’t want the trolls to win,” Hancock said.
