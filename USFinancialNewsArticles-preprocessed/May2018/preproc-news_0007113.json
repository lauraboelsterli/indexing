    "text": "CARLSBAD, Calif., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. (Nasdaq:GNMK), a leading provider of automated, multiplex molecular diagnostic testing systems, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nRevenues of $20.6 million, an increase of 65% over the prior year period ePlex net new placements of 32 analyzers, expanding the global installed base to 228 placements Five abstracts and posters on the benefits of ePlex BCID panels presented at ECCMID, the largest microbiology meeting in Europe\n“We’re off to a solid start in 2018, with revenue growth in the first quarter driven by high respiratory testing volumes in an exceptionally strong flu season, as well as a growing number of customers utilizing ePlex for routine clinical testing. As a result, ePlex contributed meaningfully to first quarter sales and for the first time, surpassed revenues from our XT-8 products,” said Hany Massarany, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We’re encouraged by the steady positive customer feedback we receive on the performance, ease of use and processing capacity of ePlex, and we’re very pleased with its strong market acceptance across all segments. We’re also excited about the potential for our uniquely differentiated BCID panels and look forward to accelerating future placements and revenue as we launch them in the U.S. market.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nRevenue was $20.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 65% versus $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit was $4.2 million, or 20% of revenue, compared with $6.2 million, or 49% of revenue in the same period of 2017, reflecting the increased proportion of ePlex revenues in the quarter, driven by extraordinary flu season demand.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $15.0 million compared to $19.7 million in the same period for 2017. The decrease was largely due to reduced ePlex development expenses, partially offset by an increase in Sales and Marketing expenses.\nLoss per share was $0.21 per share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a $0.30 loss per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company ended the quarter with $65.5 million in cash and investments, reflecting the impact of reductions in operating expenses and the focus on minimizing working capital needs.\nGuidance for Full Year 2018\nGenMark is reconfirming prior 2018 revenue guidance of $68 to $72 million. Gross margin is expected to be in the 30% range. The Company continues to expect ePlex placements of 140-170 net new analyzers, and an annuity per ePlex placement in the $100,000 to $120,000 range.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nThe Company will be hosting a conference call to discuss first quarter results in further detail on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 starting at 4:30 p.m. ET.
