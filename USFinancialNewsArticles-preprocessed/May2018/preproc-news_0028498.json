(\"Gridsum Holding\") (NASDAQ: GSUM) securities.\nClick here to learn about the case: http://www.wongesq.com/pslra-c/gridsum-holding-inc?wire=2 . There is no cost or obligation to you.\nAccording to the complaint, throughout the Class Period, the Company issued materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Gridsum lacked effective internal control over financial reporting; (ii) consequently, Gridsum’s financial statements were inaccurate and misleading, and did not fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company; and (iii) as a result of the foregoing, Gridsum’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nIf you suffered a loss in Gridsum you have until June 25, 2018 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.
