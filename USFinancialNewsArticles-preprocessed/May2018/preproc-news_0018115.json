    "text": "MELBOURNE, Fla., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Goldfield Corporation (NYSE American:GV), a leading provider of electrical construction services for the utility industry and industrial customers, today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Through its subsidiaries, Power Corporation of America, C and C Power Line, Inc. and Southeast Power Corporation, Goldfield provides electrical construction services primarily in the Southeast, mid-Atlantic, Texas and Southwest regions of the United States.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer John H. Sottile said, “First-quarter 2018 electrical construction revenue improved nearly 16 percent year over year, as we experienced overall increased activity in both bid and MSA work. Importantly, we achieved our third consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement. Additionally, our total backlog reached $193 million, with a record-high 12-month backlog of $111 million. We believe our strong market position and active bidding climates should continue to support growth in our operations.”\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017:\nTotal revenue increased 12.1% to $34.4 million from $30.7 million attributable to a 15.9% improvement in electrical construction revenue mainly due to increases in projects awarded and work completed in the Texas and Southwest and mid-Atlantic operations of $7.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in project activity in the Southeast operation of $5.5 million in part due to customer demand exceeding labor resources, as well as lower real estate development revenue.\nGross margin on electrical construction operations decreased to 21.5% from 25.3% attributable to a change in project mix, resulting in a higher volume of lower margin projects mainly due to increased competition.\nOperating income decreased to $3.5 million from $4.3 million due to the same factors which affected gross margin, as well as higher selling, general and administrative, depreciation expenses and lower real estate volume.\nNet income declined to $2.4 million, or $0.09 per share, from $2.7 million, or $0.10 per share.\nEBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) (1) decreased to $5.4 million from $6.1 million as a result of the same factors which drove operating income.\nBacklog\nAs of March 31, 2018, total backlog, which includes total revenue estimated over the remaining life of the Master Service Agreements, or MSAs, an estimate of existing customer renewal options, plus estimated revenue from awarded fixed-price contracts, increased to $193.1 million from $152.3 million as of March 31, 2017, an improvement of 26.7 percent, mainly due to an increase in both firm contract awards and estimated MSAs. The Company’s 12-month electrical construction backlog improved to a record $111.1 million compared to $79.5 million one year ago, and of that, project-specific firm contracts increased 62.2 percent while estimated MSA backlog increased 29 percent. The size and amount of future projects awarded under MSAs cannot be determined with certainty and revenue from such contracts may vary substantially from current estimates.\nBacklog is estimated at a particular point in time and is not determinative of total revenue in any particular period. It does not reflect future revenue from a significant number of short-term projects undertaken and completed between the estimated dates.\nConference Call\nThe Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer John H. Sottile and Chief Financial Officer Stephen R. Wherry will host a conference call and webcast to discuss results at 10 a.m. Eastern time on May 9, 2018.

The non-GAAP measure in this press release and on The Goldfield Corporation’s website is provided to enable investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s performance excluding the effects of certain items that impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods and compare the Company’s operating results with those of its competitors. This measure should be used to supplement, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nThis press release includes within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provision of the 1995 throughout this document.

EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. We use, and we believe investors benefit from the presentation of, EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\nThree Months Ended March 31, EBITDA 2018 2017 Net income (GAAP as reported) $ 2,405,675 $ 2,665,149 Interest expense, net of amount capitalized 189,617 134,020 Provision for income taxes, net (1) 878,139 1,537,138 Depreciation and amortization (2) 1,887,508 1,748,892 EBITDA $ 5,360,939 $ 6,085,199",
