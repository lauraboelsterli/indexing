    "text": "CNBC.com Brendan McDermid | Reuters T-Mobile CEO John Legere speaks on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, April 30, 2018.\nT-Mobile is expected to report first quarter earnings and revenue after market close on Tuesday.\nHere's what Wall Street expects: Earnings: 71 cents per share, forecast by Thomson Reuters Revenue: $1 billion, forecast by Thomson Reuters Net adds: 1.27 million, forecast by StreetAccount\nOn Sunday, the company announced a blockbuster merger agreement with former rival Sprint . The new combined company will boast more than 100 million subscribers and a value of $146 billion.\nT-Mobile had previously struggled to keep up with the two largest wireless companies, Verizon and AT&T , but the merger with Sprint promises to boost T-Mobile's odds in the race for customers and technological innovation. The new company is touting the ability to create thousands of U.S. jobs and a large-scale 5G network that could compete with China in the near-term.\nThe agreement still faces regulatory scrutiny from the Trump administration, which has taken a hard line on telecom mergers. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump scuppered Broadcom's attempt to buy mobile chip maker Qualcomm , and the Department of Justice is suing to stop AT&T 's proposed acquisition of Time Warner .\nAfter Sunday's announcement shares of T-Mobile plunged 6 percent. Shares of the telecom giant are down 4.72 percent year-to-date.\nThis is breaking news. Please check back for updates. Chloe Aiello News Associate for CNBC.com Related Securities ",
