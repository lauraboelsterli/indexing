Cron’s attempt to add to the lead, ending the inning, but the Tampa Bay bullpen didn’t need any additional help.\nRyne Stanek (1-0) got two outs in the last of the 13th, before Jonny Venters came on with one runner aboard to strike out Matt Olson for the final out. The save was the first for Venters since 2011.\nBoth starting pitchers worked out of two serious jams to keep the game scoreless.\nThe Rays’ Archer allowed four hits and two walks in six innings. He struck out seven.\nHe stranded Olson at second after a two-out double in the fourth, then faced Olson again in the sixth after Jonathan Lucroy’s single and two walks loaded the bases with one out. Archer got Olson to ground into a double play, ending the threat.\nThe A’s Cahill went eight innings, also allowing four hits. He struck out six and did not walk a batter.\nCahill twice allowed a two-out double with a runner at first — by Smith in the third inning and Joey Wendle in the sixth — before denying the Rays both times and stranding the two base runners on each occasion.\nSucre and Smith had two hits apiece for the Rays, who opened a nine-game trip with the 10th win in their last 14 games. They’ve won seven of their last eight on the road.\nPiscotty and Jed Lowrie had two hits each for the A’s, who had a two-game winning streak snapped while falling to 3-4 on their ongoing 10-game homestand.\nBoth teams had seven hits.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
