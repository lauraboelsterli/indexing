    "text": "RICHMOND, Va., May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Capital Square 1031, a leading real estate investment and management firm specializing in Delaware statutory trust offerings, announced today its acquisition of a portfolio of nine medical office buildings located in five states. Each property is 100 percent leased to Fresenius Medical Care, the world's leading provider of dialysis services and products.\n\"This is a diversified portfolio of well-located medical clinics with new 15-year net leases guaranteed by Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, an investment-grade company,\" said Louis Rogers, founder and chief executive officer of Capital Square 1031. \"We believe that medical real estate is a stable and recession-resistant asset class. This healthcare-related portfolio is an attractive opportunity for investors seeking a safe investment because dialysis is a necessary and recurring medical treatment for more than 2.5 million Fresenius patients worldwide. By expanding Capital Square's relationship with Fresenius, we are able to help a growing number of investors gain access to medical properties using the DST structure.\"\nLocated in Texas, Tennessee, New York, Michigan and Mississippi, the portfolio includes the following properties*:\n5000 Campus Dr., a 10,640-square-foot building in Fort Worth, Texas, 9449 Grogans Mill Road, a 6,865-square-foot building in The Woodlands, Texas, 825-833 Dalworth St., a 9,150-square-foot building in Grand Prairie, Texas, 222 E.

There are various risks associated with owning, financing, operating, and leasing commercial properties. If the tenant does not renew or extend the lease, or terminates or defaults on the lease, the operating results of the Property could be adversely affected by the loss of revenue and Beneficial Owners could lose the benefits of Section 1031. Other risks include potential environmental conditions at the property, changes in economic conditions, changes in the investment climate for real estate investments, new competition, changes in the demand from competing properties, changes in local market conditions, changes in lease-up periods, changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses. There can be material tax consequences and prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors to evaluate the tax consequences of a DST interest. This is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy a DST interest. Offers are made solely pursuant to the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum.
