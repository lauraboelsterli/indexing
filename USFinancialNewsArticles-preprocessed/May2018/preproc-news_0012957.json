Singapore banks are benefiting from an improving economy and higher local interest rates.\n“The group’s income growth was broad-based, loan growth was sustained, assets under management growth continued and allowances were much lower,” OCBC Chief Executive Officer Samuel Tsien said in a statement on Monday.\nOCBC’s net profit came in at S$1.11 billion ($832 million) in the three months ended March 31 versus S$861 million reported a year ago, and was the highest since the quarter ending September 2014.\nThis was short of the average estimate of S$1.18 billion from five analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters. The year-ago number was restated from a reported profit of S$973 million.\nOCBC said the changes were a result of Singapore-incorporated companies listed on the Singapore Exchange being required to adopt a new financial reporting framework.\nThe bank’s net interest margin rose five basis points to 1.67 percent. Fee and commission income increased 11 percent, led by a 19 percent jump in wealth management fee income.\nOCBC’s allowances for loans and other assets declined to S$12 million from S$168 million a year ago.
