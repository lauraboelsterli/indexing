    "text": "DENVER, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centennial Resource Development, Inc. (“Centennial” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:CDEV) today announced financial and operational results for the first quarter 2018.\nFinancial and Operational Highlights:\nIncreased daily crude oil production 15 percent quarter-over-quarter and 201 percent year-over-year Announced strong Wolfcamp A well results including a positive test in Lea County, New Mexico Delivered consistent well results from multiple intervals in the Delaware Basin Decreased unit costs sequentially Reported drilling and completion capital expenditures in line with expectations Maintained conservative balance sheet and strong liquidity\nFinancial Results\nFirst quarter net income increased 116% to $66.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $30.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2017.\nFor the quarter, average daily crude oil production increased 15 percent compared to the prior quarter and 201 percent compared to the same prior year period. Average daily total equivalent production increased 22 percent compared to the prior period. Centennial’s robust production profile enhanced overall financial performance with the reduction of unit cost metrics, including a reduction in depreciation, depletion and amortization to $13.57 per barrel of oil equivalent (\"Boe\") for the quarter from $14.42 per Boe in the prior quarter.\n“Centennial delivered another quarter of solid operating results. This puts us on-track to deliver the 2018 goals articulated at the beginning of the year,” said Mark G. Papa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We saw consistent well performance during the quarter, with the average well producing approximately 1,200 barrels of oil per day for the initial 30-day production period. Individual wells are outperforming our expectations. These well results coupled with low unit costs were key to giving us very strong overall results for the quarter.”\nOperational Update\nCentennial continues to efficiently develop its acreage position in the Delaware Basin. In Lea County, New Mexico, the Juliet Federal Com 1H (85% WI) was drilled with an approximate 4,000-foot effective lateral and reported an initial 30-day production rate of 1,447 Boe/d (78% oil). The well averaged 282 Bbls/d of oil per 1,000 foot of lateral for the first 30 days and produced over 50,000 barrels of oil during its initial 60-day period.\n“The Juliet is Centennial’s first operated well targeting the Wolfcamp A in Lea County. The initial results are very positive, and we believe this confirms the productivity of this interval on our acreage in the Northern Delaware,” Papa said. “Since entering this part of the basin last year, essentially every well has either met or exceeded expectations, highlighting the quality of our acreage and the expertise of our technical team.”\nCentennial also reported results from new horizons on the Texas side of the Delaware Basin where it is operating a six rig drilling program. While still drilling some delineation wells across its acreage, drilling and completion operations have largely shifted to multi-well pad development where possible, leading to greater operational efficiencies and cost improvements.\nIn Reeves County, Texas, Centennial posted robust results from the Third Bone Spring Sand, Upper Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B intervals. With 98% WI in both wells, the Carpenter State A U30H and B U39H were drilled in the Upper Wolfcamp A with approximate 6,900-foot laterals. The Carpenter State A U30H averaged 2,020 Boe/d (84% oil) for the initial 30-day production period. The Carpenter State B U39H reported an initial 30-day production rate of 1,532 Boe/d (86% oil). The Carpenter State A U30H and B U39H delivered an average initial 30-day oil production rate of 216 Bbls/d per 1,000 foot of lateral per well. Additionally, Centennial drilled and completed an extended 9,100-foot lateral, the Sieber Trust B13H (100% WI) in the Wolfcamp B formation. The well achieved an initial 30-day production rate of 1,877 Boe/d, or 1,441 Bbls/d of oil (77% oil).\n“During the first quarter, the average completed lateral length increased more than 20 percent over the previous quarter. The impact of cost savings from drilling longer laterals from multi-well pads and higher well productivity is reflected in our improved bottom line,” Papa said. “Also, the encouraging results from the Sieber Trust well give us greater confidence in future upside potential of our Reeves County acreage position in the Wolfcamp B.”\nAs previously announced, the Weaver C T34H (86% WI) was Centennial’s first Reeves County well in the Third Bone Spring Sand, using modern completion techniques. The well, drilled with an approximate 9,350-foot effective lateral, reported an initial 30-day production rate of 2,129 Boe/d, or 1,563 Bbls/d of oil (73% oil). The well has proved the viability of the zone with results comparable to some of Centennial’s best producers from the Wolfcamp A zone.\n“With 82,000 barrels of oil in the first 60 days, the Weaver well continues to demonstrate a very strong production profile,” Papa said. “The Third Bone Spring Sand extends over a significant portion of our Reeves County position and has the potential to add substantial, high rate-of-return inventory to our drilling portfolio. We expect to drill additional wells in the zone during the year.”\nDrilling and completion capital expenditures incurred for the first quarter were approximately $181.8 million. Centennial’s facilities, infrastructure, land and other capital totaled approximately $56.5 million during the quarter.\n“Operationally, this was a significant quarter for us. We drilled a Wolfcamp A well in Lea County, while testing longer laterals in the Wolfcamp A and B zones in Reeves County. All wells came on-line with strong oil production over the initial thirty-day period,” Papa said. “Furthermore, we now have over sixty days of production from our Third Bone Spring Sand test that continues to produce at a very healthy rate of oil production. These data points set us up nicely and confirm additional running room for the future.”\nCapital Structure and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, Centennial had approximately $38 million in cash on hand, with zero borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $400 million of senior unsecured notes. On May 4, 2018, the Company closed a new five-year revolving credit facility. The borrowing base under the new credit facility increased by 39% to $800 million from $575 million under the Company’s prior credit facility, with a new elected commitment of $600 million. As of March 31, 2018, after giving effect to the new borrowing base and elected commitment, total liquidity was approximately $637 million, including letters of credit.\nHedge Position\nAs of May 8, 2018, Centennial had no fixed-price crude oil hedges. For the period April to December 2018, Centennial’s crude oil basis hedges represent approximately 27% of its expected crude oil production (using the mid-point of guidance) at a weighted average price of $(1.77) per barrel. To protect its associated rich natural gas production from current market dynamics in the Permian Basin, Centennial also entered into additional natural gas swap and basis hedges effective 2019. (For a summary table of Centennial’s derivative contracts as of May 1, 2018, please see the Appendix of this press release.)\n“As predicted, crude oil prices have responded positively to tightening global supply and demand fundamentals. At this time, we plan to remain fully unhedged on future oil production given our positive macro view,” Papa said. “We will also look to ensure adequate gas takeaway from the basin and minimize basis pricing risk for both crude oil and natural gas.”\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nCentennial’s financial statements and related footnotes will be available in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which is expected be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 8, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast\nCentennial will host an investor conference call on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Mountain (10:00 a.m. Eastern) to discuss first quarter 2018 operating and financial results. Interested parties may join the webcast by visiting Centennial’s website at www.cdevinc.com and clicking on the webcast link or by dialing (800) 789-3525, or (442) 268-1041 for international calls, (Conference ID: 1872225) at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the call.

We define Adjusted EBITDAX as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration costs, impairment and abandonment expenses, non-cash gains or losses on derivatives, non-cash stock-based compensation, gains and losses from the sale of assets and transaction costs. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nOur management believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful as it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to net income, our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP:\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Adjusted EBITDAX reconciliation to net income: Net income attributable to Class A Common Stock $ 66,090 $ 9,823 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 4,682 884 Interest expense 5,813 410 Income tax expense 19,137 — Depreciation, depletion and amortization 66,010 26,160 Impairment and abandonment expenses — (29 ) Non-cash portion of derivative gain (7,482 ) (4,156 ) Stock-based compensation expense 3,952 2,370 Exploration expense 3,447 1,181 Transaction costs — 887 (Gain) loss on sale of oil and natural gas properties (15 ) (166 ) Adjusted EBITDAX $ 161,634 $ 37,364\nCentennial Resource Development, Inc.\nOperating Highlights For the Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017 $ % Operating revenues (in thousands): Oil sales $ 174,841 $ 46,681 $ 128,160 275 % Natural gas sales 18,580 8,241 10,339 125 % NGL sales 22,477 6,175 16,302 264 % Oil and gas sales $ 215,898 $ 61,097 $ 154,801 253 % Average sales prices: Oil (per Bbl) $ 61.53 $ 49.45 $ 12.08 24 % Effect of derivative settlements on average price (per Bbl) (0.09 ) 0.28 (0.37 ) (132 )% Oil net of hedging (per Bbl) $ 61.44 $ 49.73 $ 11.71 24 % Average NYMEX price for oil (per Bbl) $ 62.91 $ 51.82 $ 11.09 21 % Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 2.42 $ 2.91 $ (0.49 ) (17 )% Effect of derivative settlements on average price (per Mcf) (0.01 ) 0.05 (0.06 ) (120 )% Natural gas net of hedging (per Mcf) $ 2.41 $ 2.96 $ (0.55 ) (19 )% Average NYMEX price for natural gas (per Mcf) $ 3.08 $ 3.06 $ 0.02 1 % NGL (per Bbl) $ 30.21 $ 25.10 $ 5.11 20 % Net production: Oil (MBbls) 2,842 944 1,898 201 % Natural gas (MMcf) 7,683 2,833 4,850 171 % NGL (MBbls) 744 246 498 202 % Total (MBoe) 4,866 1,662 3,204 193 % Average daily net production volume: Oil (Bbls/d) 31,573 10,489 21,084 201 % Natural gas (Mcf/d) 85,372 31,478 53,894 171 % NGL (Bbls/d) 8,267 2,733 5,534 202 % Total (Boe/d) 54,069 18,469 35,600 193 %\nCentennial Resource Development, Inc.\nOperating Expenses For the Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017 $ % Operating costs (in thousands): Lease operating expenses $ 16,276 $ 7,278 $ 8,998 124 % Severance and ad valorem taxes 14,173 3,187 10,986 345 % Gathering, processing and transportation expenses 13,828 5,244 8,584 164 % Operating costs per Boe: Lease operating expenses $ 3.34 $ 4.38 $ (1.04 ) (24 )% Severance and ad valorem taxes 2.91 1.92 0.99 52 % Gathering, processing and transportation expenses 2.84 3.16 (0.32 ) (10 )%\nCentennial Resource Development, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except per share data) For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Operating revenues Oil and gas sales 215,898 61,097 Operating expenses Lease operating expenses 16,276 7,278 Severance and ad valorem taxes 14,173 3,187 Gathering, processing and transportation expenses 13,828 5,244 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 66,010 26,160 Impairment and abandonment expenses — (29 ) Exploration expense 3,447 1,181 General and administrative expenses 14,297 10,884 Total operating expenses 128,031 53,905 Income from operations 87,867 7,192 Other income (expense) Gain (loss) on sale of oil and natural gas properties 15 166 Interest expense (5,813 ) (410 ) Net gain (loss) on derivative instruments 7,843 3,759 Other income (expense) (3 ) — Other income (expense) 2,042 3,515 Income before income taxes 89,909 10,707 Income tax expense 19,137 — Net income 70,772 10,707 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 4,682 884 Net income attributable to Class A Common Stock $ 66,090 $ 9,823 Income per share of Class A Common Stock: Basic $ 0.25 $ 0.04 Diluted $ 0.25 $ 0.04 The following table summarizes the approximate volumes and average contract prices of swap contracts the Company had in place as of March 31, 2018 and additional contracts entered into through May 1, 2018:\nDescription and Production Period Volume (Bbl) Weighted Average\nDifferential ($/Bbl) (1) Crude Oil Basis Swaps: April 2018 -
