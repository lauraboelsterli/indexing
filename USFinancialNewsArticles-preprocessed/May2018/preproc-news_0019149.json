(NYSE:MG), a leading \"one source\" global provider of technology-enabled asset protection solutions, reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nConsolidated revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $187.6 million, 15% higher than the prior year period of $163.3 million. Services segment revenues were $145.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, 15% higher than $126.3 million in the prior year. The increase in revenues was due to the combined effects of acquisition expansion, organic growth and favorable FX rates. All three segments had revenue increases in excess of 10% year-over-year.\nOperating income for the first quarter was $6.4 million, 97% higher than the prior year period of $3.3 million. First quarter\n2018 net income was $2.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $1.7 million and $0.06 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nThe Company generated $5.8 million of net cash from operating activities during the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $15.3 million. The Company’s net debt (total debt of $187.8 million less cash and cash equivalents of $33.1 million) was $154.7 million at March 31, 2018.\nPerformance by segment was as follows:\nServices segment Q1 revenues increased by $19.3 million or 15% over prior year, attributable to mid-single digit organic growth coupled with high-single digit acquisition growth. Services segment operating income increased by $4.9 million or 66% and income before special items increased by $2.8 million or 33%, respectively, over prior year. Services segment operating income margin before special items increased by 100 bps.\nInternational segment Q1 revenue increased by $4.2 million or 12% over prior year, attributable to favorable FX rates. As expected, International Q1 operating income decreased from the prior year's strong comparable results, but improved sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017's operating loss.\nProducts and Systems segment Q1 revenue increased by $0.6 million or 11% over prior year. Products and Systems Q1 operating income increased by $0.7 million compared with the prior year operating loss.\nDennis Bertolotti, Chief Executive Officer stated, \"I am pleased with the top-line performance of all segments during Q1, as each segment grew revenue at a double digit rate. Our services segment also reached an all-time high in Q1 revenue, even after excluding the effect of all 2017 acquisitions. This was attributable to organic growth, the benefit of acquisitions completed last year as well as favorable FX rates. Our operating margin improved by 140 basis points, driven by a 220 basis improvement in our operating expense ratio.”\nMr. Bertolotti added “Market conditions have also improved over 2017 with higher petroleum prices and a growing aerospace business. We have also continued our push into expanding our mechanical services.\" Mr. Bertolotti concluded, stating “I believe macro-level economics drivers will be positive throughout 2018, and am confident in maintaining the forward momentum that we've built up over the past few successive quarters.\"\nThe Company’s 2018 financial guidance remains unchanged, as follows:\nTotal revenues from $715 million to $730 million;\nAdjusted EBITDA from $78 million to $83 million;\nOperating cash flow of approximately $70 million;\nCapital expenditures expected between $15 million and $20 million.\nThe Company completed its initial assessment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act using best estimates based on current data and guidance available and expects its effective tax rate to be between 30% to 32% for 2018. Additionally, the Company has the following expectations for net income and earnings per diluted share:\nNet income is expected to between $24 million to $28 million;\nEarnings per diluted share is expected to between $0.83 to $0.95 cents.\nConference Call\nIn connection with this release, Mistras will hold a conference call on May 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern).

The term \"Adjusted EBITDA\" used in this release is a financial measurement not calculated in accordance with GAAP and is defined as net income attributable to Mistras Group, Inc. plus: interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and certain acquisition related costs (including transaction due diligence costs and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration), foreign exchange (gain) loss and, if applicable, certain special items which are noted. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to a financial measurement under GAAP is set forth in a table attached to this press release. In addition, the Company has also included in the attached tables non-GAAP measurement” “Segment and Total Company Income (Loss) Before Special Items”, reconciling these measurements to financial measurements under GAAP. The Company uses the term “free cash flow”, a non-GAAP measurement the Company defines as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). The Company also uses the term “net debt”, a non-GAAP measurement defined as the sum of the current and long-term portions of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents.\nMistras Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(unaudited) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 ASSETS Current
