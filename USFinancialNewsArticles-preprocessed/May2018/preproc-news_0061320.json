At McCann, he was responsible for building and supervising scientific strategy teams across multiple agencies within the McCann Health network.

His research experience extended over 13 years and earned him a Harvard Medical School Hematology Fellowship and a Young Investigator Award from Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation, among other achievements.\n“I’m excited to join W2O and harness its existing strengths, including unparalleled analytics capabilities, to build a best-in-class scientific strategy and communications offering and change the way people connect with and value science and medicine,” said Dr. Pyati. “I intend to infuse deeper scientific strategy and content into our existing client work and raise the level of scientific rigor and impact in everything we do, implement a consistent methodology, and create new approaches to scientific storytelling. Combining all these strengths, W2O has the capability to transform deep scientific insights into foundational drivers of brands, franchises and companies across their lifecycles.”\nIn this newly created position, Dr. Pyati will leverage his deep understanding of the science behind established and emerging therapies to develop the two core capabilities of the new practice’s offering: 1) Science-driven strategy, driving situational assessments and workshops as well as developing differentiated positioning, scientific platforms and lexicons, and 2) Scientific Storytelling, creating disease/mechanism of action narratives and visuals, product messaging, and disease education along with peer-to-peer educational and promotional materials.\n“Uj has been an integral force in driving the commercial success of a vast range of high-science brands through bold, differentiated and inspiring disease awareness and brand campaigns. Because of this experience, he will not only make an immediate and measurable impact on our ability to define scientific strategies and stories for our cornerstone AOR assignments, but he will also provide scientific leadership throughout the firm on everything we do for clients across the board,” said Jennifer Gottlieb , President of W2O.\nW2O has established itself as a leader in the marketing and communications space, specifically in healthcare, and primarily through leading-edge analytics, data and insights, resulting in precise communications programming and execution.
