The logo of EuropaCorp, of which French film director Luc Besson (not pictured) is co-founder and Chairman, is seen at the inauguration of the 'Cite du Cinema' movie studios in Saint-Denis, near Paris, September 21, 2012. REUTERS/Charles Platiau\nEuropaCorp shares were down 13.3 percent in early session trading.\nOver the weekend, Besson’s lawyer Thierry Marembert told Reuters that Besson “categorically denied” the allegation, made by an unnamed actress.
