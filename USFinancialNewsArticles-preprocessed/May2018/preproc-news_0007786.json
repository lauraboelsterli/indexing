    "text": "PARSIPPANY, N.J., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE: WYN) today announced results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Full reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures for all reported periods appear in the tables to this press release.\nFirst quarter revenues from continuing operations were $1.2 billion, an increase of 3% compared with the prior-year period. Results reflect the required adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, which had an immaterial year-over-year impact on the Company's results on a comparable basis.\nNet income from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2018 was $81 million compared with $127 million for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $0.80, versus $1.20 in the prior-year period. Net income from continuing operations was impacted by $53 million ($0.53 per diluted share) of after-tax separation- and transaction-related costs in first quarter 2018.\nAdjusted net income from continuing operations was $134 million or $1.33 per diluted share, compared with $106 million or $1.01 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 32%, and 10% excluding the benefit of a reduced effective income tax rate. Adjusted results exclude separation costs and other items as detailed in Tables 7 and 8 of this press release. The growth in adjusted earnings primarily reflects higher revenues in all three of the Company's operating segments, hurricane-related insurance recoveries and lower taxes, partially offset by increased interest expense. Adjusted diluted EPS also reflects the benefit of the Company's share repurchase program.\n\"We've started the year with strong growth in our businesses,\" said Stephen P. Holmes, chairman and CEO. \"Our teams delivered solid financial results while executing on several key strategic initiatives, including the pending sale of our European vacation rentals business, the planned spin-off of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts into a separate publicly traded company, and the pending acquisition of La Quinta's hotel franchising and hotel management business.\"\nFirst quarter EBITDA from continuing operations was $221 million, compared with $237 million in the prior-year period, due to separation-related costs recorded in first quarter 2018. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased 10%, to $274 million, compared with $249 million in the first quarter of 2017. Results primarily reflect the growth in revenues as well as an approximately $5 million net benefit from hurricane-related impacts and insurance proceeds.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS\nHotel Group\nRevenues increased 4% to $302 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $289 million in first quarter 2017. Results reflect higher royalties and franchise fees as well as higher marketing, reservation and Wyndham Rewards revenues, which are generally offset in expenses.\nEBITDA was $83 million in the first quarter, unchanged from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to $12 million of separation- and acquisition-related costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $98 million compared with $84 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 17%, primarily reflecting the growth in revenue and a net benefit of $6 million from hurricane-related insurance recoveries and costs.\nFirst quarter domestic RevPAR increased 5.6% compared with first quarter 2017. Global RevPAR increased 7.0%, and 4.7% in constant currency.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's hotel system consisted of over 8,300 properties and approximately 723,000 rooms, a 3% increase compared with a year earlier that includes almost 12,000 rooms the Company added with the acquisition of AmericInn in October 2017. The development pipeline increased to over 1,100 hotels and nearly 147,700 rooms, a 3% year-over-year room increase, of which 58% are international and 67% are new construction.\nDestination Network\nRevenues were $246 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $243 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 1%. The average number of members increased 1%, while exchange revenue per member declined 1%.\nEBITDA was $66 million compared with $75 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting $11 million of separation costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $77 million compared with $75 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 3%, primarily reflecting hurricane-related insurance recoveries and cost savings.\nThis segment no longer includes the Company's European vacation rentals business, which is classified as a discontinued operation.\nVacation Ownership\nRevenues were $661 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $639 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 3%. The increase reflects 6% growth in both gross vacation ownership interest (VOI) sales and consumer financing revenues, partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses. Tour flow increased 8% and sales volume per guest (VPG) declined 2%, driven by increased tours to new owners. New owner sales volume increased 19% year-over-year.\nEBITDA was $124 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $117 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $129 million compared with $122 million in the prior-year quarter, an increase of 6%. Results primarily reflect the growth in revenues.\nOTHER ITEMS\nUpcoming Separation – As previously announced, the Company plans to separate into two publicly traded hospitality companies through the spin-off of the Company's Hotel Group business to shareholders. In the spin-off, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. will become an independent hotel franchising and hotel management company whose common stock is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"WH.\" In conjunction with the spin-off, Wyndham Worldwide will change its name to Wyndham Destinations, Inc. and will be primarily comprised of Wyndham's Vacation Ownership and Destination Network operations, making it the world's largest vacation ownership and exchange company. Wyndham Destinations' stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"WYND.\" The separation process has been proceeding as planned, and the Company expects to complete the spin-off this quarter. Sale of European Vacation Rentals Business – In the first quarter, the Company agreed to sell its European vacation rentals business to an affiliate of Platinum Equity for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. This transaction is expected to be completed this quarter. La Quinta Acquisition – As previously announced, the Company has agreed to purchase La Quinta Holdings' hotel franchising and hotel management operations for $1.95 billion in cash. The acquisition will add approximately 900 managed and/or franchised hotels to our Hotel Group's portfolio and is expected to close this quarter. In preparation for the La Quinta acquisition and the spin-off, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes due 2026 and arranged for commitments from lenders for a $1.6 billion senior secured term loan facility. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts has also arranged a $750 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which it expects to be undrawn at the time of spin-off and acquisition of La Quinta. Share Repurchases – The Company repurchased 0.6 million shares of common stock for $75 million during the first quarter of 2018 at an average price of $115.91. From April 1 through May 1, 2018, the Company repurchased an additional 0.2 million shares for $22 million. Sale of Knights Inn – In April, the Company agreed to sell its Knights Inn franchise brand, consisting of approximately 350 franchised hotels with 21,000 rooms, to Red Lion Hotels for approximately $27 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close this quarter. New Revenue Recognition Standard – In the first quarter, the Company adopted the new U.S. GAAP revenue recognition standard, as required. This new standard reduced previously reported first quarter 2017 revenues and adjusted EBITDA by $14 million and $3 million, respectively, and reduced first quarter 2018 revenues and adjusted EBITDA by $16 million and $3 million, respectively.\nOUTLOOK\nNote to Editors: The Company has classified its European vacation rentals business, which it has agreed to sell, as a discontinued operation; its results are therefore excluded from the outlook below. In addition, the outlook excludes possible future share repurchases. Analysts' estimates may include projections of the European vacation rentals business and/or include projected share repurchases, and may not have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the new U.S. GAAP revenue recognition standard. These factors may result in discrepancies between the Company's projections and database consensus forecasts.\nThe Company's outlook for 2018 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is unchanged from the outlook it provided in February. The Company projects the following results for full-year 2018:\nRevenues of $5.195 billion to $5.335 billion, an increase of 4% to 7%. The change from the Company's prior projection is entirely due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which did not affect projected year-over-year revenue growth calculated on a comparable basis An effective tax rate applicable to adjusted pretax earnings of approximately 25%. Adjusted net income from continuing operations of $702 million to $717 million, an increase of 25% to 28%, approximately 19 points of which is due to a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.330 billion to $1.355 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7% to 9% and is comprised of: Hotel Group adjusted EBITDA of $445 million to $455 million Destination Network adjusted EBITDA of $265 million to $275 million Vacation Ownership adjusted EBITDA of $735 million to $750 million Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $6.96 to $7.11, which is an increase of 28% to 31% and is based on a diluted share count of 100.8 million.\nThese projections exclude the impact of the La Quinta acquisition and the financing thereof, exclude any impact from our European vacation rentals business, which is treated as a discontinued operation, and exclude costs associated with the Company's planned separation into two separate publicly traded companies. Projections now reflect the required change in revenue recognition accounting. See Table 12 for detailed projections. In addition, we are publishing two presentations on our website ( http://investor.wyndhamworldwide.com ) with additional information on our projections for the two separate companies post-spin.\nIn determining adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, the Company excludes certain items which are otherwise included in determining the comparable GAAP financial measures. A description of the adjustments that have been applicable for the reported periods in determining adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS are reflected in Tables 7 and 8 of this press release. The Company is providing an outlook for net income, EBITDA and EPS only on a non-GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the totality or ultimate outcome or occurrence of these adjustments or other potential adjustments that may arise in the future during the outlook period, which can be dependent on future events that may not be reliably predicted.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nWyndham Worldwide Corporation will hold a conference call with investors to discuss the Company's results and outlook on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET. Listeners can access the webcast live through the Company's website at http://www.wyndhamworldwide.com/investors/ .

A telephone replay will be available for approximately 10 days beginning at 12:00 p.m. ET on May 2, 2018 at 800-374-1375.\nPRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nFinancial information discussed in this press release includes non-GAAP measures, which include or exclude certain items. These non-GAAP measures differ from reported GAAP results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons and are helpful to investors as an additional tool for further understanding and assessing the Company's ongoing operating performance. Exclusion of items in the Company's non-GAAP presentation should not be considered an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.

The Company also uses adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure of its operating performance. The Company believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of assessing performance of the Company and for the Company's segments which, when considered with GAAP measures, give a more complete understanding of its operating performance and assist its investors in evaluating its ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods, by adjusting for certain items which may be recurring or nonrecurring and which in the Company's view do not necessarily reflect ongoing operating performance. The Company also internally uses these measures to assess its operating performance, both in absolute terms and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. These supplemental disclosures are in addition to GAAP reported measures. The Company's presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nThe following tables summarize net revenues and EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, as well as reconcile Net Income to EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet Revenues\nEBITDA\nNet Revenues\nEBITDA\nHotel Group\n$\n302\n$\n83\n$\n289\n$\n83\nDestination Network\n246\n66\n243\n75\nVacation Ownership\n661\n124\n639\n117\nTotal Reportable Segments\n1,209\n273\n1,171\n275\nCorporate and Other (a)\n(19)\n(52)\n(17)\n(38)\nTotal Company\n$\n1,190\n$\n221\n$\n1,154\n$\n237\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n34\n$\n90\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\n47\n37\nProvision for income taxes\n40\n26\nDepreciation and amortization\n56\n51\nInterest expense\n45\n34\nInterest income\n(1)\n(1)\nEBITDA\n$\n221\n$\n237\nThe following tables summarize net revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (for a description of adjustments and reconciliation by segment, see Table 8):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nAdjusted\nAdjusted\nNet Revenues\nEBITDA\nNet Revenues\nEBITDA\nHotel Group\n$\n302\n$\n98\n$\n289\n$\n84\nDestination Network\n246\n77\n243\n75\nVacation Ownership\n661\n129\n639\n122\nTotal Reportable Segments\n1,209\n304\n1,171\n281\nCorporate and Other (a)\n(19)\n(30)\n(17)\n(32)\nTotal Company\n$\n1,190\n$\n274\n$\n1,154\n$\n249\nNote: Amounts may not add due to rounding.\n(a) Includes the elimination of transactions between segments.\nTable 3\n(1 of 2)\nWyndham Worldwide Corporation\nOPERATING STATISTICS\nThe following operating statistics are the drivers of the Company's revenues and therefore provide an enhanced understanding of the Company's businesses:\nYear\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nFull Year\nHotel Group(a)\nNumber of Rooms\n2018\n723,000\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2017\n699,800\n705,700\n708,500\n728,200\n728,200\n2016\n679,100\n683,300\n689,800\n697,600\n697,600\nRevPAR\n2018\n$\n33.95\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2017\n$\n31.73\n$\n39.43\n$\n44.36\n$\n34.88\n$\n37.63\n2016\n$\n31.59\n$\n39.10\n$\n43.04\n$\n32.92\n$\n36.67\nDestination Network(a)\nAverage Number of Members (in 000s)\n2018\n3,852\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2017\n3,817\n3,791\n3,792\n3,796\n3,799\n2016\n3,841\n3,857\n3,868\n3,843\n3,852\nExchange Revenue Per Member\n2018\n$\n194.70\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2017\n$\n195.84\n$\n174.12\n$\n172.43\n$\n164.45\n$\n176.74\n2016\n$\n193.06\n$\n170.48\n$\n169.18\n$\n157.56\n$\n172.56\nVacation Ownership (a)\nGross Vacation Ownership Interest (VOI) Sales (in 000s) (b)\n2018\n$\n465,000\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2017\n$\n438,000\n$\n562,000\n$\n600,000\n$\n538,000\n$\n2,139,000\n2016\n$\n427,000\n$\n517,000\n$\n563,000\n$\n501,000\n$\n2,007,000\nTours (in 000s)\n2018\n190\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2017\n176\n235\n247\n210\n869\n2016\n179\n213\n230\n197\n819\nVolume Per Guest (VPG)\n2018\n$\n2,303\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2017\n$\n2,354\n$\n2,302\n$\n2,299\n$\n2,438\n$\n2,345\n2016\n$\n2,244\n$\n2,328\n$\n2,320\n$\n2,399\n$\n2,324\nNote: Full year amounts may not add across due to rounding.\n(a) Includes the impact of acquisitions from the acquisition dates forward.\n(b) Includes Gross VOI sales under the Company's Wyndham Asset Affiliate Model (WAAM) Just-in-Time.

Comparable RevPAR represents RevPAR of hotels which are included in both periods.\nDestination Network\nAverage Number of Members: Represents members in the Company's vacation exchange programs who paid annual membership dues as of the end of the period or who are within the allowed grace period. For additional fees, such participants are entitled to exchange intervals for intervals at other properties affiliated with the Company's vacation exchange business. In addition, certain participants may exchange intervals for other leisure-related services and products.\nExchange Revenue Per Member: Represents total annualized revenues generated from fees associated with memberships, exchange transactions, member-related rentals and other servicing for the period divided by the average number of vacation exchange members during the period.\nVacation Ownership\nGross Vacation Ownership Interest Sales: Represents sales of vacation ownership interest (VOIs), including WAAM sales, before the net effect of percentage-of-completion accounting and loan loss provisions. The Company believes gross VOI sales provide an enhanced understanding of the performance of its vacation ownership business because it directly measures the sales volume of this business during a given reporting period.

The Company believes free cash flow to be a useful operating performance measure to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash for uses other than capital expenditures and, after debt service and other obligations, its ability to grow its business through acquisitions, development advances and equity investments, as well as its ability to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measures of net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities as a means for evaluating Wyndham Worldwide is that free cash flow does not represent the total cash movement for the period as detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nThe following table provides more details on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measure and the related reconciliation between these financial measures:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities - Continuing Operations\n$\n1\n$\n123\nLess: Property and equipment additions - Continuing Operations\n(28)\n(28)\nFree cash flow - Continuing Operations\n$\n(27)\n$\n95\nNet cash provided by operating activities - Discontinued Operations\n$\n132\n$\n115\nLess: Property and equipment additions - Discontinued Operations\n(6)\n(7)\nFree cash flow - Discontinued Operations\n$\n126\n$\n108\nTotal free cash flow\n$\n99\n$\n203\nTable 5\n(1 of 2)\nWyndham Worldwide Corporation\nREVENUE DETAIL BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT\n(In millions)\n2018\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nYear\nHotel Group\nRoyalties and Franchise Fees\n$\n84\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nMarketing, Reservation and Wyndham Rewards Revenues (a)\n83\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nHotel Management Reimbursable Revenues (b)\n66\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nIntersegment Trademark Fees\n13\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nOwned Hotel Revenues\n23\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nAncillary Revenues (c)\n33\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal Hotel Group\n302\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nDestination Network\nExchange Revenues\n188\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nRental Revenues North America\n38\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nAncillary Revenues (d)\n20\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal Destination Network\n246\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nVacation Ownership\nVacation Ownership Interest Sales\n358\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nConsumer Financing\n118\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nProperty Management Fees and Reimbursable Revenues\n164\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nWAAM Fee-for-Service Commissions\n10\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nAncillary Revenues (e)\n11\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal Vacation Ownership\n661\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal Reportable Segments\n$\n1,209\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2017\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nYear\nHotel Group\nRoyalties and Franchise Fees\n$\n78\n$\n98\n$\n110\n$\n95\n$\n380\nMarketing, Reservation and Wyndham Rewards Revenues (a)\n77\n96\n109\n89\n371\nHotel Management Reimbursable Revenues (b)\n66\n69\n64\n64\n264\nIntersegment Trademark Fees\n13\n15\n16\n14\n59\nOwned Hotel Revenues\n23\n21\n16\n18\n78\nAncillary Revenues (c)\n32\n32\n32\n32\n128\nTotal Hotel Group\n289\n331\n347\n312\n1,280\nDestination Network\nExchange Revenues\n187\n165\n163\n156\n671\nRental Revenues North America\n38\n46\n63\n25\n172\nAncillary Revenues (d)\n18\n23\n22\n21\n84\nTotal Destination Network\n243\n234\n248\n202\n927\nVacation Ownership\nVacation Ownership Interest Sales\n350\n446\n466\n422\n1,684\nConsumer Financing\n111\n114\n119\n120\n463\nProperty Management Fees and Reimbursable Revenues\n163\n164\n160\n162\n649\nWAAM Fee-for-Service Commissions\n2\n4\n8\n10\n24\nAncillary Revenues (e)\n13\n17\n15\n15\n61\nTotal Vacation Ownership\n639\n745\n768\n729\n2,881\nTotal Reportable Segments\n$\n1,171\n$\n1,310\n$\n1,363\n$\n1,243\n$\n5,088\nTable 5\n(2 of 2)\nWyndham Worldwide Corporation\nREVENUE DETAIL BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT\n(In millions)\n2016\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nYear\nHotel Group\nRoyalties and Franchise Fees\n$\n75\n$\n94\n$\n104\n$\n95\n$\n369\nMarketing, Reservation and Wyndham Rewards Revenues (a)\n79\n94\n114\n84\n372\nHotel Management Reimbursable Revenues (b)\n67\n71\n67\n65\n271\nIntersegment Trademark Fees\n13\n15\n16\n14\n56\nOwned Hotel Revenues\n27\n19\n17\n17\n81\nAncillary Revenues (c)\n30\n31\n31\n30\n120\nTotal Hotel Group\n291\n324\n349\n305\n1,269\nDestination Network\nExchange Revenues\n185\n164\n164\n151\n665\nRental Revenues North America\n39\n44\n62\n25\n169\nAncillary Revenues (d)\n19\n23\n21\n20\n82\nTotal Destination Network\n243\n231\n247\n196\n916\nVacation Ownership\nVacation Ownership Interest Sales\n341\n407\n439\n414\n1,601\nConsumer Financing\n107\n108\n112\n113\n440\nProperty Management Fees and Reimbursable Revenues\n153\n151\n160\n159\n623\nWAAM Fee-for-Service Commissions\n17\n16\n13\n-\n46\nAncillary Revenues (e)\n16\n18\n16\n14\n64\nTotal Vacation Ownership\n634\n700\n740\n700\n2,774\nTotal Reportable Segments\n$\n1,168\n$\n1,255\n$\n1,336\n$\n1,201\n$\n4,959\nNote: Full year amounts may not add across due to rounding.\n(a) Marketing and reservation revenues represent fees the Company receives from franchised and managed hotels that are to be expended for marketing purposes or the operation of a centralized reservation system.

The presentation of these adjustments is intended to permit the comparison of particular adjustments as they appear in the income statement in order to assist investors' understanding of the overall impact of such adjustments. In addition to GAAP financial measures, the Company provides adjusted net income and adjusted EPS financial measures to assist its investors in evaluating its ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods, by adjusting for certain items which may be recurring or non-recurring and which in the Company's view do not necessarily reflect ongoing performance. The Company also internally uses these measures to assess its operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. These supplemental disclosures are in addition to GAAP reported measures.

The presentation of these adjustments is intended to permit the comparison of particular adjustments as they appear in the income statement in order to assist investors' understanding of the overall impact of such adjustments. In addition to GAAP financial measures, the Company provides adjusted net income and adjusted EPS financial measures to assist its investors in evaluating its ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods, by adjusting for certain items which may be recurring or non-recurring and which in the Company's view do not necessarily reflect ongoing performance. The Company also internally uses these measures to assess its operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. These supplemental disclosures are in addition to GAAP reported measures. This non-GAAP reconciliation table should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 11\nWyndham Worldwide Corporation\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION OF GROSS VOI SALES\n(In millions)\nThe Company believes gross vacation ownership sales provide an enhanced understanding of the performance of its vacation ownership business because it directly measures the sales volume of this business during a given reporting period.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Gross VOI sales (see Table 3) to vacation ownership interest sales (see Table 5):\nYear\n2018\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nFull Year\nGross VOI sales\n$\n465\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nLess: Sales under WAAM Fee-for-Service\n(15)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nGross VOI sales, net of WAAM Fee-for-Service sales\n450\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nLess: Loan loss provision\n(92)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nVacation ownership interest sales\n$\n358\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2017\nGross VOI sales\n$\n438\n$\n562\n$\n600\n$\n538\n$\n2,139\nLess: Sales under WAAM Fee-for-Service\n(3)\n(5)\n(11)\n(15)\n(35)\nGross VOI sales, net of WAAM Fee-for-Service sales\n435\n556\n589\n523\n2,104\nLess: Loan loss provision\n(85)\n(110)\n(123)\n(101)\n(420)\nVacation ownership interest sales\n$\n350\n$\n446\n$\n466\n$\n422\n$\n1,684\n2016\nGross VOI sales\n$\n427\n$\n517\n$\n563\n$\n501\n$\n2,007\nLess: Sales under WAAM Fee-for-Service\n(23)\n(20)\n(20)\n(1)\n(64)\nGross VOI sales, net of WAAM Fee-for-Service sales\n404\n497\n543\n500\n1,944\nLess: Loan loss provision\n(63)\n(90)\n(104)\n(86)\n(342)\nVacation ownership interest sales\n$\n341\n$\n407\n$\n439\n$\n414\n$\n1,601",
