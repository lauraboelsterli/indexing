    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Three Nuveen Nushares ETFs have declared monthly distributions. The following dates apply to the distributions:\nEx-Dividend Date May 1, 2018\nRecord Date May 2, 2018\nPayable Date May 4, 2018\nCash Distribution Ticker Exchange Fund Name Per Share NUAG NYSE Arca Nushares Enhanced Yield U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF $0.0679 NUSA NYSE Arca Nushares Enhanced Yield 1-5 Year U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF $0.0600 NUBD NYSE Arca Nushares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF $0.0573 The funds intend to pay out substantially all of their net earnings to shareholders as dividends and distributions. The funds may earn interest from debt securities. These amounts, net of expenses and taxes (if applicable), are passed along to fund shareholders as dividends. Dividends, if any, are declared and paid monthly.\nThe investor’s broker is responsible for distributing any dividends and capital gain distributions.\nFor more information about these funds as well as other Nushares ETFs, please visit Nuveen’s ETF homepage by clicking here .\nAbout Nuveen\nNuveen, the investment manager of TIAA, offers a comprehensive range of outcome-focused investment solutions designed to secure the long-term financial goals of institutional and individual investors. Nuveen has $967 billion in assets under management as of 3/31/18 and operations in 16 countries. Its affiliates offer deep expertise across a comprehensive range of traditional and alternative investments through a wide array of vehicles and customized strategies. For more information, please visit www.nuveen.com .\nThe information contained on the Nuveen website is not a part of this press release.\nSecurities offered through Nuveen Securities, LLC, member FINRA and SIPC.\nInvesting involves risk; principal loss is possible. There is no guarantee the funds’ investment objectives will be achieved. These ETFs seek to generally track the investment results of indexes; however the funds may underperform, outperform or be more volatile than the referenced indexes. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fund's portfolio will decline because of rising interest rates. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a debt security may be unable or unwilling to make interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a debt security may decline because of concerns about the issuer's ability or willingness to make such payments. For the NUSA fund, this ETF is concentrated in the financial sector . Performance of companies in the financial sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, government regulations, economic conditions, changes in interest rates and decreased liquidity in credit markets. For the NUBD fund, the strategy selects securities for inclusion based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria which may cause the fund to forgo some market opportunities available to funds that don’t use these criteria. These and other risk considerations are described in detail in the funds' prospectuses.\nBefore investing, carefully consider fund investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other information that should be read carefully, please request a prospectus or summary prospectus from your financial advisor or Nuveen at 800-257-8787 or visit www.nuveen.com .\n486449-INV-O-05/20\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501005933/en/\nNuveen\nKristyna Munoz\n254-644-1615\nkristyna.munoz@nuveen.com\nSource: Nuveen",
