    "text": "DENVER, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $191 million, or $1.05 per share. Net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $441 million, or $2.26 per share. Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $147 million, or $0.75 per share.\nFor the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc., see the note titled \"Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nFinancial and operating highlights include:\nCash flow: For the rolling twelve months ended March 31, 2018, consolidated operating cash flow was $1.405 billion, of which $993 million was from continuing operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, consolidated operating cash flow was $363 million, of which $206 million was from continuing operations. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $62 million and $447 million for the quarter and rolling twelve months ended March 31, 2018, respectively.\nOperating income and adjusted operating income: Operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $411 million. Operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $876 million, and adjusted operating income for the same period was $380 million.\nCalcimimetics: On January 1, 2018, both oral and IV forms of calcimimetics, a drug class taken by many patients with end stage renal disease to treat mineral bone disorder, became the financial responsibility of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business for Medicare patients and are included in our payment under Medicare Part B. During the pass-through period, Medicare payment for calcimimetics is based on a pass through rate of the average sales price plus approximately 4%. Previously, calcimimetics were reimbursed under Medicare Part D through traditional pharmacies, including our pharmacy business, DaVita Rx. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, calcimimetics increased revenues and patient care costs at our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business, offset in part by a decrease in revenues and costs in our other ancillary services and strategic initiatives business due to calcimimetics.\nVolume: Total U.S. dialysis treatments for the first quarter of 2018 were 7,174,026, or 92,568 treatments per day, representing a per day increase of 4.8% over the first quarter of 2017. Normalized non-acquired treatment growth in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was 3.4%.\nEffective income tax rate: Our effective income tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 23.4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This effective tax rate is impacted by the amount of third party owners' income attributable to non-tax paying entities. The effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. was 27.0% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nCenter activity: As of March 31, 2018, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 221,600 patients at 2,780 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,539 centers were located in the United States and 241 centers were located in 10 countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2018, we opened a total of 28 new dialysis centers, acquired one dialysis center, and closed one center in the United States. We also acquired six dialysis centers and closed two dialysis centers outside of the United States.\nNew revenue accounting standard: On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the cumulative effect method. Results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018 are presented under this new guidance, while prior periods remain unchanged. Due to a policy election we made allowing us to apply the new guidance only to contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018, we recognized $24 million in the first quarter of 2018 relating to Medicare bad debt revenue from 2017 dates of service.\nPending sale of DMG: As previously announced in December 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell our DMG division to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc. for $4.9 billion in cash, subject to net working capital and other customary adjustments. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and we continue to expect it to close in 2018. As a result, the DMG business is classified as held for sale and the results of operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nNew debt capacity: On March 29, 2018, we entered into an agreement to increase our borrowing capacity under our existing Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company entered into an additional $995 million Term Loan A-2 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. As of March 31, 2018 the Company had drawn an initial $452 million on Term Loan A-2. The Company has drawn and intends to continue to draw on this new debt capacity as needed for any share repurchases made prior to the closing of the sale of DMG.\nShare repurchases: During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 4,197,304 shares of our common stock for approximately $298 million at an average price of $71.09 per share. We have also repurchased 4,350,135 shares of our common stock for $276 million at an average price of $63.44 per share from April 1, 2018 through May 2, 2018. As of May 2, 2018, we have a total of approximately $545 million in outstanding Board repurchase authorizations remaining under our stock repurchase program. These share repurchase authorizations have no expiration dates.\nOutlook\nThe following forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those described herein, and actual results may vary significantly from these current forward-looking measures. The guidance below does not include the impact of currency fluctuations.\nWe still expect our Kidney Care consolidated operating income for 2018 to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. We still expect our operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2018 to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We still expect our 2018 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. to be approximately 26.5% to 27.5%.\nWe will be holding a conference call to discuss our results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 on May 3, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. To join the conference call, please dial (877) 918-6630 from the U.S. or (517) 308-9042 from outside the U.S., and provide the operator the password 'Earnings'. A replay of the conference call will be available on our website at investors.davita.com , for the following 30 days.\nNote on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs used in this press release the term \"adjusted\" refers to non-GAAP measures as follows, each as reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure as presented in the non-GAAP reconciliations in the notes to this press release: (i) for income measures, the term \"adjusted\" refers to operating performance measures that exclude certain items such as impairment charges, gains (losses) on ownership changes, restructuring charges, accruals for legal matters, recent federal tax reform legislation, and gains and charges associated with settlements; and (ii) the term \"adjusted effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc.\" represents the Company's effective tax rate excluding applicable non-GAAP items and noncontrolling owners' income that primarily relates to non-tax paying entities.\nThese non-GAAP or \"adjusted\" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered alternatives to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP.\nSpecifically, we use adjusted operating income, adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations per share attributable to DaVita Inc. to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. We also believe these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. As a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results.\nIn addition, the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income that primarily relates to non-tax paying entities and the adjusted effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income that primarily relates to non-tax paying entities, and certain non-deductible and other charges which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results. Accordingly, we believe these adjusted effective income tax rates are useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance concerning and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to DaVita Inc.\nFinally, free cash flow from continuing operations represents net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions to noncontrolling interests and capital expenditures for routine maintenance and information technology from continuing operations. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to management, investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations and other measures under GAAP, since free cash flow from continuing operations is meaningful for assessing our ability to fund acquisition and development activities and meet our debt service obligations.\nIt is important to bear in mind that these non-GAAP \"adjusted\" measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures presented herein to their most comparable GAAP measures are included at Notes 2, 3, 4 and 5 at the end of this press release.\nDaVita Inc. and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"), including statements in this release, filings with the Securities (\"SEC\"), reports to stockholders and in meetings with investors and analysts. All such statements in this release, during the related presentation or other meetings, other than statements of historical fact, are and as such are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for \" \" provided by the PSLRA. Without limiting the foregoing, statements including the words \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"will,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"forecast,\" \"guidance,\" \"outlook,\" \"goals,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify .\nThe should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties. All in this release are based on information available to us on the date of this presentation. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our guidance, the assessment of the underlying assumptions or other , whether as a result of changed circumstances, new information, future events or otherwise.\nThese could include but are not limited to statements related to our guidance and expectations for our 2018 Kidney Care consolidated operating income, our 2018 operating cash flows from continuing operations, our 2018 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc., our expectations related to our stock repurchase program, and uncertainties associated with the other risk factors set forth in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the other risks discussed in our subsequent periodic and current reports filed with the SEC from time to time.\nOur actual results could differ materially from any due to numerous factors that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of those risk factors in our SEC filings relating to:\nthe concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number of patients under such plans, including as a result of restrictions or prohibitions on the use and/or availability of charitable premium assistance, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, or our making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from charitable organizations; the extent to which the ongoing implementation of healthcare exchanges or changes in or new legislation, regulations or guidance, or enforcement thereof, including among other things those regarding the exchanges, results in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our services from and/or the number of patients enrolled in higher-paying commercial plans; a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease program or other government-based programs; the impact of the Medicare Advantage benchmark structure; risks arising from potential and proposed federal and/or state legislation or regulation, including healthcare-related and labor-related legislation or regulation; the impact of the changing political environment and related developments on the current health care marketplace and on our business, including with respect to the future of the Affordable Care Act, the exchanges and many other core aspects of the current health care marketplace; uncertainties related to the impact of federal tax reform legislation; changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns, reimbursement and payment policies and processes, or pharmaceutical pricing, including with respect to calcimimetics; legal compliance risks, such as our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the provisions of our current corporate integrity agreement and current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private-party proceedings, and restrictions on our business and operations required by our corporate integrity agreement and other current or potential settlement terms, and the financial impact thereof and our ability to recover any losses related to such legal matters from third parties; continued increased competition from large- and medium-sized dialysis providers and others who compete, or will compete directly with us; our ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance, including our ability to achieve anticipated savings from our recent restructurings; our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates, such as accountable care organizations, independent practice associations and integrated delivery systems; our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might announce or be considering, on terms favorable to us or at all, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, or to successfully expand our operations and services to markets outside the United States, or to businesses outside of dialysis; noncompliance by us or our business associates with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information; the variability of our cash flows; factors that may impact our ability to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and the timing of any such stock repurchases, including market conditions, the price of our common stock, our cash flow position, borrowing capacity and leverage ratios, and legal, regulatory and contractual requirements; the risk that we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, yet we might not be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all; risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements; impairment of our goodwill, investments or other assets; the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing, conditions and receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions of the DMG sale transaction and potential disruption in connection with the DMG sale transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the risk that laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which DMG conducts its business; the risk that the cost of providing services under DMG's agreements may exceed our compensation; the risk that reductions in reimbursement rates, including Medicare Advantage rates, and future regulations may negatively impact DMG's business, revenue and profitability; the risk that DMG may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions or successfully address competitive threats that could reduce its profitability; the risk that a disruption in DMG's healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on DMG's business operations and profitability; the risk that reductions in the quality ratings of health maintenance organization plan customers of DMG could have an adverse effect on DMG's business; and the risk that health plans that acquire health maintenance organizations may not be willing to contract with DMG or may be willing to contract only on less favorable terms.\nContact:\nJim Gustafson\nInvestor

The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using \"Consolidated EBITDA\" as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of \"Consolidated EBITDA\", pro forma for routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company's management believes the presentation of \"Consolidated EBITDA\" is useful to users to enhance their understanding of the Company's leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement. The leverage ratio calculated by the Company is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net income attributable to DaVita Inc., net income attributable to DaVita Inc. or total debt as determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company's calculation of its leverage ratio might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.\nRolling twelve\nmonths ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nNet income attributable to DaVita Inc.\n$\n394,607\nIncome taxes\n(250,715)\nInterest expense\n407,239\nDepreciation and amortization\n730,077\nImpairment charges\n942,223\nNoncontrolling interests and equity investment income, net\n193,007\nStock-settled stock-based compensation\n35,097\nGain on changes in ownership interest, net\n(17,129)\nOther\n1,552\n\"Consolidated EBITDA\"\n$\n2,435,958\nMarch 31, 2018\nTotal debt, excluding debt discount and other deferred financing costs of $62.0 million\n$\n9,563,255\nLetters of credit issued\n36,917\n9,600,172\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents including short-term investments (excluding DMG's physician owned entities cash)\n(470,088)\nConsolidated net debt\n$\n9,130,084\nLast twelve months \"Consolidated EBITDA\"\n$\n2,435,958\nLeverage ratio\n3.75x\nIn accordance with the Credit Agreement, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.50 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2018.
