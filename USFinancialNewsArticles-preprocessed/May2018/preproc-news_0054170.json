    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 9:20 AM / Updated 22 minutes ago UK energy regulator opens one-month consultation on price caps Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s energy regulator has called for comments from gas and electricity suppliers and consumers on plans to impose price caps on certain tariffs.\nOfgem says the consultation is on how it should set the price caps, how frequently to modify them and by what criteria it should judge whether they should be lifted.\nThe price caps on so-called standard variable rates were proposed by the government and will be implemented by the end of this year.\nThere about 12 million households on such tariffs, Ofgem has said, paying as much as 300 pounds more on their annual bills.\nOfgem says, in establishing a price cap, it will look at four methodologies of establishing suppliers’ costs. It will then assess whether an additional “headroom” is needed above the cost base to take into account uncertainties and risks.\nThe price cap is due to be lifted in 2020 but the government can extend its duration by 12 months on three occasions.\nThose wishing to participate in the consultation have until June 25 to reply.\nSome of Britain’s biggest energy companies have announced price increases this year, citing higher wholesale prices and the cost of government policies to support renewable energy generation.
