    "text": "EVANSVILLE, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Berry Global Group, Inc. (NYSE:BERY) today reported results for its second fiscal 2018 quarter, referred to in the following as the March 2018 quarter.\nHighlights\n(all comparisons made to the March 2017 quarter)\nNet income per diluted share increased 22 percent to $0.66. Adjusted net income per diluted share up 12 percent to $0.84. Net sales increased 9 percent to $2.0 billion. Operating income increased by 7 percent to $188 million. Operating EBITDA was $350 million, an increase of 4 percent. Increased annual cost synergy expectation relating to the Clopay acquisition to $40 million. Reaffirmed guidance for fiscal year 2018 cash flow from operations of $1,007 million and adjusted free cash flow of $630 million.\nCommenting on the quarter, Tom Salmon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Berry stated, “I am proud to report we had March quarterly records for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share of $1 billion $967 million, $350 million and $0.84, respectively.\n“We had another solid quarter of sales and earnings in our Engineered Materials division as net sales increased 6 percent and operating EBITDA improved by 17 percent compared to the prior year quarter. Within our Health, Hygiene & Specialties division, excluding South America, our nonwoven product volumes grew +2 percent compared to the prior year quarter. Further, we believe the addition of the Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc.(“Clopay”) provides an enhanced product offering that reduces cost and provides improved performance in our global hygiene films offerings. Based on our progress to-date, we are increasing our annual cost synergy target to $40 million from our original guidance of $20 million when we announced the deal. Additionally our Consumer Packaging division saw strength in foodservice products from quick service restaurants and convenience stores. We continue to partner with certain customers in our core foodservice product portfolio to address unmet needs and continue to make investments introducing technologically advanced solutions to the market at a lower cost with improved functionality and sustainability.”\nMarch 2018 Quarter Results\nConsolidated Overview March Quarter (in millions of dollars) Current Prior $ Change\n% Change Net sales $1,967 $1,806 $161 9% Operating income 188 175 13 7% The net sales increase of $161 million from the prior year quarter was primarily attributed to acquisition net sales of $106 million, selling price increases of $59 million due to the pass through of higher resin prices, and a $34 million favorable impact from foreign currency changes, partially offset by a 2% base volume decline.\nThe operating income increase of $13 million from the prior year quarter was primarily attributed to acquisition operating income of $20 million, a $13 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expense due to synergies and cost reductions, a $7 million decrease in depreciation and amortization, and a $5 million favorable impact from foreign currency changes, partially offset by a $22 million negative impact from under recovery of higher cost of goods sold, and a $7 million negative impact from lower base volumes, and a $3 million increase in business integration expenses.\nThe performance of the Company’s divisions compared with the prior fiscal year quarter is as follows:\nEngineered Materials March Quarter (in millions of dollars) Current Prior $ Change\n% Change Net sales $655 $620 $ 35 6% Operating income 94 67 27 40% Engineered Materials’ net sales increased by $35 million from the prior year quarter primarily attributed to acquisition net sales of $34 million, selling price increases of $19 million due to the pass through of higher resin prices, and a $3 million favorable impact from foreign currency changes, partially offset by a 3% base volume decline.\nThe operating income increase of $27 million from the prior year quarter was primarily attributed to acquisition operating income of $15 million, a $4 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expense, an $8 million decrease in business integration expenses, and a $3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a $4 negative million impact from lower base volumes.\nHealth, Hygiene, and Specialties March Quarter (in millions of dollars) Current Prior $ Change\n% Change Net sales $706 $597 $109 18% Operating income 41 52 (11) (21)% Health, Hygiene, and Specialties’ net sales increased $109 million from the prior year quarter primarily attributed to acquisition net sales of $72 million, selling price increases of $15 million due to the pass through of higher resin prices, and a $31 million favorable impact from foreign currency changes, partially offset by a 1% base volume decline.\nThe operating income decrease of $11 million from the prior year quarter was primarily attributed to a $13 million negative impact from under recovery of higher cost of goods sold, and an $11 million increase in business integration expenses related to the Clopay acquisition, partially offset by acquisition operating income of $5 million, a $5 million favorable impact from foreign currency changes, and a $4 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense.\nConsumer Packaging March Quarter (in millions of dollars) Current Prior $ Change\n% Change Net sales $606 $589 $17 3% Operating income 53 56 (3) (5)% Consumer Packaging’s net sales increased by $17 million from the prior year quarter primarily attributed to selling price increases of $25 million due to the pass through of higher resin prices, partially offset by a 1% base volume decline.\nThe operating income decrease of $3 million from the prior year quarter was primarily attributed to a $10 million negative impact from under recovery of higher cost of goods sold, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expense and a $3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization.\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $132 million and $927 million for the quarter and last four quarters ended March 2018, respectively. The Company’s adjusted free cash flow for the quarter and last four quarters ended March 2018 was $42 million and $526 million, respectively. Our total debt less cash and cash equivalents at the end of the March 2018 quarter was $5,735 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the four quarters ended March 31, 2018 was $1,464 million.\nRecent Development\nOn February 6, 2018, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Clopay for a purchase price of $474 million, which is preliminary, unaudited and subject to adjustment. Clopay manufactures printed breathable films and is an innovator in the development of elastic films and laminates with product offerings uniquely designed for applications used in a number of markets including: hygiene, healthcare, construction and industrial protective apparel. Clopay is operated within the Health, Hygiene and Specialties segment. The Company has revised its original cost synergy estimate and now expects to realize annual cost synergies of approximately $40 million from the completion of the Clopay transaction. To finance the purchase, the Company used the proceeds from the issuance of $500 million 4.5% second priority senior secured notes.\nOutlook\nToday we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2018 projected cash flow from operations of over $1 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $630 million, which includes the cash flow from operations partially offset by net capital expenditures of $340 million as well as $37 million of payments made under the tax receivable agreement. Additionally, within our adjusted free cash flow guidance we are assuming our fiscal 2018 cash interest costs to be $250 million, a working capital use of $40 million, cash taxes to be $130 million, including the $37 million payment made in the first fiscal quarter under the Company’s tax receivable agreement, and other cash uses of $50 million related to items such as acquisition integration expenses and costs to achieve synergies. We are extremely proud of our history and predictability, as we have exceeded our free cash flow targets every single year as a public company.\nInvestor Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today, May 3, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2018 results.

(10) Supplemental financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities, in each case determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently by other companies, including other companies in our industry, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We define “adjusted free cash flow” as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment and payments under the tax receivable agreement. We believe adjusted free cash flow is useful to an investor in evaluating our liquidity because adjusted free cash flow and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties in our industry to measure a company’s liquidity. We also believe adjusted cash flow is useful to an investor in evaluating our liquidity as it can assist in assessing a company’s ability to fund its growth through its generation of cash. We believe cash interest expense is useful to investors by providing information regarding interest expense without regard to non-cash interest expense recognition which may vary based on financing structure and accounting methods. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our lenders for debt covenant compliance purposes. We also use Adjusted EBITDA and Operating EBITDA among other measures to evaluate management performance and in determining performance-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA and Operating EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties in our industry to measure a company’s performance. We also believe EBITDA and adjusted net income are useful to an investor in evaluating our performance without regard to revenue and expense recognition, which can vary depending upon accounting methods.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005471/en/\nBerry Global Group, Inc.\nDustin Stilwell, 1+812-306-2964\nir@berryglobal.com\nSource: Berry Global Group, Inc.",
