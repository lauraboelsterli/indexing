SLE will continue to be one of the main storage solutions for Teva and the main distribution arm for the products and services Teva promotes in Israel, along with the other third party pharmaceutical companies whose products SLE distributes,” it said.\n* Teva stressed the decision was made “despite the great interest of dozens of potential buyers”.
