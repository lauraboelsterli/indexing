    "text": "ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Chesapeake Lodging Trust (NYSE:CHSP), a lodging real estate investment trust (REIT), reported today its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nComparable RevPAR : 3.5% increase for the 21-hotel portfolio over the same period in 2017. Comparable Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre Margin : 90 basis point increase to 27.9% for the 21-hotel portfolio over the same period in 2017. Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre : $37.7 million. Adjusted Corporate EBITDAre : $32.3 million. Net income available to common shareholders : $6.5 million or $0.11 per diluted common share. Adjusted FFO : $25.7 million or $0.43 per diluted common share.\n“We are pleased with our results for the first quarter, which exceeded the high end of our provided outlook for all of our key operating metrics. Our hotel managers, working with our asset management team, did a terrific job managing and controlling expenses during the quarter, leading to a 90 basis point increase in our comparable hotel EBITDAre margin,” said James L. Francis, Chesapeake Lodging Trust’s President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Francis continued, “We have seen modest strengthening in lodging demand trends over the last few months. We remain cautiously optimistic that the pro-growth political agenda will continue to positively impact lodging demand as we proceed through the year.”\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe following is a summary of the consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions, except share and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Total revenue $ 135.0 $ 134.9 Net income available to common shareholders $ 6.5 $ 5.6 Net income per diluted common share $ 0.11 $ 0.09 Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre (1) $ 37.7 $ 36.0 Adjusted Corporate EBITDAre (1) $ 32.3 $ 31.1 AFFO available to common shareholders (1) $ 25.7 $ 24.2 AFFO per diluted common share $ 0.43 $ 0.41 Weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding 59,718,986 58,995,589 (1)\nSee the discussion included in this press release for information regarding this non-GAAP financial measure.\nHOTEL OPERATING RESULTS\nThe Trust uses the term \"comparable\" to refer to metrics that include only those hotels owned for the entirety of the two periods being compared. As of March 31, 2018, the Trust owned 21 hotels. Since The Hotel Minneapolis, Autograph Collection was sold on November 8, 2017, it has been excluded from the hotel portfolio metrics for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Included in the following table are comparisons of the key operating metrics for the comparable 21-hotel portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except for ADR and RevPAR):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change Comparable Occupancy 81.0 % 76.6 % 440 bps Comparable ADR $ 213.07 $ 217.57 (2.1 )% Comparable RevPAR $ 172.55 $ 166.68 3.5 % Comparable Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre (1) $ 37,664 $ 35,744 5.4 % Comparable Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre Margin (1) 27.9 % 27.0 % 90 bps (1) See the discussion included in this press release for information regarding this non-GAAP financial measure.

The outlook assumes no future acquisitions, dispositions, or financing transactions (in millions, except RevPAR and per share amounts):\nSecond Quarter Full Year 2018 Outlook 2018 Outlook Low High Low High CONSOLIDATED: Net income available to common shareholders $ 22.4 $ 24.4 $ 62.9 $ 69.4 Net income per diluted common share $ 0.37 $ 0.41 $ 1.06 $ 1.17 Adjusted Corporate EBITDAre $ 52.6 $ 54.8 $ 175.5 $ 183.0 AFFO available to common shareholders $ 41.4 $ 43.4 $ 138.1 $ 144.6 AFFO per diluted common share $ 0.69 $ 0.73 $ 2.33 $ 2.43 Corporate cash general and administrative expense $ 2.8 $ 3.0 $ 10.8 $ 11.8 Corporate non-cash general and administrative expense $ 1.9 $ 1.9 $ 7.6 $ 7.6 Weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding 59.8 59.8 59.4 59.4 HOTEL PORTFOLIO: RevPAR $ 208.00 $ 212.00 $\n193.00\n$ 197.00 RevPAR change as compared to 2017 (1) 2.5 % 4.5 % 3.0 % 5.0 % Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre $ 57.2 $ 59.6 $ 193.8 $ 202.3 Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre Margin 35.4 % 36.2 % 32.1 % 32.9 % Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre Margin change as compared to 2017 (1) 25 bps 100 bps 50 bps 125 bps (1) The comparable 2017 period excludes results of operations for The Hotel Minneapolis, Autograph Collection, which was sold on November 8, 2017. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Trust reports the following seven non-GAAP financial measures (within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) that it believes are useful to investors as key measures of its operating performance: (1) EBITDAre, (2) Adjusted Corporate EBITDAre, (3) Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre, (4) Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre Margin, (5) FFO, (6) FFO available to common shareholders and (7) AFFO available to common shareholders. Effective January 1, 2018, the Trust began reporting EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). Adjusted Corporate EBITDAre, Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre, and Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre Margin are equivalent to the Trust's previously reported Adjusted Corporate EBITDA, Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin measures, respectively. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included in the accompanying financial tables.\nEBITDAre — The Trust calculates EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains (losses) from sales of real estate, impairment charges of depreciated real estate, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Trust believes that EBITDAre provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s operating performance, excluding the impact of the Trust’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and the Trust’s asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization).\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDAre — The Trust further adjusts EBITDAre for certain additional recurring and non-recurring items that are not in NAREIT’s definition of EBITDAre. Specifically, the Trust adjusts for hotel acquisition costs and non-cash amortization of intangible assets and liabilities, deferred franchise costs, and deferred key money, all of which are recurring items. The Trust believes that Adjusted Corporate EBITDAre provides investors another financial measure of its operating performance that provides for greater comparability of its core operating results between periods.\nAdjusted Hotel EBITDAre — The Trust further adjusts Adjusted Corporate EBITDAre for corporate general and administrative expenses, which is a recurring item. The Trust believes that Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s hotel operating performance by excluding the impact of corporate-level expenses.\nAdjusted Hotel EBITDAre Margin — Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre Margin is defined as Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre as a percentage of total revenues. The Trust believes that Adjusted Hotel EBITDAre Margin provides investors another useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s hotel operating performance.\nFFO — The Trust calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization, gains (losses) from sales of real estate, impairment charges of depreciated real estate, adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most industry investors consider presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. By excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization and gains (losses) from sales of real estate, both of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, the Trust believes that FFO provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s operating performance.\nFFO available to common shareholders — The Trust reduces FFO for preferred share dividends, write-off of issuance costs of redeemed preferred shares, and dividends declared on and earnings allocated to unvested time-based awards (consistent with adjustments required by GAAP in reporting net income available to common shareholders and related per share amounts). FFO available to common shareholders provides investors another financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s operating performance after taking into account the interests of holders of the Trust’s preferred shares and unvested time-based awards.\nAFFO available to common shareholders — The Trust further adjusts FFO available to common shareholders for certain additional recurring and non-recurring items that are not in NAREIT’s definition of FFO. Specifically, the Trust adjusts for hotel acquisition costs and non-cash amortization of intangible assets and liabilities, deferred franchise costs, and deferred key money, all of which are recurring items. The Trust believes that AFFO available to common shareholders provides investors another financial measure of its operating performance that provides for greater comparability of its core operating results between periods.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Trust will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results.
