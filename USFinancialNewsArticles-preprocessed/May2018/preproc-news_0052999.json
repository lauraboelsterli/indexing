    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (“B&W”) (NYSE: BW) confirmed that it had received a non-binding indication of interest from Steel Partners, which beneficially owns 17.8% of B&W’s outstanding common stock, to acquire B&W in a transaction in which B&W shareholders would receive between $3.00 and $3.50 per share in cash. The non-binding indication of interest assumes the acquisition of all of B&W’s businesses, including its MEGTEC and Universal businesses. B&W announced last year that it was exploring strategic options for those businesses.\nB&W said that its Board of Directors will review the Steel Partners non-binding indication of interest to determine the course of action it believes to be in the best interests of B&W and its stockholders.\nThere can be no assurance that the non-binding indication of interest will result in a transaction or on what basis or terms any transaction may occur. B&W does not intend to comment further with respect to the non-binding indication of interest unless and until further developments warrant.\nAbout B&W\nHeadquartered in Charlotte, N.C., Babcock & Wilcox is a global leader in energy and environmental technologies and services for the power and industrial markets, and has been transforming our world for 150 years.
