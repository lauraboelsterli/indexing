    "text": "GAINESVILLE, Fla. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq:AGTC), a biotechnology company conducting human clinical trials of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies for the treatment of rare diseases, today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Along with our collaboration partner, Biogen, we have achieved several critical milestones recently, including the completion of enrollment in our XLRS Phase 1/2 clinical trial and dosing the first patient in our XLRP trial,” said Sue Washer, president and CEO of AGTC. “We expect these positive trends to continue as we realize improved execution through enhanced clinical operations, clinical outreach and patient advocacy efforts.”\nRecent Highlights\nAGTC completed enrollment of the Phase 1/2 clinical study of investigational gene therapy in patients with X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), in collaboration with Biogen. AGTC dosed the first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and biologic activity of an investigational AAV-based gene therapy for the treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa caused by mutations in the RPGR gene (XLRP) and, as a result, received a $2.5M milestone payment under its collaboration agreement with Biogen. In March, AGTC sponsored a subretinal surgical summit in Chicago, Illinois, to discuss and develop best practices for subretinal administration of viral vectors in gene therapy.\nClinical Programs\nThe company has four ongoing clinical trials.\nXLRS Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial\nIn April, AGTC completed its target enrollment of 27 patients in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial for its XLRS product candidate as part of the company’s collaboration with Biogen.\nThe primary endpoint of this clinical trial is safety, and available data thus far have shown that the XLRS product candidate is generally safe and well tolerated. In addition to safety, this trial will measure biologic activity by assessing changes in visual function, retinal structure and quality of life. The company expects to provide topline six-month data across both safety and biologic activity endpoints by the end of 2018 with the primary analysis of the full twelve-month active trial data six months later.\nXLRP Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial\nIn April, the company enrolled the first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of its product candidate for XLRP and earned a milestone payment of $2.5M from Biogen as part of its ongoing collaboration. The company has two sites open for enrollment in this trial with more sites expected to open over the next several months. The company expects to complete the dose escalation portion of the XLRP trial in the first quarter of 2019.\nACHM Phase 1/2 Clinical Trials\nThe company is presently enrolling patients in two parallel Phase 1/2 clinical trials of its product candidates for achromatopsia (ACHM) caused by mutations in the two most common ACHM genes, CNGB3 and CNGA3. In the ACHM CNGB3 trial, AGTC has completed enrollment of four patients in one dose group and one patient in a new lower dose group. The company expects to complete the dose escalation portion of the CNGB3 trial in the first quarter of 2019. The ACHM CNGA3 trial has enrolled one patient.\nSurgical Summit and Clinical Infrastructure Enhancements\nAGTC has taken several steps during the past quarter to more predictably and efficiently enroll patients in all of the company’s ongoing clinical trials. This included expanding patient recruitment efforts, initiating new clinical trial sites and enhancing clinical support and infrastructure activities. In March, the company also sponsored a subretinal surgical summit that brought together highly experienced, world-renowned vitreoretinal surgeons to discuss best practices for subretinal surgery techniques used in gene therapy. Information from this summit will be used to optimize the subretinal delivery of AGTC’s ACHM and XLRP product candidates and to educate and train additional surgeons in subretinal delivery.\nAGTC-Bionic Sight Collaboration\nThrough the AGTC-Bionic Sight collaboration, the companies are pursuing the development of a novel optogenetic therapy that leverages AGTC's extensive experience in gene therapy and ophthalmology and Bionic Sight's pioneering neuro-prosthetic device and algorithm for retinal coding to develop a product to treat patients with advanced retinal disease. AGTC is working with Bionic Sight to file their IND for this product candidate, which the companies anticipate will take place in the second half of 2018.\nFinancial Results for the Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenues: Total revenue was $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $18.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $8.4 million and $31.1 million in the comparable periods in 2017. Revenue primarily consists of non-refundable upfront fees received under the company’s collaboration with Biogen, which are amortized to collaboration revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period, and development services revenue, which primarily consists of reimbursement of development activities under the Biogen Collaboration. Amortization revenue decreased $14.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to reaching the end of the XLRP service period in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and to a lesser extent, due to changes in estimates associated with the period of performance under the XLRS and preclinical programs. Development services revenue increased $1.9 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to activities associated with the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for XLRP.\nR&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $23.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.3 million and $17.9 million in the comparable periods in 2017. The increase for the nine-month period was primarily due to increased spending on general research and discovery programs, increased spending on the company's clinical programs and increased employee-related expenses associated with the hiring of additional employees to support clinical trial execution and research and development activities.\nG&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $11.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.9 million and $8.5 million in the comparable periods in 2017. The increase for the nine-month period was primarily due to increased employee-related and corporate expenses to support the company’s continued expansion.\nTax Provision: For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, the company recorded an income tax provision of $0.7 million and ($66,000), respectively. For the same periods in 2017, the income tax provision was $0.6 million and $1.8 million. The income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily driven by the apportionment of income to certain state jurisdictions where the company had not generated net operating losses (NOL’s). The income tax benefit for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to certain tax credit carryforwards becoming refundable under The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, offset by income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNet Income or Loss: The net loss was $8.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the net loss was $14.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a net loss of $1.2 million and net income $3.6 million in the comparable periods in 2017.\nFinancial Guidance: As of March 31, 2018, the company's cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to $111.8 million. The company believes these funds will be sufficient to allow AGTC to generate data from its ongoing clinical programs, to move the pre-clinical optogenetic program in collaboration with Bionic Sight into the clinic and fund the currently planned research and discovery programs for at least the next two years. The company expects total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of June 30, 2018 to be between $95 and $105 million. These projected cash balances include the $2.5 million milestone payment, less sublicensing fees of approximately 23%, associated with dosing of the first patient in the XLRP trial, but do not include the $10 million milestone payment, less such fees, associated with dosing of the fourth patient in the XLRP trial, as we are uncertain as to the timing of this milestone payment.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAGTC will host a conference call and webcast to discuss financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 today at 4:30pm ET.

Its initial focus is in the field of ophthalmology, where it has active clinical trials in X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), and achromatopsia (ACHM CNGB3 & ACHM CNGA3). In addition to its clinical trials, AGTC has preclinical programs in optogenetics, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), which is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS), and otology. The clinical-stage XLRS and XLRP programs, the discovery program in ALD and two additional ophthalmology programs are being developed in collaboration with Biogen. In addition to its product pipeline, AGTC has a significant intellectual property portfolio and extensive expertise in the design of gene therapy products including capsids, promoters and expression cassettes, as well as expertise in the formulation, manufacture and physical delivery of gene therapy products.\nAbout X-linked Retinoschisis (XLRS)\nXLRS is an inherited retinal disease caused by mutations in the RS1 gene, which encodes the retinoschisin protein. It is characterized by abnormal splitting of the layers of the retina, resulting in poor visual acuity in young boys, which can progress to legal blindness in adult men.\nAbout Achromatopsia (ACHM)\nAchromatopsia is an inherited retinal disease, which is present from birth and is characterized by the lack of cone photoreceptor function. The condition results in markedly reduced visual acuity, extreme light sensitivity causing day blindness, and complete loss of color discrimination. Best-corrected visual acuity in persons affected by achromatopsia, even under reduced light conditions, is usually about 20/200, a level at which people are considered legally blind.\nAbout X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP)\nXLRP is an inherited condition that causes boys to develop night blindness by the time they are ten and progresses to legal blindness by their early forties.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis release contains that reflect AGTC's plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs.
