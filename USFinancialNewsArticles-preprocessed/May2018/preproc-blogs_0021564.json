    "text": "0 COMMENTS A Dish Network satellite dish is shown on a residential home in Encinitas, Calif., U.S., Nov. 8, 2017. Photo: Reuters\nNew revenue accounting standards buoyed Dish Network Corp.’s net income by around 7% during its latest quarter, the company’s finance chief said Tuesday.\nThe positive impact from the regulatory shift wasn’t enough, however, to offset the exodus of subscribers that pushed the company’s first quarter profit down 2% when compared to the same period last year.\nThe new accounting rules require companies to recognize revenue from contracts at the time the promised goods and services are delivered to a customer. The uniform standard, which became effective for public companies this year, replaces a patchwork of industry-specific rules with the aim of making comparisons of revenue and fiscal performance easier. The rules also affect how and when companies report the costs associated with delivering their products and services.\n“Prior to the adoption of (the new standards), certain sales incentive payments made to third-party retailers were booked as incurred,” said Steve Swain, the chief financial officer of the company, during a conference call Tuesday. “Now these costs are deferred over the average customer life.”\nThe rule change “positively impacted DISH’s net income by $27 million,” Mr. Swain said. He also added that the company’s income tax for the period dropped 44% to $116 million mostly due to to the recently passed U.S. tax legislation, which lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% previously.\nStill, the satellite-TV company’s earnings fell to $368 million for the quarter, down from $376 million during the same period last year. Revenue for the period slipped about 6% to $3.46 billion.\nThe company reported that net pay-TV subscribers declined by 94,000 in quarter. Traditional cable-TV companies have been pressured by customers’ growing preference for streaming and on-demand services. Dish officials declined to give further comment.\nThe new accounting standards were developed and released in 2014 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and their European counterpart, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nLate last year, SEC officials said they noticed a 15% rise in inquires surrounding revenue recognition from companies as the deadline for implementation approached. Commission officials have said that they will refrain initially from issuing comment letters scrutinizing company compliance with the new standard during the early stages of enforcement.\nShare this: ACCOUNTING FASB IASB Previous The Morning Ledger: CEO Pay Hits New Postrecession High Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte Red, Yellow, Green: Building a Strong Team During a Transition First-time or newly hired CFOs need to make critical decisions early on about who to place in top positions, or risk being saddled with an underperforming team that can hamper the CFO’s ability to meet their strategic goals.
