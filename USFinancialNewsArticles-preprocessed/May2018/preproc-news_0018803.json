    "text": "SUNRISE, Fla., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Federated National Holding Company (the “Company”) (Nasdaq:FNHC) today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 2018 highlights (as measured against the same three-month period last year, except where noted):\nNet income of $7.5 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Investment losses of $0.8 million on the impact of rising interest rates and portfolio rebalancing. Annualized return on equity of 14.2%, as reported, and 15.7% excluding investment losses. Gross written premiums of $134.4 million. Quarter-end Florida homeowners’ in-force policies of approximately 265,000. 60.1% increase in non-Florida homeowners’ policies to approximately 33,500. 19.0% decrease in loss and loss adjustment expenses to $46.1 million. Since December 31, 2017, decreased staff by approximately 50 positions representing $3.0 million in annual savings as a result of exiting non-core lines of business and improved operational efficiencies within our Homeowners operations. Book value per share of $16.36 as compared to $16.29, excluding noncontrolling interest, as of December 31, 2017. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, book value per share increased 3% to $16.66 as of March 31, 2018 from $16.16 as of December 31, 2017. Repurchased 322,865 shares of common stock at an average price of $15.49, during the first quarter of 2018.\nMr. Michael H. Braun, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, said regarding the quarter’s results, “Our strong first quarter financial results demonstrate continued momentum from prior quarters and a strong start to 2018. Earnings per share of $0.64, before investment losses, were significantly higher than last year’s first quarter and up sequentially from the preceding quarters, driven by the performance of Homeowners, our core line of business. We increased our underwriting profitability with a significantly improved loss ratio and our lowest combined ratio in eight quarters as a result of our entire team's efforts, along with the 10% rate increase that went into effect last August, the benefit of which will not be fully reflected in our earnings until later this year in the third quarter. We showed solid performance in our core Florida homeowners business along with significant growth in our select coastal markets outside Florida. As we progress through the year, our focus remains on increasing the profitability of our homeowners business, capitalizing on our recent Monarch acquisition, improving our efficiencies and leveraging the strong relationships we enjoy with our trusted partner agents.”\nConsolidated\nNet income of $7.5 million or $0.58 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to net income of $2.4 million or $0.18 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2017. The current quarter results include investment losses of $1.1 million or $0.8 million after tax, which reduced net income by $0.06 per diluted share. Book value per share increased $0.07 in the first quarter of 2018, to $16.36 at March 31, 2018. Book value per share increased based on net income of $0.58 per share, as noted above, offset by the decrease in unrealized gains (losses) within other comprehensive income of $0.33 per share, driven by the impact of rising interest rates on bond valuations, and a decrease of $0.18 per share from dividends and the acquisition of Monarch’s non-controlling interests.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues remained steady at $93.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Gross written premiums decreased $11.7 million, or 8%, to $134.4 million in the quarter, compared with $146.1 million for the same three-month period last year. Gross premiums written decreased due to a $12.9 million, or 67%, decline in Automobile and, to a lesser extent, homeowners Florida offset by the growth in homeowners non-Florida. The lower premiums in Automobile was due to our decision to exit this line of business. The increase in gross premiums written in homeowners non-Florida was due to continued expansion and growth in market share, allowing us to leverage personnel and diversify insurance risk. Homeowners Florida written premiums benefited from the 10.0% rate increase that became effective on August 1, 2017. Gross premiums earned decreased $1.5 million, or 1%, to $146.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $148.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Gross premiums earned in Automobile decreased $7.3 million due to lower premiums written in Automobile over the past six to nine months, offset by $5.8 million higher gross premiums earned in Homeowners, due to higher premiums written over the past twelve to eighteen months. Ceded premiums decreased $2.0 million, or 3%, to $64.3 million in the quarter, compared to $66.3 million in the same three-month period last year, with the majority of the decline coming from lower gross earned premiums in Automobile. Ceded premiums earned included the effect of the 10% Florida-only property quota share treaty, which became effective on July 1, 2017, offset by the impact by the expiration of the 10% and 30% Florida-only property quota share treaties, which ended on July 1, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The ceded premiums associated with the 2017-2018 excess of loss reinsurance program in the first quarter of 2018 were in line with the costs associated with the 2016-2017 excess of loss reinsurance program in the first quarter of 2017. Net realized and unrealized investment losses were $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.1 million in the prior year period. The result for the first quarter of 2018 was due to the decision to re-position portions of the fixed income portfolio, including positions related to tax-free municipal securities, as well as to align our investment strategy for Monarch (\"MNIC\") with that of the rest of the Company. Direct written policy fees decreased by $1.1 million, or 24.1%, to $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $4.7 million in the same period in 2017. The decrease in direct written policy fees is driven by issuance of fewer policies as compared to the prior year period, primarily in Automobile and to a lesser extent, in Homeowners as we focus on the profitability of our business. Other income increased $1.0 million, or 23.1%, to $5.5 million in the quarter, compared with the same three-month period last year. The increase in other income was due to higher brokerage revenue, which as the result of an increase in the amount of our homeowners reinsurance placed, the type of reinsurance purchased and the commissions paid on these reinsurance agreements in place during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to during the three months ended March 31, 2017. In addition, the Company earned additional brokerage revenue related to premiums paid for the reinstatement of catastrophe reinsurance layers that were pierced by losses from Hurricane Irma.\nExpenses\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) decreased $10.8 million, or 19.0%, to $46.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $56.9 million for the same three-month period last year. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company experienced decreased losses of approximately $7.0 million in Automobile due to lower premiums earned and a lower net loss ratio as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, the homeowners Florida loss ratio benefited from earning in more of the August 1, 2017 10.0% rate increase, which resulted in approximately $1.0 million of lower losses. In the quarter, we had no severe weather events and $0.7 million of favorable loss and LAE reserve redundancy in accident year 2017. The redundancy was the result of additional ceded losses to reinsurers associated with Hurricane Irma. Lastly, in the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $5.2 million of gross losses related to severe weather events offset by $2.3 million of higher ceded losses related to homeowners' quota share treaties in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the current quarter. The net expense ratio increased 4.8%, to 44.2% in the current quarter, as compared to 39.4% in the first quarter of 2017. The increased level was driven by the homeowners non-Florida 50% profit share provision, as a result of higher profitability this quarter as compared to first quarter of 2017 and other recent quarters. The higher profitability is the direct result of continued earned premium growth, together with good loss experience in these states. The increase in the ratio was also driven by higher legal and professional fees, including audit, tax and actuarial fees, related to work associated with year-end activities. The operational expenses this quarter also include $0.4 million of severance and other related costs from management’s initiatives to exit the Automobile business as well as headcount reduction initiatives. Interest expense increased $1.0 million to $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $0.1 million in the prior year period. The increase in interest expense is the result of the Company issuing $45.0 million of senior notes in late December 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company only had $5.0 million of debt on its balance sheet.\nStock Repurchase Program\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 322,865 shares of common stock for $5.0 million at an average price per share of $15.49. To date, share repurchases in the second quarter of 2018 have been minimal.\nLine of Business Results\nHomeowners’ net income for the current quarter was $6.9 million, which included 9.6% growth in net premiums earned compared to the first quarter of 2017, the combined ratio for the current quarter was 95.9%. Additionally, the Florida homeowners 10.0% rate increase, which became effective on August 1, 2017, continues to earn in. Automobile results for the first quarter of 2018 was breakeven, representing a significant improvement in operational results versus 2017. The improvement was a direct result of the Company’s decision to close down this line of business and significantly lower gross and net premiums earned. Other’s net income of $0.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, included $1.1 million of realized losses and $1.0 million of interest expense. Additionally, net investment income continued to increase, amounting to $2.9 million for the quarter.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold an investor conference call at 9:00 AM (ET) Tuesday, May 8, 2018.
