FILE PHOTO: A Brussels Airlines Airbus A320-200 plane taxis at Lisbon's airport, Portugal April 24, 2018. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\nThe unions of pilots formally notified the airline of its intention on Friday, although there will be talks between Brussels Airlines and union representatives on Monday, the airline said.\n“We have been in talks for a few weeks. For Monday and also after Monday there are meetings planned,” a Brussels Airlines spokeswoman said. “We hope that we can find a solution to prevent a possible strike.”\nPilots want a pay hike, a better work-life balance, improved career prospects and the possibility of earlier retirement.
