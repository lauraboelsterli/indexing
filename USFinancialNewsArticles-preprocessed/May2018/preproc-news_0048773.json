The Power 100 belong to an exclusive group drawn from this larger list: women leaders whose vision and influence are key drivers of their companies’ success and help move the entire IT channel forward.\nBisnette and Herndon co-led the effort to rollout a new, innovative partner program, Riverbed Rise launched in Janury 2018. Riverbed Rise is a performance-based program designed to reward all types of partners, business models and various customer technology consumption preferences. Built on simplicity, flexibility and profitability for partners, Riverbed Rise simplifies how partners achieve and continue to maintain their status. The program uniquely adapts to multiple business models and partners' needs and rewards achievement across key strategic activities and joint sales priorities.\nBisnette’s vision and execution drove the rebuilding of Channel Sales at Riverbed, establishing a spirit of change, while driving alignment globally. Herndon played a key role in the company’s broader effort to deliver a new partner experience in 2018, including the launch of an improved, simplified partner portal that provides ample opportunities for self-service, and creating flexible incentives that partners can use to improve the bottom line, drive business development or train their personnel. Thana Balasingam has played a pivotal role in re-defining Riverbed’s go-to-market strategies in the APJ region. Key initiatives included: consolidation of all routes to market functions to cater for a diverse partner ecosystem and emerging markets; formation of the Partner Executive Advisory Council; and revamping the distribution landscape to support Riverbed’s portfolio growth. She is also active in empowering the next generation of women in leadership in her role as co-founder of Lean In Singapore and founder of Lean In Women in Technology Asia & Women in Technology Singapore ( LeanIn.Org ).\n“This accomplished group of leaders is steadily guiding the IT channel into a prosperous new era of services-led business model and deep, strategic partnerships,” said Bob Skelley, CEO of The Channel Company. “CRN’s 2018 Women of the Channel list honors executives who are driving channel progress through a number of achievements—exemplary partner programs, innovative product development and marketing, effective team-building, visionary leadership and accelerated sales growth—as well as advocacy for the next generation of women channel executives.”\n“I am thrilled to accept this honor and applaud Cindy and Uma for being recognized for their accomplishments in working with our channel partners under the success of the new Riverbed Rise program as we help customers drive new levels of digital performance into their business,\" said Bridget Bisnette, Vice President Global Channels and Commercial Sales at Riverbed. \"Together, we are working to make a positive impact on the Riverbed channel and advocate for the next generation of female leadership.”\nThe 2018 Women of the Channel and Power 100 lists will be featured in the June issue of CRN Magazine and online at www.CRN.com/wotc .\nConnect with Riverbed Partners\nLinkedIn Riverbed Partner Blog Twitter (@RiverbedPartner)\nAbout the Channel Company\nThe Channel Company enables breakthrough IT channel performance with our dominant media, engaging events, expert consulting and education, and innovative marketing services and platforms.
