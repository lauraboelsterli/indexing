Underpinned by a record level of design ins and design wins, our core business momentum continues to gain strong traction,” stated Dr. Mike Chang, chairman and CEO of the company, “While consistently delivering quality results, we have been carefully planning and investing in the capacity expansion of our Oregon fab, which we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the June quarter. The increased capacity in the second half of calendar 2018 will enable us to not only realize more of our revenue potential, but also cultivate deeper relationships with key customers. We are optimistic about the opportunities in front of us, and remain committed to execute our business plans to invigorate our earnings power.”\nBusiness Outlook for Fiscal Q4 Ending June 30, 2018\nThe following statements are based on management's current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. AOS undertakes no obligation to update these statements. The following statements contain non- and please see the section below “Use of Non- ” for more information.\nThe construction of cleanrooms of our Chongqing joint venture was completed during the March quarter. We are now in the process of increasing headcount, installing equipment, conducting qualification processes, and performing trial productions. As previously announced, a substantial portion of our pre-production costs cannot be capitalized under GAAP accounting. Because these expenses do not reflect our normal business and operations, we exclude such pre-production expenses in our non-GAAP operating expenses. The following sets forth our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018:\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $106 million to $110 million. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 26.5% plus or minus 1%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 26.8% plus or minus 1%. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes $0.3 million of estimated share-based compensation charge. Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $29.3 million plus or minus $1 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $23.0 million plus or minus $1 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses include $1.6 million to $1.8 million of estimated expenses relating to the development of our digital power team. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude an estimated share-based compensation charge of approximately $2.3 million and estimated pre-production expenses relating to the Chongqing joint venture of $4.0 million. Tax expenses are expected to be in the range of $1.0 million to $1.2 million. Loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is expected to be around $2.6 million. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding estimated pre-production expenses, this item is expected to be approximately $0.5 million. The $2.1 million difference is due to the exclusion of estimated pre-production expenses in non-GAAP operating expenses.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAOS plans to hold an investor teleconference and live webcast to discuss the fiscal third quarter of 2018 ended March 31, 2018 today, May 2, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET. To participate in the live call, analysts and investors should dial 877-312-8797 (or 253-237-1194 if outside the U.S.). To access the live webcast and the subsequent replay of the conference call, which will be available for seven days after the live call, go to the \"Events & Presentations\" section of the company's investor relations website, http://investor.aosmd.com .

These include, without limitation, statements relating to projected amount of revenue, gross margin, operating income (loss), income tax expenses, net income (loss), noncontrolling interest, and share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, tax expenses, and non-GAAP loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, our ability and strategy to develop new products, including digital power controller products, the ability to expand our sales, increase our capacity and achieve sustained growth and profitability, the pre-production phase of our Chongqing joint venture, the relationship with key customers, and other information under the section entitled “Business Outlook for Fiscal Q4 Ending June 30, 2018”. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the . These factors include, but are not limited to, the decline of the PC industry and our ability to respond to such decline; difficulties and challenges in executing our diversification strategy into different market segments; ordering pattern from distributors and seasonality; our ability to introduce or develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance, the actual product performance in volume production, the quality and reliability of our product, our ability to achieve design wins, the general business and economic conditions, the state of semiconductor industry and seasonality of our markets, our ability to maintain factory utilization at a desirable level, our ability to successfully operate our joint venture in China, and other risks as described in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 filed on September 5, 2017. Other unknown or unpredictable factors or underlying assumptions subsequently proving to be incorrect could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the . Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance, or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these . All information provided in this press release is as of today's date, unless otherwise stated, and AOS undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\nUse of Non-\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP, we disclose certain non- for our historical performance, including non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, operating income (loss), loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, net income (loss) and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"). These supplemental measures exclude share-based compensation expenses for all periods presented, income tax benefit from tax reform for the quarter of December 31, 2017, and pre-production expenses related to Chongqing joint venture during the current quarter in this press release. We also disclose certain non- in our guidance for the next quarter, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. These forecast supplemental measures exclude estimated pre-production expenses relating to our Chongqing joint venture and estimated share-based compensation expenses. We believe that these historical and forecast non- can provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items and expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results or do not reflect our normal business operations, such as the joint venture pre-production expenses. In addition, our management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and to benchmark our performance externally against competitors. Our use of non- has certain limitations in that the non- we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as non-GAAP net income (loss) or adjusted operating expenses, do not have a standardized meaning. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non- to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures both in the text in this press release and in the tables attached hereto. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. and the reconciliation of these non- to their most directly comparable U.S. .\nAbout Alpha and Omega Semiconductor\nAlpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited, or AOS, is a designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of power semiconductors, including a wide portfolio of Power MOSFET, IGBT, IPM and Power IC products.
