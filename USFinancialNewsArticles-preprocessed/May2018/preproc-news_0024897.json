ASU 2016-18 is effective January 1, 2018, but early adoption is permitted and requires retrospective application of the requirements to all previous periods presented. This change was applied on a retrospective basis to all previous periods to match the current period presentation with immaterial impact.\nCenturyLink, Inc.\nOPERATING METRICS\n(UNAUDITED)\n(In thousands)\nAs of\nAs of\nAs of\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nOperating Metrics\nConsumer broadband subscribers\n4,986\n5,044\n5,291\nCenturyLink's methodology for counting broadband subscribers may not be comparable to those of other companies.\nDescription of Non-GAAP Metrics\nPursuant to Regulation G, the company is hereby providing definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nThe following describes and reconciles those financial measures as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with those financial measures as adjusted by the items detailed below and presented in the accompanying news release. These calculations are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP. In keeping with its historical financial reporting practices, the company believes that the supplemental presentation of these calculations provides meaningful non-GAAP financial measures to help investors understand and compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nWe use the term Special items as a non-GAAP measure to describe items that impacted a period's net income and the statement of operations for which investors may want to give special consideration due to their magnitude, nature or both. We do not use the term non-recurring because while some of these items are special because they are unusual and infrequent, others may recur in future periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA ($) is defined as net income (loss) from the Statements of Income before income tax (expense) benefit, total other income (expense), non-cash impairment charges, depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock .\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (%) is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are relevant and useful metrics to provide to investors, as they are an important part of CenturyLink's internal reporting and are key measures used by Management to evaluate profitability and operating performance of CenturyLink and to make resource allocation decisions. Management believes such measures are especially important in a capital-intensive industry such as telecommunications. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (and similarly uses these terms excluding acquisition-related expenses) to compare CenturyLink's performance to that of its competitors and to eliminate certain non-cash and non-operating items in order to consistently measure from period to period its ability to fund capital expenditures, fund growth, service debt and determine bonuses. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash impairment charges and non-cash stock because of the non-cash nature of these items. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes interest income, interest expense and income taxes because these items are associated with CenturyLink's capitalization and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non-cash expenses primarily reflect the impact of historical capital investments, as opposed to the cash impacts of capital expenditures made in recent periods, which may be evaluated through cash flow measures. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the gain (or loss) on extinguishment and modification of debt and other, net because these items are not related to the primary operations of CenturyLink.\nThere are limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from CenturyLink's calculations. Additionally, this financial measure does not include certain significant items such as interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment charges, non-cash stock , the gain (or loss) on extinguishment and modification of debt and net other income (expense). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (either with or without acquisition-related expense adjustments) should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.\nUnlevered Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures, plus cash interest paid and less interest income all as disclosed in the Statements of Cash Flows or the Statements of Income. Management believes that Unlevered Cash Flow is a relevant metric to provide to investors, as it is an indicator of the operational strength and performance of CenturyLink and, measured over time, provides management and investors with a sense of the underlying business' growth pattern and ability to generate cash. Unlevered Cash Flow excludes cash used for acquisitions and debt service and the impact of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents balances.\nThere are material limitations to using Unlevered Cash Flow to measure CenturyLink's cash performance as it excludes certain material items such as payments on and repurchases of long-term debt, interest income, cash interest expense and cash used to fund acquisitions. Comparisons of CenturyLink's Unlevered Cash Flow to that of some of its competitors may be of limited usefulness since CenturyLink does not currently pay a significant amount of income taxes due to net operating loss carryforwards, and therefore, generates higher cash flow than a comparable business that does pay income taxes. Additionally, this financial measure is subject to variability quarter over quarter as a result of the timing of payments related to accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. Unlevered Cash Flow should not be used as a substitute for net change in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures as disclosed in the Statements of Cash Flows. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is a relevant metric to provide to investors, as it is an indicator of the CenturyLink's ability to generate cash to service its debt. Free Cash Flow excludes cash used for acquisitions, principal repayments and the impact of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents balances.\nThere are material limitations to using Free Cash Flow to measure CenturyLink's performance as it excludes certain material items such as principal payments on and repurchases of long-term debt and cash used to fund acquisitions. Comparisons of CenturyLink's Free Cash Flow to that of some of its competitors may be of limited usefulness since CenturyLink does not currently pay a significant amount of income taxes due to net operating loss carryforwards, and therefore, generates higher cash flow than a comparable business that does pay income taxes. Additionally, this financial measure is subject to variability quarter over quarter as a result of the timing of payments related to interest expense, accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be used as a substitute for net change in cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCenturyLink, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Integration-Related Expenses and Special Items\n(UNAUDITED)\n($ in millions)\nActual\nPro Forma\nIntegration-Related Expenses and Special Items Impacting Adjusted EBITDA\n1Q18\n1Q17\n(Gain) loss on sale of data centers and colocation business\n$\n—\n11\nOTT/Stream impairment of content commitment and hardware, software, and internal labor (1)\n42\n—\nTotal special items impacting adjusted EBITDA\n42\n11\nPlus: integration-related expenses impacting adjusted EBITDA\n65\n30\nTotal integration-related expenses and special items impacting adjusted EBITDA\n$\n107\n41\nIntegration-Related Expenses and Special Items Impacting Net Income\n1Q18\n1Q17\n(Gain) loss on sale of data centers and colocation business\n$\n—\n11\nOTT/Stream impairment of content commitment and hardware, software, and internal labor (1)\n42\n—\nTotal special items impacting net income\n42\n11\nPlus: integration-related expenses impacting net income\n71\n30\nTotal integration-related expenses and special items impacting net income\n113\n41\nIncome tax effect of integration-related expenses and special items (2)\n(30)\n(16)\nImpact of tax reform\n64\n—\nTotal integration-related expenses and special items impacting net income, net of tax\n$\n147\n25\n(1) Includes $15 million of content commitment impairment and $27 million of hardware, software, and internal labor impairment.\n(2) Tax effect calculated using the effective tax rate in place for each period, which was 38% for 2017 and 26.4% for Q1 2018.\nCenturyLink, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(UNAUDITED)\n($ in millions)\nThree Months Ending March 31, 2017\nActual\nConsolidated\nCenturyLink\nPredecessor\nLevel 3\nAdjustments\nPro Forma\nCombined\nCompany\nOPERATING REVENUES\nOperating revenues\n$\n4,209\n2,048\n(63)\n(a)\n6,194\nLess: colocation sold to Cyxtera and not retained\n—\n—\n(144)\n(144)\nTotal operating revenues\n4,209\n2,048\n(207)\n6,050\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nCost of services and products\n1,888\n1,050\n(58)\n(a)\n2,880\nSelling, general and administrative\n810\n364\n—\n1,174\nDepreciation and amortization\n880\n297\n67\n(b)\n1,244\nLess estimated net costs of colocation sold to Cyxtera and not retained\n—\n—\n(75)\n(75)\nTotal operating expenses\n3,578\n1,711\n(66)\n5,223\nOPERATING INCOME\n631\n337\n(141)\n827\nOTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME\nInterest expense\n(318)\n(132)\n(77)\n(c)\n(527)\nOther income (expense), net\n(6)\n(40)\n—\n(46)\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\n(144)\n(70)\n83\n(d)\n(131)\nNET INCOME\n$\n163\n95\n(135)\n123\nPro Forma Reconciliation for Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\nAcquisition/integration related expenses\n$\n10\n20\n—\n30\nShare-based\n$\n21\n48\n—\n69\n(a)\nAdjustment reflects the elimination of operating revenues and expenses for existing commercial transactions between CenturyLink and Level 3 and elimination of Level 3 deferred revenues.\n(b)\nDepreciation expense decreased on Level 3's property, plant and equipment resulting from decreased PP&E fair value.

The provision of these ranges is in no way meant to indicate that CenturyLink is explicitly or implicitly providing an outlook on those GAAP components of the reconciliation. In order to reconcile the non-GAAP financial metric to GAAP, CenturyLink has to use ranges for the GAAP components that arithmetically add up to the non-GAAP financial metric. While CenturyLink feels reasonably comfortable about the outlook for its non-GAAP financial metrics, it fully expects that the ranges used for the GAAP components will vary from actual results. We will consider our outlook of non-GAAP financial metrics to be accurate if the specific non-GAAP metric is met or exceeded, even if the GAAP components of the reconciliation are different from those provided in an earlier reconciliation.\nCenturyLink, Inc.\n2018 OUTLOOK\n(UNAUDITED)\n($ in millions)\nAdjusted EBITDA Outlook\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2018\nRange\nLow\nHigh\nNet income\n$\n470\n950\nIncome tax expense\n170\n310\nTotal other expense\n2,300\n2,200\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n5,300\n5,100\nNon-cash\n210\n190\nIntegration-related expenses\n300\n200\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n8,750\n8,950\nFree Cash Flow Outlook\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2018\nRange\nLow\nHigh\nNet cash provided by operating activities excluding integration costs\n$\n7,050\n7,150\nCapital expenditures, excluding: integration projects\n(3,900)\n(3,800)\nFree cash flow\n$\n3,150\n3,350\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/centurylink-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300645719.html\nSOURCE CenturyLink, Inc.",
