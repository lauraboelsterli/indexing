    "text": "May 18 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s on Thursday reinstated its ‘B/B’ long- and short-term credit ratings on Poland-based GetBack SA and lowered them to ‘D/D’, considering the company to be in a general default.\n“We note that the promptness of the possible restructuring agreement might be crucial for GetBack’s survival, given the potential for rapid value deterioration of its main asset, distressed debt,” S&P said in a statement.\nThe company’s ratings will not be raised until it resumes payments on its obligations, S&P said.\nReporting by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ",
