    "text": "CLINTON, Conn., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nRevenues Increase 9 Percent PURA and MPUC Regulatory Applications Filed for Merger of Equals With SJW Group PURA Decision on Connecticut Water Settlement Agreement Expected\nConnecticut Water Service, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTWS) announced a net loss of $1.2 million or $0.10 loss per basic common share for the first quarter of 2018 on total revenues of $26.4 million. Total revenues include revenues generated by the Company’s three business segments: Water Operations, Service and Rentals, and Real Estate. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company had net income of $4.1 million or $0.36 per basic common share, on total revenues of $24.2 million.\nThe $5.3 million decrease in net income was driven primarily through a non-recurring tax benefit in the first quarter of 2017 that was related to the release of previously reserved tax liabilities for the Maine Water Company (Maine Water), and costs in 2018 related to the merger of equals with SJW Group that was announced on March 15, 2018. Excluding these two items, net income was about $900,000 lower than in 2017.\nResults were also driven by increased operating expenses, depreciation, and less Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) benefit. The Company’s $36.3 million Rockville Water Treatment Facility was placed into service during the second quarter of 2017 and was the primary reason for the reduced AFUDC benefit. The Company negotiated a Settlement Agreement (Agreement) in February 2018 with the Office of Consumer Counsel that would allow for the recovery of that infrastructure investment through an increase on customer bills. The Connecticut Public Utility Regulatory Authority (PURA) has approved the Company’s request for a limited rate reopener to consider the Agreement and held public hearings on the Agreement in April. Additional provisions of the Agreement are noted later in this news release.\nOperating revenues increased $2.4 million from the same quarter of the previous year, primarily driven by the 2017 acquisitions of the Heritage Village and Avon water companies in Connecticut, increased Water Infrastructure and Conservation Adjustment (WICA) and Water Infrastructure Charge (WISC) surcharges, and a general rate increase in Maine Water’s Biddeford-Saco Division, which became effective in December 2017.\nDavid C. Benoit, president and CEO of Connecticut Water, says the first-quarter of 2018 laid the groundwork for increased growth and customer satisfaction. Mr. Benoit stated, “Our pending merger of equals with SJW Group will create the third-largest investor-owned water and wastewater utility in the nation. Our shareholders, who have invested in us because our only business is water, wastewater, and related services, will benefit from being part of a larger combined company that shares our mission, vision and values — including an unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction and the communities we serve.”\nMerger of Equals With SJW Group\nOn March 15, 2018, CTWS and SJW Group (NYSE: SJW) announced that both companies’ boards of directors had unanimously approved a definitive agreement to combine through a merger of equals to create the third-largest investor-owned water and wastewater utility in the United States, based on pro forma enterprise value and combined rate base. The increased scale and more diverse geographic footprint of the new organization provide the opportunity for investments in service and reliability that can enhance value for shareholders, customers and communities. Additional information regarding the transaction is available at www.sjw-ctws.com .\nRecent Developments\nApplications for the approval of Connecticut Water’s merger of equals with SJW Group were filed with PURA and the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) on May 4, 2018.\nOn April 30, 2018, Connecticut Water and SJW Group jointly announced that the Federal Trade Commission has granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, with respect to the companies’ merger of equals.\nThe companies anticipate the transaction to close during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nSettlement Agreement\nOn February 7, 2018, the Connecticut Water Company (Connecticut Water) filed a motion with PURA to reopen its last rate decision for the purpose of considering a Settlement Agreement negotiated with the Office of Consumer Counsel. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement:\nConnecticut Water would begin to recover through increased rates the $36.3 million of plant in service with Connecticut Water’s generational investment in clean drinking water at the newly upgraded Rockville Drinking Water Treatment Facility. The current WICA surcharges on customers’ bills would be rolled into base rates and the surcharge reset to zero. Connecticut Water would not increase its base rates until January 2020, at the earliest, with an exception for extraordinary circumstances.\nA final decision is expected to be issued by PURA no later than July 11, 2018, with rates effective soon thereafter.\nWICA and WISC\nMaine Water files for WISC increases with the MPUC on a system-by-system basis. Six WISC applications filed since the fourth quarter of 2017 have been approved in 2018, and the WISC surcharge in the Biddeford Saco division has been reset to zero with the approval of the general rate case in December 2017. The current overall approved cumulative WISC surcharge for all divisions of Maine Water is 6.9 percent. The maximum WISC surcharge allowed in Maine ranges from 10 to 20 percent, depending on the size of the water system.\nThe current WICA charge is 9.98 percent for Connecticut Water and 7.51 percent for Avon Water. Heritage Village Water has not filed for a WICA surcharge.\nWICA and WISC allow for recovery of eligible infrastructure replacements on a semiannual basis. Through WICA and WISC, Connecticut Water and Maine Water combined have replaced more than 130 miles of aging water main and pump stations, constructed storage tanks, and funded treatment improvements.\nAbout CTWS\nCTWS is one of the 10 largest U.S.-based publicly traded water utilities, and is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol CTWS. Through its regulated utility subsidiaries, CTWS serves more than 135,000 water customers, or more than 425,000 people in 80 communities across Connecticut and Maine, and more than 3,000 wastewater customers in Southbury, Connecticut.\nSince January 2012, CTWS has grown its customer base by more than 45 percent, or more than 44,000 customers, primarily through large acquisitions in Maine in 2012 and the acquisitions of Heritage Village Water Company and Avon Water Company in Connecticut in 2017.\nAdditional information regarding results, performance or achievements noted in this news release is available in CTWS’s Form 10-Q that was filed with the SEC today.
