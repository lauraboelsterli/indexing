Liverpool officials are involved in ongoing discussions with the Italian authorities aimed at ensuring fans enjoy the best possible experience with safety and security at the top of the club’s agenda as always,” the Premier League club said on their website.\nThe authorities will hold back Liverpool supporters for an extended period following the conclusion of the game, after which the shuttle buses, under full police protection, will carry the fans to Villa Borghese.\nPre-arranged taxis and coaches will be made available for fans once they reach Villa Borghese. Supporters have been advised against walking into the city.\nLiverpool, UEFA and Roma condemned the perpetrators of the attack outside Anfield after two men from Rome were arrested and charged with violent disorder for the incident.
