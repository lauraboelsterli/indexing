    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc. (NYSE: TRTX) (“TRTX” or the “Company”) reported its operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the first quarter of 2018, GAAP net income was $25.1 million, earnings per diluted common share was $0.42, and book value per common share at March 31, 2018 was $19.82.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\n-- Generated GAAP net income of $25.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted common share, based on a weighted average share count of 60.4 million common shares\n-- Closed seven new loan commitments totaling $579.2 million, with an average loan size of $82.7 million, and an initial unpaid principal balance of $516.7 million\n-- Closed a $932.4 million collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) to finance one first mortgage whole loan and 25 pari passu first mortgage loan participation interests at a current advance rate of 80.0% and a weighted average coupon of LIBOR plus 1.08%\n-- Declared cash dividends of $25.3 million, or $0.42 per common share, representing an 8.4% annualized dividend yield based on the quarter end closing share price of $19.89\nGreta Guggenheim, Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Origination volume and credit quality during the first quarter represents a solid start to our year. Additionally, we reduced our cost of funds by approximately 40 bps compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily by issuing a $932.4 million CRE CLO that provides low cost, matched-term funding for just over 25 percent of our high-quality loan portfolio. Our performance in a hotly competitive market demonstrates the importance of our long term lending, credit and capital markets experience, and our affiliation with TPG.\"\nThe Company issued a detailed supplemental presentation detailing its first quarter 2018 operating results, which can be viewed at http://investors.tpgrefinance.com/ .\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST INFORMATION\nThe Company will host a conference call tomorrow, May 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss its first quarter operating results.
