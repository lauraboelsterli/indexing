    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 9:10 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Safe-standing to be debated in British Parliament on June 25 Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - A possible introduction of safe-standing section in the Premier League and Championship will be discussed in British Parliament on June 25.\nThe decision follows a successful petition, signed by over 110,000 people, to the British government.\nAll-seater stadiums became mandatory in England’s top two divisions following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 when 96 Liverpool fans were killed in a crush at an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest.\nThe league’s governing body is keen on re-opening discussions about the matter.\nWest Bromwich Albion had offered to run a pilot scheme at the Hawthorns that would have meant 3,600 seats in the Smethwick End were converted into ‘rail-seats’, but their application was rejected by the government last month.
