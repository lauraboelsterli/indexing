    "text": "PARIS, May 30 (Reuters) - The United States and the European Union could still discuss opening up their markets more even if Washington applied import tariffs on EU steel and aluminium, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Wednesday.\nEU leaders agreed earlier this month to offer the prospect of trade discussions with the United States, but only if Washington removes its threat to impose tariffs. The bloc has a temporary exemption from those tariffs, which expires on Friday.\n“There can be negotiations with or without tariffs in place. There are plenty of tariffs the EU has on us. It’s not that we can’t talk just because there’s tariffs,” Ross told a panel at the OECD.
