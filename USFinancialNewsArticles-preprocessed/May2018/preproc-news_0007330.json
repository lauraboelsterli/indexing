GAAP operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $86.8 million, or 20.6 percent of GAAP revenue, compared to $89.7 million, or 22.0 percent of GAAP revenue, in 2017's first quarter, representing a 3.2 percent decrease.\nGAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $51.3 million, up 6.4 percent compared to $48.1 million in 2017's first quarter. On a fully diluted GAAP basis, earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 were $0.24 per share, up 4.3 percent compared to $0.23 per share on a fully diluted GAAP basis in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted Non-GAAP Results (defined in Notes 1-4 below)\nAdjusted revenue was $434.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, up 6.1 percent compared to $409.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $171.9 million, or 39.6 percent of adjusted revenue, compared to $155.4 million, or 38.0 percent of adjusted revenue, in 2017's first quarter, representing a 10.6 percent increase.\nAdjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $114.8 million, up 23.6 percent compared to $92.9 million in 2017's first quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 were $0.53 per share, up 20.5 percent compared to $0.44 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nAdjusted net income was $114.8 million for Q1 2018, increasing 23.6 percent from Q1 2017's adjusted net income of $92.9 million. Q1 2018 net cash provided by operating activities was $69.9 million, an increase of 20.8 percent. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA increased 10.5 percent to $178.7 million in Q1 2018. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin was 41.1 percent for the quarter, up over 160 basis points from Q1 2017's 39.5 percent adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin. SS&C raised $7.4 billion in cash from debt and $1.4 billion in cash from the sale of our common stock to primarily fund the acquisition of DST Systems, which we closed on April 16, 2018, and refinance existing debt.\n\"SS&C had a great start to 2018. We announced the acquisition of DST Systems in January and closed on April 16, 2018. We grew adjusted revenue over 6 percent, confirming the strength of our global business\" said Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We are delighted with our results, which we accomplished alongside the announcement, financing, and ultimately closing of our largest acquisition to date.\"\nOperating Cash Flow\nSS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $69.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $57.9 million for the same period in 2017, representing a 20.8 percent increase. SS&C ended the first quarter with $74.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,030.9 million in gross debt, for a net debt balance of $1,956.8 million. SS&C's consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement stood at 2.74 times consolidated EBITDA as of March 31, 2018.\nGuidance\nQ2 2018\nFY 2018\nAdjusted Revenue ($M)\n$895.0 – $915.0\n$3,344.0 – $3,404.0\nAdjusted Net Income ($M)\n$131.6 – $140.8\n$546.7 – $575.3\nCash from Operating Activities ($M)\n–\n–\nCapital Expenditures (% of revenue)\n–\n–\nDiluted Shares (M)\n249.4 – 248.6\n243.5 – 243.0\nEffective Income Tax Rate (%)\n25%\n25%\nSS&C does not provide reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Net Income to comparable GAAP measures, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. SS&C is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures. These items include acquisition transactions and integration, foreign exchange rate changes, as well as other non-cash and other adjustments as defined under the Company's Credit agreement, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted consolidated EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures. See the accompanying notes to the attached Condensed Consolidated Financial Information for the reconciliations and definitions for each of these non-GAAP measures and the reasons our management believes these measures provide useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations.\nEarnings Call and Press Release\nSS&C's Q1 2018 earnings call will take place at 5:00 p.m. eastern time today, May 1, 2018.
