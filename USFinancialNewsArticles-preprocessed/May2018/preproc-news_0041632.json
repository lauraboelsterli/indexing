    "text": "Growth in EU Sales & Recurring Airtime Revenue Results in Highest Quarterly Sales Since Inception\nFirst Quarter Revenue Increases by 20.7% from 2017\nAVENTURA, Fla., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orbital Tracking Corp. (OTCQB:TRKK) (“Orbital Tracking” or the \"Company\") today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nDuring the quarter, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Global Telesat Communications Ltd. (“GTC”) and Orbital Satcom Corp . (“OSC”), achieved combined revenue growth of 20.7%, as compared to the same period in the previous year, as well as the largest amount of revenue reported in any prior quarter. The main factors behind this growth were record levels of e-commerce sales in the EU, a further increase in recurring revenue for monthly airtime customers, and an improvement in exchange rates for sales reported in US$.\nNotable orders received by the Company during the quarter in terms of sales revenue included the supply of satellite terminals and airtime for use by a disaster preparedness organization and annual renewal of the UK’s Forestry Commission’s 750+ SPOT Gen3 messaging plans. The Company continued to attract a record number of recurring revenue customers who have opted to buy monthly or annual recurring airtime plans through the Company.\nThe Company further expanded its reach into new markets through the opening of its first e-commerce storefront in Australia.\nIn addition to a record quarter for sales, the Company reported a decrease in total operating expenses as compared to the same period in the previous year. Total operating expenses are inclusive of selling, general and administrative expenses, professional fees, salaries, wages and payroll taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n“Having recently reported record annual revenue as a result of a consolidated annual sales increase of 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017, we are now pleased to report our largest grossing sales quarter for our first quarter of 2018,” said David Phipps, Chief Executive Officer of Orbital Tracking Corp. “As we continue to grow our product range, expand our international presence, and increase our recurring revenue customer base, we expect our trend of overall growth in consolidated income to continue. Furthermore, we are pleased to report that this revenue growth has been achieved without increasing total operating costs.”\nFirst Quarter 201 8 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, consolidated revenues reached record levels, as compared to the same period in the previous year, increasing $285,606 or 20.7% to $1,667,938, as compared to $1,382,332 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nComparable revenue for the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Global Telesat Communications, increased 7.5% in its home currency, GBP, for the three months ended March 31,2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. When converted to US$ for reporting purposes, total sales for Global Telesat Communications were $1,136,716 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $941,681 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $195,035 or 20.7%.\nComparable revenue for the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Orbital Satcom Corp. was $531,222 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $440,651 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $90,571 or 20.6%.\nThe Company recorded a net loss before income tax of approximately $145,458 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a loss of $219,262, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in the loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $64,518, or 20.5% and a decrease in professional fees of $39,667 or 26.6%, offset by an increase in wages of $27,769 or 18.2%. As a percentage of sales, wages decreased from 11.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 10.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nAbout Orbital Tracking Corp.\nOrbital Tracking Corp. provides satellite based tracking, services as well as mobile voice and data communications services globally via satellite to the commercial and government users.
