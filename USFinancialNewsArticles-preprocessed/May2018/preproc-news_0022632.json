    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The Latest on three black people who were questioned after leaving an Airbnb rental (all times local):\n4:21 p.m.\nA lawsuit is planned by three black people briefly detained by police in Southern California after a 911 caller wrongly reported they might be burglars.\nThe Rialto Police Department said Monday that it has received notice of legal action by the three, who were leaving an Airbnb rental with their luggage when a neighbor called police on April 30.\nPolice said they were polite during the 22-minute interaction.\nBut one of the renters, Kells Fyffe-Marshall, wrote on social media that they were \"surrounded\" by seven police cars and told to put up their hands. She says a helicopter was tracking them and an officer accused them of lying.\nThe encounter is the latest example of friction between law enforcement and minorities. Last month, two black men in Philadelphia were arrested after a Starbucks employee called police because they hadn't bought anything.\nThis story corrects ext. headline to say three black people were detained, not three black women\n2:59 p.m.\nA lawsuit is planned by three black people briefly detained by police in Southern California after a 911 caller wrongly reported they might be burglars.\nThe Rialto Police Department said Monday that it has received notice of legal action by the three, who were leaving an Airbnb rental with their luggage when a neighbor called police on April 30.\nPolice said they were polite during the 22-minute interaction.\nBut one of the renters, Kells Fyffe-Marshall, wrote on social media that they were \"surrounded\" by seven police cars and told to put up their hands.\nThe encounter is the latest example of friction between law enforcement and minorities.
