    "text": "SEATTLE, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tableau Software (NYSE: DATA), the leading analytics platform, today announced that it has appointed veteran technologist Mark Nelson as Executive Vice President of Product Development effective May 21, 2018. He will be responsible for leading the global engineering team at Tableau, helping the company continue to broaden and deepen its industry leading analytics platform to support customers globally. Mark has more than 25 years of experience in software development, engineering, and SaaS infrastructures at AT&T, Informix, Oracle and most recently at Concur, where he served as Chief Technology Officer.\n\"We are thrilled to welcome Mark to the Tableau team,\" said Adam Selipsky, CEO of Tableau. \"His extensive experience in software development and his passion for smart, customer-centric technology will help accelerate Tableau's pace of innovation and will serve to provide our customers with a cutting edge, industry-leading analytics platform that will help everyone from the sophisticated analyst to the causal user see and understand data.\"\nAt Concur, Mark was responsible for all aspects of product development as well as hosting operations for their SaaS services and Concur's internal IT function. Previously, he spent more than 16 years as Vice President and Architect at Oracle, where his last role was responsible for much of Oracle's cloud infrastructure. Nelson's extensive cloud computing expertise also affords him a role as an Advisory Board Member for SkyTap, a cloud provider focused on transforming traditional enterprise applications. He holds a B.S. in General Engineering and an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\"We are experiencing an explosion of data and the opportunity around using it effectively is not only exciting, but it's where the world is headed,\" said Nelson. \"As a former customer, I am a true believer in Tableau, using it every day over the last few years. I know there's nothing like the Tableau platform and I'm excited not only to help build an innovative product, but to also bring my expertise in engineering at scale - both technically and organizationally - to help grow the platform and the company. I look forward to working with the team towards making a difference in the world with data.\"\nIn addition, Andrew Beers has been named to the new role of Chief Technology Officer, where he will focus on Tableau's long term technology roadmap and emerging technology areas such as machine learning, automated insights and data architectures.\nAbout Tableau Software\nTableau (NYSE: DATA) helps people see and understand data and explore with limitless visual analytics.
