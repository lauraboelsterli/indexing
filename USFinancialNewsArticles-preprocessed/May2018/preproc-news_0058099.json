Former senior International Monetary Fund (IMF) official Carlo Cottarelli speaks to the media after a meeting with Italy's President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy, May 28, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile\nCottarelli, who has been trying to put together a stop-gap government to lead the country to early elections, had been expected to meet Mattarella formally, which led to expectations that he was ready to give the head of state a list of ministers. The source gave no details on why the informal talks were necessary. Reporting By Massimiliano Di Giorgio; writing by Philip Pullella",
