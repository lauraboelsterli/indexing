    "text": "ZURICH, May 8 (Reuters) - LafargeHolcim reported a 13 percent fall in first quarter earnings as the worldâ€™s largest cement maker embarks on its new strategy under recently-appointed Chief Executive Jan Jenisch.\nThe Swiss company said recurring earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell to 700 million Swiss francs ($697.70 million) during the first quarter, down from 808 million Swiss francs a year earlier.\nWhen adjusted for currency effects and the asset sales, the decline was 7.7 percent.\nRevenue was flat at 5.83 billion francs, said LafargeHolcim, which changed its reporting practices and no longer publishes net profit for its first quarter.
