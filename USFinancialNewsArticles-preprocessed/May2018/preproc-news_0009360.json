Adjusted net earnings in Q1’18 were $36.8 million or $0.52 per share, compared to $45.1 million, or $0.64 per share in Q4’17 and $22.7 million, or $0.32 per share in Q1’17.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $81.1 million on sales of $527.6 million in Q1’18 versus $89.5 million on sales of $532.8 million in Q4’17.\nNotable items in the quarter included:\n• Higher Lumber Prices\nThe key benchmark prices improved quarter-over-quarter with the SYP Composite, Western SPF Composite and KD H-F Stud 2x4 9’ increasing by US$37, US$33 and US$63 per mfbm, respectively. Interfor’s average lumber selling price increased $38 from Q4’17 to a record $688 per mfbm.\n• Increased Production/Reduced Shipments\nTotal lumber production was 666 million board feet or 11 million board feet more than the prior quarter. Production in the U.S. South region increased to 302 million board feet from 296 million board feet in the preceding quarter. The B.C. and U.S. Northwest regions accounted for 218 million board feet and 146 million board feet, respectively, compared to 219 million board feet and 140 million board feet in Q4’17, respectively.\nTotal lumber shipments were 648 million board feet, including agency and wholesale volumes, or 38 million board feet lower than Q4’17. This reduction was the result of industry-wide logistics issues, particularly due to weather-impacted rail constraints in B.C.\n• Continued Financial Flexibility\nNet debt ended the quarter at $127.1 million, or 12.4% of invested capital, resulting in available liquidity of $444.6 million.\nInterfor generated $75.5 million of cash from operations before changes in working capital, or $1.08 per share. Total cash generated from operations was $18.5 million after considering an increase in working capital, including a $34.0 million increase in inventories, a $10.9 million increase in accounts receivable due primarily to higher lumber prices, and the payment of annual employee incentive compensation.\nCapital spending was $18.1 million on a mix of high-return discretionary, maintenance and woodlands projects.\n• Softwood Lumber Duties\nInterfor expensed $12.9 million of duties in the quarter, representing the full amount of countervailing (“CV”) and anti-dumping (“AD”) duties incurred on its Canadian shipments of softwood lumber into the U.S. at a combined mandated final rate of 20.23%.\n(1) Refer to Adjusted EBITDA and Operating cash flow per share in the Non-GAAP Measures section\nStrategic Capital Plan\nInterfor continues to make progress on its multi-year strategic capital plan that involves a number of discretionary projects designed to capture the opportunities within its current operating platform and to pursue opportunities for further growth.\nThe previously announced projects at the Company’s Meldrim and Monticello sawmills are on track for completion in Q1’19.\nThe Company completed the installation of an autograding system at its Perry, Georgia sawmill in Q1’18.\nOther large capital projects to enhance existing operations are continuing to be advanced from an engineering and feasibility standpoint. In particular, the Company is refining plans for a series of substantial capital investment opportunities at three of its U.S. South sawmills. It is expected that these projects could be completed between 2019 and 2021. These projects will be subject to Board approval in the normal course.\nThe greenfield sawmill opportunity in the Central Region of the U.S. South is in the final stages of assessment with a decision on the project expected by mid-2018.\nFinancial and Operating Highlights (1)\nFor the three months ended Mar. 31\nMar. 31\nDec. 31\nUnit 2018\n2017\n2017\nFinancial Highlights (2) Total sales $MM 527.6 456.8 532.8 Lumber $MM 445.9 389.6 446.0 Logs, residual products and other $MM 81.7 67.2 86.8 Operating earnings $MM 46.5 30.4 47.9 Net earnings $MM 33.0 19.7 36.2 Net earnings per share, basic $/share 0.47 0.28 0.52 Adjusted net earnings (3) $MM 36.8 22.7 45.1 Adjusted net earnings per share, basic (3) $/share 0.52 0.32 0.64 Operating cash flow per share (before working capital changes) (3) $/share 1.08 0.85 1.19 Adjusted EBITDA (3) $MM 81.1 60.3 89.5 Adjusted EBITDA margin (3) % 15.4 % 13.2 % 16.8 % Total assets $MM 1,410.1 1,318.8 1,353.0 Total debt $MM 257.9 325.4 250.9 Net debt to invested capital (3) % 12.4 % 27.6 % 12.3 % Return on invested capital (3) % 32.4 % 22.0 % 36.4 % Operating Highlights Lumber production million fbm 666 640 655 Total lumber sales million fbm 648 645 686 Lumber sales - Interfor produced million fbm 635 624 666 Lumber sales - wholesale and commission million fbm 13 21 20 Lumber - average selling price (4) $/thousand fbm 688 604 650 Average USD/CAD exchange rate (5) 1 USD in CAD 1.2647 1.3238 1.2713 Closing USD/CAD exchange rate (5) 1 USD in CAD 1.2894 1.3322 1.2545\nNotes: (1) Figures in this table may not equal or sum to figures presented elsewhere due to rounding.

Net debt at March 31, 2018 was $127.1 million, or 12.4% of invested capital, representing a decrease of $179.6 million from March 31, 2017, and an increase of $7.8 million from December 31, 2017. The majority of the increase in net debt in Q1’18 is as a result of the weakened Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar as all debt held was denominated in U.S. Dollars.\nFor the three months ended Mar. 31,\nDec. 31,\nMar. 31,\nThousands of Dollars 2018 2017 2017 Net debt Net debt, period opening, CAD $ 119,300 $ 177,787 $ 289,551 Net drawing (repayment) on credit facilities, CAD (1 ) (1 ) 19,250 Impact on U.S. Dollar denominated debt from (strengthening) weakening CAD 6,981 1,301 (2,704 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents, CAD 784 (59,787 ) 579 Net debt, period ending, CAD $ 127,064 $ 119,300 $ 306,676 Net debt components by currency U.S. Dollar debt, period opening, USD $ 200,000 $ 200,000 $ 230,000 Net repayment on credit facilities, USD - - 5,979 U.S. Dollar debt, period ending, USD 200,000 200,000 235,979 Spot rate, period end 1.2894 1.2545 1.3322 U.S. Dollar debt expressed in CAD 257,880 250,900 314,371 Canadian Dollar debt, CAD - - 4,987 Canadian Dollar operating line, CAD - - 6,009 Total debt, CAD 257,880 250,900 325,367 Cash and cash equivalents, CAD (130,816 ) (131,600 ) (18,691 ) Net debt, period ending, CAD $ 127,064 $ 119,300 $ 306,676 As at March 31, 2018, the Company had net working capital of $316.0 million and available liquidity of $444.6 million, including cash and borrowing capacity on operating and term line facilities.\nThese resources, in addition to cash generated from operations, will be used to support capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and debt servicing commitments. We believe that Interfor will have sufficient liquidity to fund operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Resources\nThe following table summarizes Interfor’s credit facilities and availability as of March 31, 2018:\nRevolving Senior U.S. Operating Term Secured Operating Thousands of Canadian Dollars Line Line Notes Line Total Available line of credit $ 65,000 $ 200,000 $ 257,880 $ 64,470 $ 587,350 Maximum borrowing available $ 65,000 $ 200,000 $ 257,880 $ 64,470 $ 587,350 Less: Drawings - - 257,880 - 257,880 Outstanding letters of credit included in line utilization 12,168 - - 3,172 15,340 Unused portion of facility $ 52,832 $ 200,000 $ - $ 61,298 314,130 Add: Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 130,453 Available liquidity at March 31, 2018 $ 444,583 As of March 31, 2018, the Company had commitments for capital expenditures totaling $29.5 million.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis release makes reference to the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted net earnings per share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net debt to invested capital, Operating cash flow per share (before working capital changes) and Return on invested capital which are used by the Company and certain investors to evaluate operating performance and financial position. These non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to figures as reported in the Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS:\nFor the three months ended Mar. 31, Mar. 31,\nDec. 31,\nThousands of Canadian Dollars except number of shares and per share amounts 2018 2017 2017 Adjusted Net Earnings Net earnings $ 32,976 $ 19,667 $ 36,196 Add: Restructuring costs and capital asset write-downs 236 345 7,422 Other foreign exchange loss (gain) (111 ) 181 (412 ) Long term incentive compensation expense 4,858 3,593 3,110 Other expense 178 189 995 Post closure wind-down costs and losses 4 8 5 Income tax effect of above adjustments (1,374 ) (1,249 ) (2,260 ) Adjusted net earnings $ 36,767 $ 22,734 $ 45,056 Weighted average number of shares -
