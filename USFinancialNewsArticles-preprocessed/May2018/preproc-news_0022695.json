It is precisely this kind of spirit with which FC Barcelona has always been identified.”\nMandela was born on July 18, 1918.\nThe friendly is sandwiched between Barca’s penultimate Liga game away to Levante on May 13 and their final game at home to Real Sociedad on May 20.\nErnesto Valverde’s side clinched a 25th Liga title on April 29 and the King’s Cup on April 21 and are bidding to become the first team since 1933 to complete a Spanish top flight season without losing a game.
