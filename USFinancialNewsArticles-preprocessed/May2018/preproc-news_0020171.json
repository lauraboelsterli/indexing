    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 12:34 AM / Updated 15 hours ago Katy Perry and Taylor Swift put end to their bad blood\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Katy Perry sent Taylor Swift a real olive branch on Tuesday, appearing to end a long-running feud between two of pop music’s biggest stars. A combination photo shows singers Taylor Swift (L) and Katy Perry (R) in Beverly Hills and in Inglewood, California, U.S., February 28, 2016 and August 27, 2017 respectively. REUTERS/Danny Moloshok/File Photos\nSwift, 28, posted a video of the package, which also included a letter from Perry, on her Instagram stories account with the caption “Thank You Katy” and a double heart emoji.\nThe fight, which started as a dispute over back up dancers, has dominated the personal and professional lives of the two singers for more than four years and played out in their songs.\nSwift’s 2014 single “Bad Blood” was believed to be directed at Perry. Perry, 33, described her 2017 single, “Swish Swish,” as “a great anthem for people to use whenever somebody’s trying to hold you down or bully you.”\nAn attempt by Perry a year ago to bury the hatchet, when she apologized for past actions and called Swift a “fantastic singer,” was met with silence from Swift.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nOn Tuesday however, the singer said in her Instagram story, “I just got to my dressing room and found this actual olive branch. This means so much to me.”\nAn olive branch is a traditional symbol of peace.\nThe olive branch, along with a letter beginning “Hey Old Friend, I’ve been doing some reflecting on past miscommunications and hurt feelings between us,” arrived on the first day of Swift’s worldwide “Reputation” tour, in Glendale, Arizona.
