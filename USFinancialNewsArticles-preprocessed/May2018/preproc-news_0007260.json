    "text": "0 COMMENTS The U.S. dollar surged Tuesday after recent economic data signaled stronger growth in the U.S. than other developed nations.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of 16 others, rose 0.5% to 86.04. The currency rose broadly against the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound.\nThe dollar has been buoyed by an array of strong economic data, which has contributed to investors’ rising expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates four times in 2018. Fed funds futures show the market sees a 51% likelihood for that fourth rate increase, up from 32% a month ago, according to CME Group data early Tuesday.\n“If you look at monetary policy expectations outside the U.S., they’ve shifted” and become less aggressive, said Eric Viloria, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. That, combined with stronger U.S. data has been “contributing to some of the dollar strength.”\nThe dollar has been buoyed by strong economic data.

Their previous forecast had been for March 2020. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England have both also sent signals that they aren’t rushing to remove accommodative policies.\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com",
