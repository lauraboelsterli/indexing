    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Just Desserts announced today the addition of Anthony (Tony) Zamudio as Director of Sales. Zamudio has over three decades of experience in the Bakery industry, working in key sales leadership positions at Treehouse, ConAgra, Bunge, and Dawn Foods. Tony started his career as a bakery manager for Haggens, and was Director of Bakery for Brown and Cole which provided him with extensive technical bakery experience.\n“Tony understands the challenges faced by the instore bakery manager. As we are rapidly expanding our business, Tony’s knowledge and experience will be a great resource,” said Michael J. Mendes, CEO, Just Desserts. Dean Gold, who recently joined Just Desserts as Vice President of Sales, was looking for a sales leader who had the experience and energy needed to continue to expand distribution for Just Desserts. Gold noted, “I am excited to have Tony join our organization, as he adds deep industry knowledge, knows how to sell brands, and has a real passion for the industry. Tony has had the opportunity to work with a variety of key retail customers throughout the country and is very familiar with many of our key customers. I am confident Tony can hit the ground running, and will be a great asset.”\nWhile Just Desserts has developed a strong base of distribution, there is significant opportunity for growth. “I have been impressed by what Just Desserts has accomplished over the past few years to position the company to grow, and to develop a brand and product line that is on trend with where consumer interest is growing,” said Zamudio. “Just Desserts has always been known for outstanding quality, clean label products. However, the product innovation and initiative to launch the Organic and Vegan product lines has really outpaced the industry,” noted Zamudio. “The new bakery Just Desserts has built is impressive, and investing in new equipment and building a talented team really shows a commitment for the future.”\nZamudio will join the company June 4 th , and will be joining the Just Desserts booth at IDDBA (Booth #2541).\nAbout Just Desserts\nJust Desserts was founded in San Francisco in 1974 with a passion for making delicious clean label desserts that are hand-crafted and made from scratch.\nFor more information visit: JustDesserts.com\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514005910/en/\nJust Desserts\nAna Speros, 415-780-6870\nasperos@justdesserts.com\nSource: Just Desserts",
