    "text": "- VTL-308 Enrollment Completed with 151 Subjects\n- On Track for Release of Topline Results in Third Quarter of 2018\nSAN DIEGO, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vital Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq:VTL), a biotherapeutic company developing ELAD®, a cell-based therapy targeting the treatment of acute forms of liver failure, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased to have completed enrollment in our VTL-308 clinical trial and we have met both our timeline and our targeted treatment enrollment criteria. We anticipate reporting topline results in September,” said Russell J. Cox, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our company focus has now turned to preparations for filing a biologics license application and plans for commercialization in the event of positive trial results.”\nKey Recent Developments\nVTL-308 completed enrollment at the end of March with 151 subjects enrolled. VTL-308 is the Company's phase 3 randomized, controlled, open-label trial, designed to evaluate the ELAD System in subjects with severe alcoholic hepatitis (sAH). The Company expects to report topline data in the third quarter of this year, likely in September.\nThe Company has updated the baseline characteristics of subjects enrolled in VTL-308 to include current data for 151 subjects. The data show that the means for these baseline characteristics continued to track the reference population from VTI-208, the Company’s prior phase 3 clinical trial with ELAD in subjects with sAH on which the design of VTL-308 is based. The updated baseline data are presented in the table below:\nData Age (years) MELD Bilirubin (mg/dL) INR Creatinine\n(mg/dL) VTL-308 enrollment limits <50 yrs <30 ≥16 mg/dL ≤2.5 <1.3mg/dL VTI-208 reference population\n(n=60) Mean\n(range) 40.10\n(28 - 49) 25.60\n(20 - 29) 26.62\n(16.6 - 52.6) 1.86\n(1.0 - 2.5) 0.71\n(0.10 - 1.30) VTL-308\n(n=151) Mean\n(range) 39.30\n(23 - 49) 25.14\n(19 - 29) 24.93\n(16.0 – 44.7) 1.82\n(0.95 – 2.50) 0.73\n(0.30 – 1.27) The Company continues to present findings from its research into the mechanism of action of ELAD and potential other applications for the technology at scientific conferences. An abstract titled “Inflammation Biomarkers Decrease During ELAD Treatment in Alcoholic Hepatitis Subjects” was accepted for poster presentation at Digestive Disease Week, to be held June 2-5, 2018 in Washington, D.C. An abstract titled “Impact of ELAD C3A Cell Conditioned Medium Enhanced Perfusate Fluid on Functional Recovery of Extended Criteria Donor Livers during Normothermic Machine Perfusion” was accepted for poster presentation at both the International Liver Transplantation Society 2018 Annual Congress, to be held May 23-26 in Lisbon, Portugal, and the 2018 Annual Transplant Congress, to be held June 2-6 in Seattle, Washington. Posters and associated presentations are made available at http://ir.vitaltherapies.com in the \"Clinical Publications and Presentations\" section promptly after they have been presented publicly.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash Position\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018, totaled $43.6 million compared to $56.9 million at December 31, 2017. The Company believes its current cash position should provide funding through the first quarter of 2019, past the expected announcement of VTL-308 top-line trial results.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nThe Company reported a net loss of $14.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which compared with a net loss of $12.6 million for the same prior year period. This resulted in a net loss of $0.34 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a net loss of $0.39 per share for the corresponding period in 2017, on both a basic and diluted basis. These per share figures are based on weighted-average common shares outstanding of 42,368,864 shares and 32,645,103 shares, respectively, with the increase in common shares outstanding at March 31, 2018 primarily attributable to shares issued as part of the Company’s follow-on offering in March of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses increased to $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $9.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nUpcoming Investor Conferences\nThe Company will be presenting at the following upcoming conferences:\nThe Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2018 Health Care Conference on Thursday, May 17, 2018 at 1:15 PM Eastern in Las Vegas, NV.\nThe Jefferies 2018 Global Healthcare Conference on Friday, June 8, 2018 at 8:30 AM Eastern in New York City.\nA live webcast of each presentation will be available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at: http://ir.vitaltherapies.com/ .
