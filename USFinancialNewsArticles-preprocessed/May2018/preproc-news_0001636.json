Adjusted gross margin of 32.1%, up 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $68.7 million, down 4% from $71.2 million in the prior year, impacted by the removal of ATMs at 7-Eleven locations in the U.S. Adjusted Net Income per diluted share of $0.46 compared to $0.55 in the prior year, impacted by the removal of ATMs at 7-Eleven locations in the U.S. and higher interest expense associated with permanent financing related to the DCPayments acquisition.\n“We had a great start to 2018, with a first quarter that demonstrated the strength and durability of our business and strong operational execution resulting in margin expansion over the prior year. As we moved past the 7-Eleven deconversion, we delivered solid organic revenue growth in North America, driven by improved transaction levels. In addition to delivering value for our premier retailers, we continue to focus on becoming an increasingly important strategic partner to financial institutions, and our efforts are gaining momentum. We’re excited about the year ahead and our ability to execute on our strategic priorities,” commented Edward H. West, Cardtronics’ chief executive officer.\nNote Regarding First Quarter 2018 Results Compared to Prior Year:\nThe Company had a long-standing relationship with 7-Eleven in the U.S. that ended during the quarter In previous periods, this relationship accounted for a material portion of the Company’s consolidated revenues and profits. The Company began a transition to 7-Eleven’s new service provider during the third quarter of 2017 and that transition was completed in February 2018. The Company estimates that 7-Eleven accounted for approximately 15% of the Company’s total revenues during the first quarter of 2017 and had an incremental adjusted gross margin of approximately 40%. During the first quarter of 2018, 7-Eleven in the U.S. accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s total revenues. 7-Eleven in the U.S. accounted for approximately 12.5% of the Company’s consolidated revenues for the year ended 2017 and the Company expects that 7-Eleven in the U.S. will account for less than 1% of consolidated revenues in 2018.\nSee Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Information in this earnings release for definitions of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per diluted share, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, and certain other non-GAAP measures on a constant-currency basis. For additional information, including reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measure recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”), see the supplemental schedules of selected financial information in this earnings release.\nThe Company may also refer to revenue or profit growth as being organic. When providing growth measures on an organic basis, the Company attempts to exclude the estimated impact from any acquired or divested businesses that may be included or partially included in one period but not another. The Company may further adjust organic performance measures for the impacts of currency movements, in order to have a consistent performance comparison across periods for the business, excluding movements in exchange rates. Due to the significance of the Company’s 7-Eleven relationship in the U.S., which accounted for 12.5% of consolidated revenues in 2017 and is expected to account for less than 1% of consolidated revenues in 2018, the Company may also report certain performance measures excluding the estimated contribution of this relationship to enable more comparable analysis of the business across periods excluding this relationship.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nBelow is the Company’s financial outlook for the full year 2018:\nRevenues of $1.26 billion to $1.30 billion; GAAP Net Income of $1.0 million to $6.0 million; Adjusted EBITDA of $255 million to $265 million; Depreciation and accretion expense of $126 million to $128 million; Cash interest expense of $36 million; Adjusted Net Income of $67 million to $77 million; Adjusted Net Income per diluted share of $1.45 to $1.65, based on approximately 46.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding; and Capital expenditures of $110 million.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income outlook excludes the impact of certain expenses, as outlined in the reconciliation provided at the end of this earnings release. See Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Information in this earnings release for definitions of these Non-GAAP measures. This outlook is based on average foreign currency exchange rates for the year of £1.00 U.K. to $1.35 U.S., $20.00 Mexican pesos to $1.00 U.S., $1.00 Canadian dollar to $0.80 U.S., €1.00 Euros to $1.24 U.S., $1.00 Australian dollar to $0.80 U.S., and R13 South African Rand to $1.00 U.S.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nThe Company will host a conference call today, Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss its financial results for the quarter To access the call, please call the conference call operator at:\nDial in: (877) 303-9205 Alternate dial-in: (760) 536-5226 Please call in 15 minutes prior to the scheduled start time and request to be connected to the “Cardtronics First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.” Additionally, a live audio webcast of the conference call will be available online through the investor relations section of the Company’s website at www.cardtronics.com .\nA digital replay of the conference call will be available through Thursday, May 10, 2018, and can be accessed by calling (855) 859-2056 or (404) 537-3406 and entering 4096764 for the conference ID.

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and measuring the performance of its business, including setting and measuring incentive based compensation for management. Management believes that the presentation of these measures and the identification of notable, non-cash, and/or (if applicable in a particular period) certain costs not anticipated to occur in future periods enhance an investor’s understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s business and provide for better comparability between periods in different years.\nAdjusted Gross Profit represents total revenues less the total cost of revenues, excluding depreciation, accretion, and amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted Gross Profit by total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation, accretion, and amortization of intangible assets as these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the Company’s industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, and the methods by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes share-based compensation expense, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, certain non-operating expenses, (if applicable in a particular period) certain costs not anticipated to occur in future periods, gains or losses on disposal and impairment of assets, the Company’s obligations for the payment of income taxes, interest expense, and other obligations such as capital expenditures, and includes an adjustment for noncontrolling interests. Adjusted Net Income represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, before amortization of intangible assets, gains or losses on disposal and impairment of assets, share-based compensation expense, certain other expense amounts, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, certain non-operating expenses, and (if applicable in a particular period) certain costs not anticipated to occur in future periods (together, the “Adjustments”). For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the non-GAAP tax rate used to calculate Adjusted Net Income was approximately 25.8% and 28.2%, respectively, representing the GAAP tax rate for the period as adjusted by the estimated tax impact of the items adjusted from the measure. Adjusted Net Income per diluted share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less the impact of changes in restricted cash due to the timing of settlements and less payments for capital expenditures, including those financed through direct debt, but excluding acquisitions. The Adjusted Free Cash Flow measure does not take into consideration certain other non-discretionary cash requirements such as mandatory principal payments on portions of the Company’s long-term debt. Management calculates certain GAAP as well as non-GAAP measures on a constant-currency basis using the average foreign currency exchange rates applicable in the corresponding period of the previous year and applying these rates to the measures in the current reporting period. Management uses GAAP as well as non-GAAP measures on a constant-currency basis to assess performance and eliminate the effect foreign currency exchange rates have on comparability between periods.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented herein should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities, or other income or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in tabular form at the end of this earnings release.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\n(In thousands, excluding share, per share amounts, and percentages) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 % Change 2017 (Unaudited)\nRevenues: ATM operating revenues $ 319,731 (6.5 ) % $ 341,788 ATM product sales and other revenues 16,453 4.2 15,784 Total revenues 336,184 (6.0 ) 357,572 Cost of revenues: Cost of ATM operating revenues (excludes depreciation, accretion, and amortization of intangible assets reported separately below.) 215,490 (7.1 ) 231,927 Cost of ATM product sales and other revenues 12,762 (12.8 ) 14,635 Total cost of revenues 228,252 (7.4 ) 246,562 Operating expenses: Selling, general, and administrative expenses 41,740 (0.5 ) 41,949 Redomicile-related expenses — n/m 760 Restructuring expenses 2,413 (70.7 ) 8,243 Acquisition and divestiture-related expenses 1,720 (79.7 ) 8,456 Depreciation and accretion expense 31,042 6.6 29,121 Amortization of intangible assets 13,771 (9.3 ) 15,180 Loss on disposal and impairment of assets 5,420 69.7 3,194 Total operating expenses 96,106 (10.1 ) 106,903 Income from operations 11,826 187.9 4,107 Other expense: Interest expense, net 9,174 39.9 6,557 Amortization of deferred financing costs and note discount 3,308 11.2 2,976 Other expense (income) 2,160 n/m (1,580 ) Total other expense 14,642 84.1 7,953 Loss before income taxes (2,816 ) (26.8 ) (3,846 ) Income tax benefit (31 ) (98.9 ) (2,952 ) Effective tax rate 1.1 % 76.8 % Net loss (2,785 ) 211.5 (894 ) Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests (17 ) n/m 7 Net loss attributable to controlling interests and available to common shareholders $ (2,768 ) 207.2 % $ (901 ) Net loss per common share – basic $ (0.06 ) $ (0.02 ) Net loss per common share – diluted $ (0.06 ) $ (0.02 ) Weighted average shares outstanding – basic 45,833,070 45,490,461 Weighted average shares outstanding – diluted 45,833,070 45,490,461\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\n(In thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (Unaudited) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 46,673 $ 51,370 Accounts and notes receivable, net 94,345 105,245 Inventory, net 15,529 14,283 Restricted cash 73,003 48,328 Prepaid expenses, deferred costs, and other current assets 121,298 96,106 Total current assets 350,848 315,332 Property and equipment, net 487,695 497,902 Intangible assets, net 195,378 209,862 Goodwill 779,394 774,939 Deferred tax asset, net 5,948 6,925 Prepaid expenses, deferred costs, and other noncurrent assets 75,245 57,756 Total assets $ 1,894,508 $ 1,862,716 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Current portion of other long-term liabilities $ 22,877 $ 31,370 Accounts payable and other accrued and current liabilities 362,756 351,180 Total current liabilities 385,633 382,550 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 915,586 917,721 Asset retirement obligations 61,392 59,920 Deferred tax liability, net 42,394 37,130 Other long-term liabilities 70,921 75,002 Total liabilities 1,475,926 1,472,323 Shareholders' equity 418,582 390,393 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 1,894,508 $ 1,862,716 SELECTED BALANCE SHEET DETAIL:\nLong-term debt: March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (In thousands) (Unaudited) Revolving credit facility $ 117,168 $ 122,461 1.00% Convertible senior notes (1) 254,797 251,973 5.125% Senior notes (1) 248,210 248,038 5.50% Senior notes (1) 295,411 295,249 Total long-term debt $ 915,586 $ 917,721 (1) The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 with a face value of $287.5 million are presented net of the unamortized discount and capitalized debt issuance costs of $32.7 million and $35.5 million as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
