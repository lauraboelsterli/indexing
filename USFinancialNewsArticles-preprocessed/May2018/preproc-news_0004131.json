    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cerner Corporation (Nasdaq:CERN) today announced results for the 2018 first quarter that ended March 31, 2018.\nBookings in the first quarter of 2018 were $1.398 billion, an increase of 12 percent compared to $1.250 billion in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter revenue was $1.293 billion, an increase of 3 percent compared to $1.260 billion in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, first quarter 2018 net earnings were $160.0 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.48. First quarter 2017 GAAP net earnings were $173.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.52.\nAdjusted Net Earnings for first quarter 2018 were $193.9 million, compared to $197.8 million of Adjusted Net Earnings in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) were $0.58 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.59 of Adjusted Diluted EPS in the year-ago quarter. Analysts’ consensus estimate for first quarter 2018 Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.58.\nAdjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are not recognized terms under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be substituted for GAAP net earnings or GAAP diluted earnings per share, respectively, as measures of Cerner’s performance, but instead should be utilized as supplemental measures of financial performance in evaluating our business. Please see the accompanying schedule, titled “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results,” where our non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nOther Highlights:\nFirst quarter operating cash flow of $409.0 million. First quarter Free Cash Flow of $255.7 million. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP cash flows from operating activities less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs. Please see the accompanying schedule, titled “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results.” First quarter days sales outstanding of 73 days, up from 71 days in the year-ago period. Total backlog of $14.63 billion. Backlog reflects the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance effective for this quarter, which will be further discussed in Cerner’s Form 10-Q. Certain provisions within such guidance impact how we calculate backlog. Backlog amounts disclosed in prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, and are not comparable to, the current period presentation.\n“Our results in the first quarter included strong bookings and cash flow and in-line earnings, but our revenue was below expected levels,” said Zane Burke, President. “Our mixed results and revised outlook reflect the delay of a large contract and a less predictable end market. However, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities due to our strong market position and portfolio of solutions and tech-enabled services that align with the pressures health care stakeholders are facing.”\nFuture Period Guidance\nCerner currently expects:\nSecond quarter 2018 revenue between $1.310 billion and $1.360 billion. Full year 2018 revenue between $5.325 billion and $5.450 billion, down from a range of $5.450 billion to $5.650 billion. Second quarter 2018 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share between $0.59 and $0.61. Full year 2018 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share between $2.45 and $2.55, down from a range of $2.57 to $2.73. Second quarter 2018 new business bookings between $1.350 billion and $1.550 billion.\nEarnings Conference Call\nCerner will host an earnings conference call to provide additional detail on the Company’s results and outlook at 3:30 p.m. CT on May 2, 2018. On the call, Cerner will discuss its first quarter 2018 results and answer questions from the investment community.

However, we supplement our GAAP results with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review and understanding of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to GAAP results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with Cerner's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculations. We provide the measures of Adjusted Operating Earnings, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as such measures are used by management, along with GAAP results, to analyze Cerner's business, make strategic decisions, assess long-term trends on a comparable basis, and for management compensation purposes. We provide the measure of Free Cash Flow as such measure takes into account certain capital expenditures necessary to operate our business. Free Cash Flow is used by management, along with GAAP results, to analyze our earnings quality and overall cash generation of the business. We calculate each of our non-GAAP financial measures as follows: Adjusted Operating Earnings - Consists of GAAP operating earnings adjusted for: (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) Health Services acquisition-related amortization, (iii) acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, and (iv) other acquisition-related adjustments. Adjusted Net Earnings - Consists of GAAP net earnings adjusted for: (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) Health Services acquisition-related amortization, (iii) acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, (iv) other acquisition-related adjustments, (v) the income tax effect of the aforementioned items, and (vi) share-based compensation permanent tax items. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share - Consists of Adjusted Net Earnings, as defined above, divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, in the applicable period. Free Cash Flow - Consists of cash flows from operating activities, less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs. Adjustments included in the calculations of Adjusted Operating Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings are described below: Share-based compensation expense - Non-cash expense arising from our equity compensation and stock purchase plans available to our associates and directors. We exclude share-based compensation expense as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Share-based compensation expense is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows: (In thousands) Three Months Ended 2018 2017 Sales and client service $ 12,579 $ 9,671 Software development 5,425 4,227 General and administrative 8,453 4,957 Total share-based compensation expense $ 26,457 $ 18,855 Health Services acquisition-related amortization - Non-cash expense consisting of the amortization of customer relationships, acquired technology, and trade name intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. We exclude Health Services acquisition-related amortization as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.\" Acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment - Consists of acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. Accounting guidance requires that deferred revenue acquired in a business combination be written-down to an estimate of fulfillment cost, plus a normal profit margin, as a part of the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We add back the amount of the write-down applicable to the period as we believe such amount directly correlates to the underlying performance of our business operations. Other acquisition-related adjustments - Consists of acquisition, employee separation, and other costs associated with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. We exclude other acquisition-related adjustments as they are non-recurring charges, and we believe the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"General and administrative\" expense. Income tax effect of pre-tax adjustments - The GAAP effective income tax rate for the applicable quarterly period is applied to pre-tax adjustments for Adjusted Net Earnings. Share-based compensation permanent tax items - Consists of permanent items impacting the Company's income tax provision related to our share-based compensation arrangements, including net excess tax benefits recognized upon the exercise of stock options. We exclude such items as we believe the amount of such items in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"Income taxes.\" Cerner's future period guidance in this release includes adjustments for items not indicative of our core operations, which may include without limitation share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, such as integration expenses, and may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments relating to the Company's acquired businesses, and may also be affected by nonrecurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, all of which are excluded in the calculation of non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Earnings, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as described above. The exact amount of these adjustments are not currently determinable, but may be significant. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile this non-GAAP guidance to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nCERNER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS As of March 31, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (unaudited) (In thousands) 2018 2017 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 413,399 $ 370,923 Short-term investments 507,965 434,844 Receivables, net 1,040,741 1,042,781 Inventory 14,301 15,749 Prepaid expenses and other 388,809 515,930 Total current assets 2,365,215 2,380,227 Property and equipment, net 1,600,876 1,603,319 Software development costs, net 847,984 822,159 Goodwill 853,834 853,005 Intangible assets, net 460,564 479,753 Long-term investments 172,007 196,837 Other assets 211,158 134,011 Total assets $ 6,511,638 $ 6,469,311 Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 210,046 $ 218,996 Current installments of long-term debt and capital lease obligations 6,804 11,585 Deferred revenue 311,015 311,337 Accrued payroll and tax withholdings 211,716 183,770 Other accrued expenses 63,361 63,907 Total current liabilities 802,942 789,595 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations 438,773 515,130 Deferred income taxes and other liabilities 362,538 365,674 Deferred revenue 6,891 13,564 Total liabilities 1,611,144 1,683,963 Shareholders’ Equity: Common stock 3,599 3,592 Additional paid-in capital 1,413,637 1,380,371 Retained earnings 5,106,467 4,938,866 Treasury stock (1,551,723 ) (1,464,099 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net (71,486 ) (73,382 ) Total shareholders’ equity 4,900,494 4,785,348 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 6,511,638 $ 6,469,311\nCERNER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017 (unaudited) Three Months Ended (In thousands) 2018 2017 CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES: Net earnings $ 160,001 $ 173,213 Adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization 152,592 134,833 Share-based compensation expense 24,935 17,500 Provision for deferred income taxes (3,047 ) 11,214 Changes in assets and liabilities: Receivables, net (70,608 ) (34,236 ) Inventory 1,445 (4,266 ) Prepaid expenses and other 125,550 27,270 Accounts payable 7,608 (21,908 ) Accrued income taxes 7,195 768 Deferred revenue (7,205 ) 24,269 Other accrued liabilities 10,499 (25,072 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 408,965 303,585 CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES: Capital purchases (79,711 ) (88,065 ) Capitalized software development costs (73,602 ) (71,092 ) Purchases of investments (151,387 ) (53,340 ) Sales and maturities of investments 101,674 115,030 Purchase of other intangibles (8,472 ) (6,385 ) Net cash used in investing activities (211,498 ) (103,852 ) CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES: Repayment of long-term debt (75,000 ) — Proceeds from exercises of stock options 10,036 10,683 Payments to taxing authorities in connection with shares directly withheld from associates (1,723 ) (5,314 ) Treasury stock purchases (87,624 ) — Contingent consideration payments for acquisition of businesses — (1,000 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (154,311 ) 4,369 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (680 ) 3,489 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 42,476 207,591 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 370,923 170,861 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 413,399 $ 378,452\nSource:Cerner Corporation",
