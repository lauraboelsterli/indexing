Working Title TV and Instinct Productions are producing the series.\n“ The Case Against Adnan Syed will offer a cinematic look at the life and 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee and conviction of Adnan Syed, from the genesis of their high school relationship, to the original police investigation and trial, through to the current day, when Syed faces a new trial after serving 18 years in jail,” according to a release from HBO and Sky.\nFor those who were consumed with this story, HBO and Sky said the series will include “ground-breaking revelations that challenge the state’s case.”\nSince the airing of Serial, Syed’s conviction has been vacated, and he was granted a new trial .\nA release date for ‘The Case Against Adnan Syed’ has not been announced.",
