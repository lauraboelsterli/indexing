    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French construction group Eiffage ( FOUG.PA ) kept its 2018 targets for higher revenues and profits after it reported a 5.6 percent rise in first quarter sales.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of French construction group Eiffage is seen at a job site in Paris, France, February 26, 2016. REUTERS/Charles Platiau Eiffage, which is France’s third-largest construction and concessions company behind Vinci ( SGEF.PA ) and Bouygues ( BOUY.PA ), said revenue reached 3.379 billion euros ($4.1 billion), a 4.3 percent rise on a like-for-like basis.\nEiffage’s order book for contracting stood at 14.1 billion euros, a 23 percent rise from the previous year, with almost 1.9 billion euros of orders taken for the Grand Paris Express project, which entails various developments for the capital.\nLast month, rival Vinci posted a 4.9 percent rise in first-quarter sales, helped by acquisitions, robust concessions activity and a recovery in the French construction market.\nReporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
