    "text": "Crypto investor Brian Kelly makes the case for bitcoin cash May 21, 2018\nCryptocurrency investor Brian Kelly said Monday bitcoin cash is the must-own digital currency of the moment.\nOn Saturday, bitcoin cash miners met to discuss funding for a bitcoin cash development fund, he told CNBC.\nIn the fund, miners are “going to take some of the rewards they get from mining and put it in a fund to build stuff on top of bitcoin cash,” Kelly said on “ Fast Money .”\n“That’s how blockchains gain value,” he added. “You’re going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash.”\n“That’s a place I want to buy,” said Kelly, who is founder and CEO of BKCM, an investment firm focused on digital currencies.\nBitcoin cash was priced at $1,233.25 at 6 p.m. ET Monday. While it declined from its $1,300 price the week of May 14, bitcoin cash was still valued significantly higher than its April 17 level of $763 . ",
