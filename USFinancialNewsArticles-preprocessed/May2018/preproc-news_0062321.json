    "text": "ATLANTA, May 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Triad Advisors, LLC (\"Triad\" or \"the Firm\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE American: LTS, LTSL, LTS PrA), and a leading independent advisory and brokerage (IAB) firm supporting independent hybrid financial advisory practices and registered investment advisory (RIA) firms, today announced that Boston-area independent advisory firm Pinnacle Private Wealth (\"Pinnacle\") has joined its broker-dealer and hybrid RIA custodial platforms.\nHeadquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts, Pinnacle Private Wealth is an independent financial advisory firm that provides financial planning, investment and risk management, and retirement planning services for pre-retirees and high-net-worth individuals.

Dan Cotton and Myles Dudley have built a talented and experienced team of advisors and other professionals who share our vision of providing clients across the country with consistently sterling service. Pinnacle has grown tremendously in the nine years they have been in business, and they have impressive plans to continue their expansion in the years ahead. Triad is thrilled to serve as a strategic partner to Pinnacle in helping them achieve these growth goals.\"\nDaniel J.

We are confident we have found the ideal partner for our needs in Triad Advisors, and we look forward to working with them.\"\nMyles Dudley, Co-Founder of Pinnacle, added, \"Our goal is to continue to give Pinnacle advisors access to the technology and the platforms needed to stay ahead in an ever-changing advisory world. Pinnacle aims to be a premier destination for advisors and their clients and this change helps us continue to move closer to that goal.\"\nStibbs concluded, \"Pinnacle Private Wealth's decision to join Triad demonstrates once again the compelling value proposition we offer advisors and clients in the hybrid space. Pinnacle's transition extends the strong recruiting results we saw throughout 2017 – and have continued to see this year – as more independent practices are drawn to our flexible platform and the choice it provides as they work to build businesses that are right for them and their clients. Pinnacle also appreciated our unique combination of a boutique service culture with the resources of a publicly-traded parent company with national reach in Ladenburg Thalmann. We look forward to facilitating continued growth for Pinnacle and all of our affiliated advisors throughout 2018 and beyond.\"\nAbout Triad Advisors\nHeadquartered in Atlanta, GA, Triad Advisors, LLC is a national, independent advisory and brokerage firm as well as a multi-custodial SEC-Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) that is an early pioneer and continued leader in the Hybrid RIA marketplace.
