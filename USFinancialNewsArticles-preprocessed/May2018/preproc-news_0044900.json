    "text": "EditorsNote: Adds Steven Souza injury toward bottom\nJacob deGrom tied a career high by striking out 13 batters over seven strong innings Friday night as the New York Mets beat the visiting Arizona Diamondbacks 3-1 at Citi Field.\nThe Mets won for the 10th time in 28 games following an 11-1 start. The Diamondbacks have lost eight of nine.\nDeGrom (4-0), who missed a start earlier this month due to a hyperextended right elbow and threw 45 pitches while lasting only one inning in his return Sunday, allowed one run on six hits and no walks while throwing 71 of his 100 pitches for strikes. The 13-strikeout effort was the fourth of his career, including one in the 2015 playoffs, and his first since he whiffed 13 against the Miami Marlins on April 15, 2017.\nThe Diamondbacks got only one runner beyond first base in the first five innings before scoring in the sixth, when Steven Souza Jr. singled with one out and scored on Jake Lamb’s double. The run snapped deGrom’s scoreless streak at a career-high 24 2/3 innings.\nDeGrom allowed a leadoff double to Daniel Descalso in the seventh before setting down the next three batters. Robert Gsellman tossed a perfect eighth before Jeurys Familia struck out the side in the ninth for his 12th save.\nWilmer Flores gave the Mets a lead they’d never relinquish with an RBI groundout in the first inning. Michael Conforto tied a career high with four hits, all singles, and produced RBIs with his first- and fifth-inning hits.\nConforto and Brandon Nimmo, who went 0-for-3, are locked into everyday duties after the Mets announced Friday that Juan Lagares is likely going to miss the rest of the season with a toe injury suffered Wednesday.\nDescalso had two hits for the Diamondbacks. Lamb, who was activated from the disabled list Thursday after missing almost seven weeks with a sprained left shoulder, went 1-for-4.\nSouza left the game in the bottom of the sixth inning with right pectoral soreness. He singled and came around to score in the top of the inning. Souza began the season on the disabled list with a right pectoral strain and rejoined the team May 3.\nZack Godley (4-3) took the loss for the Diamondbacks after allowing three runs (one earned) on four hits and four walks while striking out six over six innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
