Q1 product revenue was $4.7M versus prior year Q1 of $3.4M, an increase of 38%. Q1 Service and Other revenue totaled $2.5M versus prior year Q1 of $1.6M, an increase of 52%.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Highlights\nAs previously noted, Quanterix successfully completed the acquisition of Aushon BioSystems on Jan. 30, 2018 and has begun to successfully integrate the two businesses. Major benefits of the Aushon transaction include: acquired an ultra-sensitive protein detection technology, complimentary to Simoa; acquired a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory, expanding services and accelerating entry into pharmaceutical drug trial services; gained access to Aushon’s menu of over 200 assays, many with multiplexing capabilities; accessed a talented work force allowing us to accelerate assay development; and, inherited an additional facility (close to the Quanterix headquarters), enabling cost-effective expansion of operations to meet growing demand. Expanded operations in Asia, particularly working through distributors in China. Successfully closed first full quarter of sales of the new SR-X Ultra-Sensitive Biomarker Detection System™ . Began a collaboration with DestiNA Genomics in an effort to transform microRNA biomarker detection, bringing together high-specificity and ultra-sensitivity for the first time. Surpassed more than 100 third-party, peer-reviewed publications in neurology , as driven by increased demand for the Company’s Simoa technology, bringing the total number of publications for the Company to over 215 across neurology, oncology, cardiology, inflammation and infectious disease. Named as partner candidate in the FNIH (Foundation for National Institutes of Health) Biomarkers Consortium, which launched a project to improve diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.
