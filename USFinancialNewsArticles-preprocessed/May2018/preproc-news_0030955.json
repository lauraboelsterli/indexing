    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ark Restaurants Corp. (NASDAQ:ARKR) today reported financial results for the second quarter\nTotal revenues for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 were $35,276,000 versus $34,640,000 for the three months ended April 1, 2017. The three-month period ended March 31, 2018 includes revenues of $1,272,000 related to Sequoia DC which was closed for renovation for the entire three-month period ended April 1, 2017. The three-month period ended April 1, 2017 includes revenues of $1,762,000 related to three properties that were closed prior to fiscal 2018.\nTotal revenues for the six-month period ended March 31, 2018 were $74,628,000 versus $73,059,000 for the six months ended April 1, 2017. As noted above, the six-month period ended March 31, 2018 includes revenues of $1,273,000 generated during the second quarter of 2018 related to Sequoia DC which was closed for renovation for the entirety of the second quarter of 2017. The six-month period ended April 1, 2017 includes revenues of $3,258,000 related to three properties that were closed prior to fiscal 2018.\nCompany-wide same store sales increased 2.4% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same three month period last year.\nThe Company’s EBITDA, adjusted for non-controlling interests, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was $769,000 versus $694,000 during the same three-month period last year.\nThe Company’s EBITDA, adjusted for non-controlling interests, for the six-month period ended March 31, 2018 was $2,841,000 versus $4,794,000 during the same six-month period last year. EBITDA for the six-months ended April 1, 2017 includes a gain of $1,637,000 recognized in connection with the sale of the real estate underlying our Rustic Inn, Jupiter, FL property.\nNet loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, after a tax benefit, was ($637,000), or ($0.19) per basic and diluted share compared to ($393,000) after a tax benefit, or ($0.11) per basic and diluted share for the same three-month period last year.\nNet income for the six-month period ended March 31, 2018 was $990,000 or $0.29 per basic, $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $1,341,000, or $0.39 per basic share, $0.38 per diluted share, for the same six-month period last year.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. As a result, income tax expense reported for the six-months ended March 31, 2018 was adjusted to reflect the effects of the change in the tax law and resulted in a discrete income tax benefit of approximately $1.2 million. While we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the corporate tax rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to the Tax Act. Accordingly, the Company’s accounting for impact of the Tax Act remains incomplete as of March 31, 2018.\nArk Restaurants owns and operates 20 restaurants and bars, 19 fast food concepts and catering operations primarily in New York City, Florida, Washington, D.C, Las Vegas, NV and the gulf coast of Alabama.

Although EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure enhances an overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance as well as providing useful information to the investor because of its historical use by the Company as both a performance measure and measure of liquidity, and the use of EBITDA by virtually all companies in the restaurant sector as a measure of both performance and liquidity. However, investors should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Company's operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, pre-tax income, is included above.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514006337/en/\nArk Restaurants Corp.\nRobert Stewart, 212-206-8800\nbstewart@arkrestaurants.com\nSource: Ark Restaurants Corp.",
