(NYSE: ZEN) today reported financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, and released a Shareholder Letter on its investor relations website at https://investor.zendesk.com . All results and guidance are based on the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606.\nResults for the First Quarter 2018\nRevenue was $129.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 38% over the prior year period. GAAP net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $29.3 million, and GAAP net loss per share was $0.28. Non-GAAP net income was $2.0 million, and non-GAAP net income per share was $0.02. Non-GAAP net income excludes approximately $29.2 million in share-based compensation and related expenses (including $1.9 million of employer tax related to employee stock transactions and $0.4 million of amortization of share-based compensation capitalized in internal-use software), $0.7 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $0.7 million of acquisition-related expenses, and $0.7 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. GAAP net loss per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was based on 103.7 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic), and non-GAAP net income per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was based on 103.7 million weighted averages shares outstanding (basic) and 108.9 million weighted average shares outstanding (diluted).\nOutlook\nAs of May 1, 2018, Zendesk provided guidance for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 and updated its guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018.\nFor the quarter ending June 30, 2018, Zendesk expects to report:\nRevenue in the range of $136.0 - 138.0 million GAAP operating income (loss) in the range of $(34.0) - (32.0) million, which includes share-based compensation and related expenses of approximately $30.7 million, amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $0.7 million, and acquisition-related expenses of approximately $0.6 million Non-GAAP operating income (loss) in the range of $(2.0) - 0.0 million, which excludes share-based compensation and related expenses of approximately $30.7 million, amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $0.7 million, and acquisition-related expenses of approximately $0.6 million Approximately 105.2 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic) Approximately 109.9 million weighted average shares outstanding (diluted)\nFor the full year 2018, Zendesk expects to report:\nRevenue in the range of $565.0 - 572.0 million GAAP operating income (loss) in the range of $(132.0) - (127.0) million, which includes share-based compensation and related expenses of approximately $126.8 million, amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $2.7 million, and acquisition-related expenses of approximately $2.5 million Non-GAAP operating income (loss) in the range of $0.0 - 5.0 million, which excludes share-based compensation and related expenses of approximately $126.8 million, amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $2.7 million, and acquisition-related expenses of approximately $2.5 million Approximately 106.0 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic) Approximately 111.8 million weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) Free cash flow in the range of $25.0 - 30.0 million\nWe have not reconciled free cash flow guidance to net cash from operating activities for the full year 2018 because we do not provide guidance on the reconciling items between net cash from operating activities and free cash flow, as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, these items. The actual amount of such reconciling items will have a significant impact on our free cash flow and, accordingly, a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities to free cash flow for the full year 2018 is not available without unreasonable effort.\nZendesk’s estimates of share-based compensation and related expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and acquisition-related expenses in future periods assume, among other things, the occurrence of no additional acquisitions, investments or restructurings, and no further revisions to share-based compensation and related expenses.\nShareholder Letter and Conference Call Information\nThe detailed Shareholder Letter is available at https://investor.zendesk.com and Zendesk will host a conference call to answer questions today, May 1, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

flow $ 7,090 $ 639 *Adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASC 606.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors and others with additional information regarding Zendesk’s results, the following non-GAAP financial measures were disclosed: non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, and free cash flow.\nSpecifically, Zendesk excludes the following from its historical and prospective non-GAAP financial measures, as applicable:\nShare-based Compensation and Amortization of Share-based Compensation Capitalized in Internal-use Software: Zendesk utilizes share-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, share-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.\nEmployer Tax Related to Employee Stock Transactions: Zendesk views the amount of employer taxes related to its employee stock transactions as an expense that is dependent on its stock price, employee exercise and other award disposition activity, and other factors that are beyond Zendesk’s control. As a result, employer taxes related to its employee stock transactions vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles: Zendesk views amortization of purchased intangible assets, including the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired entity’s developed technology, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.\nAcquisition-Related Expenses: Zendesk views acquisition-related expenses, such as transaction costs, integration costs, restructuring costs, and acquisition-related retention payments, including amortization of acquisition-related retention payments capitalized in internal-use software, as events that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period. In particular, Zendesk believes the consideration of measures that exclude such expenses can assist in the comparison of operational performance in different periods which may or may not include such expenses.\nAmortization of Debt Discount and Issuance Costs: In March 2018, Zendesk issued $575 million of convertible senior notes due in 2023, which bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.25%. The imputed interest rate of the convertible senior notes was approximately 5.26%. This is a result of the debt discount recorded for the conversion feature that is required to be separately accounted for as equity, and debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying value of the convertible debt instrument. The debt discount is amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt. The expense for the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense will provide for a more useful comparison of our operational performance in different periods.\nZendesk provides disclosures regarding its free cash flow, which is defined as net cash from operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and internal-use software development costs. Zendesk uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Zendesk believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to fund ongoing operations.\nZendesk has not reconciled free cash flow guidance to net cash from operating activities for the year ending December 31, 2018 because Zendesk does not provide guidance on the reconciling items between net cash from operating activities and free cash flow, as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, these items. The actual amount of such reconciling items will have a significant impact on Zendesk’s free cash flow and, accordingly, a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities to free cash flow for the year ending December 31, 2018 is not available without unreasonable effort.\nZendesk’s disclosures regarding its expectations for its non-GAAP operating margin include adjustments to its expectations for its GAAP operating margin that exclude the expected share-based compensation and related expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and acquisition-related expenses excluded from its expectations for non-GAAP operating income (loss) as compared to its expectation for GAAP operating income (loss) for the same period.\nZendesk does not provide a reconciliation of its non-GAAP operating margin guidance to GAAP operating margin for future periods beyond the current fiscal year because Zendesk does not provide guidance on the reconciling items between GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin for such periods, as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, these items. The actual amount of such reconciling items will have a significant impact on Zendesk’s non-GAAP operating margin and, accordingly, a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin guidance for such periods is not available without unreasonable effort.\nZendesk’s disclosures regarding its expectations for its non-GAAP gross margin include adjustments to its expectations for its GAAP gross margin that exclude share-based compensation and related expenses in Zendesk’s cost of revenue and amortization of purchased intangibles related to developed technology. The share-based compensation and related expenses excluded due to such adjustments are primarily comprised of the share-based compensation and related expenses for employees associated with Zendesk’s infrastructure and customer experience organization.\nZendesk does not provide a reconciliation of its non-GAAP gross margin guidance to GAAP gross margin for future periods because Zendesk does not provide guidance on the reconciling items between GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin, as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, these items. The actual amount of such reconciling items will have a significant impact on Zendesk’s non-GAAP gross margin and, accordingly, a reconciliation of GAAP gross margin to non-GAAP gross margin guidance for the period is not available without unreasonable effort.\nZendesk uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Zendesk's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Zendesk presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Zendesk's operating results. Zendesk believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate Zendesk’s operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management.\nZendesk's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information that may include items such as share-based compensation and related expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and acquisition-related expenses, and the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Zendesk's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. When Zendesk uses such a non-GAAP financial measure with respect to historical periods, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure. When Zendesk uses such a non-GAAP financial measure in a forward-looking manner for future periods, and a reconciliation is not determinable without unreasonable effort, Zendesk provides the reconciling information that is determinable without unreasonable effort and identifies the information that would need to be added or subtracted from the non-GAAP measure to arrive at the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.\nAbout Operating Metrics\nZendesk reviews a number of operating metrics to evaluate its business, measure performance, identify trends, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. These include the number of paid customer accounts on Zendesk Support, Zendesk Chat, and its other products, dollar-based net expansion rate, monthly recurring revenue represented by its churned customers, and the percentage of its monthly recurring revenue from Support originating from customers with 100 or more agents on Support.\nZendesk defines the number of paid customer accounts at the end of any particular period as the sum of (i) the number of accounts on Support, exclusive of its legacy Starter plan, free trials, or other free services, (ii) the number of accounts using Chat, exclusive of free trials or other free services, and (iii) the number of accounts on all of its other products, exclusive of free trials and other free services, each as of the end of the period and as identified by a unique account identifier. Use of Support, Chat, and Zendesk’s other products requires separate subscriptions and each of these accounts are treated as a separate paid customer account. Existing customers may also expand their utilization of Zendesk’s products by adding new accounts and a single consolidated organization or customer may have multiple accounts across each of Zendesk’s products to service separate subsidiaries, divisions, or work processes. Each of these accounts is also treated as a separate paid customer account.\nZendesk’s dollar-based net expansion rate provides a measurement of its ability to increase revenue across its existing customer base through expansion of authorized agents associated with a paid customer account, upgrades in subscription plans, and the purchase of additional products as offset by churn, contraction in authorized agents associated with a paid customer account, and downgrades in subscription plans. Zendesk’s dollar-based net expansion rate is based upon monthly recurring revenue for a set of paid customer accounts on its products. Monthly recurring revenue for a paid customer account is a legal and contractual determination made by assessing the contractual terms of each paid customer account, as of the date of determination, as to the revenue Zendesk expects to generate in the next monthly period for that paid customer account, assuming no changes to the subscription and without taking into account any one-time discounts or any platform usage above the subscription base, if any, that may be applicable to such subscription. Monthly recurring revenue is not determined by reference to historical revenue, deferred revenue, or any other GAAP financial measure over any period. It is forward-looking and contractually derived as of the date of determination.\nZendesk calculates its dollar-based net expansion rate by dividing the retained revenue net of contraction and churn by Zendesk’s base revenue. Zendesk defines its base revenue as the aggregate monthly recurring revenue across its products for customers with paid customer accounts on Support or Chat as of the date one year prior to the date of calculation. Zendesk defines the retained revenue net of contraction and churn as the aggregate monthly recurring revenue across its products for the same customer base included in the measure of base revenue at the end of the annual period being measured. The dollar-based net expansion rate is also adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain activities that Zendesk identifies involving the transfer of agents between paid customer accounts, consolidation of customer accounts, or the split of a single paid customer account into multiple paid customer accounts. In addition, the dollar-based net expansion rate is adjusted to include paid customer accounts in the customer base used to determine retained revenue net of contraction and churn that share common corporate information with customers in the customer base that are used to determine the base revenue. Giving effect to this consolidation results in Zendesk’s dollar-based net expansion rate being calculated across approximately 95,800 customers, as compared to the approximately 125,500 total paid customer accounts as of March 31, 2018.\nTo the extent that Zendesk can determine that the underlying customers do not share common corporate information, Zendesk does not aggregate paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements for the purposes of determining its dollar-based net expansion rate. While not material, Zendesk believes the failure to account for these activities would otherwise skew the dollar-based net expansion metrics associated with customers that maintain multiple paid customer accounts across its products and paid customer accounts associated with reseller and other similar channel arrangements.\nZendesk does not currently incorporate operating metrics associated with its analytics product or its Outbound product into its measurement of dollar-based net expansion rate.\nFor a more detailed description of how Zendesk calculates its dollar-based net expansion rate, please refer to Zendesk’s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nZendesk’s percentage of monthly recurring revenue from Support that is generated by customers with 100 or more agents on Support is determined by dividing the monthly recurring revenue from Support for paid customer accounts with 100 or more agents on Support as of the measurement date by the monthly recurring revenue from Support for all paid customer accounts on Support as of the measurement date. Zendesk determines the customers with 100 or more agents on Support as of the measurement date based on the number of activated agents on Support at the measurement date and includes adjustments to aggregate paid customer accounts that share common corporate information.\nZendesk determines the annualized value of a contract by annualizing the monthly recurring revenue for such contract.\nZendesk does not currently incorporate operating metrics associated with products other than Support into its measurement of the percentage of monthly recurring revenue from Support that is generated by customers with 100 or more agents on Support.\nSource: Zendesk, Inc.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006742/en/\nZendesk, Inc.\nInvestor Contact:\nMarc Cabi, +1 415-852-3877\nir@zendesk.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nTian Lee, +1 415-231-0847\npress@zendesk.com\nSource: Zendesk, Inc.",
