    "text": "Shares of Roku popped in extended trading Wednesday, after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter financial results .\nThe stock price was up about 1.5 percent when the report was released after the bell, following a pre-earnings rally of nearly 9 percent in the regular trading session.\nHere's what Roku reported:\nLoss per share: 7 cents, excluding items vs. expectation of 15 cents per share by a Thomson Reuters estimate Revenue: $136.6 million vs. $127.6 million expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate The company also saw sales from its platform surpass revenue from selling physical devicesâ€” driven by advertising, something the company invested in after its IPO.\nRoku went public last year in one of 2017's more successful IPOs. The shares have risen more than 23 percent over the past 6 months, as the company has taken advantage of the trend of streaming video from online sources like Amazon , Netflix and Hulu. Netflix revealed last month that it added far more users than expected in the first quarter.\nRoku said that of its nearly 21 million active users, almost half either cancelled their linear TV subscription or never had one.\nRoku devices that connect to TVs have become particularly trendy. A new report from research firm Conviva said Wednesday that connected TV streaming in the home has tripled since 2015, replacing computers as the \"platform of choice for binge-watching.\"\nDisclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.",
