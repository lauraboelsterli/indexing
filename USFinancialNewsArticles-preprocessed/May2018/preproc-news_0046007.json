    "text": "- Accretive and disciplined capital management strategy -\n- Enhances portfolio composition -\n- Re-affirms 2018 distribution guidance -\nMEXICO CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FIBRA Macquarie México (FIBRA Macquarie) (BMV: FIBRAMQ), owner of one of the largest portfolios of industrial and retail property in Mexico, announced today that it has agreed to sell 37 non-strategic industrial assets comprising 2.6 million square feet of GLA for US$87.4 million of cash proceeds (the “Transaction”). The Transaction is expected to close in mid-2018, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n“The sale of this portfolio marks a key milestone in our asset recycling program. Upon the close of this Transaction we will have sold 44 non-strategic properties, for an equivalent total of US$117.5 million at an aggregate 2.2 percent premium to book value. This is in stark contrast to the substantial discount of FIBRA Macquarie’s certificate price to its intrinsic net asset value, which exceeds 40 percent,” said Juan Monroy, FIBRA Macquarie’s chief executive officer. “This Transaction enhances our overall portfolio composition and key financial metrics, and substantially accomplishes our near term asset recycling objectives. Furthermore, we are delivering on what we set out to achieve with our capital management strategy as we continue to source and deploy capital in a disciplined manner to maximize value to our investors on a per certificate basis. The proceeds from our asset recycling program, together with retained AFFO, are expected to be ultimately used to fund accretive investments including high quality real estate expansions and selective developments, along with our certificate repurchase for cancellation program.”\nThe Transaction is fully comprised of non-strategic properties located in Mexico’s northern markets including Matamoros, Reynosa, Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexicali and Tijuana. The Transaction complements the US$30.1 million of asset sales completed to date, which resulted in the complete exit from four tertiary industrial markets: Ascension, La Paz, Durango and Villahermosa. In achieving these asset sales, FIBRA Macquarie has sourced a diverse set of buyers including private equity funds, listed entities, existing tenants and family offices.\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nThe Transaction sale proceeds of US$87.4 million are to be received in three tranches comprising US$66.4 million at closing and US$12.2 million and US$8.8 million to be received 18 months and 24 months following closing, respectively. The first tranche will initially be used to fully repay FIBRA Macquarie’s drawn revolver of US$40.0 million, with the remaining US$26.4 million held as unrestricted cash.\nThe Transaction increases FIBRA Macquarie’s total capital available for investment to approximately US$300 million, comprised of undrawn revolver facility and cash on hand. All of the Transaction sale proceeds are expected to be ultimately re-deployed in accretive investment opportunities, including expansions, developments and certificate repurchases for cancellation.\nENHANCED PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION\nFollowing completion of the Transaction, FIBRAMQ’s industrial portfolio will have an increased focus in core assets and core markets, and will also achieve improved operational efficiencies, with expected NOI margin expansion driven by higher average occupancy and rental rates in the remaining portfolio.\nKEY INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIO METRICS 1 1Q18 Actual\n1Q18 Pro forma 2\nVariance\nNet operating income (NOI) (LTM) Ps 2,648.6m Ps 2,537.7m (-4.2%) NOI margin (LTM) 90.5% 91.1% +60bps Occupancy (EOP) 91.9% 93.3% +140bps Avg. monthly rent per leased (US$/sqm) (EOP) $4.67 $4.75 +1.7% Weighted avg. lease term remaining (years) (EOP) 3.2 3.3 +1.5% Percentage of US$ leases (EOP) 92.5% 92.0% (50bps) GLA (’000s sqft) (EOP) 31,991 29,407 (8.1%) GLA (’000s sqm) (EOP) 2,972 2,732 (8.1%) Number of properties (EOP) 271 234 (13.7%) 1.

Portfolio composition by geography and tenant industries will not be materially affected by the Transaction.\nSTRENGTHENED KEY FINANCIAL METRICS\nThe initial debt repayment will improve a number of key financial metrics, including leverage ratios, liquidity and proportion of fixed rate debt.\nKEY FINANCIAL METRICS 1 1Q18 Actual\n1Q18 Pro forma 3\nVariance\nReal estate net LTV 2 38.8% 36.4% (240bps) Regulatory LTV 35.8% 34.7% (110bps) Undrawn revolver facility (US$) 224.0m 264.0m +17.9% Fixed rate debt proportion (%) 95.0% 100.0% +500bps Debt tenor (weighted avg. years) 5.7 5.9 +3.5% Total debt (US$) 880.1m 840.1m (4.5%) Total unrestricted cash (US$) 19.0m 44.5m +134.2% Asset sales receivable (US$) 0.0m 21.0m n.a.

It assumes the Transaction was completed at the beginning of 2Q17 and includes adjustments which are directly attributable to the Transaction. UPDATED GUIDANCE\nIn respect of the full year 2018, FIBRAMQ re-iterates its expectation to make cash distributions of approximately Ps. 1.56 per certificate, payable in quarterly distributions of Ps. 0.39 per certificate.\nFIBRA Macquarie is updating its AFFO guidance for 2018, and estimates revised AFFO of between Ps. 2.19 and Ps. 2.24 per certificate, from its prior range of Ps. 2.25 to Ps. 2.30 per certificate. This reflects the Transaction’s net impact being an expected temporary AFFO reduction of Ps. 0.06 per certificate for 2018.\nThis guidance is based on the following assumptions:\nTransaction financial close in mid-2018 Based on the cash-generating capacity of its post-Transaction portfolio and an average exchange rate of Ps. 18.5 per US dollar for the remainder of the year, consistent with guidance provided to date No new acquisitions No further divestments Repurchase for cancellation of the remaining 21.4 million certificates available for buyback, resulting in an aggregate 5.0% of issued certificates being repurchased and cancelled, to close 2018 with 770.8 million certificates outstanding The payment of cash distributions is subject to the approval of the board of directors of the Manager, the continued stable performance of the properties in the portfolio, and market conditions.\nBased upon the mid-point of our revised 2018 guidance and closing certificate price on May 18, 2018 of Ps. 18.68, the current implied AFFO yield is 11.9% per annum, distribution yield is 8.4% per annum and AFFO payout ratio is approximately 70%.\nPRUDENT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nFIBRA Macquarie continues to source and deploy capital in a disciplined manner to maximize value to its investors on a per certificate basis. FIBRA Macquarie remains committed to utilizing retained AFFO and proceeds from our asset recycling program to deploy accretively across high quality property expansions and developments and certificate repurchases for cancellation.\nAbout FIBRA Macquarie\nFIBRA Macquarie México (FIBRA Macquarie) (BMV:FIBRAMQ) is a real estate investment trust (fideicomiso de inversión en bienes raíces), or FIBRA, listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores) targeting industrial, retail and office real estate opportunities in Mexico, with a primary focus on stabilized income-producing properties.
