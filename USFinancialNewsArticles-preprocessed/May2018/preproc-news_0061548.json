The Trust seeks to provide investors with long-term, stable value creation, while preserving the capital value of its investment portfolio through investment in a range of operational green energy, blockchain and cryptocurrency related assets. The Trust intends to qualify as a “mutual fund trust” under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the “ Tax Act ”). The Trust will not be a “SIFT trust” (as defined in the Tax Act), provided that the Trust complies at all times with its investment restriction which precludes the Trust from holding any “non-portfolio property” (as defined in the Tax Act). All material information about the Trust may be found under the Trust’s issuer profile at www.sedar.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release contain forward-looking information. Such forward-looking information may be identified by words such as “anticipates”, “plans”, “proposes”, “estimates”, “intends”, “expects”, “believes”, “may” and “will”. The are founded on the basis of expectations and assumptions made by the Trust. Details of the risk factors relating to Blockchain Power and its business are discussed under the heading “Business Risks and Uncertainties” in Blockchain Power’s annual management’s discussion & analysis dated May 15, 2018, a copy of which is available on Blockchain Power’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com . Most of these factors are outside the control of the Trust. Investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking information. These statements speak only as of the date of this press release. Except as otherwise required by applicable securities statutes or regulation, Blockchain Power expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNeither the TSXV nor its regulation services provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nThe Trust has included certain non-GAAP measures to supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with IFRS, including operating margin, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (“EBITDA”) and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation per Unit.\nOperating margin is calculated as cost of sales from revenues as follows:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018\n$ March 31, 2017\n$ Total revenue 5,059,499 2,779,970 Less:\n2,137,173\n778,565 Cost of sales excluding depreciation Operating margin 2,922,326 2,001,405 Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\n$ March 31, 2017\n$ (Loss) for the period\n(5,441,309\n)\n(3,833,821\n)\nAdd-back:\nInterest and finance charges\n2,922,326 2,029,536 Income tax recovery\n(35,278\n) (123,132 )\nDepreciation\n1,693,263 981,788\nFair value gain on debentures and conversion features\nLoss on settlement of debt\n(1,184,249)\n13,737,250 -\n320,254 Warrant revaluation\n(7,529,160\n) 2,072,830 Adjusted EBITDA\n3.218,552 1,447,455 Adjusted EBITDA per Unit\n0.02 0.03 The Trust believes that operating margin and adjusted EBITDA, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Trust. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other entities. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management's determination of the components of non-GAAP and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions, a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable. Any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable.\nSource:Blockchain Power Trust",
