FILE PHOTO: BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley addresses the gathering during a media interaction in New Delhi, India, June 15, 2017. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\nDudley’s remuneration rose by 13 percent to $13.4 million (10 million pounds) last year as the oil and gas giant’s profit more than doubled and production soared.\nIn 2016 Dudley’s pay package was cut by 40 percent after a majority of shareholders opposed the company’s pay policy.
