    "text": "Do you invest consistently? Generate passive income? Are you decisive?\nIf so, you could be on track to become a millionaire . No one can guarantee you'll reach seven-figure status, but if these routines, habits and personality traits describe you, you're doing something right.\nHere are 7 signs you could be on your way to striking it rich.\nYou have multiple streams of income As author Thomas C. Corley found in his multi-year study of self-made millionaires, the rich \"do not rely on one singular source of income,\" he writes in \" Change Your Habits, Change Your Life .\"\n\"Sixty-five percent had at least three streams of income that they created prior to making their first million dollars,\" Corley says, such as real-estate rentals , a side hustle or a part-time job.\nYou save to invest \" Investing money is how you will get super rich,\" says self-made millionaire Grant Cardone . \"The only reason to save money is to one day invest money.\"\nIn fact, how much you save and invest is often more important than the size of your paycheck. As personal finance expert Ramit Sethi writes in \" I Will Teach You to Be Rich \": \"On average, millionaires invest 20 percent of their household income each year. Their wealth isn't measured by the amount they make each year, but by how they've saved and invested over time.\"\nshow chapters Warren Buffett's secret to investing lays in the game of baseball 2:26 PM ET Thu, 2 Feb 2017 | 00:48 You surround yourself with high-achieving people \"You are only as successful as those you frequently associate with,\" Corley says .\nSteve Siebold, self-made millionaire and author of \" How Rich People Think ,\" agrees. \"Successful people generally agree that consciousness is contagious, and that exposure to people who are more successful has the potential to expand your thinking and catapult your income,\" he writes in his book. \"We become like the people we associate with, and that's why winners are attracted to winners.\"\nYou're decisive After studying over 500 millionaires, author Napoleon Hill found that they're good at making choices. As he writes in his 1937 personal finance classic, \" Think and Grow Rich \": \"Analysis of several hundred people who had accumulated fortunes well beyond the million dollar mark disclosed the fact that every one of them had the habit of reaching decisions promptly.\"\n\"Those who reach decisions promptly definitely know what they want, and generally get it.\"\nshow chapters This mindset is what separates the middle class from the millionaire class 11:09 AM ET Fri, 7 April 2017 | 00:55 You have specific goals for your money If you know exactly what you want, you're one step closer to achieving whatever it is you're aiming for.\nMost self-made millionaires plan to get rich and then make it happen, Corley's research finds . An overwhelming 80 percent of the wealthy are \"obsessed with pursuing goals,\" both daily and long-term, he writes.\nYou prefer books The rich \" would rather be educated than entertained,\" Siebold writes in \" How Rich People Think .\"\nThey appreciate the power of learning long after college or any formal education is over, he says: \"Walk into a wealthy person's home and one of the first things you'll see is an extensive library of books they've used to educate themselves on how to become more successful. The middle class reads novels, tabloids, and entertainment magazines.\"\nYou think big If you set your expectations exceptionally high and are up for any challenge, you're on the right track. After all, \"no one would ever strike it rich and live their dreams without huge expectations,\" Siebold writes.\nThis is an update of a previously published story.\nLike this story?
