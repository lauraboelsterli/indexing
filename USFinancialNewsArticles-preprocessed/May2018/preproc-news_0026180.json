    "text": "GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. (NASDAQ: CWCO), a leading developer and operator of seawater desalination plants, reported financial and operating results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\nPresident and CEO Rick McTaggart commented: \"Our core desalination business in the first quarter of 2018 remained consistent and in line with our expectations. A highlight was the strong performance of our Bulk segment, which experienced a 7% sales increase year-over-year due to higher volumes and energy pass-through charges in the Bahamas. Revenues in our Retail segment remained stable year-on-year as slightly higher sales volumes were offset by a shift in the sales mix to larger customers in Grand Cayman with a lower effective water rate.\n\"The timing of order bookings and the allocation of a portion of our manufacturing capacity to internal component production resulted in lower first quarter comparisons in our manufacturing segment. Our manufacturing operations produced approximately $700,000 worth of components for the refurbishment of our Bahamas Windsor plant. This project and the expansion of our Governor's Harbour plant in Grand Cayman resulted in higher capital expenditures in the first quarter but will lead to improved efficiencies for these plants,\" Mr. McTaggart noted.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $15.3 million, compared to $15.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit amounted to $6.6 million, compared to $6.8 million in the year ago quarter. Inclusive of $0.7 million Rosarito-related expenses, net income attributable to Consolidated Water stockholders was $2.1 million, or $0.14 per fully diluted share, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.18 per fully diluted share, reported in last year's first quarter.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $0.7 million, a significant improvement when compared to last year's $0.7 million of negative operating cash flow. Capital expenditures amounted to $2.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents were $43.7 million as of March 31, 2018.\nSegment Results\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 (Unaudited)\nRetail\nBulk\nServices\nManufacturing\nTotal\nRevenues\n$\n6,431,348\n$\n8,228,515\n$\n123,764\n$\n552,768\n$\n15,336,395\nCost of revenues\n2,761,554\n5,396,591\n134,871\n438,861\n8,731,877\nGross profit (loss)\n$\n3,669,794\n$\n2,831,924\n$\n(11,107)\n$\n113,907\n$\n6,604,518\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017 (Unaudited)\nRetail\nBulk\nServices\nManufacturing\nTotal\nRevenues\n$\n6,476,604\n$\n7,690,402\n$\n130,252\n$\n1,379,848\n$\n15,677,106\nCost of revenues\n2,684,286\n5,015,789\n102,166\n1,041,297\n8,843,538\nGross profit\n$\n3,792,318\n$\n2,674,613\n$\n28,086\n$\n338,551\n$\n6,833,568\nSummary and Outlook\n\"Our first quarter laid the groundwork for successes to come in the remainder of 2018.\nThe financial results from our core retail and bulk operations will continue to provide a solid foundation for other initiatives, and our capital expenditures in 2018 for these businesses will ensure their ongoing efficiency and reliability. Our manufacturing segment is anticipated to experience year-over-year revenue growth for the remainder of the year due to a significant pickup in orders during the first quarter from both existing and new customers. We will continue our progress with respect to the Rosarito project. In the first quarter, we executed a subscription agreement for the equity funding of Rosarito with SUEZ, a global leader in water treatment, and Greenfield, an affiliate of a leading U.S. asset management firm. The aggregate funding to be provided in the form of equity and subordinated shareholder loans is presently estimated at approximately 20% of the total cost of Phase 1 of the Project. NSC expects to generate a portion of its funding for AdR through the sale to AdR of the land it has purchased for the Project. Going forward, we expect to complete the negotiation and execution of the debt financing agreements and be able to obtain all outstanding permits from the federal, state and municipal authorities.\n\"Given our strong balance sheet and cash position supporting our growth opportunities and dividend payments, our capital allocation priorities remain the same,\" Mr. McTaggart concluded.\nInvestor Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (EDT) on Friday, May 11, 2018 to review the Company's operating results for the first quarter of 2018, along with other relevant topics of interest.
