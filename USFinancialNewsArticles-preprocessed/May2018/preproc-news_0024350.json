(NYSE: ZTO) (\"ZTO\" or the \"Company\") , a leading and fast-growing express delivery company in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 [1] .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenues [2] were RMB3,544.4 million (US$565.1 million), an increase of 35.6% from RMB2,614.6 million in the same period of 2017. Gross profit was RMB1,032.1 million (US$164.5 million), an increase of 41.3% from RMB730.6 million in the same period of 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA [3] was RMB1,099.1 million (US$175.2 million), an increase of 36.5% from RMB805.0 million in the same period of 2017. Adjusted net income [4] was RMB757.2 million (US$120.7 million), an increase of 50.5% from RMB503.1 million in the same period of 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per American depositary share (\"ADS\" [5] ) were RMB0.78 (US$0.12), compared to RMB0.70 in the same period of 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB214.2 million (US$34.1 million), compared with RMB331.5 million in the same period of 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational Highlights\nParcel volume in the first quarter of 2018 was 1,599 million, an increase of 36.0% from 1,175 million in the same period last year. Number of pickup/delivery outlets was around 28,700 as of March 31, 2018. Number of network partners was over 9,300, which included over 3,900 direct network partners and over 5,400 indirect network partners as of March 31, 2018. Number of line-haul vehicles was over 4,600 as of March 31, 2018, which included around 3,500 self-owned vehicles and around 1,100 vehicles owned and operated by Tonglu Tongze Logistics Ltd., a transportation operator that works exclusively for ZTO. Number of self-owned trucks decreased to over 3,500 as of March 31, 2018, from 3,600 as of December 31, 2017, however, among which the number of high capacity 15-17 meter long models increased to over 1,900 as of March 31, 2018, compared to over 1,800 as of December 31, 2017.

The January 1, 2018 balance of retained earnings was not adjusted due to the immaterial cumulative net impact of adopting ASC 606. The impact of applying ASC 606 as compared with previous guidance applied to revenues and costs was not material .\n[3] Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net income before depreciation, amortization, interest expenses and income tax expenses, and further adjusted to exclude the shared-based compensation expense.\n[4] Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net income before share-based compensation expense.\n[5] One ADS represents one Class A ordinary share.\nMr. Meisong Lai, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ZTO, commented \"Driven largely by strong growth in e-commerce, express delivery volumes grew faster than anticipated during the quarter providing us with an opportunity to respond quickly and benefit from the growth. Our parcel volumes grew 36% to reach 1.6 billion which increased our market share to 16.1% from 15.5% just a quarter ago. At the same time, we generated strong profit growth with adjusted net income increasing over 50% year-over-year from RMB503.1 million to RMB757.2 million.\"\n\"During the first quarter, we continued to focus on strengthening our sorting and transit capabilities and efficiencies, and network stability. More high capacity trailer trucks were put into service, which combined with better route planning, resulted in increased transit efficiency. The various types of automated sorting equipment installed last year successfully ramped up capacity to handle the increased volumes during the first quarter with improved sorting efficiency. Meanwhile, we continued to fine tune the structure of our network of partners, further improving their economics and strengthening relationships. In addition, our continued investment into developing technology is providing a wide array of integrated data-driven tools that allow employees and partners across our ecosystem to connect and collaborate. We have also begun focusing on creating more organizational efficiencies. Sorting and transit hubs managers have been given greater autonomy to pursue and implement solutions aimed at developing synergies and more efficient use of existing resources. Recent organizational changes at headquarters and renewed leadership are cutting down corporate barriers and allowing operations to become more effective.\"\nMr. Lai concluded, \"We got off to a good start in 2018 and are excited about the growth opportunities in China's express delivery industry. Our overall goal is to outpace the industry average growth rate by 10 percentage points each year while providing high quality of services and generating superior profit, and solidify our leadership position in the market.\"\nMs. Huiping Yan, Chief Financial Officer of ZTO, added, \"Our focus on operational excellence and corporate responsiveness allowed us to quickly adapt to a surge in growth from e-commerce during the quarter and resulted in both the parcel volume and adjusted net income exceeding expectations. Gross margin rose to 29.1% year over year from 27.9% mainly driven by efficiency gains in transportation and sorting operations. As a percentage of revenues, sorting hub cost and line-haul transportation cost decreased to 19.4% and 33.4% this quarter, respectively, from 21.3% and 42.8% last year, respectively. Prioritize volume growth by strengthening and relying on Company's competitive advantages allowed us to maintain high quality of services and deliver healthy profit expansion.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2017\n2018\nRMB\n%\nRMB\nUS$\n%\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nExpress delivery services\n2,510,668\n96.0\n3,086,997\n492,140\n87.1\nFreight forwarding services\n-\n-\n293,275\n46,755\n8.3\nSale of accessories\n103,926\n4.0\n150,843\n24,048\n4.3\nOthers\n-\n-\n13,289\n2,118\n0.3\nTotal revenues\n2,614,594\n100.0\n3,544,404\n565,061\n100.0\nRevenues were RMB3,544.4 million (US$565.1 million), an increase of 35.6% from RMB2,614.6 million in the same period of 2017. Revenue from express delivery services increased by 23.0% compared to the same period of 2017, mainly driven by a 36% increase in parcel volume and partially offset by the decrease in unit price per parcel as a result of a decrease in weight per parcel. Freight forwarding services acquired during the fourth quarter of 2017 contributed revenue of RMB293.3 million during the first quarter of 2018. The increase in revenue from sales of accessories was mainly due to the increase of sales in thermal paper used for printing of digital waybills. Other revenues are composed of exploratory new service offerings such as cloud warehousing solutions.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2017\n2018\nRMB\n% of\nrevenues\nRMB\nUS$\n% of\nrevenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nLine-haul transportation cost\n1,120,089\n42.8\n1,183,638\n188,700\n33.4\nSorting hub cost\n556,186\n21.3\n686,437\n109,434\n19.4\nFreight forwarding cost\n-\n-\n283,670\n45,224\n8.0\nCost of accessories sold\n62,448\n2.4\n88,717\n14,144\n2.5\nOther costs\n145,222\n5.6\n269,816\n43,014\n7.6\nTotal cost of revenues\n1,883,945\n72.1\n2,512,278\n400,516\n70.9\nTotal cost of revenues were RMB2,512.3 million (US$400.5 million), an increase of 33.4% from RMB1,883.9 million in the same period last year. Total cost of revenues includes RMB283.7 million in costs associated with the freight forwarding business acquired during the fourth quarter of 2017, which is mainly composed of shipping, last-mile delivery, and cargo handling costs.\nLine haul transportation cost was RMB1,183.6 million (US$188.7 million), an increase of 5.7% from RMB1,120.1 million in the same period last year. As a percentage of revenues, line-haul transportation cost decreased to 33.4% from 42.8% in the same period last year, which was mainly driven by (i) a decrease in weight per parcel, and (ii) increased usage of self-owned and more efficient high capacity trailer trucks. The total transportation cost of self-owned trucks accounted for 53.4% of the total truck transportation cost in this quarter, compared to 40.6% in the same period last year. Sorting hub operating cost was RMB686.4 million (US$109.4 million), an increase of 23.4% from RMB556.2 million in the same period last year. As a percentage of revenues, sorting hub cost decreased to 19.4% from 21.3% in the same period last year, mainly due to the increased level of automation in the Company's sorting facilities which offset a portion of the continuous increase in labor cost per headcount. As of March 31, 2018, 59 sets of automation sorting equipment have been put into use, compared to 17 sets as of March 31, 2017. As a result, the average number of headcount of sorting hub workers increased by only 7% when compared to the first quarter of 2017, significantly less than the 36.0% increase in parcel volume during the first quarter of 2018. Cost of accessories was RMB88.7 million (US$14.1 million), an increase of 42.1% from RMB62.4 million in the same period last year. The increase was in line with the increase in the sale of thermal paper for waybill printing by 59.0% compared to the same period last year. Other costs were RMB269.8 million (US$43.0 million), increased by RMB124.6 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to (i) an increase of RMB60.5 million (US$9.6 million) in dispatching costs associated with serving enterprise customers, (ii) an increase of RMB46.6 million (US$7.4 million) in the taxes surcharge, and (iii) an increase of RMB24.6 million (US$3.9 million) in the IT related expenses.\nGross Profit was RMB1,032.1 million (US$164.5 million), an increase of 41.3% from RMB730.6 million in the same period last year. Gross margin increased to 29.1% from 27.9% in the same period last year, mainly attributable to the savings in the transportation and sorting cost.\nTotal Operating Expenses were RMB333.7 million (US$53.2 million), compared to RMB73.9 million in the same period last year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were RMB415.6 million (US$66.3 million), compared to RMB162.0 million in the same period last year. The increase was mainly due to (i) an increase in share-based compensation expenses from RMB0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB199.7 million (US$31.8 million) in the first quarter of 2018, (ii) an increase of salary and accrued bonus of RMB31.9 million, and (iii) an increase of fixed assets disposal loss of RMB9.8 million. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses accounted for 11.7%, compared to 6.2% during the same period last year, primarily due to the one-time impact from share-based compensation expenses in the first quarter of 2018. Other operating income, net was RMB81.9 million (US$13.1 million), compared to RMB88.0 million in the same period last year. Other operating income mainly includes the subsidy income of RMB71.9 million (US$11.5 million) and RMB95.0 million received in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIncome from operations was RMB698.4 million (US$111.3 million), an increase of 6.3% from RMB656.7 million in the same period last year. Operating margin decreased to 19.7% from 25.1% in the same period last year, of which, 5.6% decrease was attributable to the impact from the share-based compensation expenses.\nInterest income was RMB60.3 million (US$9.6 million), compared with RMB28.6 million in the same period in 2017, primarily due to the increased amount of cash and interest-earning bank deposits since the Company's initial public offering in October 2016.\nInterest expense was RMB0.8 million (US$0.1 million) on bank borrowings, compared with RMB5.7 million in the same period in 2017, as a result of the decreased balance in short term loans during the first quarter of 2018.\nForeign currency exchange loss, before tax was RMB36.8 million (US$5.9 million), which was mainly due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Chinese renminbi.\nNet income was RMB557.5 million (US$88.9 million), compared with RMB502.9 million in the same period last year.\nBasic and diluted earnings per ADS were RMB0.78 (US$0.12), compared with basic and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.70 in the same period last year.\nAdjusted net income was RMB757.2 million (US$120.7 million), compared with adjusted net income of RMB503.1 million during the same quarter last year.\nEBITDA was RMB899.4 million (US$143.4 million), compared with RMB804.8 million in the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was RMB1,099.1 million (US$175.2 million), compared to RMB805.0 million in the same period last year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was RMB214.2 million (US$34.1 million), compared with 331.5 million in the same period last year. Net cash provided by operating activities reflected RMB119.3 million (US$19.0 million) of short-term financing provided to network partners for general operating activities, and an estimated RMB160 million of income taxes incurred for 2017 and paid during the first quarter of 2018 which will be refunded from tax authority due to reduced income tax rate applicable for high and new technology enterprises.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on current market conditions and current operations, the Company's parcel volume for the second quarter of 2018 is expected to be in the range of 2,020 million to 2,060 million, representing a 35.3% to 38.0% increase year over year, and the Company's adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of RMB1,000 million (US$159.4 million) to RMB1,050 million (US$167.4 million), representing a 36.9% to 43.8% increase from the same period of 2017. These estimates represent management's current and preliminary view, which are subject to change.\nCompany Share Purchase\nOn May 21, 2017, the Company announced a share repurchase program whereby ZTO is authorized to repurchase its own Class A ordinary shares in the form of ADSs with an aggregate value of up to US$300 million during the 12-month period thereafter.
