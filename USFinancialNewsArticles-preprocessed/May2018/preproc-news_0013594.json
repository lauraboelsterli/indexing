(NASDAQ: CBPO, \"China Biologic\" or the \"Company\"), a leading fully integrated plasma-based biopharmaceutical company in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal sales in the first quarter of 2018 increased by 13.7% in RMB terms and 23.0% in USD terms to $112.5 million from $91.5 million in the same quarter of 2017. Gross profit increased by 33.1% to $78.8 million from $59.2 million in the same quarter of 2017. Gross margin increased to 70.0% from 64.8% in the same quarter of 2017. Income from operations increased by 0.5% to $39.0 million from $38.8 million in the same quarter of 2017. Operating margin decreased to 34.7% from 42.4% in the same quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to the Company increased by 5.3% to $31.6 million from $30.0 million in the same quarter of 2017. Fully d iluted earnings per share decreased to $0.92 compared to $1.06 in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to the Company increased by 2.1% in RMB terms and 10.4% in USD terms to $41.3 million from $37.4 million in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share decreased to $1.21 from $1.32 in the same quarter of 2017. Certain income statement and balance sheet items impacted by the TianXinFu acquisition are presented for comparison purposes.\nMr. David (Xiaoying) Gao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of China Biologic, commented, \"We began 2018 with a challenging first quarter of 2018 was worse than we anticipated due to the ongoing impact of government reform measures on China's healthcare market. The trend of many regional hospitals reducing purchases on certain high-unit-price plasma products at the end of 2017 to comply with the strict policy of capping the revenue from drug sales to 30% of the total revenue of a hospital continued in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted in a high double digit sales revenue decline in our direct sales channel. Our prices in the distribution channel also face increased pressure with more intensified competition among all major plasma products. To offset the deceleration of volume growth associated with ongoing healthcare reform, we continued to enhance marketing and promotional activities to pursue new sales channels and strategic partners, including new distributors and retail pharmacy chains which together achieved 20% year over year growth. The revenue contribution from placenta polypeptide continued to grow approximately 45% in RMB terms in the first quarter, reflecting an increased proportion of higher-invoiced shipments due to the wider implementation of the two-invoice policy. While the TianXinFu business demonstrated softer performance as anticipated in the first quarter of 2018, we expect the business will experience greater levels of growth in the remaining quarters of the year.\"\n\"Despite our first quarter challenges, we achieved notable operational progress in our business. We began full operations at the new Shandong facility in late February, received the long-awaited operating permit at the Daming plasma collection station in early March and commenced commercial plasma collection immediately thereafter, and construction of our Feicheng branch plasma collection facility remains on track for completion by the middle of this year. In addition, the construction of our new Wenchang station in Hainan Province remains on track, and the station is expected to obtain the operating permit to begin commercial operations before the end of this year.\"\n\"We remain focused on solidifying our leading market position by broadening our sales channels, exploring new growth opportunities to offset the impact of ongoing healthcare reform, and further investing in medical marketing with our internal sales force as well as utilizing TianXinFu's team to support our newly launched products. In addition, we remain committed to managing public tenders in local markets to secure optimized pricing and increasing our profitability by accelerating the commercial launch time of our various pipeline products. Despite the challenges we are facing, we remain optimistic about the long-term development of China's plasma industry,\" concluded Mr. Gao.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Performance\nTotal sales in the first quarter of 2018 increased by 13.7% in RMB terms, or 23.0% in USD terms due to favorable exchange rate benefit, to $112.5 million from $91.5 million in the same quarter of 2017, primarily attributable to $11.4 million contribution from TianXinFu, accounting for approximately 10.1% of total sales for the quarter. Excluding TianXinFu, total sales in the first quarter of 2018 increased by 2.2% in RMB terms, as a combined result of an increase in the sales of placenta polypeptide products and certain immunoglobulin products, which was partly offset by the decrease in the sales of human albumin and IVIG products.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, human albumin and IVIG products remained the Company's two largest sales contributors. As a percentage of total sales, sales from human albumin and IVIG products were 30.1% and 28.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the contribution from TianXinFu, human albumin and IVIG products were 33.4% and 31.4% of total sales, respectively, which was a decrease from 40.3% and 34.8% respectively in the first quarter of 2017, mainly reflecting the combined effects of decreased sales volume and sales prices year-over-year.\nThe sales volume of human albumin and IVIG products decreased by 12.0% and 6.2%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter of 2017, reflecting the decreased purchase volumes at various hospitals due to government healthcare reform measures.\nThe average price for human albumin and IVIG products decreased by 3.7% and 1.3%, respectively, in RMB terms in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter of 2017, mainly due to further price discounts to certain distributors, which reflected intensified market competition for major plasma products. In USD terms, the average price for human albumin and IVIG products increased by 4.2% and 6.7% year-over-year, respectively.\nRevenue from human hyper-immunoglobulin products increased by 56.4% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter of 2017, reaching 11.5% of total sales, mainly due to the increase in sales volume of human rabies immunoglobulin products.\nRevenue from coagulation factor products, including human coagulation factor VIII, human prothrombin complex concentrate and newly launched human fibrinogen products, increased by 48.2% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter of 2017, representing 5.7% of total sales. The growth mainly came from the human fibrinogen products launched by the Company from the beginning of 2018, as well as an increase in sales volume of human prothrombin complex concentrate products, reflective of the Company's ongoing medical marketing activities.\nRevenue from placenta polypeptide products increased by 45.2% in RMB terms, or 57.1% in USD terms, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter of 2017, reaching 14.3% of total sales, supported by higher unit selling prices due to wider implementation of the two-invoice policy, partially offset by lower sales volume due to the government's control on medical insurance spending.\nCost of sales increased by 4.3% to $33.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter of 2017. As a percentage of total sales, cost of sales decreased to 30.0% from 35.2% in the same quarter of 2017. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of total sales mainly reflected a higher gross margin of TianXinFu. Excluding TianXinFu, cost of sales was 32.2% of total sales, also lower than the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to the higher sales price of placenta polypeptide product.\nGross profit increased by 33.1% to $78.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $59.2 million in the same quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 70.0% and 64.8% in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 was $39.8 million, compared to $20.4 million in the same quarter of 2017. As a percentage of total sales, total operating expenses increased to 35.4% in the first quarter of 2018 from 22.4% in the same quarter of 2017. Excluding TianXinFu, total operating expenses increased by $14.3 million, or 70.1%, to $34.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase mainly consisted of an increase of $13.1 million in selling expenses.\nSelling expenses in the first quarter of 2018 was $20.7 million, compared to $3.8 million in the same quarter of 2017. More than half of the increase was related to the sales of placenta polypeptide products, with the remainder related to the sales of plasma products and TianXinFu's sales of its dura mater products. For placenta polypeptide products and certain hyper-immune products, as certain previous multiple layers of distribution channels were disqualified due to the two-invoice regulation, the Company implemented new sales strategies including using an internal sales force or engaging third party contract service organizations to promote its placenta polypeptide products. For other plasma products, in order to solidify its competitiveness within distribution channel customers, the Company incurred additional promotion and marketing costs. TianXinFu's selling expenses included a $2.0 million amortization expense for the intangible asset of customer relationships associated with the Company's acquisition of TianXinFu. Excluding this intangible asset amortization expense, selling expenses accounted for 16.7% of total sales of the Company in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.2% in the same quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 was $17.4 million, compared to $15.2 million in the same quarter of 2017. As a percentage of total sales, general and administrative expenses were 15.5% and 16.7% in the first quarter of 2018 and the same quarter of 2017, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to a $0.9 million increase of share-based compensation expenses. Excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses would have been 7.4% and 7.9% of total sales in the first quarter of 2018 and the same quarter of 2017, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.7 million, compared to $1.4 million in the same quarter of 2017. As a percentage of total sales, research and development expenses remained stable at 1.5% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter of 2017.\nIncome from operations for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 0.5% to $39.0 million from $38.8 million in the same period of 2017. Operating margin decreased to 34.7% in the first quarter of 2018 from 42.4% in the same quarter of 2017.\nIncome tax expense was $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $7.0 million in the same period of 2017. The effective income tax rate was 15.1% and 16.8% for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease of the effective income tax was mainly due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as a deduction from income tax expense in the first quarter of 2018.\nNet income attributable to the Company increased by 5.3% to $31.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $30.0 million in the same quarter of 2017. Net margin decreased to 28.1% in the first quarter of 2018 from 32.8% in the same quarter of 2017. Diluted net earnings per share decreased to $0.92 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.06 in the same quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to the Company increased by 2.1% in RMB terms, or 10.4% in USD terms, to $41.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $37.4 million in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net margin decreased to 36.7% in the first quarter of 2018 from 40.9% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share decreased to $1.21 in the first quarter of 2018 from $1.32 in the same quarter of 2017. Excluding TianXinFu, Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to the Company decreased by 12.1% in RMB terms, or 4.8% in USD terms in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 exclude $8.3 million in non-cash employee share-based compensation expenses and $1.5 million in intangible assets amortization expense related to the acquisition of TianXinFu.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $118.2 million in cash and cash equivalents , primarily consisting of cash on hand and demand deposits, $106.6 million in time deposits and $141.9 million in financial instruments .\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $23.3 million, including a $4.5 million contribution from TianXinFu, compared to $13.0 million for the same quarter of 2017. Excluding TianXinFu, the $5.8 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was a combined result of 1) the benefit from an increase of other payables and accrued liabilities, an increase of advance from customers, and a slowdown of increase in account receivable, and 2) the negative impact from a decrease in net income, a decrease in accounts payable, an increase in prepayments and deferred expenses as well as inventory compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nExcluding TianXinFu, the other payables and accrued liabilities increased by $8.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a decrease of $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase mainly reflected more marketing activities carried out by third party contract service organizations that the Company engaged to promote placenta polypeptide and certain plasma products in complying with the two-invoice policy.\nExcluding TianXinFu, accounts receivable increased by $15.5 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $17.6 million in the same quarter of 2017. The accounts receivable turnover days for plasma products increased to 84 days during the first quarter of 2018 from 46 days in the same quarter of 2017, reflecting longer credit terms to hospitals as a result of the nationwide implementation of healthcare reform measures and intensified competition in the distribution channel.\nExcluding TianXinFu, inventories increased by $10.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $9.1 million in the same quarter of 2017. This increase was a result of an increase in raw materials due to downwardly adjusted plasma throughput, reflecting weaker market demand due to a more aggressive-than-expected implementation of certain government healthcare reform policies.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $135.5 million compared to $9.1 million for the same quarter of 2017. Net cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2018 mainly consisted of $264.7 million payment for purchase of time deposits and financial instruments, $11.3 million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and land use rights, which was partly offset by $97.7 million cash received upon acquisition of TianXinFu and the maturity of $42.8 million time deposits and financial instruments. In the same quarter of 2017, the Company paid $9.1 million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and land use rights for Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.3 million compared to $8.8 million for the same quarter of 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of 2018 represented proceeds of $0.3 million from stock options exercised. The net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of 2017 mainly consisted of an $8.7 million short-term loan.\nFinancial Outlook Update for 2018\nFor the full year of 2018, the Company previously published a guidance of total sales growth of 18% to 20% in RMB terms and non-GAAP adjusted net income growth of 16% to 18% in RMB terms over 2017 financial results. Excluding TianXinFu, sales for 2018 are expected to grow 6% to 8% in RMB terms, and non-GAAP adjusted net income is expected to grow 3% to 4% in RMB terms over 2017 financial results. The 2018 non-GAAP adjusted net income projection excludes non-cash employee share-based compensation expenses and non-cash intangible assets amortization expense associated with the TianXinFu acquisition.\nHowever, given the worse-than-expected first quarter results due to ongoing impact of regulatory changes, the Company expects that it will be challenging to meet its previously published full year guidance. The Company is actively evaluating the evolving regulatory environment and competition dynamics and may lower its full year guidance should there be no significant improvement in the business operating conditions for the remainder of the year.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 7:30 am Eastern Time on May 7, 2018, which is 7:30 pm Beijing Time on May 7, 2018, to discuss its first quarter 2018 results and answer questions from investors.
