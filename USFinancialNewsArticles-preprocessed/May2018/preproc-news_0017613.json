    "text": "First Quarter Net Sales of $569 million; Diluted EPS (Loss) of $(0.99)\nProvides Second Quarter Guidance and Updates Fiscal 2018 Guidance\nRICHARDSON, Texas, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) (the “Company” or “Fossil Group”) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company reported net income (loss) for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $(48.3) million compared to $(48.2) million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings (loss) per share were $(0.99), as compared to $(1.00) for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Currencies, including both the translation impact on operating earnings and the impact of foreign currency hedging contracts, favorably affected the year-over-year earnings (loss) per share comparison by $0.02\nKosta Kartsotis, Chairman and CEO, commented: “We had an encouraging start to the year, delivering first quarter sales results that were stronger than our expectations. This performance reflects the disciplined execution of our strategy which capitalizes on our strong design, innovation, distribution and operating capabilities. These core capabilities, when combined with powerful global brand portfolio, drove our connected watch sales and helped improve traditional watch performance, while increasing efficiencies across our enterprise. During the first quarter, connected watch sales nearly doubled, FOSSIL brand watch sales grew 4% globally and comparable retail sales increased 5%. Following quarter end, we were pleased to announce Puma as our new licensed watch brand. We are excited to add this strong global brand to our portfolio, with plans to begin distribution of Puma watches in 2019. We believe we have the right strategies, brands and balance sheet strength to continue to transform our Company and ultimately return to long term profitable growth.”\nOperating Results\nCompared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar increased the Company’s fiscal 2018 reported net sales by $30.1 million and operating income by $9.0 million. The discussion of the Company’s net sales is presented on a GAAP basis and in constant dollars and reflects regional performance based on sales in all channels within the geographic location.\nThe following table provides a summary of net sales performance, on both a reported and constant currency basis, for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the fiscal 2017 first quarter (in millions, except percentage data).\nFirst Quarter 2018 2017 Growth (Decline) Amounts as\nReported Amounts as\nReported Dollars as\nReported\n(1) Constant\nCurrency\nDollars (2) Percentage\nas\nReported\n(1) Percentage\nConstant\nCurrency\n(2) Americas $ 249 $ 277 $ (28 ) $ (30 ) (10 )% (11 )% Europe 202 196 6 (16 ) 3 (8 ) Asia 118 109 9 3 9 3 Total net sales $ 569 $ 582 $ (13 ) $ (43 ) (2 )% (7 )% Watches $ 448 $ 450 $ (2 ) $ (25 ) — % (6 )% Leathers 69 73 (4 ) (7 ) (5 ) (9 ) Jewelry 42 48 (6 ) (9 ) (13 ) (20 ) Other 10 11 (1 ) (2 ) (8 ) (15 ) Total net sales $ 569 $ 582 $ (13 ) $ (43 ) (2 )% (7 )% (1) Reported GAAP amounts include impacts from currency. (2) Eliminates the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2018 to give investors a better understanding of the underlying trends within the business. See constant currency financial information at the end of this release for more information. First quarter fiscal 2018 worldwide net sales decreased $12.6 million or 2% and $42.7 million in constant currency (a 7% decline) compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Watches declined in the Americas and Europe and increased in Asia, with growth in connected watches and declines in traditional watches in all geographies on a constant currency basis. Geographically, sales declines in the U.S. drove the decrease in the Americas. In Europe, on a constant currency basis, sales across the Eurozone and in distributor markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East declined moderately with the largest declines in the United Kingdom and France. In Asia, sales increases in India, China and Malaysia were partially offset by declines in Japan and the distributor markets.\nGlobal retail comps for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with positive comps in the watch and leather categories partially offset by negative comps in jewelry. Positive comps in the Americas and Asia were partially offset by a decline in Europe.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2018, gross margin increased 70 basis points to 50.5%. Gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 150 basis points due to currency movements, mainly due to a stronger Euro and British pound, as well as benefits generated by the Company's New World Fossil (\"NWF\") margin improvement initiatives. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable factory absorption on lower sales volumes, an increased sales mix of connected products, which carry lower overall margins and higher volumes of off-price sales as the Company remains focused on right-sizing its inventory position.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s operating expenses were $316.0 million, including $21.3 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to employee costs and store closings, as compared to $26.3 million of restructuring costs in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Expenses were lower compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of corporate and regional infrastructure reductions driven by our New World Fossil initiatives, as well as lower store expenses given the significant number of stores closures since the first quarter of last year, partially offset by the currency effects of a weaker dollar.\nOperating income (loss) for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 improved by $17 million to $(28.3) million, driven by reduced operating expenses, partially offset by lower sales and gross margin.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2018, interest expense increased $2.3 million to $10.7 million. Other income (expense) decreased $7.5 million to $(1.9) million, primarily due to net foreign currency contract losses compared to net gains in the prior fiscal year first quarter.\nIncome tax expenses were $6.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and included impacts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") that was signed into law in December 2017, as well as charges related to valuation allowances established on the Company’s deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company’s effective income tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was (16.3)%, compared to 2.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAccounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company has made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements for fiscal 2018. As the Company collects and prepares necessary data, and interprets any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act will be completed in 2018.\nGuidance\nOver the next several years, Fossil Group will continue to transform the Company’s business model to address changes in consumer behaviors and their purchases of traditional watches and connected devices, as well as jewelry and leathers. During the Company’s ongoing transformation project, it believes certain operating metrics are the most appropriate performance measures. These metrics include net sales, gross margin, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), interest expense, income (loss) before income taxes and Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Company is providing guidance on a GAAP basis. For comparison purposes, the Company has also provided additional information which quantifies the estimated impact on its operating expenses and operating income for non-operational items impacting operating results for fiscal 2018 and the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nGAAP Guidance\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company expects the following:\nNet sales in the range of (12)% to (5)% Gross margin in the range of 51% to 53% Operating expenses as a percent of net sales, including restructuring charges, ranging from 48.5% to 50.5% Operating margin in the range of 0.5% to 4.5% Other income (expense) of approximately $(10) million based on prevailing currency rates Interest expense of approximately $50 million Income (loss) before income taxes in the range of $(40) million to $50 million\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects the following:\nNet sales in the range of (11)% to (4)% Gross margin in the range of 51.5% to 53.5% Operating expenses as a percent of net sales, including restructuring charges, ranging from 55.5% to 58.0% Operating margin in the range of (6.5)% to (2.0)% Other income (expense) of approximately $(3) million based on prevailing currency rates\nInterest expense of approximately $13 million Income (loss) before income taxes in the range of $(50) million to $(30) million\nAdjusted EBITDA is non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, guidance or financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as the sum of income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, amortization and depreciation and other non-cash charges (such as impairment), stock-based compensation expenses, and restructuring charges minus interest income. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors about the Company's operating performance on a constant currency basis for the periods presented without the impact of certain items. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its operating performance period-over-period. The Company expects the following during fiscal 2018:\nNon-operational and Non-GAAP Items\nFor fiscal 2018:\nRestructuring charges of approximately $55 million Adjusted EBITDA of $175 million to $225 million\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018:\nRestructuring charges of approximately $18 million Adjusted EBITDA of $0 million to $30 million\nBelow is a reconciliation of forward-looking income (loss) before income taxes to Adjusted EBITDA for first quarter 2018 actual and fiscal year 2018 guidance based on the mid-point of the Company's guidance range:\nFiscal 2018\nFull Year ($ in millions): 2018\nGuidance 2017\nActual Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ — $ (454 ) Plus: Interest Expense 50 43 Amortization and Depreciation 70 81 Impairment Expense — 411 Other Non-cash Charges 7 46 Stock-based Compensation 26 31 Restructuring Expense 55 48 Less: Interest Income 3 5 Adjusted EBITDA $ 205 $ 201 Second Quarter Fiscal 2018\nSecond Quarter ($ in millions): 2018\nGuidance 2017\nActual Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ (40 ) $ (439 ) Plus: Interest Expense 13 12 Amortization and Depreciation 18 21 Impairment Expense — 409 Other Non-cash Charges — 7 Stock-based Compensation 7 8 Restructuring Expense 18 10 Less: Interest Income 1 1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 15 $ 27 First Quarter Fiscal 2018\nFirst Quarter Actual ($ in millions): 2018 2017 Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ (41 ) $ (48 ) Plus: Interest Expense 11 8 Amortization and Depreciation 16 21 Impairment Expense — 1 Other Non-cash Charges 7 3 Stock-based Compensation 4 6 Restructuring Expense 21 26 Less: Interest Income — 1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 18 $ 16 Note that due to relatively low levels of income (loss) before income taxes in the near term, as well as the combined impact of the modified territorial tax program under the Tax Act and deferred tax asset valuation reserve accounting, the Company’s effective tax rate is expected to have unusual variations and occasionally an inverse relationship to income (loss) before income taxes.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including multi-year profit improvement estimates, the success of our connected accessories, future financial guidance as well as estimated impacts from the Tax Act, foreign currency translation, amortization expense, foreign tax credits, non-cash impairments and restructuring charges, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
