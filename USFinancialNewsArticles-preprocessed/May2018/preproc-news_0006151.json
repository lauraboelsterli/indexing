(“Pete”) Grum, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rand Capital, commented, “In the quarter we made two follow-on investments totaling $450,000. The first was in one of our newer portfolio companies, Centivo, which we started investing in last year. The other was in one of our long-standing holdings, SciAps, in which we have been investing since 2013. Both investments were part of capital raises to support these companies’ growth.”\nDuring the quarter, Rand consolidated the majority of its investments and cash of its newly formed Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) applicant fund, Rand SBIC II, into its original SBIC fund.\nMr. Grum noted, “We have finalized our strategy with the SBA and have consolidated our SBIC funds as the first step. We can now begin the application process for $6 million minimum of additional leverage in 2018. We are excited to expand our longstanding relationship with the SBA.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nReported $4.97 net asset value (NAV) per share at March 31, 2018, compared with $5.05 at December 31, 2017. Supported two current portfolio companies with $450,000 of investments during the quarter: Centivo Corporation $200,000 SciAps, Inc. $250,000 Investment income increased 10.4% over the prior-year first quarter. At March 31, 2018, portfolio fair value was $32.2 million and consolidated cash was $5.5 million.\nTotal investment income in the first quarter of 2018 grew to approximately $363,000, up from approximately $329,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The $34,000 increase was driven by the Company’s success with focusing investments in income producing instruments. Total expenses in the 2018 and 2017 first quarters were approximately $589,000 and $516,000, respectively.\nSelected Portfolio Highlights\nACV Auctions, Inc. , the leading dealer-to-dealer full-service wholesale online auction platform, reached a major milestone in March selling more than 5,000 units online for a total of more than $35 million in vehicle inventory sold. The rapidly growing automotive company is increasing vehicle sales at a rate of 400 percent per year, including over 500 new dealer sign-ups per month. ACV Auctions operates and sells vehicles in 52 markets throughout the East Coast and Midwest. By the end of 2018, the company expects to be in over 70 markets by expanding to the West Coast. ACV Auctions' world-class technology modernizes the wholesale auction operation, including title management, floor plan purchasing, arbitration and facilitating the transportation of the vehicles. Rand’s initial $163,000 investment in 2016 has a fair market value of $282,000 at March 31, 2018. SciAps, Inc. develops portable analytical instruments that identify virtually any compound, mineral or element on earth. The company recently introduced a new Scrapper X-250, which is an X-ray analyzer designed from the ground up to be the fastest scrap sorter in existence. It measures magnesium up to 10 times faster than any other X-ray gun, which is one of the keys to highly accurate aluminum alloy testing. SciAps recently completed a Series D $10 million financing round, in which Rand invested $250,000 during the first quarter. This represents Rand’s tenth investment in SciAps. At March 31, 2018, Rand’s investment in SciAps was valued at approximately $2.0 million. OutMatch Holdings, LLC is a leader in delivering actionable predictive analytics to build world-class workforces and is transforming the world of work by helping companies hire, retain and develop great talent. The company experienced a breakthrough year in 2017, fueled by the acquisition of a leading culture analytics firm and the launch of its robust new platform. Outmatch gained 60 new clients and its client retention rate was 98% which drove double-digit year-over-year recurring revenue growth. For 2018, the company is developing enhancements to expand its candidate assessment platform, broadening its OutMatch Impact. They recently announced the launch of two new solutions, which include the industry’s fastest pre-hire assessment and OutMatch Bridge, an exclusive solution that allows point-and-click integration of assessments into applicant tracking systems. At March 31, 2018, Rand’s investment in OutMatch was valued at approximately $2.1 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Rand’s portfolio consisted of 30 active companies. At that date, the portfolio was comprised of approximately 60% in equity investments and 40% in debt investments, compared with 63% in equity investments and 37% in debt investments at March 31, 2017. The change in investment mix reflects Rand’s goal to generate sufficient investment income to cover operating expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nRand will host a conference call and live webcast today, May 2, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time to review its financial condition and results for the 2018 first quarter, as well as its strategy and outlook.
