These statements include: (1) statements regarding our ability to continue to drive profitable growth; and (2) all of the statements under the \"Business Outlook\" section regarding our expected revenue and GAAP and non-GAAP net income per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. These involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially from these Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the include, but are not limited to: less customer demand for our products and services than forecasted; less growth in the optical communications, industrial lasers and sensors markets than we forecast; difficulties expanding into additional markets, such as the semiconductor processing, biotechnology, metrology and materials processing markets; increased competition in the optical manufacturing services markets; difficulties in delivering products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective; our reliance on a small number of customers and suppliers; difficulties in managing our operating costs; difficulties in managing and operating our business across multiple countries (including Thailand, the People's Republic of China, the U.S. and the U.K.); and other important factors as described in reports and documents we file from time to time with the Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed on February 7, 2018. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financials\nWe refer to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes: share-based compensation expenses; depreciation of fair value uplift; executive separation costs; expenses related to our CEO search; amortization of intangibles; business combination expenses; loss (gain) on foreign currency contracts; amortization of debt issuance costs; and restructuring charges. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors’ understanding of our underlying operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors’ operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in making financial and operational decisions. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.\nFABRINET\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
