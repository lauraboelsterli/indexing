    "text": "MADRID, May 31 (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will not resign ahead of a vote of confidence in his leadership on Friday, the Secretary-General of his People’s Party (PP), Maria Dolores de Cospedal, said on Thursday.\n“Mariano Rajoy will not resign,” de Cospedal said in a press conference on the sidelines of a debate in parliament ahead of the vote which has taken all day and will continue on Friday morning ahead of the vote.\nRajoy’s hours in office appeared numbered on Thursday after a Basque political party said it would back the no-confidence vote brought over a corruption case, paving the way for Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez to take power.
