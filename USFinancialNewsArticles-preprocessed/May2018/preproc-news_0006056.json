FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is reflected in the window of a branch office in London November 1, 2013. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\nThe bank has concluded that many of its branches in these regions are too close to one another and because changing consumer behaviours have led to a decline in footfall.\n“We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected. We will ensure compulsory redundancies are kept to an absolute minimum,” the bank said in a statement. Reporting by Emma Rumney, editing by Sinead Cruise",
