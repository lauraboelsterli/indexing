    "text": "RADNOR, Pa., Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:MRNS) (“Marinus” or “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders, today provided a business update on its clinical development activities and reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNear-term Clinical Value Catalysts (unchanged)\nInitiate Phase 3 Marigold pivotal study with oral ganaxolone in children with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) mid-2018 Report top-line intravenous (IV) ganaxolone data from Phase 2 Magnolia study in women with severe postpartum depression (PPD) third quarter 2018 Report top-line oral ganaxolone data from Amaryllis study in women with moderate PPD fourth quarter 2018\n“Our team is laser-focused on enrolling our studies in women with postpartum depression and preparing the medical community for a soon-to-initiate global phase 3 pivotal study in children with CDKL5 deficiency disorder,” commented Christopher M. Cashman, chairman and chief executive officer of Marinus. “We expect our PPD studies to generate data this year that will inform our Phase 3 program. We look forward to providing updates on our progress in these areas in the upcoming months.”\nCDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD)\nThe Company expects to begin enrolling CDD patients in its Marigold study in mid-2018. The Marigold study will be a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial in which patients will undergo a baseline period followed by a treatment period. The study’s primary efficacy endpoint will be percent reduction in seizures. Further study details will be released once the study has been initiated.\nPostpartum Depression (PPD)\nEnrollment is ongoing in the Company’s Magnolia study, a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization clinical trial to evaluate ganaxolone in women diagnosed with severe PPD (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) score ≥26). The primary efficacy endpoint in the Magnolia study is change from baseline in the HAMD17 score. Patients randomized into the first part of the study will undergo a 60-hour infusion of either ganaxolone or placebo and will be followed for 30 days. The Company expects to complete the IV portion (part one) of the study in the third quarter of 2018. These data will be used to inform dosing for part two of the study, which is planned to evaluate regimens that include both IV and oral formulations of ganaxolone.\nEnrollment is also on-going in the Company’s Amaryllis study, a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral ganaxolone in women with moderate PPD (HAMD17 score between 20 and 25). Patients enrolled in the study will receive up to two weeks of treatment with ganaxolone capsules and will be followed for 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in the HAMD17 score. Data from this study are expected fourth quarter of 2018.\nStatus Epilepticus (SE)\nThe Company has initiated its Phase 2 study with ganaxolone IV in patients with refractory status epilepticus (RSE). Ganaxolone IV will be added to standard of care and administered for up to five days. The primary endpoint of the study is the number of subjects who do not require IV anesthetic for status epilepticus treatment within the first 24 hours after study drug initiation. Initial data from this proof-of-concept study are expected fourth quarter of 2018.\nFinancial Update\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $52.0 million, compared to $58.4 million at December 31, 2017. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and investments, as of March 31, 2018, are adequate to fund its operations into 2020.\nResearch and development expenses increased to $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $3.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was related to preclinical and clinical expenses associated with our Phase 2 clinical trials in PPD and RSE and planned Phase 3 trial in CDD.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $1.8 million for the same period in the prior year. The expense increase was driven primarily by an increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nReaders are referred to, and encouraged to read in its entirety, the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes further detail on the Company’s business plans and operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSelected Financial Data (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nMarch 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $27,181 $33,531 Investments 24,839 24,825 Other assets 3,013 2,316 Total assets $55,033 $60,672 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities 1,794 2,544 Other long term liabilities 114 120 Total liabilities 1,908 2,664 Total stockholders’ equity 53,125 58,008 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $55,033 $60,672\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\n2017\nExpenses: Research and development $ 3,927 $ 3,573 General and administrative 2,187 1,812 Loss from operations (6,114 ) (5,385 ) Interest income 116 40 Interest expense — (84 ) Other income (expense) (1 ) (9 ) Net loss $ (5,999 ) $ (5,438 ) Per share information: Net loss per share of common stock—basic and diluted $ (0.15 ) $ (0.26 ) Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding 40,373,083 20,580,558 About Marinus Pharmaceuticals\nMarinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of ganaxolone, which offers a new mechanism of action, demonstrated efficacy and safety, and convenient dosing to improve the lives of patients suffering from epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders.
