Each honoree is recognized for her outstanding leadership, vision and unique role in driving channel growth and innovation.\nO'Sullivan also has the privilege of being named to CRN's Power 100 list where she is highlighted for her innovative initiatives and outstanding channel performance.\nCRN editors select the Women of the Channel honorees based on their professional accomplishments, demonstrated expertise and ongoing dedication to the IT channel. The Power 100 belong to an exclusive group drawn from this larger list: women leaders whose vision and influence are key drivers of their companies' success and help move the entire IT channel forward.\nAs channel marketing manager, O'Sullivan worked with partners to develop strategies that successfully deliver growth to both the partners and StorageCraft.
