Shariq Yosufzai and Sushil (\"Sam\") Kapoor Are Appointed to Aqua Metals Board\nSteve Cotton Rejoins Aqua Metals as President\nALAMEDA, Calif., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQMS) , which is commercializing a non-polluting electrochemical lead recycling technology called AquaRefining™, today announced that it has entered into a settlement agreement with Kanen Wealth Management, LLC (“KWM”).\nUnder the agreement, Aqua Metals has expanded the Board from five (5) to six (6) directors and has appointed KWM nominees - - Mr. S. Shariq Yosufzai and Mr. Sushil (\"Sam\") Kapoor - - to the Board, effective immediately. Aqua’s Nominating Committee has determined that Messrs. Yosufzai and Kapoor are “independent directors” under applicable Nasdaq Stock Market rules, and Mr. Yosufzai will serve as Aqua’s new Non-Executive Chairman and lead independent director. With the addition of Messrs. Yosufzai and Kapoor, Aqua’s Board now consists of six directors, all of whom are independent directors. Upon completion of Aqua’s CEO search, the new permanent CEO will join the Board as the seventh director. Each of Messrs. Vincent L. DiVito, Mark Slade, Eric Prouty, Mark Stevenson, Shariq Yosufzai and Sushil (“Sam”) Kapoor has been nominated to stand for election at Aqua’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders scheduled to be held on June 5, 2018.\nMessrs. Yosufzai and Kapoor have been appointed, with Messrs. DiVito and Stevenson, to serve on the Board’s newly constituted CEO Search Committee, which is charged with overseeing and executing Aqua’s previously announced permanent CEO search process, in consultation with an external executive search firm and with authority to make hiring recommendations to the full Board. Mr. Yosufzai has also been appointed to the Board’s Nominating Committee and Mr. Kapoor has been appointed to the Board’s Compensation Committee.\nSteve Cotton, the Company's former Chief Commercial Officer (from January 2015 to June 2017) rejoins Aqua as its new President and will be invited by the CEO Search Committee to interview for the position of CEO together with all other candidates for such position during the pendency of the Company’s permanent CEO search process. Mr. Selwyn Mould, who served briefly as Aqua’s interim CEO, has agreed to step down from such capacity immediately following the Company’s filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and has resigned as a director of the Company, effective immediately. Mr. Mould will remain Aqua’s Chief Operating Officer. Although there can be no assurance, the Board expects to complete its search process and to hire a permanent CEO before Q4 2018.\nAqua and KWM are committed to establishing certain corporate governance “best practices” going forward and, in that regard, have agreed to institute a “majority voting” policy for the election of directors which will be effective commencing with the 2019 Annual Meeting of stockholders. The Company will also continue to focus on further refreshing the Board to improve its overall diversity.\nIn addition, KWM has agreed to certain customary standstill and voting provisions, including voting for the election of the Board’s slate of six (6) directors at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n“We are very pleased to welcome Shariq and Sam as our two newest independent directors,” said independent director Vincent L. DiVito. “Over the past week, we’ve had very open and positive discussions with Shariq and Sam, and it’s clear that their stellar credentials and strong executive management experience will be most valuable as Aqua enters the next critical phase of commercializing our AquaRefining™ technology.\n“We also welcome back Steve Cotton, and greatly appreciate his willingness to join Aqua as our new President to help lead our executive team during this important time of transition and work side-by-side with our Chief Operating Officer and the entire AquaRefining operations team. Steve has considerable institutional knowledge about Aqua from his prior leadership role as Chief Commercial Officer and has built valuable relationships with the Company’s vendors and customers. “\nDavid Kanen, managing member of KWM, stated, “We are pleased to have reached an amicable resolution that enhances Aqua’s board and management team. We believe a solid foundation exists and can be built upon to monetize our revolutionary Aqua refining technology. We are looking forward to executing a strategy that we are hopeful will lead to value creation for all shareholders.”\nSteve Cotton noted, “I am looking forward to hitting the ground running by reigniting my existing relationships and developing new ones with Aqua Metals employees, partners, industry and other stakeholders to build momentum and maximize shareholder value.”\nAs previously announced, Frank Knuettel II will formally assume the CFO role immediately following the filing of the Company’s second quarter. As CFO, Mr. Knuettel will succeed Thomas Murphy, who was named interim CFO after the departure of Mark Weinswig in March 2018.\nBiography of S. Shariq Yosufzai\nS.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that contain words such as “expects,” “contemplates,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “intends,” “believes” and variations of such words or similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends, or that do not relate to historical matters. The forward looking statements in this release include the strength and efficacy of Aqua Metals’ portfolio of patent applications and issued patents, the lead acid battery recycling industry, the future of lead acid battery recycling via traditional smelters, the Company’s development of its commercial lead acid battery recycling facilities and the quality and efficiency of the Company’s proposed lead acid battery recycling operations. Those forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Among those factors are: (1) the risk that the Company may not be able to produce and market AquaRefined lead on a commercial basis or, if the Company achieves commercial operations, that such operations will be profitable, (2) the fact that the Company only recently commenced production and has not generated any significant revenue to date, thus subjecting the Company to all of the risks inherent in a pre-revenue start-up; (3) the risk no further patents will be issued on the Company’s patent applications or any other application that it may file in the future and that those patents issued to date and any patents issued in the future will be sufficiently broad to adequately protect the Company’s technology, (4) the risk that the Company’s initial patents and any other patents that may be issued to it may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, (5) risks related to Aqua Metals’ ability to raise sufficient capital, as and when needed, to develop and operate its recycling facilities and fund continuing losses from operations as the Company endeavors to achieve profitability; (6) changes in the federal, state and foreign laws regulating the recycling of lead acid batteries; (7) the Company’s ability to protect its proprietary technology, trade secrets and know-how and (8) those other risks disclosed in the section “Risk Factors” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 15, 2018. Aqua Metals cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur, except as required by law.\nMZ Group | MZ North America\nGreg Falesnik\nMain: 949-385-6449\ngreg.falesnik@mzgroup.us\nMacKenzie Partners, Inc.\nPaul R.
