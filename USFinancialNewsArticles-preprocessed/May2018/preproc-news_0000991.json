    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 4:28 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago Crescent Point set to win support for director nominees - sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nTORONTO, May 2 (Reuters) - Canadian energy producer Crescent Point Energy Corp is poised to win support for its director nominees based on preliminary counting of votes, shrugging off opposition from activist investor Cation Capital, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nFinal results are expected to be announced on or before Friday.\nCrescent Point, whose stock has underperformed the broader market in recent years, is under pressure from Cation Capital to change its board.\nWith ISS supporting some of the activist’s nominees and Glass Lewis supporting the company’s choices, investors expected a close vote on Wednesday.\nCrescent Point and Cation could not immediately be reached for comment. The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public. (Reporting by John Tilak Editing by Denny Thomas and Matthew Lewis)",
