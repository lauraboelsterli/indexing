With more than 20 years’ experience with a variety of technology and sales organizations, such as Oracle, Salesforce and Avaya, Griggs will oversee the sales and client success departments to drive new growth and development company-wide.\nHired in March 2018, Griggs will lead the Client Success, Inside Sales, Regional Sales and Sales Operations teams and will continue to build and develop the sales team through leadership training and new processes, as well as furthering a culture of growth and outcomes throughout the teams.\nPrior to joining Nextech, Griggs worked as a senior vice president at Apttus, where he helped build out and develop the company’s North American sales division. Earlier in his career, he also worked with Salesforce to develop and grow their Atlanta regional sales team, and with Oracle to build a new sales team, process and go-to-market strategy.\n“We couldn’t be more thrilled to have Jeff on board to help oversee new growth and change within our sales department,” said Mike Scarbrough, Nextech’s president and CEO. “Jeff has worked with some of the most reputable technology companies in the world, and we’re excited to have his leadership at Nextech, specifically as we increase our commitment to client success and product innovation.”\n“There are many opportunities in the health care industry right now,” said Griggs. “Unfortunately for many practices, inefficiency can be more common than not.
