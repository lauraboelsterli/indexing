    "text": "DENVER, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glowpoint, Inc. (NYSE American:GLOW) (“Glowpoint” or the “Company”), a managed service provider of video collaboration and network applications, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\nCash of $3.1 million, working capital of $3.8 million and no debt as of March 31, 2018.\nRevenue of $3.5 million, net loss of $1.3 million, and adjusted EBITDA (“AEBITDA”) of $0.1 million. AEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” later in this release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nClosed a registered direct offering of 0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock in January 2018 for net proceeds to the Company of $1.5 million.\nRetired $1.8 million of outstanding debt obligations in the first quarter, resulting in no outstanding debt as of March 31, 2018.\nStockholders’ equity of $12.5 million as of March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased to have further strengthened our balance sheet during the first quarter of 2018 through the completion of our Series C equity round in January which, along with improving the Company’s liquidity position, also resulted in the retirement of all outstanding debt. Our simplified capital structure provides the Company a foundation on which to pursue both organic and inorganic growth initiatives including the release of our next generation UCaaS 1 support platform this summer,” said Glowpoint President and CEO Peter Holst. “According to Gartner Research 2 , global spending on Unified Communications (UC) will reach $45.7 billion in 2022, and technology strategic planners positioning UC solutions must plan for expected shortages of skilled support resources as the UC market evolves. Time-to-market has always been a challenge for IT teams seeking to deploy and adopt communication services to their fullest potential and, as market demand for UC grows rapidly, we’ve worked closely with our customers, partners and prospects to design a service platform that shortens innovation and adoption cycles while also addressing their needs to substantially reduce complexity and cost. Leading IT organizations identify the customer experience as a top priority by accelerating the adoption and dissemination of services that engage customer interaction and response. With recent advancements in machine learning and emerging architectures that simplify applications into functional components, business users can not only expect faster innovation, but also far greater flexibility in adoption, support and customization to meet their specific objectives.”\nGlowpoint’s results from operations and financial condition are more fully discussed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Investors are encouraged to carefully review the Company’s Form 10-Q for a complete analysis of its results from operations and financial condition.\nAbout Glowpoint\nGlowpoint, Inc.

To learn more please visit www.glowpoint.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nAdjusted EBITDA (“AEBITDA”), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net loss before depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, and interest and other expense, net. AEBITDA is not intended to replace operating loss, net loss, cash flow or other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Rather, AEBITDA is an important measure used by management to assess the operating performance of the Company and is used in determining achievement of performance-based stock awards. AEBITDA as defined here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies. Therefore, AEBITDA should be considered in conjunction with net loss and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating loss or cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, such as net loss, operating loss or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance. A reconciliation of AEBITDA to net loss is shown in the attached schedules.\nForward looking and cautionary statements\nThis press release and any oral statements made regarding the subject of this release contain forward-looking statements as defined under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
