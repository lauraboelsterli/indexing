    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Rexford Industrial\") (NYSE: REXR), a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") that specializes in acquiring, owning and operating industrial properties located in Southern California infill markets, today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights:\nNet income attributable to common stockholders of $0.15 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.06 per diluted share last year. Company share of Core FFO increased 41.8% year-over-year to $21.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Company share of Core FFO per diluted share increased 17.4% year-over-year to $0.27 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Total first quarter rental revenues of $48.4 million, which represents an increase of 38.4% year-over-year. Property Net Operating Income (NOI) of $36.5 million, which represents an increase of 41.5% year-over-year. Same Property Portfolio NOI increased 9.3% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven by a 7.8% increase in Same Property Portfolio total rental revenue and a 3.7% increase in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses. Same Property Portfolio Cash NOI increased 8.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Stabilized Same Property Portfolio NOI increased 7.4% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Stabilized Same Property Portfolio Cash NOI increased 8.0% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Signed new and renewal leases totaling 848,395 rentable square feet. Rental rates on new and renewal leases were 25.3% higher than prior rents on a GAAP basis and 14.9% higher on a cash basis. Stabilized Same Property Portfolio occupancy was 97.5%, which represents an increase of 110 basis points year-over-year. Same Property Portfolio occupancy, inclusive of assets in value-add repositioning, was 94.9%, which represents an increase of 220 basis points year-over-year. At March 31, 2018, the consolidated portfolio including repositioning assets was 95.6% leased and 95.2% occupied, which represents an increase in occupancy of 630 basis points year-over-year. At March 31, 2018, the consolidated portfolio, excluding repositioning assets aggregating approximately 0.5 million rentable square feet, was 98.1% leased and 97.7% occupied. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company acquired five industrial properties for a total purchase price of $52.7 million. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company sold three industrial properties for an aggregate sales price of $26.9 million.\n\"Rexford's strong first quarter results, which culminated with a 42% increase in Core FFO and a 17.4% increase in Core FFO per share, driven in part by a 9.3% increase in Same Property NOI, are indicative of the strength of the value-driven Rexford platform, our focused business model and extensive market opportunity,\" stated Michael Frankel and Howard Schwimmer, Co-Chief Executive Officers of the Company. \"During the first quarter, we achieved impressive GAAP and cash releasing spreads of 25.3% and 14.9%, respectively, as we capitalized on the favorable fundamentals within the infill Southern California industrial market. We continue to see an extreme scarcity of available space and a supply-demand imbalance into the foreseeable future, as more product is converted to other uses than can be delivered, amidst increasing demand from the dramatic growth in e-commerce, among other landlord-favorable factors.\"\nFinancial Results:\nThe Company reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $12.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $4.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes $10.0 million of gains on sale of real estate, as compared to $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company reported Company share of Core FFO of $21.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share of common stock, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to Company share of Core FFO of $15.1 million, or $0.23 per diluted share of common stock, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusting for non-core expenses ($9,000 reported during the first quarter of 2018 and $385,000 reported during the first quarter of 2017), Company share of FFO was $21.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share of common stock, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to Company share of FFO of $14.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share of common stock, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company's Same Property Portfolio GAAP NOI increased 9.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven by a 7.8% increase in Same Property Portfolio total rental revenue and a 3.7% increase in Same Property Portfolio expenses. Same Property Portfolio Cash NOI increased 8.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Stabilized Same Property Portfolio NOI increased 7.4% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 and Stabilized Same Property Portfolio Cash NOI increased 8.0% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating Results:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company signed 117 new and renewal leases totaling 848,395 rentable square feet. Average rental rates on comparable new and renewal leases were up 25.3% on a GAAP basis and up 14.9% on a cash basis. The Company signed 47 new leases for 281,844 rentable square feet, with GAAP rents up 32.0% compared to the prior in-place leases. The Company signed 70 renewal leases for 566,551 rentable square feet, with GAAP rents up 23.1% compared to the prior in-place leases. For the 47 new leases, cash rents increased 18.1%, and for the 70 renewal leases, cash rents were up 13.8%, compared to the ending cash rents for the prior leases.\nThe Company has included in a supplemental information package the detailed results and operating statistics that reflect the activities of the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2018. See below for information regarding the supplemental information package.\nTransaction Activity:\nIn the first quarter 2018, the Company completed five acquisitions, for an aggregate purchase price of $52.7 million, as detailed below. Additionally, the Company sold three properties for $26.9 million.\nIn January 2018, the Company acquired 13971 Norton Avenue, a 100% leased single-tenant industrial building containing 103,208 square feet on 4.8 acres of land, located in the Inland Empire West submarket, for $11.4 million or approximately $110 per square foot.\nIn February 2018, the Company acquired 1900 Proforma Avenue and 1910-1920 Archibald Avenue, an 86% leased three-building industrial park containing 214,000 square feet on 12.3 acres of land located in the Inland Empire West submarket, for $24.1 million or approximately $113 per square foot.\nIn March 2018, the Company acquired 16010 Shoemaker Avenue, a 100% leased single-tenant industrial property containing 115,600 square feet on 4.4 acres of land, located in the Los Angeles - Mid Counties submarket, for $17.2 million or approximately $149 per square foot.\nIn January 2018, the Company sold 8900-8980 North Benson Avenue and 5637 Arrow Highway, a six building industrial park containing 88,016 square feet in the Inland Empire West submarket, for $11.4 million or approximately $130 per square foot.\nIn January 2018, the Company sold 700 Allen Avenue and 1851 Flower Street, a two-building creative office property containing 25,168 square feet on 1.14 acres of land in the Greater San Fernando Valley submarket, for $10.9 million or approximately $433 per square foot.\nIn March 2018, the Company sold 200-220 South Grand Avenue, a multi-tenant industrial building containing 27,200 square feet in the Orange County Airport submarket, for $4.5 million or approximately $166 per square foot.\nBalance Sheet:\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $662.4 million of outstanding debt, with an average interest rate of 3.39% and an average term-to-maturity of 5.5 years. As of March 31, 2018, approximately $511 million, or 77%, of the Company's outstanding debt was fixed-rate with an average interest rate of 3.49% and an average term-to-maturity of 5.9 years. The remaining $151.0 million, or 23%, of the Company's outstanding debt was floating-rate, with an average interest rate of LIBOR + 1.17% and an average term-to-maturity of 4.1 years. The Company has one interest rate swap that will hedge $100 million of its remaining floating-rate debt beginning in August 2018 when the swap becomes effective. If this interest rate swap was effective as of March 31, 2018, the Company's debt would be 92% fixed and 8% variable with an average interest rate of 3.32%.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,498,961 shares of common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program (ATM program). The shares were issued at a weighted average price of $28.16 per share, providing gross proceeds of approximately $70.4 million and net proceeds of approximately $69.3 million. As of March 31, 2018, the ATM program had approximately $158.7 million of remaining capacity.\nGuidance\nThe Company is reiterating and increasing its full year 2018 guidance as follows:\nNet income attributable to common stockholders within a range of $0.22 to $0.25 per diluted share Company share of Core FFO within a range of $1.02 to $1.05 per diluted share Year-end Same Property Portfolio occupancy within a range of 95.0% to 97.0% Year-end Stabilized Same Property Portfolio occupancy within a range of 96.5% to 98.0% Same Property Portfolio NOI growth for the year of 6.5% to 8.5% Stabilized Same Property Portfolio NOI growth for the year of 4.5% to 6.0% General and administrative expenses of $24.0 million to $25.0 million\nThe Core FFO guidance refers only to the Company's in-place portfolio as of May 1, 2018, and does not include any assumptions for acquisitions, dispositions or balance sheet activities that may or may not occur later during the year. The Company's in-place portfolio as of May 1, 2018, reflects the acquisition of five properties totaling 372,691 rentable square feet and the disposition of one property containing 11,808 rentable square feet that occurred subsequent to March 31, 2018. A number of factors could impact the Company's ability to deliver results in line with its guidance, including, but not limited to, interest rates, the economy, the supply and demand of industrial real estate, the availability and terms of financing to the Company or to potential acquirers of real estate and the timing and yields for divestment and investment. There can be no assurance that the Company can achieve such results.\nDividends:\nOn April 30, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.16 per share for the second quarter of 2018, payable in cash on July 16, 2018, to common stockholders and common unit holders of record as of June 29, 2018.\nOn April 30, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.367188 per share of its Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and $0.367188 per share of its Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, payable in cash on June 29, 2018, to preferred stockholders of record as of June 15, 2018.\nSupplemental Information:\nDetails regarding these results can be found in the Company's supplemental financial package available on the Company's investor relations website at www.ir.rexfordindustrial.com .\nEarnings Release, Investor Conference Webcast and Conference Call:\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time to review first quarter results and discuss recent events.

FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, other than temporary impairments of unconsolidated real estate entities, and impairment on our investment in real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. A reconciliation of net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent, to FFO is set forth below.\nCore Funds from Operations (Core FFO): We calculate Core FFO by adjusting FFO to exclude the impact of certain items that we do not consider reflective of our core revenue or expense streams. These adjustments consist of acquisition expenses. Management believes that Core FFO is a useful supplemental measure as it provides a more meaningful and consistent comparison of operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company's operating results. Because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of Core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate Core FFO in a consistent manner. Accordingly, our Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' Core FFO. Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. A reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO is set forth below.\nReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders per Diluted Share Guidance to Company share of Core FFO per Diluted Share Guidance: The following is a reconciliation of the Company's guidance range of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure, to Company share of Core FFO per diluted share.\n2018 Estimate\nLow\nHigh\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n0.22\n$\n0.25\nCompany share of depreciation and amortization\n$\n0.92\n$\n0.92\nCompany share of gains on sale of real estate\n$\n(0.12)\n$\n(0.12)\nCompany share of Core FFO\n$\n1.02\n$\n1.05\nNet Operating Income (NOI): NOI is a non-GAAP measure, which includes the revenue and expense directly attributable to our real estate properties. NOI is calculated as total revenue from real estate operations including i) rental income, ii) tenant reimbursements and iii) other income less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization). We use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense and gains (or losses) from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have a real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs.\nNOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. We use NOI to help evaluate the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the performance of our Same Property Portfolio. A calculation of NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, as well as a reconciliation of net income to NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, is set forth below.\nCash NOI: Cash NOI is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting from NOI i) fair value lease revenue and ii) straight-line rent adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. We use Cash NOI to help evaluate the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the performance of our Same Property Portfolio. A calculation of Cash NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, as well as a reconciliation of net income to Cash NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, is set forth below.\nSame Property Portfolio: Our Same Property Portfolio is a subset of our consolidated portfolio and includes properties that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2017, and still owned by us as of March 31, 2018. Therefore, we excluded from our Same Properties Portfolio any properties that were acquired or sold during the period from January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018. The Company's computation of same property performance may not be comparable to other REITs.\nStabilized Same Property Portfolio: Our Stabilized Same Property Portfolio represents the properties included in our Same Property Portfolio, adjusted to exclude the properties listed in the tables below that were under repositioning/lease-up during comparable years.\nStabilized Same Property Portfolio occupancy/leasing statistics, excludes vacant/unleased repositioning space at each of these properties as of the end of each reporting period. Stabilized Same Property Portfolio NOI, excludes the NOI for the entire property for all comparable periods.\nOur Stabilized Same Property Portfolio excludes the following Same Property Portfolio properties that were in various stages of repositioning or lease-up during the year ended December 31, 2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2018:\n12131 Western Avenue\n301-445 Figueroa Street\n14742-14750 Nelson Avenue\n3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard\n1601 Alton Parkway\n3880 Valley Boulevard\n18118-18120 Broadway Street\n679-691 South Anderson Street\n228th Street\n9615 Norwalk Boulevard\n2700-2722 Fairview Street\nAs of March 31, 2018, the difference between our Same Property Portfolio and our Stabilized Same Property Portfolio is 376,385 rentable square feet of space at five of our properties that were classified as repositioning or lease-up. As of March 31, 2017, the difference between our Same Property Portfolio and our Stabilized Same Property Portfolio is space aggregating 534,924 rentable square feet at nine of our properties that were in various stages of repositioning or lease-up.\nProperties and Space Under Repositioning: Typically defined as properties or units where a significant amount of space is held vacant in order to implement capital improvements that improve the functionality (not including basic refurbishments, i.e., paint and carpet), cash flow and value of that space. We define a significant amount of space in a building as the lower of (i) 20,000 square feet of space or (ii) 50% of a building's square footage. Typically, we would include properties or space where the repositioning and lease-up time frame is estimated to be greater than six months. A repositioning is considered complete once the investment is fully or nearly fully deployed and the property is marketable for leasing. We consider a repositioning property to be stabilized at the earlier of the following: (i) upon reaching 90% occupancy or (ii) one year from the date of completion of repositioning construction work.\nContact:\nInvestor Relations:\nStephen Swett\n424-256-2153 ext 401\ninvestorrelations@rexfordindustrial.com\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands except
