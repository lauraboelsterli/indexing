Throughout this Press Release, management used a number of terms and ratios which do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other organizations. A full description of these measures can be found in the Management Discussion & Analysis that accompanies the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nECN Capital’s management discussion and analysis as at and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 has been filed on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ) and is available under the investor section of the Company’s website ( www.ecnapitalcorp.com ).\nAbout ECN Capital Corp.\nWith total owned and managed assets of more than US$4.5 billion, ECN Capital Corp.
