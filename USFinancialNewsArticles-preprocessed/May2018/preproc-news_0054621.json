    "text": "MOSCOW, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. Mars Inc said on Thursday it would increase investment in one of its five pet food factories in Russia by 30 percent to enable it to reach its full capacity.\nCandy manufacturer Mars said it would invest an additional 1.2 billion roubles ($19.5 million) before year end, having previously spent 4.0 billion roubles on the project.\nThe plant, located in the Rostov region some 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) south of Moscow, was launched in October 2017 and is one of Marsâ€™ biggest investment projects in Russia in the past decade, the privately owned company said in a statement.\nThe factory, which makes Pedigree and Whiskas pet foods, is currently operating at 70 percent of capacity.\n$1 = 61.5227 roubles Reporting by Maria Kiselyova Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ",
