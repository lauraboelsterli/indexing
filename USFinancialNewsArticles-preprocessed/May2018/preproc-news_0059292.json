This included $5.5 million generated from the Networks and Platforms segment through Channel Frederator Network, which continues to build viewership. Revenue for the Animation Production segment was $10.2 million for first quarter, a 137% increase in comparison to the first quarter of 2017, bolstered by the continued production of Costume Quest , Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures and Spy Kids: Mission Critical , as well as revenue from the US licensing of Bravest Warriors, season 4, and proceeds from licensing of worldwide SVOD rights for Reboot: The Guardian Code. Operating EBITDA was $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and the net loss was $0.2 million.\n“We continue to build our Networks and Platforms business,” reported Michael Hirsh, Chairman and CEO, “the Frederator Networks exceeded 5.4 Billion views in the first quarter of 2018, up 25% from the quarter ended December 31, 2017. WOW continues production on several high-profile titles and our work on three innovative series has premiered on Netflix for the past three months in a row - Reboot: The Guardian Code debuted in March, Spy Kids: Mission Critical commenced in April and Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures began in May, 2018. Excitement is also building for the Canadian premiere of Reboot on YTV in June, 2018.”\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER\nCumulative prior period information in the following table has been restated for purchase price allocation adjustments relating to the acquisition of Frederator.\nFor the three months ended $000's March 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nRevenue $ 15,663 $ 5,867 Amortization of investment in film and television $ 947 $ – Operating EBITDA $ 1,552 $ (374 ) Finance costs 353 88 Depreciation and amortization 1 760 1,229 General and administration 731 420 Operating loss (292 ) (2,111 ) Items affecting comparability: Share based compensation expense 261 180 Deferred income tax recovery (391 ) (825 ) (130 ) (645 ) Net loss $ (162 ) $ (1,466 ) 1 Excludes amortization of investment in film and television Revenue and Operating EBITDA\nRevenue for the 3 months ended March 31, 2018, increased by $9.8 million, compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was comprised of $3.9 million in incremental revenue in the Networks and Platforms segment, driven by escalating views and revenues for Channel Frederator, and $5.9 million of additional turnover in the Animation Production segment from continued production of series, such as Costume Quest , Barbie’s Dreamhouse Adventures and Spy Kids: Mission Critical , as well as revenue from the US licensing of Bravest Warriors , Season 4, and proceeds from licensing of worldwide SVOD rights to Reboot: The Guardian Code .\nOperating EBITDA for the 3 months ended March 31, 2018, increased by $1.9 million compared to the same period in 2017, as a result of the increased volume.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company reports using certain supplemental indicators of the Company’s financial and operating performance in addition to results reported in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“GAAP”). These measures are referred to as non-GAAP measures, and include operating profit or loss, operating profit or loss per share and operating EBITDA. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures reflect the Company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in its business.\nThe Company defines operating profit or loss as net profit or loss excluding the impact of specified items affecting comparability, including, where applicable, share of loss of equity accounted investees, other non-operational income and expenses, deferred taxes and other gains or losses. The use of the term \"non-operational income and expenses\" is defined by the Company as those that do not impact operating decisions taken by the Company's management and is based upon the way the Company's management evaluates the performance of the Company's business for use in the Company's internal management reports. Operating profit or loss per share is calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding and does not represent actual profit or loss per share attributable to shareholders. The Company believes that the disclosure of operating profit or loss and operating profit or loss per share allows investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company's ongoing business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful indicator of the Company's performance or expected performance of recurring operations.\nThe Company defines operating EBITDA as profit or loss net of amortization of investment in film, but before interest, taxes, general and administration expenses, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for certain items affecting comparability as specified in the calculation of operating profit or loss. Operating EBITDA is presented on a basis consistent with the Company's internal management reports. The Company discloses operating EBITDA to capture the profitability of its business before the impact of items not considered in management's evaluation of operating performance. Unless otherwise stated, the Company includes the amortization of investment in film and television in the calculation of EBITDA.\nOperating profit or loss, operating profit or loss per share and operating EBITDA do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company cautions readers to consider these non-IFRS financial measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis news release contains certain and forward-looking information (collectively referred to herein as \" \") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.
