    "text": "LA JOLLA, Calif., May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Regulus Therapeutics Inc . (Nasdaq: RGLS), a biopharmaceutical company leading the discovery and development of innovative medicines targeting microRNAs, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided a pipeline update.\n\"We are very pleased with the progress being made on advancing our pipeline, including the recent initiation of the multiple ascending dose (MAD) study for RGLS4326; the advancement of two new pre-clinical programs in important areas of unmet need; and the continued advancement of the RG-012 program,\" said Jay Hagan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Regulus. \"These two new pre-clinical programs represent attractive areas of development for Regulus beyond our two chronic kidney disease programs.\"\nPipeline Update\nRGLS4326 for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) : As previously announced, a Phase 1 MAD study was recently initiated in healthy volunteers. This trial was initiated based on data from the ongoing Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) trial, in which RGLS4326 has been determined to be well tolerated to date. The Phase 1 SAD study has completed dose escalation and continues in the planned follow-up phase, which is on-track for completion in the second half of 2018. Data from both studies will provide pharmacokinetics and safety data in advance of the Phase 2 proof-of-concept (POC) study estimated for initiation in the second half of 2019.\nPre-clinical programs : Based on robust human in vitro data and murine in vivo data, the Company announced today it is advancing programs in Hepatitis B virus and immunology (targets undisclosed).\nRG-012 for Alport syndrome: The Phase 2 HERA study is ongoing and data from the Phase 1 renal biopsy study is anticipated by year-end 2018.\nFinancial Results\nCash Position: As of March 31, 2018, Regulus had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $45.1 million.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $11.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $15.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in personnel-related costs subsequent to our May 2017 corporate restructuring and the wind-down of clinical activities related to the RG-101 program.\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $3.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $4.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nRevenue: Revenue was less than $0.1 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNet Loss: Net loss was $16.0 million, or $0.15 per share (basic and diluted), for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $20.0 million, or $0.38 per share (basic and diluted), for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nConference Call Details\nRegulus will host a conference call and webcast today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss first quarter financial results and provide a general business update. A live webcast of the call will be available online at www.regulusrx.com .
