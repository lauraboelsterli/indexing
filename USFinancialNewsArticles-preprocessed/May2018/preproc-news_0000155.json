    "text": "BOISE, Idaho, IDACORP, Inc. (NYSE: IDA) recorded first quarter 2018 net IDACORP of $36.1 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with $33.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Earnings for the quarter improved over last year's results as continued economic growth and the fixed cost adjustment mechanism revenues in Idaho more than offset lower residential sales from a milder winter,\" said IDACORP President and CEO Darrel Anderson. \"As we look forward, Idaho Power's pending tax reform settlement in Idaho would support our efforts to keep customer energy rates low. The settlement also proposes an extension of the existing earnings support mechanism, which could provide additional earnings predictability beyond 2019.\n\"Idaho was named the fastest growing state in the country in 2017 by the U.S. Census Bureau. We are seeing evidence of this with continued strong economic growth and a 2.1 percent increase in customers over the last year.\"\nFor the full year, Idaho Power maintains its projection to use less than $5 million of additional accumulated deferred investment tax credits under the Idaho regulatory settlement. IDACORP is reaffirming its full year 2018 earnings guidance in the range of $4.10 to $4.25 per diluted share.\nPerformance Summary\nA summary of financial highlights for the 2018 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet IDACORP, Inc.\n$\n36,142\n$\n33,102\nAverage outstanding shares â€“ diluted (000's)\n50,463\n50,397\nIDACORP, Inc. earnings per diluted share\n$\n0.72\n$\n0.66\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net IDACORP for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from the same period in 2017 (items are in millions and are before related income tax impact unless otherwise noted).\nThree months ended\nNet IDACORP, Inc. - March 31, 2017\n$\n33.1\nIncrease (decrease) in Idaho Power net income:\nCustomer growth, net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment mechanisms\n2.4\nUsage per retail customer, net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment mechanisms\n(10.4)\nIdaho fixed cost adjustment (FCA) revenues\n8.7\nRetail revenues per megawatt-hour (MWh), net of associated power supply costs and power cost adjustment mechanisms\n1.2\nTransmission services (wheeling) and other revenues\n2.7\nDepreciation expense\n(3.3)\nOther changes in operating revenues and expenses, net\n0.5\nIncrease in Idaho Power operating income before tax reform revenue accrual\n1.8\nTax reform revenue accrual for future rate reduction\n(5.0)\nDecrease in Idaho Power operating income\n(3.2)\nEarnings of equity-method investments\n2.9\nNon-operating income and expenses\n0.5\nAdditional accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) amortization\n(1.4)\nIncome tax expense (excluding additional ADITC amortization)\n4.6\nTotal increase in Idaho Power net income\n3.4\nOther IDACORP changes (net of tax)\n(0.4)\nNet IDACORP, Inc. - March 31, 2018\n$\n36.1\nIDACORP's net income increased $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher net income at Idaho Power.\nCustomer growth increased operating income by $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017, as the number of Idaho Power customers grew by 2.1 percent during the twelve months ended March 31, 2018. A decrease in sales volumes on a per-customer basis decreased operating income by $10.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017. More moderate winter temperatures in Idaho Power's service area in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017 led to a decrease in sales volumes on a per-customer basis, primarily due to residential customers using energy for heating. The revenue decrease related to lower sales volumes was largely offset by the FCA mechanism, which increased revenues by $8.7 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nA net increase in retail revenues per MWh contributed $1.2 million to operating income in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017. Revenue increases resulting from the North Valmy coal-fired power plant (Valmy Plant) settlement stipulations discussed below were mostly offset by a decrease in the proportion of residential sales in higher rate categories under Idaho Power's tiered rate structure. This was due to more moderate winter temperatures in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nIn the second quarter of 2017, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) and Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC) each approved settlement stipulations related to Idaho Power's plan to end its participation in coal-fired operations at the Valmy Plant by the end of 2025. In the first quarter of 2018, the settlement stipulations resulted in increased retail revenue collections and retail revenue accruals, increased net depreciation expense, and increased associated income tax expenses, including plant-related flow-through tax adjustments.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Idaho Power also benefited from a $2.7 million increase in transmission services and other revenue compared with the first quarter of 2017. This change was largely due to an increase in Idaho Power's Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) rates that became effective in October 2017, as well as a weather-related increase in wheeling volumes.\nDue to regulatory orders received from the IPUC and OPUC during the first quarter of 2018 relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Idaho Power recorded a $5.0 million reduction to revenue and corresponding regulatory liability for its estimate of first quarter 2018 tax benefits resulting from the changes in the federal and state income tax law that Idaho Power expects to return to Idaho and Oregon customers in the future.\nIncome from Idaho Power's unconsolidated investment in Bridger Coal Company (BCC) increased non-operating income by $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to an increase in coal sales prices at BCC.\nIdaho Power income tax expense, excluding additional ADITC amortization, decreased $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017, due mostly to the lower federal statutory income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Idaho Power recorded $0.5 million of additional ADITC amortization under its Idaho regulatory settlement stipulation during the first quarter of 2018. During the first quarter of 2017, Idaho Power recorded $1.9 million of additional ADITC amortization, which was later reversed as actual 2017 results exceeded earlier estimates. Based on Idaho Power's current expectations of full-year 2018 results, Idaho Power expects to record less than $5 million of additional ADITC amortization for the full-year 2018.\n2018 Annual Earnings Guidance and Key Operating and Financial Metrics\nIDACORP is reaffirming its earnings guidance estimate for 2018. The 2018 guidance incorporates all of the key operating and financial assumptions listed in the table that follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nCurrent (1)\nPrevious (2)\nIDACORP Earnings Guidance (per share)\nNo Change\n$4.10-$4.25\nIdaho Power Operating & Maintenance Expense\nNo Change\n$345-$355\nIdaho Power Additional Amortization of ADITC\nNo Change\nLess than $5\nIdaho Power Capital Expenditures (excluding allowance for funds used during construction)\nNo Change\n$280-$290\nIdaho Power Hydroelectric Generation (MWh)\nNo Change\n7.5-9.5\n(1)\nAs of May 3, 2018.\n(2)\nAs of February 22, 2018, the date of filing IDACORP's and Idaho Power's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMore detailed financial information is provided in IDACORP's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and posted to the IDACORP Web site at www.idacorpinc.com .\nWeb Cast / Conference Call\nIDACORP will hold an analyst conference call today at 2:30 p.m. Mountain Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time).
