Ishiguro, EVP/GC for AutoGravity (Photo: Business Wire)\n“Jennifer’s leadership — as well as legal- and corporate-governance expertise — uniquely positions her to help guide our company through its next phase of growth,” said Andy Hinrichs, Founder and CEO of AutoGravity. “Use of our technology has grown ten-fold in the last year as lenders and dealers have turned to AutoGravity to power their digital strategies. Having Jennifer at the helm of our legal endeavors is key to AutoGravity serving as the digital retailing solution for the automotive industry.”\nBefore joining AutoGravity, Ishiguro was Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary with Gateway One Lending & Finance, LLC, the auto finance company subsidiary of TCF Financial Corporation (NYSE: TCF), a publicly-held bank holding company with approximately $23 billion in assets. As the first legal executive with the company — and first woman on Gateway’s executive team — she oversaw the 12-member legal and compliance departments, while driving initiatives that promoted diversity and inclusion, employee engagement, and performance management.\nPrior to Gateway, Ishiguro spent eight years with Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, leading a team that managed cross-border securities reporting and transactions, corporate finance, broker-dealer compliance, corporate governance and commercial contracts. She also directed strategic and departmental management initiatives.\n“I'm thrilled to be joining such a diverse and passionate team at the forefront of making the car-buying experience more accessible, transparent and convenient,” said Ishiguro. “I look forward to working with the AutoGravity team and Board to move the needle even further so that every consumer can purchase and finance their next car from their smartphone.”\nEarlier in her career, Ishiguro practiced in the fields of securities law and capital markets at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, spending time in the firm’s New York, Tokyo and Washington, D.C., offices. Before law school, she was a speechwriter for United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and studied international trade law in Japan on a Fulbright fellowship.\nIshiguro brings years of experience working with non-profits and sits on the boards of organizations that promote diversity and inclusion. She is currently a board member with Los Angeles Team Mentoring and the Vice Chair of the Southern California Region of the U.S.-Japan Council. She also held leadership roles and is a current member at both the Japanese American Bar Association and the Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles. Ishiguro received her J.D., cum laude from Harvard Law School, and a B.A. in International Studies and Comparative Literature, cum laude from Yale University.\nAbout AutoGravity\nAutoGravity technology is revolutionizing the digital car-buying experience.
