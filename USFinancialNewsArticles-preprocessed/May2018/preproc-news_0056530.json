    "text": "May 27, 2018 / 1:23 PM / Updated 41 minutes ago Tennis-Stephens off to a flyer in Paris Pritha Sarkar 1 Min Read\nPARIS, May 27 (Reuters) - Sloane Stephens enjoyed her first Grand Slam win as the reigning U.S. Open champion by demoslishing Dutchwoman Arantxa Rus 6-2 6-0 in the first round of the French Open on Sunday.\nThe American 10th seedâ€™s first major as a Grand Slam winner lasted only three sets after she was beaten in the first-round of the Australian Open.\nThat result in January was one of eight successive defeats she suffered following her Flushing Meadows triumph last September.\nBut if Rus harboured any hopes of pulling off another upset, those hopes were dashed in 49 brutal minutes by Stephens.\nThe Dutwoman managed to produce only two winners during the contest as Stephens ran her ragged from the baseline with a non-stop flow of flying groundstrokes.\nShe wrapped up the win to secure a second round match with either Russian Ekaterina Alexandrova or Magdalena Frech from Poland.
