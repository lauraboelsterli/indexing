    "text": "TORONTO, Feronia Inc. (“Feronia” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:FRN) today released its audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts in this release are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n2017 Highlights\nProduced 143,572 tonnes of fruit (2016: 109,061 tonnes), a year-over-year increase of 32% Produced 27,189 tonnes of Crude Palm Oil (“CPO”) (2016: 20,724 tonnes), a year-over-year increase of 31% Revenue of $21.1 million (2016: $17.2 million), a year-over-year increase of 23%, primarily from the sale of 24,609 tonnes of CPO at an average price of $775 per tonne (2016: 23,293 tonnes at $670 per tonne) Completed installation of new fiber boilers and turbines at Yaligimba and Lokutu Completed drawdown of remaining $34 million of DFI Debt Facility\nXavier de Carnière, Chief Executive Officer of Feronia Inc. commented:\n“We take great pride in what we have accomplished in 2017. We have achieved a 31% production increase in one year (62% in two years), whilst continuing to develop our social and environmental efforts, entering into agreements with our communities, reducing our cost of production, bringing a new significant shareholder on board, finalizing the disbursement of our loan facility, reinforcing our team, increasing our workforce’ salaries to reflect the consumer price index in the DRC, commissioning possibly Africa’s most modern boiler & turbine in Yaligimba, kick-starting the rehabilitation of our Lokumete mill and commencing our Boteka boiler & turbine projects.\n“Whilst a moment of proud reflection is warranted, there is still much to be done before we can confidently consider that we have reached cruising altitude. For instance, the variable portion of our cost of production, including transport costs and labour efficiency, require improvement. Absenteeism at the plantations remains a serious concern. Our housing renovation programme is not progressing as fast as we hoped, partly because of difficulties in bringing the right skills to the sites. Agricultural upkeep standards are not at the required level yet, although they are rapidly improving, and downtime at our Lokutu and Boteka mills are still above acceptable levels; a direct consequence of insufficient preventative maintenance.\n“We have demonstrated our ability to face difficult challenges as a team, and overcome them one by one. We are now confidently capitalizing on that ability and the trend is clearly pointing in the right direction and we are delivering on our business plan.\n“Together we have the skills, the determination and the passion. The challenges before us may still be plenty, but we are confident that we will succeed.”\nFor further information please contact:\nXavier de Carniere\nChief Executive Officer, Feronia Inc.\n44 (0)7468 697 658\nxavier.decarniere@feronia.com\nwww.feronia.com\nPaul Dulieu\nDirector of Communications and Corporate Development, Feronia Inc.\n44 (0)7554 521421\npaul.dulieu@feronia.com\nwww.feronia.com\nAbout Feronia Inc.\nFeronia is an agribusiness operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). At the heart of Feronia lies a long established palm oil business, Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC), which has three remotely located plantations; Lokutu, Yaligimba and Boteka. When Feronia acquired its palm oil business from Unilever in 2009, it had suffered from years of underinvestment and considerable disruption caused by conflict in the DRC. Our initial focus has been on rebuilding the business and resuming production to secure its future and the livelihoods of the thousands of people we directly employ. Feronia’s plantations produce crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). CPO is part of the staple and traditional diet of the Congolese and, with our products sold locally in the DRC, we are well placed to help decrease reliance on imports and increase food security and quality. Feronia prides itself on being the guardian of our 107 year-old palm oil business and its employees, communities, and environment. We have a long term commitment to improve the living and working environment of our employees and their communities and are committed to sustainable agriculture, environmental protection and community inclusion. Feronia has in place an Environmental and Social Action Plan which is focused on implementing environmental and social best practice and improving social infrastructure. Feronia is working towards certification by the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and is implementing IFC/World Bank standards for environmental and social sustainability. Our oil palm replanting programme is brownfield in nature – replacing old palms with new – and it has no reliance on deforestation. Feronia’s management team has extensive experience in managing both plantations and farming operations in emerging markets.
