Bouygues, which runs Bouygues Telecom, climbed 3.2 percent.\nThe Shares of SFR’s parent company Altice also rose sharply, but the move essentially reflected a technical adjustment of their price following the separation of Altice NV from Altice USA.\nAltice USA’s spin-off was formally approved at the group’s shareholders meeting last week.\nSeveral attempts to cut the number of French telecoms operators from four to three have failed over the last few years. The last move was in 2016, when Orange failed to acquire Bouygues Telecom.\nArcep published a report earlier on Tuesday that showed that in 2017, French telecom operators had invested an extra 660 million euros ($779.5 million) more than the previous year, for an overall total of 9.6 billion euros.\nSeparately, Arcep’s head also said the regulator was opening a public consultation about the 5G radio frequencies, which he said should be granted between mid-2019 and mid-2020”.\n$1 = 0.8467 euros Reporting by Blandine Henault and Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Mathieu Rosemain\n ",
