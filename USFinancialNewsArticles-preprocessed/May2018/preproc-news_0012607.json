    "text": "PHOENIX, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (Nasdaq:SFM) today reported results for the 13-week first quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nNet sales of $1.3 billion; a 14% increase from the same period in 2017 Comparable store sales growth of 2.7% and two-year comparable store sales growth of 3.8% Net income of $67 million; a 44% increase from the same period in 2017 Diluted earnings per share of $0.50; a 52% increase from the same period in 2017\n“Our proven Sprouts business model delivered double-digit sales growth of 14%, strong new store productivity and solid EBITDA growth of 12% in the first quarter of the year,” said Amin Maredia, chief executive officer of Sprouts Farmers Market. “Our strong new store openings in both existing and new markets demonstrate our appeal to a broad base of consumers looking for healthy products at affordable prices. Our strategic initiatives remain on track and are setting the foundation for future success.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $1.3 billion, a 14% increase compared to the same period in 2017. Net sales growth was driven by strong performance in new stores opened and a 2.7% increase in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales were impacted by slight deflation during the quarter, the calendar shift in the New Year's holiday, and tight produce supply early in the quarter.\nGross profit for the quarter increased 15% to $387 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 30.1%, an increase of approximately 25 basis points compared to the same period in 2017. This leverage was primarily driven by improved merchandise margins.\nDirect store expense (“DSE”) for the quarter increased 15% to $263 million, or 20.4% of sales, compared to 20.3% in the same period in 2017. This deleverage is primarily driven by higher holiday pay related to the calendar shift in New Years, as well as increased benefit costs and depreciation. This was partially offset by labor productivity improvement and other operating efficiencies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the quarter increased 29% to $41 million, or 3.2% of sales, compared to 2.8% in the same period in 2017. This primarily reflects costs associated with strategic technology investments, as well as cycling lower stock-based compensation and bonus expenses in the prior year.\nNet income for the quarter was $67 million, a 44% increase compared to net income for the same period in 2017 and diluted earnings per share was $0.50, an increase of $0.17 or 52%, as compared to diluted earnings per share for the same period in 2017. This increase was driven by a lower effective tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the exercise of expiring pre-IPO options, higher sales and margins, and fewer shares outstanding due to our repurchase program.\nGrowth and Development\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we opened 9 new stores: three in Arizona, two in New Mexico and one each in California, North Carolina, Florida and our first store in the state of Maryland. Four additional stores have been opened in the second quarter to date, resulting in a total of 298 stores in 16 states as of May 3, 2018.\nLeverage and Liquidity\nWe generated cash from operations of $104 million for the first quarter of 2018 and invested $38 million in capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursement, primarily for new stores. In addition, we repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock for a total investment of $83 million. We ended the quarter with a $368 million balance on our revolving credit facility, $27 million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility, $21 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $394 million available under our current share repurchase authorizations. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter and through April 30, 2018, we have repurchased 44 thousand shares of common stock for a total investment of $1 million.\nDuring the first quarter, we closed on an amended and restated credit agreement that increased our total commitment to $700 million, from $450 million, extending its maturity through March 2023 and adding financial flexibility.\n2018 Outlook\nAs previously communicated, with the savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (1) , we will be investing $10 million, or approximately one third of our tax savings in team member wages and benefits. The following provides information on our guidance for 2018:\nFull-Year 2018\nCurrent Guidance Full-Year 2018\nPrior Guidance Net sales growth 10.5% to 11.5% 11.5% to 12.5% Unit growth Approximately 30 stores Approximately 30 stores Comparable store sales growth 1.5% to 2.5% 2.5% to 3.5% Diluted earnings per share $1.22 to $1.28 $1.22 to $1.28 Effective tax rate 19% to 20% (1) 19% to 20% (1) Capital expenditures $165M to $170M $165M to $170M (net of landlord reimbursements)\nFootnotes\n(1) The lower effective tax rate is due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the 2017 change in accounting standards related to the recognition of excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation and the associated effect of actual and estimated option exercises for the year. First Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nWe will hold a conference call at 7 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time (10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) on Thursday, May 3, 2018, during which Sprouts executives will further discuss our first quarter 2018 financial results.\nA webcast of the conference call will be available through Sprouts’ investor webpage located at investors.sprouts.com .

This measure is not in accordance with, and is not intended as an alternative to, GAAP. The company's management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for reviewing the financial results of the company and as a component of incentive compensation. The company defines EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income tax, and depreciation, amortization and accretion.\nNon-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meanings prescribed by GAAP. Use of these terms may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. Because of their limitations, non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to reinvest in the growth of the company’s business, or as a measure of cash that will be available to meet the company’s obligations. Each non-GAAP measure has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017:\nSPROUTS FARMERS MARKET, INC.
