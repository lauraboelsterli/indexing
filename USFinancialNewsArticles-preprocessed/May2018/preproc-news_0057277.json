Mandatory Credit: Tom Figura/Indy Star via USA TODAY Sports\nShe announced last November she would retire this year and bring the curtain down with the “Danica Double” by contesting the Daytona and Indy 500s.\nAs far as swan songs go February’s Daytona 500 was a bust ending in a wreck. The Indy 500 promised much but ended the same way.\n“Definitely not a great ending,” said Patrick. “Today was a tough day.”\nWhile there was plenty of disappointment in Patrick’s words there was not a hint of regret, having been steadfast in the buildup to Sunday’s race she would not get behind the wheel again and had no interest in being involved as an owner or mentor to young racers.

I have the highest respect for her ... she didn’t leave anything on the table.\n“It’s a tough world to carve out your niche and she did that.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury",
