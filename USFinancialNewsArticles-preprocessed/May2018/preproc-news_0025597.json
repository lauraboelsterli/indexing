Football - West Bromwich Albion v Everton - Barclays Premier League - The Hawthorns - 20/1/14 General view of Zoopla branding Mandatory Credit: Action Images / Carl Recine Livepic\nUnder the terms of the deal, each ZPG shareholder would get 490 pence in cash, which implies a premium of 31 percent to ZPG’s Thursday close, Silver Lake said in a statement on Friday.\nZPG directors, who are being advised by Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), consider the terms “fair and reasonable”, ZPG said in the joint statement.\nZPG’s largest shareholder and publisher of Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper, Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) ( DMGOa.L ), said it gave an irrevocable undertaking to accept Silver Lake’s offer in respect of its entire holding — which amounts to 29.8 percent of ZPG’s issued share capital.\nThe deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, the companies said.
