July hard red winter wheat was up 14 cents, or 2.7 percent, at $5.40-1/2 a bushel.\nBoth ended well above all key moving averages but closed below session highs.\nBetter-than-expected U.S. soybean planting progress capped the market after the USDA said 56 percent of the crop had been seeded as of Sunday, well ahead of the five-year average of 44 percent.\nCorn planting was 81-percent completed, in line with the average pace, USDA said.\nCBOT July soybeans were up 5-1/4 cents at $10.20-1/2 a bushel, settling near its 100-day moving average. The contract failed to breach chart resistance at its 50-day moving average.\nCBOT July corn added 2 cents to $4.04-3/4 a bushel.
