    "text": "PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: CDR – the \"Company\") today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net loss attributable to common shareholders was ($0.26) per diluted share compared to net income of $0.10 per diluted share for the comparable 2017 period. Other highlights include:\nHighlights\nNAREIT-defined funds from operations (FFO) of $0.09 per diluted share Operating funds from operations (Operating FFO) of $0.13 per diluted share Same-property net operating income (NOI) was flat compared to the same period in 2017 Signed 48 new and renewal leases for 578,700 square feet in the quarter Total portfolio 92.6% leased and same-property portfolio 93.7% leased at quarter-end Redeemed 2,000,000 shares of 7 ¼% Series B Preferred Stock on January 12, 2018\n\"This quarter we renewed a record amount of square footage as we proactively extended the lease terms for five strong anchor tenants,\" commented Bruce Schanzer, CEO. \"Further, we are advancing our urban mixed-use redevelopments and are excited about the value creation opportunities they represent as we continue to transform Cedar.\"\nFinancial Results\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was ($23.0) million or ($0.26) per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the same period in 2017. The principal difference in the comparative three-month results are impairment charges related to properties held for sale along with preferred stock redemption costs in 2018 and gain on sale in 2017.\nNAREIT-defined FFO for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to $11.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the same period in 2017. Operating FFO for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.9 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $11.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the same period in 2017. The principal difference between Operating FFO and NAREIT-defined FFO is preferred stock redemption costs.\nPortfolio Update\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company signed 48 leases for 578,700 square feet, all of which are comparable, at a negative lease spread of 7.2% on a cash basis. During the quarter, the Company proactively renewed and extended the rental terms for five anchor tenants totaling 303,000 square feet at reduced or flat base rental rates. These anchor tenants have good credit and generate high foot traffic at their respective properties. Excluding these five anchor renewal leases, on a comparable space basis, the Company's comparable lease spread would have been a positive 2.8%. Same-property NOI for the first quarter of 2018 was flat as compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe Company's total portfolio, excluding properties held for sale, was 92.6% leased at March 31, 2018, compared to 92.9% at December 31, 2017 and 91.2% at March 31, 2017. The Company's same-property portfolio was 93.7% leased at March 31, 2018, compared to 93.8% at December 31, 2017 and 93.2% at March 31, 2017.\nIn April 2018, the Company accepted a payment of $4.3 million in consideration for permitting a dark anchor tenant to terminate its lease prior to the contractual expiration, which will be reflected in the quarter ended June 30, 2018. This anchor tenant was located at a property held for sale, and while paying its contractual rent prior to lease termination, it had closed and ceased retail operations at the property. This termination will increase NAREIT-defined FFO and Operating FFO for 2018 by approximately $4.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share, after GAAP adjustments for amortization of intangible lease liabilities and straight-line rents, offset by foregone rental payments for the remainder of 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Carll's Corner, located in Bridgeton, New Jersey, and West Bridgewater Plaza, located in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts, have been classified as \"real estate held for sale\". The Company recorded impairment charges of $21.4 million in connection with these properties during 2018.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $98.7 million available under its revolving credit facility and reported net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations, and amortization for real estate (EBITDAre) of 7.9 times. Further, the Company has no debt maturities until early 2021.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company updates its previously-announced 2018 guidance as follows:\nNet (loss) attributable to common shareholders per diluted share\n($0.15) to ($0.13)\nNAREIT-defined FFO per diluted share\n$0.53 to $0.55\nOperating FFO per diluted share\n$0.58 to $0.60\nThis updated guidance reflects the approximately $0.24 per diluted share of impairment charges related to properties held for sale in the first quarter (excluded from NAREIT-defined FFO and Operating FFO) and the approximately $0.05 per diluted share of lease termination income in April 2018. The principal difference between NAREIT-defined FFO and Operating FFO is preferred stock redemption costs.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNAREIT-defined FFO is a widely recognized supplemental non-GAAP measure utilized to evaluate the financial performance of a REIT. The Company considers NAREIT-defined FFO to be an appropriate measure of its financial performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than other depreciable assets. The Company also considers Operating FFO to be an additional meaningful financial measure of financial performance because it excludes items the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance, such as acquisition pursuit costs, amounts relating to early extinguishment of debt and preferred stock redemption costs, management transition costs and certain redevelopment costs. The Company believes Operating FFO further assists in comparing the Company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding such items. NAREIT-defined FFO and Operating FFO should be reviewed with GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, when trying to understand the Company's operating performance. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to NAREIT-defined FFO and Operating FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is detailed in the attached schedule.\nEBITDAre is a recognized supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. The Company presents EBITDAre in accordance with the definition adopted by NAREIT, which generally defines EBITDAre as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, and impairment write-downs of depreciated property, plus or minus losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, and adjustments to reflect the Company's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company believes EBITDAre provides additional information with respect to the Company's performance and ability to meet its future debt service requirements. The Company also considers Adjusted EBITDAre to be an additional meaningful financial measure of financial performance because it excludes items the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance, such as acquisition pursuit and redevelopment costs. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDAre further assists in comparing the Company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding such items. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should be reviewed with GAAP net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, when trying to understand the Company's operating performance. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre do not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations or to cash flow from operating activities. The Company's computation of Adjusted EBITDAre may differ from the computations utilized by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such companies.\nSame-property NOI is a widely recognized supplemental non-GAAP financial measure for REITs. Properties are included in same-property NOI if they are owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared, except for properties undergoing significant redevelopment and expansion until such properties have stabilized, and properties classified as held for sale. Consistent with the capital treatment of such costs under GAAP, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other direct leasing costs are excluded from same-property NOI. The Company considers same-property NOI useful to investors as it provides an indication of the recurring cash generated by the Company's properties by excluding certain non-cash revenues and expenses, as well as other infrequent items such as lease termination income which tends to fluctuate more than rents from year to year. Same property NOI should be reviewed with consolidated operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nSupplemental Financial Information Package\nThe Company has issued \"Supplemental Financial Information\" for the period ended March 31, 2018.
