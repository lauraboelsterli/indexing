    "text": "LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Britainâ€™s House of Fraser said it would close some of its stores as a condition of securing new funds from international retailer C.banner, which will become the majority owner of the department stores group with a 51 percent stake.\nExisting shareholder Nanjing Cenbest, part of the Sanpower Group, will remain a minority shareholder, the retailer said on Wednesday.\nHouse of Fraser said it would launch a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA) next month to allow it to restructure its stores portfolio.\nReporting by Paul Sandle, editing by James Davey\n ",
