    "text": "* Futures up: Dow 0.65 pct, S&P 0.55 pct, Nasdaq 0.41 pct\nBy Medha Singh\nMay 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Wednesday, suggesting a respite from a steep selloff that had pushed the S&P and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to their worst day in a month due to a political crisis in Italy.\nReport of a renewed attempt to form a coalition government in Rome by the two anti-establishment parties, the 5-Star Movement and League, provided some comfort on hopes that the country could avoid a new election.\nA surprise breakthrough would ease uncertainty but still usher in a coalition planning to ramp up spending in the heavily indebted nation and push for changes to European Union and euro-zone fiscal rules.\nAt 7:30 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 159 points, or 0.65 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 14.75 points, or 0.55 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 28.25 points, or 0.41 percent.\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 and the Dow posted their first 1 percent drop in May as investors scurried for safety assets such as U.S. bonds on fears of political instability in eurozone.\nDespite the losses, the indexes are on track for their biggest monthly gains since January.\nInvestors kept a wary eye on the developments around tariffs and trade. In an unexpected change in tone, the United States said late on Tuesday it could still impose tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China unless it addressed the issue of theft of American intellectual property.\nChina said on Wednesday it was ready to fight back if Washington was looking for a trade war, days ahead of a planned visit by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\nAt 8:15 a.m. ET, the ADP National Employment report is expected to show that U.S. private employers added 190,000 jobs in May versus 204,000 jobs in the previous month.\nThe second estimate of first-quarter GDP is expected to have remained at 2.3 percent, while core personal consumption expenditures price index - the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation measure - is expected to increase at a 2.5 percent rate in the same period. The Commerce Department will release both data at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nBank stocks will be closely watched as the Federal Reserve is set to consider a proposal to modify the “Volcker Rule” at 3:00 p.m. ET.\nThe long anticipated proposal to rewrite the Volcker Rule, which marks another step by Trump administration regulators to ease banking rules, is aimed at preventing lenders from making market bets while accepting taxpayer-insured deposits.\nAmong stocks, Salesforce.com Inc rose 4.4 percent after the company raised its full-year forecast, helped by strong demand in its cloud-based sales and marketing software.\nReporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
