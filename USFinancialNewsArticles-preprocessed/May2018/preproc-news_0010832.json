    "text": "Published: May 1, 2018 4:44 p.m. ET Share\nEmbattled studio may soon be acquired Getty Images Harvey Weinstein, former co-chairman and co-founder of Weinstein Co., is seen in 2017.\nBy Jonathan Randles\nDallas-based private-equity firm Lantern Capital Partners topped the bidding for the film and television studio co-founded by Harvey Weinstein and is close to acquiring the business, according to people familiar with the matter.\nWeinstein Co. named Lantern the lead bidder with a $310 million offer when the entertainment company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March. No other potential buyers topped Lantern’s existing offer, one of these people said. The deadline for bids was the close of business Monday.\nRead: ‘Marco Polo’ producer files suit against Harvey Weinstein alleging rape\nAny sale of Weinstein Co. assets must be approved by a bankruptcy judge and could be challenged by the studio’s creditors.\nLantern would acquire the studio’s assets free of any of the legal liability currently pending against Weinstein Co., a common feature of chapter 11 that is intended to make sure troubled businesses are sold for as much as possible to repay creditors.",
