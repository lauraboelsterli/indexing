The French actress, who shot to fame as a teenage pop singer, stars as a director of hardcore gay porn films in a movie that screened at the Cannes Film Festival this week. 71st Cannes Film Festival - photocall for the film \"Knife + Heart\" (Un couteau dans le coeur) in competition - Cannes, France May 18, 2018.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n“Knife + Heart” (“Un Couteau Dans Le Coeur”) is set in the seedy world of low-grade porn production in 1970s France, where Paradis’ character Anne is intrigued, and then terrorized, by a serial killer who is gruesomely murdering some of her actors.\nCritics compared the movie to the works of “Dressed to Kill” director Brian De Palma, with Hollywood Reporter calling it a “deliciously campy slasher flick”. Screen Daily said it was a “film drunk on its own trashy, lurid aesthetic”.\n“The set(-up) is controversial, but the movie talks about love, deeply about love,” Paradis told Reuters in an interview.\n“It’s super-romantic, it’s very shy actually.” 71st Cannes Film Festival - conference for the film \"Knife + Heart\" (Un couteau dans le coeur) in competition - Cannes, France May 18, 2018.

It’s like a fun house, it’s full of surprises,”\n“Knife + Heart” is competing for the Palme d’Or, which will be awarded on Saturday. Writing by Robin Pomeroy; editing by Andrew Roche",
