    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northwest Natural Gas Company, dba NW Natural (NYSE:NWN), reported consolidated net income of $41.5 million (or $1.44 per share) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $40.3 million (or $1.40) for the same period in 2017. Highlights included:\nDelivered strong natural gas utility results with 1.6% customer growth over the last twelve months Continued constructing North Mist Gas Storage Expansion Project Reaffirmed earnings guidance for 2018, which is expected to range from $2.10 to $2.30 per share\n\"We continued to provide safe, reliable service to our customers through the winter months. Our service territory continues to see strong in-migration and customer growth,\" said David H. Anderson, president and chief executive officer of NW Natural. \"We continue to make good progress on the North Mist Expansion and are excited to further our water utility strategy announced in December.\"\nFor the first quarter of 2018, consolidated net income increased $1.2 million to $41.5 million compared to the same period in 2017 reflecting natural gas utility customer growth, the return to relatively average weather, lower depreciation expense in our gas storage segment, and a timing benefit associated with a lower federal tax rate.\nNORTH MIST EXPANSION PROJECT\nThe North Mist Expansion Project remains on track to be in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018. To date, we have completed all necessary wells for the project and the pipeline connecting the North Mist facility to Portland General Electric's Port Westward industrial park. We are assembling the compressor station and expect to begin natural gas injections at the facility in the coming weeks. The estimated cost of the expansion is $132 million. The investment will be included in rate base under an established tariff when it is placed into service. The facility is under an initial 30-year contract with Portland General Electric with options to extend the contract totaling up to an additional 50 years upon mutual agreement.\nThe project is designed to provide long-term, no-notice underground gas storage service to support gas-fired electric generating facilities that are intended to facilitate the integration of wind power into the region's electric generation mix. Natural gas storage enables electric generation to adjust quickly when renewable energy, such as wind and solar, rises and falls. Our no-notice service is designed to allow the local electric company to draw on our North Mist facility to meet its fueling needs and rapidly respond to natural variability in wind generation.\nFIRST QUARTER RESULTS AND UPDATES\nSegment Results\nThe following financial comparisons are between the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017 with individual factors below presented on an after-tax basis using a statutory tax rate of 26.5%, unless otherwise noted.\nThe first quarter results are summarized by business segment in the table below:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change In thousands, expect per share data Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Net income (loss): Utility segment $ 39,883 $ 1.39 $ 40,192 $ 1.40 $ (309 ) $ (0.01 ) Gas storage segment 1,898 0.06 61 — 1,837 0.06 Other (244 ) (0.01 ) 57 — (301 ) (0.01 ) Consolidated net income $ 41,537 $ 1.44 $ 40,310 $ 1.40 $ 1,227 $ 0.04 Diluted Shares 28,803 28,723 80 Gas Utility\nGas utility net income was comparable to the prior year with a $0.3 million decrease (or $0.01 per share). Utility margin decreased $6.9 million. While customer growth of 1.6% over the last twelve months contributed $1.2 million, this was more than offset by lower margins from slightly warmer than normal weather in 2018 compared to 26% colder than average weather in 2017, which led to lower margin from customers not covered by a weather normalization mechanism. In addition, margin decreased $4.7 million as a result of deferring revenues associated with the decline in the federal tax rate.\nOperations and maintenance expense increased $0.9 million reflecting higher compensation and benefits expense. Depreciation expense increased $0.7 million as we continue to invest in our infrastructure for customer growth, safety, and facility upgrades.\nTax expense decreased $9.0 million primarily due to the lower federal income tax rate.\nGas Storage\nGas storage net income increased $1.8 million (or $0.06 per share) primarily due to a $1.3 million decrease in operating expenses as depreciation expense for the Gill Ranch facility was $0.8 million lower after an impairment of long-lived assets was taken in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, gas storage revenues increased $0.5 million primarily from higher asset management revenues at our Mist facility.\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) or tax reform was enacted. Tax reform, among other things, lowered the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from the previous maximum rate of 35%. Changes in deferred taxes within our regulated operations for tax reform are recorded as adjustments to regulatory liability accounts. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated the utility's regulatory liability for historical deferred taxes was $213.3 million. The majority of this liability will likely be returned to customers over an amortization period in compliance with Internal Revenue Service tax normalization rules.\nUntil customer rates can be reset, we will defer the estimated effect of tax reform on customer rates. In the first quarter of 2018 we deferred $6.5 million pre-tax including interest ($4.8 million after-tax) of revenues into a regulatory liability to be returned to customers. The revenue deferral is based on the estimated benefit to customers for the year using forecasted utility earnings considering average weather and associated volumes. We currently estimate the deferral for 2018 will be $8 to $12 million pre-tax.\nOn March 20, 2018 we revised our Oregon general rate case to incorporate the effect of tax reform on future rates beginning Nov. 1, 2018. On a parallel track we are working with the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC) in a docket to determine the treatment of deferred taxes for periods prior to Nov. 1, 2018. We expect to address tax reform with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) in our next Washington general rate case.\nOregon Rate Case\nIn December 2017, we filed an Oregon general rate case requesting a $40.4 million or 6% revenue requirement increase, after an adjustment for the conservation tariff deferral, to continue operating and maintaining our distribution system and providing safe, reliable service to our customers. In March 2018, we made supplemental filings in the rate case to incorporate the effect of the TCJA on future rates. As a result, our requested annual revenue requirement increase is $25.7 million or 4%, after an adjustment for our conservation tariff deferral. The revised revenue requirement is based upon the following assumptions or requests:\nForward test year from November 1, 2018 through October 31, 2019; Capital structure of 50% debt and 50% equity; Return on equity of 10.0%; Cost of capital of 7.62%; and Rate base of $1.215 billion or an increase of $329 million since the last rate case.\nA final order is anticipated in or before October with new customer rates expected to be effective Nov. 1, 2018.\nBALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOWS\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we continued to maintain a strong capital structure with ample liquidity. We have solid capacity to meet our anticipated capital needs through the remainder of the year.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we generated $104.5 million in operating cash flow and invested $57.4 million in capital expenditures to support growth, safety, and our North Mist Expansion Project. Cash provided by operations decreased $40.6 million due to changes in working capital and deferred gas costs as well as higher taxes paid. Cash outflows from investing activities increased $18.7 million primarily due to higher capital expenditures, and cash outflows from financing activities decreased $29.9 million primarily due to lower debt maturities and repayments.\n2018 EARNINGS GUIDANCE REAFFIRMED\nThe Company reaffirmed 2018 guidance today in the range of $2.10 to $2.30 per share. This guidance assumes continued customer growth from our utility segment, average weather conditions, and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms, or outcomes, or significant laws or regulations.\nWe continue to expect capital expenditures for 2018 to be in the range of $190 to $220 million to support core gas utility customer growth and safety and reliability, as well as the completion of the North Mist Expansion Project. We expect to finance our capital needs in 2018 using a combination of cash flow from operations and debt. Our total capital investment plan for the five-year period from 2018 to 2022 is approximately $750 to $850 million, with a majority supporting continued customer growth, distribution system maintenance and improvements, technology investments, and utility gas storage facility maintenance.\nINCREASING DIVIDEND DECLARED\nIn April 2018, NW Natural's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 47.25 cents per share on the Company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on May 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on April 30, 2018, reflecting an annual indicated dividend rate of $1.89 per share.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nAs previously reported, NW Natural will host a conference call and webcast today to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial and operating results.\nDate and Time: Tuesday, May 8\n8 a.m. PT (11 a.m. ET) Phone Numbers: United States: 1-866-267-6789\nCanada: 1-855-669-9657\nInternational: 1-412-902-4110 The call will also be webcast in a listen-only format for the media and general public and can be accessed at nwnatural.com under the Investor Relations tab.
