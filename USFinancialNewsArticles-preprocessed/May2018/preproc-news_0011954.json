    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kansas City Southern (“KCS”) (NYSE:KSU) today announced the pricing of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.70% Senior Notes due 2048 pursuant to KCS’s shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering by KCS is expected to close on May 3, 2018. KCS intends to use the net proceeds from the offering (i) to repay KCS’s outstanding commercial paper; (ii) to refinance a locomotive lease and certain equipment loans; and (iii) for general corporate purposes.\nThis announcement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any security in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nHeadquartered in Kansas City, Mo., KCS is a transportation holding company that has railroad investments in the U.S., Mexico and Panama. Its primary U.S. holding is The Kansas City Southern Railway Company, serving the central and south central U.S. KCS’s international holdings include Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM”), serving northeastern and central Mexico and the port cities of Lázaro Cárdenas, Tampico and Veracruz, and a 50 percent interest in the Panama Canal Railway Company, providing ocean-to-ocean freight and passenger service along the Panama Canal. KCS’s North American rail holdings and strategic alliances are primary components of a railway network linking the commercial and industrial centers of the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\nThis news release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the securities laws concerning potential future events involving KCS and its subsidiaries, which could materially differ from the events that actually occur. Words such as “projects,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “believes,” “intends,” “expects,” “anticipates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify many of these forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to management and management’s perception thereof as of the date hereof. Differences that actually occur could be caused by a number of external factors over which management has little or no control, including: competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; the business environment in industries that produce and use items shipped by rail; loss of the rail concession of KCSM; the termination of, or failure to renew, agreements with customers, other railroads and third parties; access to capital; disruptions to KCS’s technology infrastructure, including its computer systems; natural events such as severe weather, hurricanes and floods; market and regulatory responses to climate change; legislative and regulatory developments and disputes; rail accidents or other incidents or accidents on KCS’s rail network or at KCS’s facilities or customer facilities involving the release of hazardous materials, including toxic inhalation hazards; fluctuation in prices or availability of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; dependency on certain key suppliers of core rail equipment; changes in securities and capital markets; unavailability of qualified personnel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; acts of terrorism or risk of terrorist activities; war or risk of war; domestic and international economic, political and social conditions; the level of trade between the United States and Asia or Mexico; fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rate; increased demand and traffic congestion; the outcome of claims and litigation involving KCS or its subsidiaries; and other factors affecting the operation of the business. More detailed information about factors that could affect future events may be found in filings by KCS with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including KCS’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (File No. 1-4717) and subsequent reports. Forward-looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guarantee of future performance or results, nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. KCS is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180430006500/en/\nKansas City Southern\nAshley Thorne, 816-983-1530\nathorne@kcsouthern.com\nSource: Kansas City Southern",
