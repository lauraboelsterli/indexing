These quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily driven by a rise in LIBOR.\nOn a fair value basis, as of March 31, 2018, 96.2% of the Company’s debt investments bore interest at a floating rate. 7\nAs of March 31, 2018, the weighted average net debt/EBITDA of the companies in the Company’s investment portfolio was 5.1x versus 5.3x as of December 31, 2017.

The increase in investment income over the quarter was primarily driven by higher interest and dividend income and is partially offset by a decline in other income. The $35.5 million of total investment income was comprised of $34.0 million from interest income, original issue discount accretion, payment-in-kind and dividend income, $0.2 million from other income and $1.3 million from prepayment related income. 9\nTotal expenses before taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $16.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively. The $1.8 million increase in expenses was primarily driven by an increase in incentive fees.

The SCF’s return to the Company was measured at GS BDC’s average member’s equity at cost over the trailing four quarters.\n4 Pursuant to the Company’s Investment Management Agreement, the management fee is calculated on the average value of the Company’s gross assets (including assets purchased with borrowed money, but excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.\n5 Total debt outstanding excluding netting of debt issuance costs of $3.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\n6 Computed based on the (a) annual actual interest rate or yield earned plus amortization of fees and discounts on the performing debt and other income producing investments as of the reporting date, divided by (b) the total performing debt and other income producing investments (excluding investments on non-accrual) at amortized cost.\n7 The fixed versus floating composition has been calculated as a percentage of performing debt investments, including income producing stock investments. Excluding investments, if any, placed on non-accrual.\n8 For a particular portfolio company, EBITDA typically represents net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. The net debt to EBITDA represents the ratio of a portfolio company’s total debt (net of cash) and excluding debt subordinated to the Company’s investment in a portfolio company, to a portfolio company’s EBITDA. The interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of a portfolio company’s EBITDA as a multiple of a portfolio company’s interest expense. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of the Company’s debt investments, including the Company’s exposure to underlying debt investments in the SCF and excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of the Company’s performing debt investments, including the Company’s exposure to underlying debt investments in the SCF and excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. Median EBITDA is based on the Company’s debt investments, including the Company’s exposure to underlying debt investments in the SCF and excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. As of March 31, 2018, investments where EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 11.1% of total debt investments, including the Company’s investment in the SCF, at fair value. Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the respective reported end date. Portfolio company statistics have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount.\n9 Interest income excludes accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts of $0.8 million. Prepayment related income includes prepayment premiums and accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts.\n10 The average debt to equity leverage ratio has been calculated using the average daily borrowings during the quarter divided by average net assets, adjusted for equity contributions. The ending and average debt to equity leverage ratios exclude unfunded commitments.\nGoldman Sachs BDC, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nDecember 31, 2017 Assets Investments, at fair value Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments (cost of $1,037,572 and $1,053,226, respectively) $ 1,034,222 $ 1,050,179 Non-controlled affiliated investments (cost of $123,289 and $109,528, respectively) 108,244 95,468 Controlled affiliated investments (cost of $116,684 and $114,911, respectively) 114,214 112,666 Investments in affiliated money market fund (cost of $2 and $11,539, respectively) 2 11,539 Cash 6,929 11,606 Receivable for investments sold 4,000 — Interest and dividends receivable from non-controlled/affiliated investments and non-controlled/non-affiliated investments 9,017 8,302 Dividend receivable from controlled affiliated investments 2,800 2,400 Other income receivable from controlled affiliated investments — 1,308 Deferred financing costs 6,332 4,847 Deferred offering costs 275 275 Other assets 194 2 Total assets $ 1,286,229 $ 1,298,592 Liabilities Debt (net of debt issuance costs of $3,507 and $3,724, respectively) $ 526,493 $ 542,526 Interest and other debt expenses payable 2,931 1,688 Management fees payable 4,803 4,647 Incentive fees payable 4,684 3,180 Payable for investments purchased 89 — Distribution payable 18,070 18,059 Directors’ fees payable 100 — Accrued offering costs 206 289 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,142 2,373 Total liabilities $ 559,518 $ 572,762 Commitments and Contingencies Net Assets Preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (1,000,000 shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding) $ — $ — Common stock, par value $0.001 per share (200,000,000 shares authorized, 40,154,489 and 40,130,665 shares\nissued and outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively)\n40 40 Paid-in capital in excess of par 800,436 799,936 Accumulated net realized gain (loss) (84,222 ) (85,451 ) Accumulated undistributed net investment income 32,743 32,078 Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (20,865 ) (19,352 ) Allocated income tax expense (1,421 ) (1,421 ) TOTAL NET ASSETS $ 726,711 $ 725,830 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND NET ASSETS $ 1,286,229 $ 1,298,592 Net asset value per share $ 18.10 $ 18.09 Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nFor the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nFor the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nInvestment Income: From non-controlled/non-affiliated investments: Interest income $ 29,790 $ 26,966 Dividend income — — Other income 236 535 Total investment income from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments 30,026 27,501 From non-controlled affiliated investments: Payment-in-kind 1,941 1,672 Interest income 388 540 Dividend income 7 23 Other income 6 6 Total investment income from non-controlled affiliated investments 2,342 2,241 From controlled affiliated investments: Payment-in-kind 373 — Dividend income 2,800 2,450 Other income — — Total investment income from controlled affiliated investments 3,173 2,450 Total investment income $ 35,541 $ 32,192 Expenses: Interest and other debt expenses $ 5,723 $ 4,512 Management fees 4,803 4,461 Incentive fees 4,684 3,733 Professional fees 670 461 Administration, custodian and transfer agent fees 231 194 Directors’ fees 101 173 Other expenses 309 338 Total expenses $ 16,521 $ 13,872 NET INVESTMENT INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAXES $ 19,020 $ 18,320 Excise tax expense $ 285 $ 365 NET INVESTMENT INCOME (LOSS) AFTER TAXES $ 18,735 $ 17,955 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investment transactions: Net realized gain (loss) from: Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments $ 1,667 $ (168) Non-controlled affiliated investments 9 — Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from: Non controlled/non-affiliated investments (303) (787) Non-controlled affiliated investments (985) (2,864) Controlled affiliated investments (225) 429 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) $ 163 $ (3,390) Provision for taxes on realized gains on investments $ (447) $ — NET INCREASE IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS $ 18,451 $ 14,565 Net investment income (loss) per share (basic and diluted) $ 0.47 $ 0.49 Earnings per share (basic and diluted) $ 0.46 $ 0.40 Weighted average shares outstanding 40,150,518 36,340,808 Distributions declared per share $ 0.45 $ 0.45 ABOUT GOLDMAN SACHS BDC, INC.\nGoldman Sachs BDC, Inc. is a specialty finance company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
