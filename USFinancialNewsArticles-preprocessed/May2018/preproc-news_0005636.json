    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Klondex Mines Ltd. (TSX:KDX) (NYSE American:KLDX) (\"Klondex\", the \"Company\", \"we\", \"our\", or \"us\") is pleased to announce its operational and financial results for the first quarter 2018. This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2018 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which includes the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\"), which is available on the Company's website ( www.klondexmines.com ), on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ), and on EDGAR ( www.sec.gov ). All dollar amounts included in this press release are expressed in thousands of United States dollars, unless otherwise noted, and are based on the MD&A and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States. References to \"Notes\" refers to the notes contained in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nAcquisition by Hecla - Announced proposed acquisition of Klondex by Hecla Mining Company (Hecla) for $462 million, and related spin out to shareholders of the Canadian assets. Safety - No lost-time injuries occurred at the Company's properties during the quarter. As of March 31, 2018, the Company operated 1,993 days (~5.5 years) at Fire Creek, 1,273 days (~3.5 years) at Midas, 143 days (~.4 years) at True North, and 544 days (~1.5 years) at Hollister and Aurora, without a lost-time injury. Consolidated operating performance - Mined a total of 49,873 gold equivalent ounces (“GEOs”), with production of 43,525 GEOs. Nevada performance - Total GEOs mined in Nevada were 47,499, with production of 41,415 GEOs. Canada performance - At the True North mine, the Company mined and produced 2,374 and 2,111 GEOs respectively from underground operations. Ounces sold - The Company sold 42,541 GEOs, consisting of 40,572 gold ounces and 158,239 silver ounces. Revenue was $56.8 million from average realized selling prices per gold and silver ounce of $1,334 and $16.61, respectively. Financial Results - Net loss for the quarter was $8.0 million or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted). First quarter net loss was negatively impacted by $3.6 million for costs related to the pending acquisition of Klondex by Hecla. Excluding the net impact of these costs, the Company's adjusted net loss (1) for the quarter was $5.1 million or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted).\n(1) This is a non-GAAP measure; refer to the Non-GAAP performance measures section of this Press Release for additional detail. Proposed Transaction with Hecla\nOn March 19, 2018, the Company announced that Hecla will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Klondex through a plan of arrangement. Hecla will acquire Klondex for consideration of $462 million comprised of cash and shares of Hecla common stock. Klondex shareholders will receive $2.47 per share in cash or shares of Hecla which represents a 59% premium to Klondex's 30-day volume-weighted average price at March 16, 2018 and a premium of approximately 72% based on the closing price on March 16, 2018. Klondex's Canadian assets will be spun out to its existing shareholders. Klondex shareholders will receive, for each Klondex share, 0.125 of a common share of a newly formed company which will own Klondex's Canadian assets.\nThe closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions including shareholder and regulatory approvals. Additional details regarding the transaction will be available in the preliminary proxy statement that is expected to be filed with regulatory agencies in May. Pending receipt of all required approvals, the Company anticipates that the transaction will be completed around the end of the second quarter of 2018.\nConsolidated Financial Results of Operations\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues $ 56,771 $ 41,710 Cost of sales Production costs 35,449 26,229 Depreciation and depletion 13,103 7,728 Write-down of production inventories 8,517 3,680 (298 ) 4,073 Other operating expenses General and administrative 5,824 4,488 Exploration 502 127 Development and projects costs — 5,505 Asset retirement and accretion 334 381 Arrangement agreement costs 3,616 — Loss on equipment disposal 20 116 (Loss) income from operations (10,594 ) (6,544 ) Other income (expense) (Loss) gain on derivatives, net (128 ) (2,144 ) Interest expense, net (599 ) (1,158 ) Foreign currency (loss) gain, net 3,185 (1,021 ) Interest income and other (expense), net 6 17 Income (loss) before tax (8,130 ) (10,850 ) Income tax benefit (expense) 132 623 Net (loss) income $ (7,998 ) $ (10,227 ) Net (loss) income per share Basic $ (0.04 ) $ (0.06 ) Diluted $ (0.04 ) $ (0.06 ) First quarter 2018\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues increased compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to more ounces sold and a higher price per ounce of gold. Increases in production costs during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017 were driven by the operations at Hollister and Aurora, which were not operating during first quarter 2017. General and administrative costs 2018 increased as compared to the prior year period primarily due to severance costs related to the restructuring of the True North operations in early January of 2018. The decrease in Development and project costs during the first quarter of 2018 was due to expenses incurred at Hollister and Aurora during the first quarter of 2017. The Company incurred a foreign currency gain of $3.2 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to a foreign currency loss of $1.0 million 2017.\nNet loss 2018 was $8.0 million or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted). The first quarter of 2018 includes $3.6 million for costs related to the pending acquisition of Klondex by Hecla. Excluding the net impact of these costs, the Company's adjusted net loss (1) for the quarter was $5.1 million or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted).\n(1) This is a non-GAAP measure; refer to the Non-GAAP performance measures section of this Press Release for additional detail.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net (loss) income $ (7,998 ) $ (10,227 ) Net non-cash adjustments 13,531 10,942 Net change in non-cash working capital 2,477 (3,809 ) Net cash provided by (used in ) operating activities 8,010 (3,094 ) Net cash used in investing activities (3,271 ) (17,927 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (507 ) 2,880 Effect of foreign exchange on cash balances (143 ) 59 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 4,089 (18,082 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 33,229 57,691 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period $ 37,318 $ 39,609 Working capital and liquidity\nCash balance at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was $27.8 million after $8.0 million of operating cash inflows, $3.3 million used in investing activities, and $0.5 million used in financing activities. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had total liquidity of $43.8 million, consisting of $38.8 million in working capital and $5.0 million Revolver borrowing availability. The Company held metal inventory valued at approximately $28.8 million at the end of the first quarter.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary Operational Results\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 Mine operations Fire Creek Midas Hollister Aurora (4) Nevada Total True North Total Ore tons mined 30,409 23,761 27,282 10,851 92,303 19,301 111,604 Average gold equivalent mined head grade (oz/ton) (1) 0.80 0.43 0.43 0.09 0.51 0.12 0.45 Gold equivalent mined (oz) (1) 24,453 10,174 11,864 1,016 47,499 2,374 49,873 Gold mined (oz) (1) 24,080 9,398 10,809 826 45,113 2,374 47,487 Silver mined (oz) (1) 30,130 62,055 84,321 15,240 191,746 — 191,746 Ore tons milled 30,699 26,973 21,249 10,851 89,772 19,390 109,162 Average gold equivalent mill head grade (oz/ton) (1) 0.79 0.42 0.51 0.10 0.54 0.12 0.40 Average gold mill head grade (oz/ton) 0.78 0.36 0.46 0.08 0.49 0.12 0.37 Average silver mill head grade (oz/ton) (2) 1.01 4.98 3.70 1.40 2.88 — 3.45 Average gold recovery rate (%) 91.9 % 89.1 % 84.4 % 55.0 % 88.9 % 92.3 % 93.4 % Average silver recovery rate (%) (2) 79.4 % 77.6 % 42.7 % 45.1 % 65.3 % — % 84.2 % Gold equivalent produced (oz) (1) 22,305 9,878 8,701 540 41,415 2,111 43,525 Gold produced (oz) 22,000 8,583 8,280 454 39,317 2,091 41,408 Silver produced (oz) 24,669 103,600 33,620 6,871 168,760 1,559 170,319 Gold equivalent sold (oz) (1) 15,241 10,565 10,081 1,492 37,370 5,171 42,541 Gold sold (oz) 15,014 9,416 9,645 1,347 35,421 5,151 40,572 Silver sold (oz) 18,340 91,897 34,860 11,583 156,680 1,559 158,239 Revenues and realized prices Gold revenue (000s) $ 20,200 $ 12,512 $ 12,801 $ 1,789 $ 47,302 $ 6,841 $ 54,143 Silver revenue (000s) 305 1,526 579 192 2,602 26 2,628 Total revenues (000s) $ 20,505 $ 14,038 $ 13,380 $ 1,981 $ 49,904 $ 6,867 $ 56,771 Average realized gold price ($/oz) $ 1,345 $ 1,329 $ 1,327 $ 1,328 $ 1,335 $ 1,328 $ 1,334 Average realized silver price ($/oz) $ 16.63 $ 16.61 $ 16.61 $ 16.58 $ 16.61 $ 16.68 $ 16.61 Non-GAAP Measures Production cash costs per GEO sold (2)(3) $ 497 $ 1,092 $ 1,156 $ 1,345 $ 877 $ 1,802 $ 989 (1) Gold equivalent ounces (\"GEO\") and grades are computed as the applicable gold ounces/grade plus the silver ounces/grade divided by a GEO ratio. GEO ratios are computed by dividing the average realized gold price per ounce by the average realized silver price per ounce received by the Company in the respective period. Mined ounces are calculated using tons hauled to surface multiplied by the assays from production sampling. (2) The Company does not track this silver statistic at True North due to silver being immaterial to that operation. (3) This is a non-GAAP measure; refer to the Non-GAAP performance measures section of this Press Release for additional detail. (4) Aurora activity is a result of processing historical Hollister tailings at the Aurora mill. Nevada operations\nThe Company's Nevada operations mined 92,303 ore tons at an average mined head grade of 0.51 GEOs per ton during the first quarter of 2018. The Company mined and produced a total of 47,499 and 41,415 GEOs, respectively, at its Nevada operations during the first quarter of 2018. Total GEOs produced for the first quarter included approximately 3,700 ounces from the Hollister ore stockpile that were sold to and processed by a third party.\nCanada operations\nDuring the first quarter, the True North mine transitioned from operating to care and maintenance. During the transition, 19,301 ore tons were mined from areas that were developed prior to the Company's decision to place the True North operation on care and maintenance in early January of 2018. The Company mined and produced a total of 2,374 and 2,111 GEOs, respectively, at its Canada operations during the first quarter of 2018. Consistent with management plans, no ounces were processed from tailings at True North during the first quarter of 2018. Processing of tailings at the True North mill has now resumed due to warmer weather conditions.\nContact\nMike Beckstead\nDirector, Investor Relations\nO: 775-284-5757\nM: 406-290-4165\nmbeckstead@klondexmines.com\nAbout Klondex Mines Ltd.

These Non-GAAP Measures are used internally to assess our operating and economic performance and to provide key performance information to management. We believe that these Non-GAAP Measures, in addition to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flows required to fund and sustain our business. These Non-GAAP Measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These Non-GAAP Measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under GAAP, and therefore may not be comparable to or consistent with measures used by other issuers or with amounts presented in our financial statements.\nOur primary business is gold production and our current and future operations, development, exploration, and life-of-mine plans primarily focus on maximizing returns from such gold production. As a result, our Non-GAAP Measures are calculated and disclosed on a per gold or gold equivalent ounce basis, except for adjusted net (loss) income.\nAdjusted net loss\nThe Company believes the use of adjusted net loss allows management, investors, and analysts to understand its net (loss) income related to its primary business. For the first quarter 2018, costs related to the pending acquisition of Klondex by Hecla have been excluded from net loss. Net loss is reconciled to adjusted net loss in the table below (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 Net loss $ (7,998 ) Arrangement agreement costs 3,616 Tax effect of Arrangement agreement costs (759 ) Adjusted net loss $ (5,141 ) Net loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.04 ) Arrangement agreement costs 0.02 Tax effect of Arrangement agreement costs — Adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.02 ) Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold\nProduction cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold presents our cash costs associated with the production of gold equivalent ounces and, as such, non-cash depreciation and depletion charges are excluded. Production cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated on a per gold equivalent ounce sold basis, and includes all direct and indirect operating costs related to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining expenses, on-site administrative and support costs, royalties, and cash portions of net realizable value write-downs on production-related inventories (State of Nevada net proceeds and other such taxes are excluded). We believe that converting the benefits from selling silver ounces into gold ounces is helpful to analysts and investors as it best represents the way we operate, which is to maximize returns from gold production. Gold equivalent ounces are computed using the number of silver ounces required to generate the revenue derived from the sale of one gold ounce, using average realized selling prices (in thousands, except ounces sold and per ounce amounts):\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 Nevada Total True North Total Average realized price per gold ounce sold $ 1,335 $ 1,328 $ 1,334 Average realized price per silver ounce sold $ 16.61 $ 16.68 $ 16.61 Silver ounces equivalent to revenue from one gold ounce 80.4 79.6 80.4 Silver ounces sold 156,680 1,559 158,239 GEOs from silver ounces sold 1,949 20 1,968 Gold ounces sold 35,421 5,151 40,572 Gold equivalent ounces $ 37,370 $ 5,171 $ 42,540 Production costs $ 27,281 $ 8,168 $ 35,449 Add: Write-down of production inventories (cash portion) 5,484 1,150 6,634 $ 32,765 $ 9,318 $ 42,083 Production cash costs per GEO sold $ 877 $ 1,802 $ 989 (1) Nevada Total includes Fire Creek, Midas, Hollister, and Aurora. All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold\nAll-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP.\nOur calculation of AISC per gold ounce sold is consistent with the June 2013 guidance released by the World Gold Council, a non-regulatory, non-profit market development organization for the gold industry. AISC per gold ounce sold reflects the varying costs of producing gold over the life-cycle of a mine or project, including costs required to discover and develop new sources of production; therefore, capital amounts related to expansion and growth projects are included.\nAISC per gold ounce includes all: (1) direct and indirect operating cash costs related to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing, third-party refining expenses, on-site administrative and support costs, royalties, and cash portions of net realizable value write-downs on production-related inventories (2) general and administrative expenses, (3) asset retirement and accretion expenses, and (4) sustaining capital expenditures, the total of which is reduced for revenues earned from silver sales. Certain cash expenditures, including State of Nevada net proceeds and other related taxes, federal tax payments, and financing costs are excluded.\nAll-in costs per gold ounce sold\nAll-in costs per gold ounce sold includes additional costs which reflect the varying costs of producing gold over the life-cycle of a mine or project. We calculate our all-in costs per gold ounce sold by beginning with the AISC total and adding non-sustaining (growth) capital expenditures and exploration and development expenditures.\nAISC per gold ounce sold and all-in costs per gold ounce sold are presented in the tables below (in thousands, except ounces sold and per ounce amounts):\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 Nevada\nTotal (1) True North Corporate Total Production costs $ 27,281 $ 8,168 $ — $ 35,449 Add: Write-down of production inventories (cash portion) 5,484 1,150 — 6,634 32,765 9,318 — 42,083 General and administrative 727 1,191 3,906 5,824 Asset retirement cost assets and accretion 303 31 — 334 Sustaining capital expenditures 2,705 16 — 2,721 Less: silver revenue (2,602 ) (26 ) — (2,628 ) All-in sustaining costs 33,898 10,530 3,906 48,334 Gold ounces sold 35,421 5,151 — 40,572 All-in sustaining costs per gold ounce sold $ 957 $ 2,044 $ — $ 1,191 All-in sustaining costs 33,898 10,530 3,906 48,334 Non-sustaining capital expenditures 64 10 15 89 Exploration 502 — — 502 Development and projects costs — — — — All-in costs $ 34,464 $ 10,540 $ 3,921 $ 48,925 Gold ounces sold 35,421 5,151 — 40,572 All-in costs per gold ounce sold $ 973 $ 2,046 $ — $ 1,206 (1) The Nevada Total includes Fire Creek, Midas, Hollister, and Aurora.\nSource:Klondex Mines Ltd.",
