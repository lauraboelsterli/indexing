    "text": "NEW YORK, May 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The ID2020 Alliance has named four new members to its Board of Directors: Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; Kim Cameron, Architect of Identity at Microsoft; Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset; and David Treat, Managing Director and Global Head of Accenture's Blockchain Practice.\nID2020 is a growing global alliance of international NGOs, private companies, and UN agencies working together to address the lack of recognized identity that affects more than one billion people around the world. Alliance partners are committed to using technology to accelerate access to digital identity for those living without a recognized form of identity. We set global technical standards and finance projects to implement digital identity solutions that are personal, private, portable, and persistent. Partners include Accenture, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Hyperledger, iRespond, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Microsoft, and UN-ICC.\n\"We are thrilled to have such an inspirational group of individuals — all cutting-edge in their respective fields — join our board,\" said Dakota Gruener, Executive Director of the Alliance. \"ID2020 has always been governed by strong leaders who are dedicated to our mission of providing a decentralized, privacy-ensuring, user-controlled digital identity. Our new board members all embody this ethos.\"\nBerkley, Cameron, Masters, and Treat join ID2020's expanded Executive Board, composed of individuals from the banking, technology, public, and international sectors. Other Board Members include: John Edge, Co-Founder and Chairman of ID2020; Chip Dempsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC); Elana Broitman, Director of New America NYC; and Oliver Bussmann, Founder of Bussmann Advisory.\nDr. Seth Berkley is a leader in the global health field. He founded the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) in 1996, and currently leads Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance as CEO. \"Digital identity has the capacity to enable access to vital, life-saving services in many different development and humanitarian contexts, including by accelerating access to basic health care systems,\" said Dr. Berkley. \"I am excited to join ID2020's Executive Board, and guide the organization and partners in harnessing innovative technologies and multi-sectoral collaboration to benefit the world's most vulnerable populations.\"\nKim Cameron is Microsoft's Chief Architect of Identity. He is the originator of the 7 Laws of Identity , published in 2006, which codified best practices for architecting digital identity solutions. Of his appointment to the ID2020 Executive Board, he notes: \"We're excited at the opportunity to work with ID2020 to use a set of new emerging technologies in ways that will empower people around the world and enhance their personal privacy.\"\nBlythe Masters is the CEO of Digital Asset, a financial technology firm. Masters joined Digital Asset in 2015 after 27 years at JP Morgan, where she served in various senior positions, including on the bank's Executive Committee. \"I am delighted to join the board of ID2020, an organization dedicated to dramatically accelerating global access to digital identity,\" said Masters of her appointment to the ID2020 Board. \"ID2020's open and collaborative model will enable the world's most vulnerable populations to access secure, digital identification. I'm excited to lend my experience in financial services and technology to guide the future of the organization.\"\nDavid Treat leads Accenture's blockchain practice, and is also a board member of Linux's Hyperledger and the Ethereum Alliance. Paul Daugherty, Accenture's Chief Technology & Innovation Officer, said: \"We congratulate ID2020 and this outstanding group of new directors. As an innovation-led company, Accenture is committed to delivering technology innovations with purpose. David Treat's broad expertise in distributed ledger technology makes him an outstanding addition to the ID2020 board at a time where privacy and digital security are more important than ever.
