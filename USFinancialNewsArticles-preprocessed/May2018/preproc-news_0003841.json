    "text": "ATLANTA, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HAVERTYS (NYSE:HVT) and (NYSE:HVT.A) reports earnings per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $0.29 compared to $0.28 for the same period of 2017.\nClarence H. Smith, chairman, president and CEO, said, “First quarter earnings were in line with our expectations based on previously released sales results. Promotions in addition to markdowns related to store closures and remodels resulted in slightly lower gross margins for the quarter.\n“We continue to separate Havertys from the promotional furniture stores with our quality products, exceptional customer service, and omni-channel capabilities. Our average ticket continues to increase and in-home designer associated sales exceeded 21% of total quarterly sales. Online engagement has grown with increases in website sessions, conversions, and sales volume.\n“Our ongoing market and store rationalization is evidenced with the March completion of the market repositioning in Columbia, SC and our upcoming exit from the Sherman, TX market. Total sales in Columbia have increased after we closed two stores and opened a new beautifully located store. We opened in Sherman over 30 years ago and our merchandising shift over the past decade does not align with this market. We will be closing a few additional stores during 2018 and entering the Chattanooga, TN market. The productivity of our store base is a strategic priority as we work to generate better returns for our stockholders.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017\nAs previously announced, net sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 0.5% to $199.4 million. Comparable store sales were down 1.1%. Total written sales for the first quarter of 2018 were down 2.0% and written comparable store sales decreased 2.6% over last year’s first quarter. Average written ticket increased 1.8%. Gross profit margins decreased 10 basis points to 54.6%. SG&A costs as a percent of sales were 50.6% in 2018 and 50.1% in 2017. Total SG&A increased $0.6 million due to higher occupancy costs, delivery and selling expenses partly offset by reductions in administrative and employee benefits costs. Other income in 2018 includes $0.9 million in gains from real estate sales and insurance recoveries for damaged property and $1.2 million in 2017 from insurance recoveries. Purchase of 171,671 shares of common stock for $3.5 million with $6.5 million remaining under current authorization. Increased quarterly dividend 20% to $0.18 per common share in February 2018 following a 25% increase in August 2017 to $0.15 from $0.12 per common share.\nExpectations and Other\nTotal delivered sales for the second quarter to date of 2018 are down approximately 1.3% and comparable store sales are down 1.9%. Total written sales are up 0.1% and written comparable store sales decreased approximately 0.3%. We expect that gross profit margins for the full year 2018 will be approximately 54.5% compared to 54.3% in 2017. We are revising our previous 2018 estimate due to anticipated increases in our LIFO charge driven by higher freight costs. Our estimate for fixed and discretionary type SG&A expenses for 2018 are in the $258 to $260 million range, compared to $253 million for these same costs in 2017. The variable type costs within SG&A for the full year of 2018 are expected to be 18.5% percent of sales compared to the 18.2% rate in 2017. Our selling square footage is expected to decrease approximately 1.6% in 2018. We plan to close two stores in Texas in the second quarter. One location is reaching the end of its lease term and the Sherman store will be sold as we exit that market. We expect to enter the Chattanooga, TN market with a single store in the fourth quarter. Total capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $20 million in 2018.\nHAVERTY FURNITURE COMPANIES, INC.

Accordingly, our gross profit may not be comparable to those entities that include these costs in cost of goods sold.\nWe classify our SG&A expenses as either variable or fixed and discretionary. Our variable expenses are comprised of selling and delivery costs. Selling expenses are primarily compensation and related benefits for our commission based sales associates, the discount we pay for third party financing of customer sales and transaction fees for credit card usage. We do not outsource delivery so these costs include personnel, fuel, and other expenses related to this function. Fixed and discretionary expenses are comprised of rent, depreciation and amortization and other occupancy costs for stores, warehouses and offices, and all advertising and administrative costs.\nConference Call Information\nThe company invites interested parties to listen to the live audiocast of the conference call on May 2 at 10:00 a.m. (ET) at its website, havertys.com under the investor relations section.
