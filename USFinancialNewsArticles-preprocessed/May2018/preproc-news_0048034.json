FILE PHOTO: The logo of the European Central Bank (ECB) is pictured outside its headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nMakuch added that he was confident inflation would rise in the coming years and would hit the ECB’s elusive target of almost 2 percent in 2020-2021.\n“The crucial thing is that we are returning to normal, to normal policies,” he said.
