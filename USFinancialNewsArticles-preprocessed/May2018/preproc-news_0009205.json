    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 9:58 AM / Updated 2 hours ago With a jingle and a beer, English Morris dancers ring in May Day Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nNEWTOWN LINFORD, England (Reuters) - Traditional English Morris Dancers with jingling bells on their shins and flower-bedecked hats rang in May Day with early morning jigs on Tuesday. Leicester Morrismen throw their hats during May Day celebrations at Bradgate Park in Newtown Linford, Britain May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Darren Staples\nAround a dozen Leicester Morrismen danced with white rags to a fiddler in the shadow of a folly known as Old John in Bradgate Park, Newton Linford, about 100 miles north of London.\nAfter their exertions, which Morris dancers trace back to the 15th Century or earlier, some drank beer served in traditional pewter tankards.\nThe art formâ€™s origins are disputed, though there have been signs in recent years of a revival of Morris dancing in England.
