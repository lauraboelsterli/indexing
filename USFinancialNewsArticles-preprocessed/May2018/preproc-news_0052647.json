    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 8:19 AM / Updated 41 minutes ago Bayer cuts Monsanto synergy target by $300 million due to divestments Patricia Weiss 2 Min Read\nBONN (Reuters) - Bayer ( BAYGn.DE ) said positive synergy effects from the planned takeover of U.S. seeds maker Monsanto ( MON.N ) would be about $300 million (224 million pounds) below its previous target because it will sell more businesses than initially expected to get antitrust approval. Werner Baumann, CEO of German pharmaceutical and chemical maker Bayer AG, attends the annual general shareholders meeting in Bonn, Germany, May 25, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\nBayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann again threw his weight behind the deal, despite higher antitrust hurdles and delays in the regulatory reviews, speaking to shareholders at the annual general meeting on Friday.
