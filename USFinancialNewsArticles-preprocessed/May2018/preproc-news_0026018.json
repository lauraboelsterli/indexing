    "text": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Miller Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MLR) (the \"Company\") today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net sales were $159.2 million, an increase of 6.9%, compared to $148.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $6.7 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of 73.7%, compared to net income of $3.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the prior year period.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $18.4 million, or 11.6% of net sales, compared to $15.4 million, or 10.3% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $9.6 million, or 6.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $9.0 million, or 6.1% of net sales, in the prior year period. The income tax provision was $2,663, for an effective tax rate of 28.5% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the income tax provision of $2,148 and effective tax rate of 35.9% in the prior year period. This was reflective of the lower tax rates under recently enacted tax laws.\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share, payable June 18, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 11, 2018.\nJeffrey I. Badgley, Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company stated, \"We are very pleased with our performance this quarter, in what was a very encouraging start to 2018. We achieved significant profitability improvement this quarter with year-over-year gross profit and net income growth of 20% and 74%, respectively. The trends across our business remain favorable as we continue to deliver revenue and earnings growth, return shareholder value, and make progress on our strategic priorities.\"\n\"We remain encouraged by the strong demand for our products across our domestic and international markets during the first quarter. Our capital projects continue to enhance our manufacturing capacity in order to better meet customer needs. Although our capital projects are largely complete, we do not expect the full effects of the projects to be fully realized until sometime in the third quarter. Our increasing ability to meet customer demand as a result of these capital projects, while effectively enhancing productivity, bodes well for the trajectory of our business. However, we continue to face uncertainty as it relates to sourcing raw materials for our products. More specifically, we remain focused on the potential effects of steel and aluminum tariffs on our industry. We will continue to monitor the changing political environment around potential tariffs to determine the impact that these trade practices may have on our raw material costs in the future.\"\nMr. Badgley concluded, \"Our outlook for the remainder of 2018 remains positive, reflecting an historically strong backlog and continued growth in our domestic and international markets. As a result, we increased the balance on our credit facility by $5 million after the close of the first quarter, for a total of $15 million, to meet working capital needs while we continue our efforts to meet customer demand.\"\nIn conjunction with this release, the Company will host a conference call, which will be simultaneously broadcast live over the Internet. Management will host the call, which is scheduled for tomorrow, May 10, 2018, at 10:00 AM ET.
