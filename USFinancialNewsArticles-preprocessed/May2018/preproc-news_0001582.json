    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning,\nHolding Sway For all of the challenges facing tech, it has been a boom time for Apple . The tech giant flexed its financial muscle with a record $100 billion plan to buy back stock from investors, as it reported strong gains in revenue and profit even as growth in the number of iPhones sold remained weak. Elsewhere, the Journal reports at least a dozen Chinese tech “unicorns”—private companies with valuations exceeding $1 billion—have held talks about possible IPOs this year or early next. Their combined valuation is some $500 billion, so if all the deals go ahead and consist of the typical 10% to 20% of shares, at least $50 billion worth could hit global markets, a test of investor appetite. Alphabet’s Google, meanwhile, is trying to navigate an age of heightened political disagreement, as the company struggles to tame a workplace culture of nonstop debate.\nAfghanistan Setbacks Afghanistan’s security forces are fraying as Islamic extremists gain control of more territory , a U.S. government watchdog reported, raising questions about progress in the yearslong project to make Afghans responsible for their country’s defense. According to the report, Afghan military and police forces—the cornerstone of American strategy to stabilize the country and prevent it from becoming a staging ground for terrorist attacks abroad—have shrunk by about 10% in the past year. But there is better news from Iraq, where national elections are set for next week: The highway to Fallujah—long synonymous with Sunni resistance to Iraq’s Shiite-led government— showcases signs the sectarian tensions that have ravaged the country are ebbing.\nXerox CEO Nudged Out Xerox Chief Executive Jeff Jacobson is resigning in a settlement with two of the company’s biggest investors —Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason—that also shakes up the majority of the board and puts Xerox’s deal with Fujifilm at risk. The new board is expected to consider alternatives to the complex transaction, in which most of Xerox would be sold to the Japanese company by combining it with a joint venture the two operate in Asia. Messrs. Icahn and Deason have been seeking to kill that deal, saying it undervalues Xerox, and had alleged Mr. Jacobson negotiated it quickly in an attempt to save his own job. A judge last week temporarily blocked the Fujifilm transaction, siding with Mr. Deason in a lawsuit.\nTrade Tensions The Trump administration has set the stage for weeks of heightened tension between the U.S. and its trading partners as administration officials race to meet self-imposed deadlines to complete high-stakes negotiations with China, Mexico, Canada and Europe. On Tuesday a U.S. trade delegation left for China hoping to glean concessions from Beijing and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed—after months of wrangling with Mexico and Canada—a mid-May deadline for Nafta renegotiations. The day before, the administration set a new June 1 deadline for a deal with European officials on steel and aluminum tariffs. All this action makes May a crucial month for President Trump’s campaign pledge to rewrite the rules of trade.\nCheap or Chic? Those little hotel bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash—icons of travel—are disappearing, replaced by bulk dispensers mounted on shower walls. Marriott is making the switch in 450 hotels across five brands this year; InterContinental Hotels, across four brands. The change has some travelers in a lather, though others—especially families packing into rooms—appreciate having more squirts than you can get out of little bottles. Hotels say bulk dispensers cost less and are better for the environment, though some chains are bucking the trend, Journal reporter Scott McCartney writes .\nToday’s Video Parallel Universes The latest virtual-reality headset from Facebook’s Oculus isn’t the most immersive, but our personal technology columnist David Pierce says it is a good portal into the VR world. It costs $200 and doesn’t require a computer or smartphone.\nTOP STORIES U.S. Pentagon Begins Probe Into Former White House Physician Jackson\nCalifornia Sues Trump Administration Over Vehicle Emissions\nWORLD Iran Treads Warily With Nuclear Deal in Balance\nAfghanistan’s First Female Pilot Granted Asylum in U.S.\nBUSINESS Tesla Feels the Weight of Solar Panels\nSnap Shares Tumble as Results Disappoint\nMARKETS Treasury Sanctions Amendment Sets Stage for Rusal Exemption\nMoney Manager AllianceBernstein Is Moving to Nashville\nNumber of the Day 51% The portion of Democrats who describe themselves as liberal rather than conservative or moderate in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll , a rise of 20 percentage points since 2004.

Today’s Question Going back to our story above, what are your thoughts on hotels’ switching to wall-mounted dispensers to save money and plastic? Send your comments, which we may edit before publication, to 10point@wsj.com . Please include your name and location.\n—Compiled by Jessica Menton\nReader Response Responding to yesterday’s question on your experiences in airport lounges , Alan Hann of New Mexico weighed in: “Remember when flying was considered quite a treat and people dressed for the occasion, airlines served everyone complimentary wine and decent food and the airports were not packed like Disneyland on spring break? Now it is like traveling by bus. It was only a matter of time until the ‘high-end airport lounge’ became a bus station with amenities to match.” Colin Taylor of New Jersey shared: “It feels like airlines apply the same overbooking policies to U.S. domestic lounge membership as they do to flights. Calmer atmospheres and adequate meals can still be found when flying internationally, like that of the United Club in London Heathrow, for example.” And Mike Edelmuth of Quote: : “Many passengers enter an area of a lounge and ensconce themselves in an area of two, four or six chairs, pick through food and not always in a socially correct manner. They should be a bit more restrictive with a better quality of food and beverage. And travelers need to be more considerate of others!”\nThis daily briefing is named “The 10-Point” after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary “What’s News” digest of top stories. Technically, “10-point” referred to the size of the typeface. The type is smaller now but the name lives on.\nSign up here for a curated weekly tour of WSJ’s unique take on the sports world including news, smart features, data and Jason Gay.\nThe 10-Point In Your Inbox CLICK HERE to sign up for this briefing by email.",
