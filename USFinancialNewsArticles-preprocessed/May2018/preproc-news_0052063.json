    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 9:50 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Congress eases post-crisis bank rules in victory for Trump Pete Schroeder , Michelle Price 5 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed on Tuesday bipartisan legislation that would ease bank rules introduced in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, giving President Donald Trump a major legislative victory. U.S. President Donald Trump waves goodbye to South Korea's President Moon Jae-In after their meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 22, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nThe vote eases some of the 2010 Dodd-Frank rules that have hurt smaller banks and community lenders and keeps the Republican president’s promise to try to spur more economic growth by cutting regulation, but does little for Wall Street.\nIt is a far cry from the repeal that Trump pledged on the campaign trail, leaving largely untouched the core Dodd-Frank provisions designed to ensure financial stability and other rules most hated by banks and conservative Republicans.\nBut industry lobbyists say Trump’s administration played a key role in getting the bipartisan legislation, which had been under discussion for years, across the finish line.\nThe bill, which was approved by the Senate in March after securing the backing of 17 Democrats, marks the first attempt to revise rules that aimed to prevent a repeat of the crisis that saw Wall Street lenders bailed out to the tune of $700 billion.\nRepublican critics say Dodd-Frank went too far and curbs banks’ ability to lend, hurting economic growth, while many Democrats say it provides critical protections for consumers and taxpayers.\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday evening, White House officials hailed the legislation as another “milestone” in the administration’s mission to “revitalise the U.S. economy” by lifting barriers to business.\nThey said Trump aims to sign the bill into law at a formal ceremony within the week.\nThe bill, approved 258-159 in the House on Tuesday, raises the threshold at which banks are considered systemically risky and subject to stricter oversight to $250 billion from $50 billion. It also eases trading, lending and capital rules for banks with less than $10 billion in assets.\nBut it does not weaken the top U.S. consumer watchdog created by Dodd-Frank that has been consistently attacked by Republicans who say it oversteps its mandate.\nTouching the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was a red line for Democrats, according to lobbyists.
