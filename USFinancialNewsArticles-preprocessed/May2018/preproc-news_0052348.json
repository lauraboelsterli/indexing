    "text": "* Materials and energy stocks drag Aussie shares\n* Aristocrat Leisure extends gains\n* a2 Milk jump drives NZ higher\nBy Aditya Soni\nMay 25 (Reuters) - Australian shares ticked down on Friday, led by weakness in materials and energy stocks as prices of commodities and crude oil fell.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 index slipped 0.1 percent or 4.40 points to 6,032.70 by 0232 GMT. The benchmark had gained 0.1 percent on Thursday.\nMaterials, especially miners ,led the declines on Friday, hurt by an overnight fall in copper prices. The metals and mining index fell 0.8 percent to a more than two-week low.\nGlobal miner BHP declined 1.8 percent to its lowest since May 11, while its rival Rio Tinto Ltd slipped 0.4 percent.\nBHP, which owns shale assets in U.S., was also hurt by a fall in oil prices, making it the biggest drag on the benchmark.\nOil prices eased on Friday as Russia hinted it may gradually increase output. The news drove down energy stocks 1.7 percent to a more than two-week low.\nWoodside Petroleum Ltd dipped as much as 2.6 percent, its biggest intraday percentage fall in more than three-months, while Origin Energy Ltd dropped 1.5 percent to a near four-week low.\nElsewhere, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd surged 4.7 percent to a record high after accounting for most of the gains on Thursday, helped by strong profit growth.\nMoody’s and Deutsche Bank also cheered the gaming machine maker’s earnings, lending support to the stock.\nWesfarmers rose 0.9 percent to a more than one-year high and was among the most dominanat gainers.\nThe conglomerate said it is divesting its money-losing Homebase business in the United Kingdom and Ireland to an associate firm of London-based Hilco Capital for an undisclosed amount and at a loss.\nTreasury Wine Estates Ltd firmed 2.9 percent, its biggest intraday percentage gain since May 9. The world’s biggest listed winemaker has traded positively since Chinese Foreign Ministry said it is handling customs processes as normal for imports of Australian wines on Wednesday, after Treasury Wine said it faced delays getting some products into China.\nMeanwhile, Australia-listed shares of a2 Milk Company Ltd , which relies heavily on sales to China, extended gains, rising 2.8 percent.\nDamian Rooney, director of equity sales at Argonaut said the dairy firm was rising on news that China will dismantle its one child policy.\nIn New Zealand, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.6 percent or 50.44 points to 8,641.21.\nConsumer stocks led the gains, with a2 Milk Company Ltd surging as much as 4.8 percent, while Synlait Milk Ltd rose 1.9 percent.
