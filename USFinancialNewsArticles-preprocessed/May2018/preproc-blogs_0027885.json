Photo: Ford Motor Co.\nHe reports to Marcy Klevorn, president of Ford’s mobility unit, which aims to accelerate the automaker’s moves into ride-sharing, autonomous car fleets and other service-based businesses. Ms. Klevorn was promoted from the CIO role in 2017 following a broad leadership shakeup , which also included Mr. Lemmer’s promotion to COO of IT.\nAs COO for IT, Mr. Lemmer ran day-to-day operations and led auto-related application development. He also oversaw the building of two new data centers, and re-focused the IT organization to become more product focused .\nMr. Lemmer joined Ford in 1987 in systems programming for parts and service warranty and has held a number of IT leadership roles throughout his career, including positions at Ford and Ford Credit.\nFord continues to face pressure from tech giants and startups edging in on the auto business.
