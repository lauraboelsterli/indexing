    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The following is the full text of a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un canceling their planned June 12 summit in Singapore.\nA letter from U.S. President Donald Trump to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un canceling their upcoming planned summit in Singapore is seen in this photo released by the White House in Washington, U.S. May 24, 2018. The White House via Reuters The letter, dated May 24, was released by the White House on Thursday:\nThe White House\nWashington\nMay 24, 2018\nHis Excellency\nKim Jong Un\nChairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea\nPyongyang\nDear Mr. Chairman:\nWe greatly appreciate your time, patience, and effort with respect to our recent negotiations and discussions relative to a summit long sought by both parties, which was scheduled to take place on June 12 in Singapore. We were informed that the meeting was requested by North Korea, but that to us is totally irrelevant. I was very much looking forward to being there with you. Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting. Therefore, please let this letter serve to represent that the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world, will not take place. You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.\nI felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me, and ultimately, it is only that dialogue that matters. Some day, I look very much forward to meeting you. In the meantime, I want to thank you for the release of the hostages who are now home with their families. That was a beautiful gesture and was very much appreciated.\nIf you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write. The world, and North Korea in particular, has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth. This missed opportunity is a truly sad moment in history.\nSincerely yours,\nDonald J. Trump\nPresident of the United States of America\nReporting by Reuters' Washington newsroom; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ",
