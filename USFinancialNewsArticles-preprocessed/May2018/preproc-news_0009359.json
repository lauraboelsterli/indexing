    "text": "Total Endo-bariatric Product Sales Increased 40% in the First Quarter\nConference Call to Discuss Results Today at 3:30 p.m. CT / 4:30 p.m. ET\nAUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Apollo Endosurgery, Inc. (\"Apollo\") (Nasdaq: APEN), a leader in less invasive medical devices for bariatric and gastrointestinal procedures, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenues increased 8% over the first quarter of 2017 to $15.7 million Total Endo-bariatric product sales were $10.3 million, up 40% over the first quarter of 2017\nTodd Newton, CEO of Apollo, said, \"We are pleased with our first quarter results and 2018 is off to a great start for the Company. Our worldwide Endo-bariatric product sales increased 40% compared to the first quarter of 2017, with OverStitch™ sales more than doubling compared to the same quarter of last year. For Orbera ® , the launch of Orbera365™ produced both higher selling prices and increased unit sales in our European markets and in the U.S. Orbera implant volume increased 27% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as we rebuild U.S. momentum.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $15.7 million, compared to $14.5 million in the first quarter 2017, an increase of 8%.\nTotal Endo-bariatric product sales increased 40% to $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $7.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher OverStitch product sales in all markets. Outside the U.S. (\"OUS\") Endo-bariatric product sales increased 61% or $2.4 million and U.S. Endo-bariatric product sales increased 18%, or $0.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Endo-bariatric product sales comprised 65% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 51% in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal Surgical product sales decreased $1.8 million, or 26% in the first quarter 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to reductions in gastric banding procedures being performed.\nGross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 58.4%, compared to 64.9% for the first quarter of 2017 as a result of a greater proportion of our overall product sales coming from our Endo-bariatric products. We have several gross margin improvement projects underway that are expected to be completed over the next couple of years with the goal to reduce the unit cost of our Endo-bariatric products.\nTotal operating expenses increased $0.6 million to $16.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Higher sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses in the first quarter were partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to higher sales compensation costs while the increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of an increase in clinical study activity and associated costs. Lower general and administrative expenses in the quarter were due to non-recurring fees and costs we incurred in the first quarter of 2017 associated with new public company activities.\nInterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $0.5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to lower interest charges as a result of a $7.0 million principal payment in March 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter 2018 was $8.1 million compared to $8.2 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $23.3 million as of March 31, 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, we used $1.2 million of cash for capital expenditures associated with gross margin improvement projects, $1.2 million for inventory purchases required to maintain safety stock for Endo-bariatric product growth, and $1.2 million for interest and debt amendment fees related to our credit facility. The remaining $4.6 million change was due to cash outflows from our operating activities.\nConference Call\nApollo will host a conference call on May 3, 2018 at 3:30 p.m. Central Time / 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss Apollo's operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nTo participate in the conference call dial (888) 213-3934 for domestic callers and (323) 794-2557 for international callers.
