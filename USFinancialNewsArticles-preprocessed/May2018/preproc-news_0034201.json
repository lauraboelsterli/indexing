    "text": "HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vicon Industries, Inc. (NYSE American:VII), a global producer of video security solutions, today announced its financial results for its second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nVicon’s Chief Executive Officer, Saagar Govil, said, \"The current quarter sales and order rate reflect a marked improvement across all market segments as compared with the prior year period. Our margins also improved to 41.0% as compared with 37.4% in the prior period. We continue to focus on margin improvements as we transition to our more cost effective new camera offering, as well as continue to build market demand for our new Valerus software platform.”\nVicon’s Chief Operating Officer, John Badke, added, “At the end of the quarter, we successfully released our first Valerus video management system (VMS) software enhancement of 2018. In addition to new enterprise system features, this release included a legacy VMS integration gateway, which provides a cost effective upgrade solution to our vast legacy system installed base. The customer reaction to this new product has been extremely positive and it is expected to gain increasing traction in converting our installed base to our new platform. We also recently announced the release of our second 2018 Valerus enhancement scheduled for the middle of the summer. This release will include add on enterprise system features as well as industry leading, powerful video analytics capability.”\n“At the end of March 2018, we announced Cemtrex, Inc’s investment in Vicon, making them the Company’s principal shareholder. We have since begun work with the Cemtrex team to leverage their worldwide capabilities. The collaboration is expected to yield operating efficiencies and expanded software capabilities to help us expedite our technology roadmap. Finally, the Company will likely require additional financing over the next twelve months to implement its planned business objectives and strategies,\" Mr. Badke continued.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 22% to $7.3 million as compared to $6.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The $1.3 million increase in the current quarter included a $1.0 million, or 23%, increase in sales in the Americas market and a $262,000, or 19%, increase in EMEA market sales. Order intake for the current quarter increased $246,000 to $7.1 million as compared to $6.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company continues to invest in the promotion of its new Valerus video management system platform and recently launched camera line offering, which is expected to ultimately improve the Company's market competitiveness.\nGross profit margins were 41.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 37.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This margin improvement resulted from the Company's transition to a new camera line. The Company continues to enhance its Valerus video management system capabilities, which are expected to ultimately allow the Company to better compete on enterprise level market opportunities that generate higher profit margins.\nTotal operating expenses increased $208,000 to $4.3 million in the current quarter, compared to $4.1 million for the second quarter of 2017, due to increased sales and marketing expenses in the U.S. for new product line promotion and ongoing market channel rebuilding efforts.\nNet loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.5 million, or $.08 per basic and diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $1.9 million, or $.20 per basic and diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAbout Vicon\nVicon Industries, Inc.
