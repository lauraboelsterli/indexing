FILE PHOTO: Credit Agricole bank logo is seen on a credit card in this picture illustration taken in Bordeaux, Southwestern France, August 22, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\nFirst-quarter net income rose 1.2 percent to 856 million euros ($1.03 billion), slightly lower than analysts’ estimates of 878 million euros, according to a Reuters poll of 6 analysts.\nRevenues rose 4.4 percent to 4.91 billion euros, compared to 4.98 billion expected by analysts.\nCredit Agricole said the “disposal of non-strategic entities, exchange rate variations and regulatory contributions weighed on the results”.
