1,263 1,178 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 2,648 $ 1,263 Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Company Financial Information\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information, we are disclosing certain unaudited pro forma combined company financial information of DXC for the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2017 (the \"pro forma combined company\" information) as supplemental information herein. The following discussion includes comparisons of our unaudited results of operations for the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2017, to our pro forma combined company results. The pro forma combined company results are based on the historical quarterly statements of operations of each of CSC and the Enterprise Services Business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPES\"), giving effect to the HPES Merger (defined below) as if it had been consummated on April 2, 2016. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations, which was previously filed with the SEC on June 14, 2017 as Exhibit 99.2 of Form 8-K/A has been revised to reflect purchase price accounting (\"PPA\") adjustments recorded subsequent to the Merger.\nCSC reported its results based on a fiscal year convention that comprised four thirteen-week quarters. Every fifth year included an additional week in the first quarter to prevent the fiscal year moving from an approximate end of March date. HPES reported its results on a fiscal year basis ended October 31. As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, all references to the pro forma combined company information include the results of operations of CSC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and of HPES for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017.\nThe historical financial information of HPES was “carved-out” from the combined statement of operations of HPE and reflects assumptions and allocations made by HPE. The combined statement of operations of HPES included all revenues and costs directly attributable to HPES and an allocation of expenses related to certain HPE corporate functions. The results of operations in the HPES historical combined statement of operations does not necessarily include all expenses that would have been incurred by HPES had it been a separate, stand-alone entity. Actual costs that may have been incurred if HPES had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, functions outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. Consequently, HPES’ historical financial information does not necessarily reflect what HPES’ results of operations would have been had HPES operated as a stand-alone company during the periods presented.\nThe pro forma combined company results have been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with CSC considered the accounting acquirer of HPES. These pro forma combined company results include historical results, reflecting PPA adjustments and aligning our accounting policies for consolidated results and reportable segments. These adjustments give effect to pro forma events that were (i) directly attributable to the merger of CSC and HPES (the \"HPES Merger\"), (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of operations of DXC. The pro forma results do not reflect the costs of integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of first-year synergies.\nThe adjustments to historical results were based upon currently available information and assumptions that management of DXC believes to be reasonable. The pro forma combined company results are provided for illustrative and informational purposes only and are not intended to represent or be indicative of what DXC's results of operations would have been had the HPES Merger occurred on April 2, 2016, and should not be taken as being indicative of DXC’s future consolidated financial results.\nSegment Results\nThe following tables summarize segment revenue for the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2017:\nSegment Revenue\nGAAP Basis Pro Forma Combined Company (in millions) Three\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nHistorical CSC\nfor the Three\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31, 2017\n% Change (NM)\nThree\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\n% Change % Adjusted\nChange in\nConstant\nCurrency (1)\nGBS $\n2,361\n$\n1,043\n— $\n2,285\n3.3 % (2.5 )% GIS 3,223 846 — 3,112 3.6 % (4.3 )% USPS 710 — — 639 11.1 % 11.1 % Total Revenues $\n6,294\n$\n1,889\n— $\n6,036\n4.3 % (2.0 )% (1) Adjusted for PPA impact of $(8) million in GBS, $(36) million in GIS and $0 million in USPS.\n(NM) Not meaningful\nSegment Revenue\nGAAP Basis Pro Forma Combined Company (in millions) Twelve\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nHistorical CSC\nfor the Twelve\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31, 2017\n% Change (NM)\nTwelve\nMonths Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\n% Change % Adjusted\nChange in\nConstant\nCurrency (1)\nGBS $\n9,254\n$\n4,173\n— $\n9,530\n(2.9 )% (4.3 )% GIS 12,479 3,434 — 13,018 (4.1 )% (5.2 )% USPS 2,823 — — 2,846 (0.8 )% (0.5 )% Total Revenues $\n24,556\n$\n7,607\n— $\n25,394\n(3.3 )% (4.3 )% (1) Adjusted for PPA impact of $24 million in GBS, $98 million in GIS and $8 million in USPS.\n(NM) Not meaningful\nWe define segment profit as segment revenues less segment cost of services, selling, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets). We do not allocate to our segments certain operating expenses managed at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include certain corporate function costs, stock-based compensation expense, pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses, restructuring costs, transaction, separation and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets.

These non-GAAP financial measures include earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), EBIT margin, adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and adjusted free cash flow.\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with meaningful supplemental financial information, in addition to the financial information presented on a GAAP or pro forma combined company basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items from GAAP and pro forma combined company results which DXC management believes are not indicative of core operating performance. DXC management believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors supplemental information about the financial performance of DXC exclusive of the impacts of corporate wide strategic decisions. DXC management believes that adjusting for these items provides investors with additional measures to evaluate the financial performance of our core business operations on a comparable basis from period to period. DXC management believes the non-GAAP measures provided are also considered important measures by financial analysts covering DXC as equity research analysts continue to publish estimates and research notes based on our non-GAAP commentary, including our guidance around non-GAAP EPS.\nThere are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. One of the limitations is that they do not reflect complete financial results. We compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-GAAP financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or on a pro forma combined company basis. Additionally, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes between companies.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP adjustments to our performance measures include:\nRestructuring costs - reflects restructuring costs, net of reversals, related to workforce optimization and real estate charges. Transaction, separation and integration-related costs - reflects costs related to integration planning, financing, and advisory fees associated with the merger and other acquisitions and costs related to the separation of USPS. Amortization of acquired intangible assets - reflects amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations. Pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses - reflects pension and OPEB actuarial and settlement gains and losses. Certain overhead costs - reflects certain fiscal 2017 HPE costs allocated to HPES that are expected to be largely eliminated on a prospective basis. Tax adjustment - reflects the estimated special benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for fiscal 2018 periods and the application of an approximate 27.5% pro forma tax rate for fiscal 2017 periods, which is the midpoint of prospective targeted effective tax rate range of 25% to 30% and effectively excludes the impact of discrete tax adjustments for those periods.\nEBIT and Adjusted
