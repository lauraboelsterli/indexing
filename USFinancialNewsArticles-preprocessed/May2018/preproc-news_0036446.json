    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 14 (Reuters) - The chairman of Malaysia’s state palm oil plantation agency Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) has resigned, an agency spokesman said on Monday, confirming earlier information from three Felda-related sources.\nThe move follows shock election results which saw the defeat of a coalition which ruled the country for six decades.\nShahrir Samad, a former federal minister, was appointed as chairman in January 2017.\nThe Felda spokesman said an official statement will be released by the end of Monday.
