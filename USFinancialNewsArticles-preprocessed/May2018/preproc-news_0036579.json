    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 6:27 PM / Updated an hour ago UPDATE 1-Germany's DZ Bank to halt Iran transactions in July Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Adds detail on German export guarantees and background)\nBERLIN, May 18 (Reuters) - Germany’s No. 2 lender DZ Bank said on Friday it will suspend financial transactions with Iran in July following U.S. President Donald Trump’s pullout from the nuclear deal with Tehran.\nTrump’s withdrawal of the United States from the accord and his order that sanctions be reimposed have led several European companies to announce their exit from Iran, including French oil major Total earlier this week.\n“We will completely suspend our foreign payment transactions related to Iran starting July 1st,” said a spokesman for Frankfurt-based DZ Bank, which is the umbrella organization of German cooperative bank chain Raiffeisen-Volksbanken.\nGermany’s export credit insurer Euler Hermes AG said on Friday it has guaranteed exports to Iran worth 200 million euros ($235.46 million) since 2016. The programme remains in place for now and companies can still apply guarantees, Hermes said.\nEuropean powers have vowed to keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran’s oil and investment flowing, but have admitted they would struggle to provide the guarantees Tehran seeks. ($1 = 0.8494 euros) (Reporting by Riham Alkousaa and Caroline Copley; Writing by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Adrian Croft and Alexander Smith)",
