U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) speaks after being awarded the 2017 Liberty Medal by former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (unseen) at the Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 16, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Mostoller\n“Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity,” said McCain, still one of the strongest voices in the Republican Party on foreign policy despite his battle with brain cancer, in “The Restless Wave,” which he co-authored with longtime aide Mark Salter.\n“It is hard to know what to expect from President Trump, what’s a pose, what’s legitimate.” Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Bill Trott",
