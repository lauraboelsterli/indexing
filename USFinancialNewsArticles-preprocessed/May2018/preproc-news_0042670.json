    "text": "STOCKHOLM, May 16(Reuters) - Swedish apartment prices fell 7 percent in the February-April period from the same period a year earlier, data from an association of Swedish real estate agents showed on Wednesday.\nPrices of single-family homes were unchanged, the Svensk Maklarstatistik association said.\nCompared with the January-March period, apartment prices were down 1 percent while single-family home prices were stable.\nProperty prices in the Nordic country have surged higher for most of the last two decades and households are among Europeâ€™s most indebted.\nBut the market has cooled in recent months, mostly due to a surge in building and tighter mortgage regulations.\nEarlier this week, Statistics Sweden said the average price of Swedish houses fell 1 percent in the three months to the end of April. Most analysts and households expect the market to stabilize this year.\nReporting by Johan Sennero; Editing by Simon Johnson\n ",
