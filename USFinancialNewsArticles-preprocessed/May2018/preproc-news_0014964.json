Join us at our London offices on May 11 for a discussion of how the risks are changing in sanctions. Mara Lemos Stein will interview Michael O’Kane of Peters & Peters and Justine Walker of U.K. Finance. http://go.dowjones.com/BreakfastBriefingMay11London .\nOne in five respondents among 975 senior leaders in 15 countries said their organizations don’t identify, review or monitor fourth or fifth parties, a Deloitte survey found. iStockphoto.com/DNY59 Good morning. Many organizations continue to struggle to fully understand their supply chains, with 53% saying they don’t have enough information about their fourth- and fifth-party partners, a survey found.\nA Deloitte survey on extended enterprise risk management, or EERM, found one in five respondents among 975 senior leaders in 15 countries said their organizations don’t identify, review or monitor fourth or fifth parties. Deloitte sponsors the WSJ Risk & Compliance Journal. Just 2% said they regularly monitor subcontractors at the fourth or fifth levels of their chain, while 10% do so for subcontractors they classify as critical. The rest rely on their third-party partners to provide oversight.\n“Third parties are closer to the core of businesses than ever before,” said Chuck Saia, chief executive of Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory, in a statement. “Organizations that step up to the challenge of developing programs to better manage third-party risk can elevate their position in the market by unleashing with confidence the reach, expertise and relationships that third parties can bring.”\nMore organizations looking to improve risk awareness and make their EERM programs more efficient are turning to centralized management structures. The survey found 52% described their EERM management as highly centralized, or more centralized than decentralized.\nNearly half the respondents (48%) cited the desire to reduce costs as a main reason for investing in EERM. Twenty-six percent cited greater flexibility to navigate market uncertainty and 21% looked at EERM spending as a way to boost revenue. Forty-nine percent said they were somewhat confident they would gain tangible results from EERM investments.\n“The business case for investment in EERM is increasingly being focused on exploiting the upside of risk—a significant shift from the almost-exclusive focus earlier on managing the downside, with increasing confidence to demonstrate tangible benefits from such investment,” Deloitte said.\nCOMPLIANCE\nEU is set to settle Gazprom antitrust case. The European Union is poised to settle a long-running antitrust case against PAO Gazprom as soon as this month, the WSJ reports. Gazprom would avoid billion-dollar fines in exchange for commitments aimed at breaking its tight grip on the bloc’s natural-gas supply.\nZTE seeks stay of U.S. ban. ZTE Corp. , the Chinese telecommunications firm in the crossfire of a U.S.-China trade fight, has formally asked the U.S. government for a stay of its order banning American companies from selling parts to the firm. It disclosed the news in a filing Sunday with the Hong Kong stock exchange, the WSJ reports.\nZTE Corp. was hit with a sales ban in April after the U.S. Commerce Department said the company violated a deal last year settling allegations of sanctions busting involving North Korea and Iran.

A proposed sanctions mechanism would let the European Commission suspend funds when it finds a country’s courts are no longer independent, rulings are ignored or criminal investigations are hampered, the WSJ reports.\nGreek banks pass ‘stress tests.’ Greece’s biggest banks received a clean bill of health from Europe’s regulators on Saturday, an important step toward the completion of an eight-year bailout program. The tests showed the lenders had sufficient capital to cushion them against a hypothetical severe economic downturn, the WSJ reports.\nGOVERNANCE\nAir France CEO steps down. Jean-Marc Janaillac, Air France-KLM ‘s chief executive officer, on Friday said he would resign after 55% of nearly 47,000 employees on French contracts rejected a pay deal.

CBS News, a unit of CBS , and its former morning-show anchor Charlie Rose were sued Friday by three women who allege they were sexually harassed by Mr. Rose and the network was aware of his behavior and refused to act.

The National Rifle Association sued insurance broker Lockton Cos, alleging the firm breached its contract to administer an insurance program—NRA Carry Guard—for the group.

Carry Guard policies cover legal costs in self-defense shootings, the WSJ reports.\nWells Fargo settles class-action suit.
