(NYSE American: NBY), a biopharmaceutical company focusing on commercializing prescription Avenova ® for the domestic eye care market, reports financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and provides a business update.\nUnit volume through the retail pharmacy channel for the first quarter of 2018 increased 12% versus the prior-year period. Net sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.9 million, compared with $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, with the decrease due to a significant increase in rebates following health insurance deductible resets at the beginning of the year. Gross margin on net sales for the first quarter of 2018 was 91%, an increase from 84% for the prior-year period. Cash used in operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.5 million, a significant improvement from cash usage of $2.0 million in the prior-year period.\n“In combination with the salesforce reduction at the end of 2017, we paused our planned salesforce expansion in a seasonally slow revenue quarter to focus on identifying the most profitable territories,” said Mark M. Sieczkarek, NovaBay’s Chairman, President and CEO. “Although we experienced growth in unit volume for the quarter versus the prior-year period, our net revenue declined due to the increased impact of rebates. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are reporting that the outsized impact of rebates negatively impacted sales across many products during the first quarter, including Avenova.\n“We flattened our sales organization to streamline communications and improve training and strategic execution. We are currently recruiting sales representatives in under-served territories. We will continue to hire new representatives before the end of 2018 in parallel with the progress we make on increasing insurance coverage on Avenova sales by managed care organizations.\n“As an update on our initiative to obtain new or improved reimbursement, introductions have been made with a target group of top managed care prospects that we expect will lead to meaningful discussions in the second half of 2018,” he added. “We believe we have a powerful rationale with Avenova as the only prescription product clinically proven to reduce bacteria on ocular surfaces, which is the underlying cause of bacterial dry eye that represents approximately 85% of the total dry eye market.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\nSales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $3.4 million, compared with $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, with the decrease due primarily to a reduction in the number of sales representatives, partially offset by higher marketing expenses. G&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $1.6 million, compared with $3.1 million for the prior-year period, with the decrease due primarily to lower stock-based compensation expense and lower professional services and consulting fees. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $46,000, compared with $62,000 for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.4 million, an improvement from an operating loss of $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-cash gain on the change of fair value of warrant liability for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.2 million, compared with a non-cash loss of $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.2 million, or $0.13 per share, compared with a net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $4.0 million, or $0.26 per share.\nNovaBay reported cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million as of March 31, 2018, compared with $3.2 million as of December 31, 2017. In February 2018, the company raised a net $5.6 million through a private placement of common stock.\nThe Company used $0.5 million in cash to fund operations in the first quarter of 2018, an improvement from $2.0 million used to fund operations in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower net loss and favorable changes in working capital.\nConference Call\nNovaBay management will host an investment community conference call today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss the Company’s financial and operational results and to answer questions.
