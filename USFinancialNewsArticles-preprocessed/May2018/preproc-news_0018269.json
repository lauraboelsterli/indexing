    "text": "INGOLSTADT, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) premium carmaker Audi will shortly present to Germany’s motor authority KBA a software upgrade for the additional 60,000 cars in which emissions-related problems have been discovered, Audi’s chief executive said.\nAn Audi logo is pictured during the Volkswagen Group's annual general meeting in Berlin, Germany, May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt Audi is in “close consultation with the authorities”, Rupert Stadler told shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting on Wednesday, according to a prepared speech text.\nThe carmaker had said on Tuesday it had stopped deliveries of A6 and A7 models with a certain type of diesel engine after finding a previously unidentified problem with emissions software. It did not give details of the problem.\nStadler also reiterated that it would take a while for the diesel emissions crisis to be ultimately resolved.\nReporting by Irene Preisinger; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Arno Schuetze\n ",
