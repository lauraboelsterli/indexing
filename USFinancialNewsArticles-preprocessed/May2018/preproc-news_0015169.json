Gali Tibbon/Pool via Reuters/File Photo\nUnder the plan devised from 15 ministries, the Tax Authority and Antitrust Authority, more than 80 requirements will be cancelled or eased, for example, in the importation of wireless communication devices.\nIn preparing the plans, existing regulation was examined in a range of fields, including approximately 50 licenses and permits, seven exportation procedures and seven importation procedures.\nNetanyahu said that in addition to cost savings, the plans would reduce the number of days spent waiting for permits by more than 40 million a year.\nIsrael slipped to 54th place in the World Bank’s 2018 Doing Business survey from 52nd in 2017.\n“The momentum of regulatory reductions is expected to accelerate in the coming years,” Netanyahu said.
