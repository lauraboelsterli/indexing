Mandatory Credit: Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports Reyes, 22, was dominant at Triple-A El Paso this season with a .346 batting average, 14 home runs and 38 RBIs in 36 games this season.\nThe 6-foot-5, 240-pound outfielder from the Dominican Republic homered seven times in his past 10 games.\nThird baseman Chase Headley was designated for assignment Saturday, opening a spot on San Diego’s 40-man roster. The Padres had five outfielders on the 25-man roster as of Sunday, and that doesn’t include, Wil Myers, who was on the disabled list.\nSan Diego is batting .227 as a team this season with 416 strikeouts, next-to-last in both categories this season entering Monday.\nReyes led the organization with 25 homers and 102 RBIs last year in the Double-A Texas League.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
