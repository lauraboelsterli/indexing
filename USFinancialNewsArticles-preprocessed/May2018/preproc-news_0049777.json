Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas leaves the West Wing with aides after meeting with U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 23, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nMaas said he explained the German and European position in a frank, but constructive discussion with U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, arguing that it was important to avoid any resumption of Iran’s nuclear activities.\n“Europe is very, very united in its position on the nuclear accord with Iran, and that will not change,” said Maas, who is due to meet later with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
