    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - A sweeping $867 billion farm bill failed to pass the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday after conservative Republicans warned party leaders not to hold the vote until they were given the chance to consider a bill to clamp down on immigration.\nThe next steps are unclear for the bill, which failed in a 198-to-213 vote. Democrats opposed the legislation due to changes it would make to a food stamps program used by about 40 million Americans, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\nMembers of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry have said they are writing their own version of the farm bill because the Houseâ€™s proposed SNAP changes could not pass the chamber, where Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority and passing most legislation requires 60 votes.
