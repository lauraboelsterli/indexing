    "text": "0 COMMENTS Capital spending is booming–at a handful of technology giants.\nThe amount companies spend on big-ticket items like new equipment and facilities is expected to have climbed roughly 20% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Credit Suisse estimates, marking the strongest quarterly growth rate since 2011.\nAs The Wall Street Journal’s Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted on Monday, many analysts have cited the rise in capital expenditures as evidence that companies are choosing to invest the money saved under the U.S. corporate tax cut into growing their businesses. That should help fuel economic growth and the stock market over the long run.\nA recent Credit Suisse analysis of first-quarter earnings reports suggests a narrower benefit from capital spending growth. More than half of the growth in first-quarter capex spending can be attributed to the technology sector, the data shows. Ten companies account for two-thirds of the total increase, Credit Suisse data shows.\nOne of the biggest spenders is Google parent Alphabet , which nearly tripled capital capital outlays in the first quarter to $7.3 billion from $2.51 billion a year earlier. On an earnings call, Financial Chief Ruth Porat said the increase–driven by spending on things like real estate, new data centers and undersea cables–illustrates the company’s “commitment to growth.”\nFacebook ’s capital expenditures doubled in the latest quarter to $2.81 billion.\nOutside of tech, spending is also accelerating but at a more muted pace. Energy companies are expected to have boosted capital spending by 15%, though that comes after low oil prices kept many from investing in their own businesses for years. Telecom spending is expected to grow 7% and industrial spending is forecast to grow 6%, Credit Suisse’s data show.\nCredit Suisse’s data suggests that the capital spending surge isn’t yet a broad-based trend but is instead being concentrated at a handful of fast-growing companies. While that could change in coming quarters–big purchasing decisions can take a long time to be executed–investors shouldn’t hold their breath for capital spending-fueled stock gains.\nTo receive our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter via email, click here .\nShare this: Morning MoneyBeat Previous Jitters About Iran Deal Boosts Crude Prices—Energy Journal Next The Warren Buffett-Elon Musk Feud Isn't Over Yet",
