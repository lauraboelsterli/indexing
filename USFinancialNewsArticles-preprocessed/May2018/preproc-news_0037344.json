We expect revenues to be weaker for the next few quarters due to these factors, however we remain optimistic about the long-term demand for our products and services.”\n“Strategically due to our shift in focus into smart devices and virtual reality applications, we will be exiting the environmental instruments and control products business this year. This new direction will be officially kicked off with the unveiling of our SmartDesk next week. Additionally, with our recently acquired stake in Vicon, we are continuing to move deeper into technology markets. We continue to invest in our compelling product roadmap across technology manufacturing, smart devices, and Virtual Reality (VR) / Augmented Reality (AR) that we expect will drive strong returns for our shareholders over the next several years.” continued Mr. Govil.\nAbout Cemtrex\nCemtrex, Inc.
