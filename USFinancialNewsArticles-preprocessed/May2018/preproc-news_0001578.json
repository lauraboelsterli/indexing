    "text": "11 COMMENTS Free agent safety Eric Reid filed a grievance against the NFL and all 32 teams alleging they have colluded to keep him unsigned, following in the footsteps of his former San Francisco 49ers teammate Colin Kaepernick.\nReid, along with Kaepernick, was at the forefront of the movement among players who knelt or sat during the national anthem beginning in 2016 to draw attention to racial inequality and social injustices. While Kaepernick remained unsigned throughout this past season, Reid continued to take a knee.\n“Our union is aware that Eric Reid and his legal representatives filed a collusion claim,” the NFL Players Association said in a statement. “Our union supports Eric and we are considering other legal options to pursue.”\nAn NFL spokesman declined to comment, citing the confidentiality provision of the grievance process in the collective bargaining agreement.\nKaepernick, who was the 49ers quarterback, became the face of the protests that drew criticism from fans and politicians who believed the demonstrations to be unpatriotic. After the 2016 season, Kaepernick went unsigned and remains a free agent. In October, Kaepernick filed a grievance alleging that the league colluded to effectively blackball him from being signed because of his outspoken political views.\nMeanwhile, Reid continued to kneel during the anthem during the 2017 season while playing for the 49ers when the protests took on a new life after President Donald Trump publicly assailed them in speeches and on Twitter, once referring to a generic player as a “son of a bitch.” In response, more players knelt than ever before in what was effectively a direct response to the president. A couple of weeks later, Vice President Mike Pence walked out of a Colts-49ers game because many players took a knee during the anthem.\nAll of this inflamed a headache that the league hoped would dissipate. Instead, the issue became only more polarizing. At league meetings during last season, there was discussion about adopting a rule to mandate that players stand during the national anthem. That was not implemented. Those discussions have continued this off-season and could be a focus during upcoming owners meetings in May.\nWithout having changed the rule, the league and owners have sought to work with players to address their concerns about these social and political issues. They worked with a group of players to advance those causes but some, including Reid, were critical of the Players Coalition group, saying it did not represent the views of all players.\nReid has hired the same lawyers as Kaepernick, Mark Geragos and Ben Meiselas of Geragos & Geragos. The NFLPA is working closely with Reid, as it has been during Kaepernick’s grievance process.\nReid could be entitled to compensatory damages should he win the claim, with teams potentially subject to fines if they are found to have colluded. But proving collusion isn’t simple. The collective bargaining agreement says “evidence about the playing skills” isn’t enough to prove teams have colluded to keep a player unsigned.\nKaepernick’s grievance has been going on for months with no clear end date in sight. His legal team has already taken depositions from some owners such as Jerry Jones and Bob McNair, in addition to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nReid, 26 years old, was a first-round pick by the 49ers in 2013 and went to the Pro Bowl that season. He has recorded 10 career interceptions while also playing parts of last season at linebacker.\nOn NFL.com’s list of the top free agents this season, Reid ranked No. 27. He is one of three players in the top 30 who remain unsigned.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nEric Reid’s last name was incorrectly spelled as Reed in a headline in an earlier version of this article.\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com",
