This has no impact on our other objectives for the current and following two years which are fully confirmed,” he said.\nThe company reported third-quarter revenues of 337.4 million euros ($404 million), missing by 3 percent the 348 million euros expected on average in a company circulated poll, as it recorded a decline in all activities, except for its core video segment which met expectations with a nearly flat like-for-like change.\nThe satellite service sector faces structural challenges over the role of satellite delivery, relative to streaming media offering customers content over the Internet.\nPress Release : bit.ly/2L1BQlh ($1 = 0.8373 euros) (Reporting by Nolwenn Brossier; Editing by Mark Potter and Adrian Croft)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
