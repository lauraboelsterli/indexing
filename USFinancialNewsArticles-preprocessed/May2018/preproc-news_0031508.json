    "text": "Board of Directors Unanimously Rejects Acquisition Proposal from Romano’s Macaroni Grill\nSpecial Meeting of Shareholders On May 22 to Approve Transaction With Spice Private Equity Ltd.\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BBRG) (“BBRG” or the “Company”), owner and operator of the BRAVO! Cucina Italiana and BRIO Tuscan Grille restaurant concepts, announced today that it has rejected an unsolicited proposal it received on May 9, 2018, from Romano’s Macaroni Grill (“Macaroni Grill”) to purchase all of the fully diluted outstanding common shares of BBRG for approximately $4.78 per share.\nMacaroni Grill’s unsolicited proposal relies on significant third party financing (both debt and equity), including by Raven Capital Management LLC, which was a prior participant in the Company’s comprehensive review of strategic alternatives that led to BBRG’s entry into a definitive merger agreement on March 7, 2018 with an affiliate of Spice Private Equity Ltd. (“Spice”), under which the Spice affiliate will acquire BBRG in an all-cash transaction (the “Spice Merger Agreement”). Spice is a Swiss-investment company focused on private equity investments, which is controlled by GP Investments, Ltd. (“GP”), a leading private equity and alternative investment firm.\nBBRG’s Board of Directors thoroughly evaluated Macaroni Grill’s proposal, including seeking clarifications from Macaroni Grill on the terms and conditions of its proposal and consulting with BBRG’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel. Following that evaluation, BBRG’s Board unanimously determined that the proposal did not constitute and would not reasonably be expected to result in a “Superior Proposal,” as defined in the Spice Merger Agreement and, accordingly, rejected the Macaroni Grill proposal.\nThe Board of Directors of BBRG continues to unanimously recommend that BBRG shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the Spice Merger Agreement.\nIn its May 9, 2018 proposal, Macaroni Grill indicated that it would be relying upon fully committed financing from third party equity and debt sources to finance the transaction and not utilizing Macaroni Grill’s own cash on hand or immediately available borrowing capacity. Macaroni Grill stated that it would promptly provide commitment papers and other documentation supporting Macaroni Grill’s financing plans. At the direction of the Company’s Board, on May 10 th the Company’s representatives requested clarification of the terms and conditions of Macaroni Grill’s proposal, including copies of the referenced commitment papers. In response to that request, Macaroni Grill delivered highly-conditional and non-binding letters of financing support which were not enforceable by the Company. Macaroni Grill’s representatives also communicated at that time that a transaction between the Company and Macaroni Grill would be subject to an additional regulatory condition relating to receipt of approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which such condition is not applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Spice Merger Agreement. Macaroni Grill also failed to provide the Company with a proposed revised merger agreement that it would be prepared to execute to effect a transaction.\nThe Board has provided Macaroni Grill with ample time and opportunity to produce an actionable proposal with fully-committed financing, and Macaroni Grill has failed to do so. It is the belief of the Company’s Board that further pursuit of Macaroni Grill’s offer would be potentially harmful to the Company given the substantial liquidity constraints facing the Company as described in the Company’s most recent Quarterly Report and the significant potential negative impact to the Company’s shareholders, operations and employees in the event of a broken transaction. Accordingly, the Company’s Board continues to unanimously recommend that BBRG shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the Spice Merger Agreement.\nAbout Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc.\nBravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. is a leading owner and operator of two distinct Italian restaurant brands, BRAVO! Cucina Italiana and BRIO Tuscan Grille.

COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING OR INVESTMENT DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED MERGER BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION.
