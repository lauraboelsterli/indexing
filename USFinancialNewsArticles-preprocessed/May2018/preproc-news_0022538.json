    "text": "HONOLULU, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (NYSE: HE) (HEI) today reported consolidated net income for common stock for the first quarter of 2018 of $40.2 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.37 compared to $34.2 million and EPS of $0.31 for the first quarter of 2017.\n\"We are pleased to report solid earnings for the first quarter of 2018 from both our bank and utility,\" said Constance H. Lau, president and CEO of HEI.\n\"In the first quarter, our utility worked with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission to give the net benefits from tax reform to utility customers, including approximately $9 million for the first quarter alone. Our Commission also opened a performance-based ratemaking proceeding that establishes a collaborative, deliberative process allowing for stakeholder and expert input to help accelerate Hawaii's move to 100% clean energy. Moving forward we are focused on our role in creating resilient, sustainable communities through technology, smart use of resources, building partnerships, and providing more value to customers.\"\n\"American Savings Bank's first quarter results included the highest quarterly net income in its history, reflecting higher net interest margin, good deposit and loan growth and the benefits of tax reform for the bank, including lower tax expense and higher wage rates for entry level and lower wage positions. We continue to work hard to deliver value for our customers as the bank's profitability improves,\" said Lau.\nHAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY EARNINGS\nHawaiian Electric Company's 1 net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $27.5 million compared to $21.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by the following after-tax items:\n$11 million higher rate adjustment mechanism (RAM) revenues, primarily due to lower revenues in the first quarter of 2017 because of the return in 2017 to recording Oahu RAM revenues for accounting purposes on a lagged basis beginning June 1, 2017, instead of on a calendar year basis; $5 million of interim rate relief from Hawaii Electric Light's 2016 test year interim rates effective August 31, 2017 and Hawaiian Electric's 2017 test year interim rates effective February 16, 2018; and $1 million higher allowance for funds used during construction mainly from the Schofield Generating Station project expected to be completed in the second quarter.\nThese items were partially offset by the following after-tax items:\n$7 million higher O&M expenses 2 compared to 2017, primarily due to the reset of pension costs as part of rate case interim decisions, higher overhaul costs for generation, a write-off of smart grid costs, and a one-time rent expense adjustment for existing substation land, partially offset by the additional reserve for environmental costs in 2017; $2 million higher depreciation expense as a result of increasing investments for the integration of more renewable energy, improved customer reliability and greater system efficiency; and $2 million lower net income, primarily representing accrued first quarter 2018 tax reform net benefits deferred (and to be returned to customers) that are higher than the reduction in first quarter income tax expense related to lower federal corporate tax rates.\nNote:\nAmounts indicated as after-tax in this earnings release are based upon adjusting items using the current year composite statutory tax rates of 25.75% for the utilities and 26.79% for the bank.\n1\nHawaiian Electric Company, unless otherwise defined, refers to the three utilities, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. on Oahu, Maui Electric Company, Limited for Maui County, and Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. on Hawaii Island.\n2\nExcludes net income neutral expenses covered by surcharges or by third parties. See the \"Explanation of HEI's Use of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Measures\" and the related reconciliation accompanying this release.\nAMERICAN SAVINGS BANK EARNINGS\nAmerican Savings Bank's (American) first quarter of 2018 net income was $19.0 million compared to $16.9 million in the fourth, or linked, quarter and $15.8 million in the prior year quarter.\nCompared to the linked quarter of 2017, the $2.1 million net income increase in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by higher net interest income, which was mainly due to higher yields on earning assets and strong deposit growth that funded increases in the investment and retail portfolios. The first quarter also included approximately $3 million in tax benefits resulting from lower federal corporate tax rates, compared to the one-time tax benefit of $1.7 million recognized in the linked quarter. In the linked quarter, American passed on approximately $1 million of increased compensation to its employees through a $1,000 cash bonus paid in December 2017. Beginning in 2018, American increased the wage rates for entry level and lower wage positions.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2017, the $3.1 million higher net income was primarily driven by higher net interest income as discussed above for the linked quarter, partially offset by lower noninterest income. Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2018 was higher compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to higher compensation and benefit expense, reflecting a higher minimum wage for employees along with higher performance-based incentives and annual merit increases, which was substantially offset by the tax benefits resulting from lower federal corporate tax rates.\nTotal loans were $4.7 billion at March 31, 2018, up $71 million or 6.1% annualized, driven mainly by increases in commercial and commercial real estate loans of $63 million compared to December 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits were $6.1 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $188 million or 12.8% annualized from December 31, 2017, including approximately $100 million in repurchase agreements that were transferred into deposit accounts. Excluding such transfers, total deposits increased by 6.0% annualized. The average cost of funds was 0.23% for the first quarter of 2018, up 2 basis points from the linked quarter and up 3 basis points from the prior year quarter.\nAmerican's first quarter of 2018 return on average equity 3 was 12.58%, compared to 11.09% in the linked quarter and 10.82% in the first quarter of 2017. Return on average assets was 1.12% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 1.01% in the linked quarter and 0.98% in the same quarter last year.\nPlease refer to American's news release issued on April 30, 2018 for additional information on American.\nHOLDING AND OTHER COMPANIES\nThe holding and other companies' net loss was $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.1 million in the prior year quarter. The higher net loss was primarily driven by the impact of federal tax reform, which negatively impacted the holding and other companies by approximately $1 million in the first quarter of 2018 due to lower tax benefits on expenses resulting from a lower corporate federal tax rate, higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and additional debt related to Pacific Current investments, and higher excess tax benefits associated with share-based awards in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2018.\nBOARD DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND\nOn May 9, 2018, the board of directors maintained HEI's quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share, payable on June 12, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 23, 2018 (ex-dividend date is May 22, 2018). The dividend would be equivalent to an annual rate of $1.24 per share.\nDividends have been paid uninterrupted since 1901. At the indicated annual dividend rate and based on the closing price per share on May 9, 2018 of $33.87, HEI's dividend yield is 3.7%.\nWEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL TO DISCUSS EARNINGS AND EPS GUIDANCE\nHawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. will conduct a webcast and conference call to review its first quarter 2018 earnings and 2018 EPS guidance on Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 7:30 a.m. Hawaii time (1:30 p.m. Eastern time).\nInterested parties within the United States may listen to the conference by calling (844) 834-0652 and international parties may listen to the conference by calling (412) 317-5198 or by accessing the webcast on HEI's website under the \"Investor Relations\" section, sub-heading \"News and Events.\" HEI and Hawaiian Electric Company intend to continue to use HEI's website, www.hei.com , as a means of disclosing additional information.

Nonservice cost was reclassified from \"Compensation and employee benefits\" to \"Other expense.\"\nThis information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in HEI filings with the SEC.\nEXPLANATION OF HEI'S USE OF CERTAIN UNAUDITED NON-GAAP MEASURES\nHEI and Hawaiian Electric Company management use certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of HEI and the utility. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information and are a better indicator of the companies' core operating activities than the corresponding GAAP measures given the non-recurring nature of certain items. Non-GAAP core measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables provide the return on average common equity (ROACE) and adjusted non-GAAP core ROACE for HEI and the utility.\nThe reconciling adjustments from GAAP earnings to core earnings used in the calculation of the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 ROACE include income, costs and associated taxes related to the terminated merger between HEI and NextEra Energy, Inc., the cancelled spin-off of ASB Hawaii, Inc. and the terminated liquefied natural gas contract which, to remain in effect, required Hawaii Public Utilities Commission approval of the merger with NextEra Energy, Inc. For more information on the transactions, see HEI's Form 8-K filed on July 18, 2016, and HEI's Form 8-K filed on July 19, 2016. The reconciling adjustments from GAAP earnings to core earnings used in the calculation of the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 ROACE exclude the impact of the federal tax reform act recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the adjustment of deferred tax balances and the $1,000 employee bonuses paid by the bank related to federal tax reform. Management does not consider these items to be representative of the company's fundamental core earnings and has shown the non-GAAP (core) ROACE in order to provide better comparability between periods.\nThe accompanying table also provides the calculation of utility GAAP other operation and maintenance (O&M) expense adjusted for \"O&M-related net income neutral items,\" which are O&M expenses covered by specific surcharges or by third parties. These \"O&M-related net income neutral items\" are grossed-up in revenue and expense and do not impact net income.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP 1 TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\nHawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries (HEI)\nUnaudited\nTwelve months ended March 31\n2018\n2017\nHEI CONSOLIDATED RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY (ROACE) (simple average)\nBased on GAAP\n8.2\n%\n12.5\n%\nBased on non-GAAP (core) 2\n8.9\n%\n9.4\n%\nHawaiian Electric Company, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nTwelve months ended March 31\n2018\n2017\nHAWAIIAN ELECTRIC CONSOLIDATED RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY (ROACE) (simple average)\nBased on GAAP\n6.91\n%\n7.84\n%\nBased on non-GAAP (core) 2\n7.41\n%\n7.88\n%\nThree months ended March 31\n($ in millions)\n2018\n2017\nHAWAIIAN ELECTRIC CONSOLIDATED OTHER OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) EXPENSE\nGAAP (as reported)\n$\n107.6\n$\n98.8\nExcluding other O&M-related net income neutral items 3\n0.3\n1.1\nNon-GAAP (Adjusted other O&M expense)\n$\n107.3\n$\n97.7\nNote: Columns may not foot due to rounding\n1 Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n2 Calculated as core net income divided by average GAAP common equity\n3 Expenses covered by surcharges or by third parties recorded in revenues\nContact:\nJulie R.
