    "text": "Lee Neibart and Sean Hehir to Lead SPAC to Target Business Combination Candidates with a Real Estate Component\nHONOLULU--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trinity Merger Corp. (the “Company”), a special purpose acquisition vehicle led by seasoned real estate investment professionals Lee S. Neibart and Sean A. Hehir, today announced the closing of its initial public offering (“IPO”) in which it raised gross proceeds of $345 million.\nThe Company intends to focus on business combination candidates with a real estate component and an enterprise value of approximately $750 million to $2 billion.\nThe Company sold 34.5 million units at $10.00 per unit in the IPO, which includes 4.5 million units issued pursuant to the underwriter’s exercise of its over-allotment option in full. The Company’s units began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “TMCXU” on May 15, 2018.\nEach unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of the Company’s Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols “TMCX” and “TMCXW,” respectively.\nB. Riley FBR, Inc. served as sole book-running manager for the offering.\nMr. Neibart serves as the Company’s Chairman and Mr. Hehir serves as its Chief Executive Officer and President. The two have worked together for more than 20 years, partnering on several large institutional real estate transactions. Altogether, the Company’s leadership team has acquired more than 50 hotels with more than 30,000 keys in the United States and abroad.\nMr. Neibart has more than 40 years of experience in commercial real estate investing, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic business planning. He has held senior leadership roles at Ares Real Estate Group, HBS Global Properties and AREA Property Partners. Mr. Neibart also has experience serving as a director for various public and private companies. The Company represents Mr. Neibart’s second real estate-related SPAC. He took NRDC Acquisition Corp. public in October 2007. That vehicle converted to a real estate investment trust and changed its name to Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. (NASDAQ:ROIC) in 2009.\nMr. Hehir has more than 20 years of experience in real estate investment and asset management, and currently serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Trinity Real Estate Investments LLC, a private equity real estate firm (“Trinity Investments”). Since joining Trinity Investments in May 1998, Mr. Hehir has executed over $4 billion of global real estate transactions. Prior to joining Trinity Investments, Mr. Hehir worked for HVS International, a leading consulting firm to the hospitality industry.\nIn addition to Messrs. Neibart and Hehir, the Company’s board of directors includes Richard F. Wacker, President and Chief Executive Officer of American Savings Bank, F.S.B.; Catherine Luke, President and Director of Loyalty Enterprises Ltd.; and Warren R. de Haan, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at ACORE Capital, LP.\nThe public offering was made only by means of a prospectus, copies of which may be obtained from: B. Riley FBR, Inc., Attention: Prospectus Department, 1300 14th Street North, Suite 1400, Arlington, VA 22209, or by telephone at (800) 846-5050 or by email at prospectuses@brileyfbr.com .\nA registration statement (including a preliminary prospectus) relating to the securities was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 14, 2018.
