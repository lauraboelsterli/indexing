    "text": "Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.28; Adjusted EPS* of $0.44\nSolid Growth in HVAC and Detection & Measurement\nOn Track to Achieve Full-Year Adjusted EPS* Guidance Range of $2.03-$2.18\nCHARLOTTE, N.C., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SPX Corporation (NYSE:SPXC) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nGene Lowe, President and CEO, remarked, “I am very pleased with our solid operating results in the first quarter, which provided a strong start to 2018. Our HVAC segment saw significant improvement in revenue due to higher heating volumes, and our Detection & Measurement segment continued to benefit from strong sales of communication technologies products. We remain on track to achieve our full-year 2018 guidance.”\nMr. Lowe continued, “We have also made significant progress on our capital deployment plans, closing one acquisition, and announcing an agreement for a second. Both are attractive companies and highly complementary fits with our Radiodetection business within our Detection & Measurement segment. These proprietary transactions position us to create higher value solutions for customers and drive meaningful growth in earnings and cash generation. As we continue executing on our growth initiatives, we are committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet, while deploying additional capital to drive value for shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Overview:\nFor the first quarter of 2018 the company reported revenue of $351.9 million and operating income of $19.3 million, compared with $340.6 million and $19.1 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017. Net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.28, compared with $0.24 for the first quarter of 2017.\nSPX Core revenue* was $337.6 million and Adjusted operating income* was $26.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $322.4 million and $23.5 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share* for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.44, compared with $0.38 for the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter Financial Comparisons:\nGAAP Results:\n($ millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Revenue $ 351.9\n$ 340.6\nSegment Income 37.0 34.3 Operating Income 19.3 19.1\n* Non-GAAP financial measure. See attached schedules for reconciliation to most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted Results:\n($ millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Core Revenue* $ 337.6 $ 322.4 Core Segment Income* 41.6 38.7 Adjusted Operating Income* 26.5 23.5\n* Non-GAAP financial measure. See attached schedules for reconciliation to most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nHVAC\nRevenue for Q1 2018 was $127.7 million, compared with $110.1 million in Q1 2017, an increase of 16.0%, including a 1.1% increase from currency fluctuations. Organic revenue* increased 14.9%, due primarily to higher customer demand for our heating products associated with colder weather during the quarter.\nSegment income was $18.6 million, or 14.6% of revenue, in Q1 2018, compared with $16.5 million, or 15.0% of revenue, in Q1 2017, with the decrease in margins largely due to a less favorable sales mix and higher freight costs.\nDetection & Measurement\nRevenue for Q1 2018 was $65.6 million, compared with $53.6 million in Q1 2017, an increase of 22.4% including a 2.8% increase from currency fluctuations and a 1.5% increase from our acquisition of Schonstedt Instrument Company, which closed in March 2018. Organic revenue* increased 18.1% primarily reflecting higher communication technologies product sales.\nSegment income was $15.7 million in Q1 2018. Adjusted segment income*, which excludes $0.3 million of acquisition-related costs in Q1 2018, was $16.0 million, or 24.4% of revenue. This compares with segment income of $11.2 million, or 20.9% of revenue, in Q1 2017. The 350 basis point increase in margins was driven by a higher profit contribution from communication technologies products sales.\nEngineered Solutions\nRevenue for Q1 2018 was $158.6 million, compared with $176.9 million in Q1 2017, a decrease of 10.3%, driven primarily by lower sales of process cooling products, timing of transformer deliveries, and lower sales related to the power projects in South Africa, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606**, and a weaker U.S dollar versus the South African Rand. Revenues in the segment’s process cooling business continue to be impacted by a shift in its sales model, which is now focused more on high-margin components and services and less on low-margin construction projects.\nSegment income was $2.7 million, or 1.7% of revenue, in Q1 2018, compared with segment income of $6.6 million, or 3.7% of revenue, in Q1 2017. The decrease in segment income margins of 200 basis points was driven primarily by a less favorable sales mix within the segment’s Transformer business.\nEngineered Solutions (Core)\nExcluding the results of the South African projects, Engineered Solutions recorded Core revenue* for Q1 2018 of $144.3 million, compared with $158.7 million in Q1 2017, a decrease of 9.1%. This decline was driven primarily by lower sales of process cooling products, and timing of transformer deliveries, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606** and a modest benefit from currency fluctuation.\nEngineered Solutions’ Core income* for Q1 2018 was $7.0 million, or 4.9% of revenue, compared with $11.0 million, or 6.9% of revenue, in Q1 2017. The decrease in segment income margins* of approximately 200 basis points was driven primarily by the less profitable sales mix within the segment’s Transformer business.\nSouth African Projects\nRevenue attributable to the South African projects for Q1 2018 was $14.3 million, compared with $18.2 million in Q1 2017. Losses for these projects recorded in our Engineered Solutions segment in Q1 2018 were $4.3 million, compared with a loss of $4.4 million in Q1 2017.\nFinancial Update:\nAs of March 31, 2018, SPX had total outstanding debt of $356.6 million and total cash and equivalents of $103.7 million. During the first quarter of 2018, free cash flow used in continuing operations* totaled $0.5 million and included net cash used for the South African projects of $5.5 million, net of a tax benefit. Net leverage, as calculated under the company’s bank credit agreement, was 1.5x, similar to Q4 2017.\nReaffirming 2018 Guidance:\nSPX is reaffirming its 2018 guidance for Core revenue* in a range of $1.35 to $1.40 billion with Core segment income margin* of approximately 14.0-14.5%. We continue to expect Adjusted operating income margin* of approximately 10% and Adjusted earnings per share* in a range of $2.03 to $2.18. This guidance does not reflect the impact of acquisitions, and we currently anticipate updating guidance for announced acquisitions later in Q2 2018.\nSegment performance, on a year-over-year basis, is expected to be as follows:\nRevenue Segment Income Margin % HVAC Organic growth* rate within long-term range of 2.0%-4.0%\nApproximately 100 basis point increase Detection & Measurement Organic growth* rate within long-term range of approximately 2.0%-6.0% Approximately 50 to 100 basis point increase Engineered Solutions (Core)* Segment (core) revenue decline* in high-single digits %; modest growth in transformer revenue; organic decline* in process cooling resulting from operating model changes Approximately 80-130 basis point increase\nNon-GAAP Presentation: The results and guidance in this release include non-GAAP financial measures, including “Core” results, “organic revenue increase (decrease),” “Adjusted operating income (loss),” and “Adjusted earnings (loss) per share.” To provide clarity to its operating results, the company reports “Core” results, which exclude the effect of the South African projects, and separately reports on the progress and results associated with the South African projects. Other items adjusted out of segment income, operating income, and earnings per share consist of certain acquisition-related costs in Q1 2018, and non-service pension items and various other tax items in Q1 2018 and Q1 2017.\nForm 10-Q: The company expects to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or before May 10, 2018.

See attached schedules for reconciliation to most comparable GAAP financial measure.\n**See attached schedule for the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on SPX’s reported results.\nNote: Our non-GAAP financial guidance excludes items, which would be included in our GAAP financial measures, that we do not consider indicative of our on-going performance. These items include, but are not limited to, acquisition costs, costs associated with dispositions, the results of our South African projects, and potential non-cash income or expense items associated with changes in market interest rates and actuarial or other data related to our pension and postretirement plans, as the ultimate aggregate amounts associated with these items are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial guidance to the nearest corresponding GAAP financial measures is not practicable.\nCertain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby.
