    "text": "(Updates with stock move after debut)\nMay 24 (Reuters) - Online lending platform GreenSky's shares fell as much as 4 percent in their market debut on Thursday after the company's initial public offering was priced at the higher end of its targeted price range.\nThe firm's upsized initial public offering of 38 million shares was priced at $23 per share earlier on Thursday, raising about $874 million.\nThe stock was last higher by 1 cent at $23.01 in late morning trading.\nGreenSky, a portal for consumers to access home improvement loans, is considered one of the most attractive fintech names in America.\nIt is also the second fintech company this week after payments processor EVO Payments to see its IPO priced at the upper end of the expected range.\nWhile many technology-driven online lenders such as LendingClub and OnDeck Capital have struggled to grow their loan portfolios, weighed down by concerns over underwriting standards and access to funding, GreenSky avoids these perils by being a conduit to banks and other specialty lenders.\nThe company had 1.7 million customers as of March 31, and has helped finance over $12 billion in loans with its bank partners which include SunTrust, Regions Financial , Fifth Third Bancorp and Synovus Financial .\nGreenSky provides its services at the point of sale, which helps attract more customers and increase sales volume. It counts Home Depot as its biggest merchant.\nIn 2016, the company began expanding into elective healthcare to target creditworthy consumers who make large purchases. Elective healthcare includes clinics providing cosmetic and aesthetic surgeries, reproductive medicine, dentistry and veterinary medicine.\nGreenSky's 2017 revenue jumped 23.5 percent year-over-year to $325.9 million, while profit rose 11.4 percent to $138.7 million as transaction volumes surged 31 percent.\nFollowing the IPO, CEO David Zalik will hold 47.68 percent of voting power at the company, GreenSky said in its IPO filing https://bit.ly/2J5J49Q .\nGoldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are among the main underwriting banks on GreenSky's IPO.
