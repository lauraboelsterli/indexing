The first quarter results included total lease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues of $186.9 million, a decrease of 4.0%, versus $194.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Compared sequentially to the fourth quarter of 2017, lease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues increased by 4.3%, from $179.3 million.\n(1)\nSee Appendix for an explanation of the reclassification of the Gain on Sale of Flight Equipment.\n(2)\nRefer to the selected financial information accompanying this press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP numbers.\nCommenting on the results, Mike Inglese, Aircastle's Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Aircastle's strong first quarter results reflect portfolio enhancements that were completed over the past year. The quality of our fleet has improved, and we continued to reduce residual value risk and generate healthy gains from aircraft sold during the first quarter. We have also continued to actively pursue attractive growth opportunities and have already acquired or committed to acquire more than $600 million of narrow-body aircraft in 2018, which includes Aircastle's first investment in new technology narrow-body aircraft.\"\nMr. Inglese concluded, \"With a 35% increase in net earnings per diluted share and consistently high cash ROE and fleet utilization, Aircastle is positioned to continue increasing the sustainable cash flow that supports our attractive dividend. As a public company, since 2006 we have acquired more than $14 billion of aircraft, paid out more than $790 million of dividends, and have repurchased more than $202 million of our shares at an average price of $13.50. By continuing to execute our thoughtful capital allocation strategy, Aircastle remains committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders.\"\nFinancial Results\n(In thousands, except share data)\nThree\n2018\n2017\nLease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues\n$\n186,925\n$\n194,659\nTotal revenues (1)\n$\n202,680\n$\n205,032\nAdjusted EBITDA (2)\n$\n191,145\n$\n193,391\nNet income\n$\n57,547\n$\n42,439\nPer common share - Diluted\n$\n0.73\n$\n0.54\nAdjusted net income (2)\n$\n56,751\n$\n45,691\nPer common share - Diluted\n$\n0.72\n$\n0.58\n(1)\nAs part of the Company's adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), we have reclassified Gain on sale of flight equipment from Other income (expense) to Revenues on our Consolidated Statement of Income as of March 31, 2018. We believe this better reflects the sale of flight equipment as part of our ordinary activities and conforms our presentation to those of our publicly traded peers. The presentation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 has also been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n(2)\nRefer to the selected financial information accompanying this press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP numbers.\nFirst Quarter Results\nNet income for the quarter was $57.5 million, an increase of $15.1 million, or 36%, versus the prior year. Lower total revenues of $2.4 million were offset by lower interest expense of $6.0 million, lower depreciation of $4.2 million and a mark to market benefit from interest rate hedging of $3.2 million.\nTotal revenues were $202.7 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 1.1%, from the previous year. The decrease was driven by a $7.7 million decline in lease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues, partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in the gain on the sale of flight equipment. Rental revenues were lower primarily due to the impact of wide-body lease transitions and extensions which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2017 at lower lease rates.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $191.1 million, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 1.2%, from the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to lower rental revenues, partially offset by higher gains from aircraft sales. We sold four aircraft for a gain on sale of $5.8 million during the first quarter of 2018 versus one aircraft sale that was closed during the first quarter of 2017.\nAviation Assets\nDuring the first quarter 2018, we acquired four aircraft for $111 million and had commitments to acquire twelve additional aircraft in 2018 for more than $490 million. These sixteen aircraft have a weighted average age of 4.7 years and a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.6 years. All of the aircraft that we have acquired or have committed to acquire this year are narrow-body aircraft.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Aircastle owned 222 aircraft having a net book value of $6.7 billion. We also manage twelve aircraft with a net book value of $634 million on behalf of our joint ventures.\nOwned Aircraft\nAs of\nMarch 31,\n2018 (1)\nAs of\nMarch 31,\n2017 (1)\nNet Book Value of Flight Equipment ($ mils.)\n$\n6,677\n$\n6,596\nNet Book Value of Unencumbered Flight Equipment ($ mils.)\n$\n5,304\n$\n4,725\nNumber of Aircraft\n222\n200\nNumber of Unencumbered Aircraft\n193\n163\nWeighted Average Fleet Age (years) (2)\n9.3\n8.2\nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term (years) (2)\n4.8\n4.8\nWeighted Average Fleet Utilization for the quarter ended (3)\n99.4\n%\n98.3\n%\nPortfolio Yield for the quarter ended (2)(4)\n11.5\n%\n12.3\n%\nNet Cash Interest Margin (5)\n8.3\n%\n8.7\n%\nManaged Aircraft on behalf of Joint Ventures\nNet Book Value of Flight Equipment ($ mils.)\n$\n634\n$\n682\nNumber of Aircraft\n12\n13\n(1)\nCalculated using net book value of flight equipment held for lease and net investment in finance leases at period end.\n(2)\nWeighted by net book value.\n(3)\nAircraft on-lease days as a percent of total days in period weighted by net book value.\n(4)\nLease rental revenue, interest income and cash collections on our net investment in finance and sales-type leases for the period as a percent of the average net book value for the period; quarterly information is annualized. Based on the growing level of finance and sales-type lease revenue management revised the calculation of portfolio yield to include our net investment in finance and sales-type leases in the average net book value and to include the interest income and cash collections on our net investment in finance and sales-type leases in lease rentals.\n(5)\nNet Cash Interest Margin = Lease rental yield plus finance lease revenue and collections minus interest on borrowings, net of settlements on interest rate derivatives, and other liabilities / average NBV of flight equipment for the period calculated on a quarterly basis, annualized.\nFinancing Activity\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we repaid $75 million that was drawn under our unsecured revolving line of credit. The current undrawn available balance under this committed credit facility is $710 million.\nCommon Dividend\nOn May 1, 2018, Aircastle's Board of Directors declared a second quarter 2018 cash dividend on its common shares of $0.28 per share, payable on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 31, 2018. This is our 48 th consecutive dividend.\nShare Repurchases\nSince the beginning of the year, the Company acquired approximately 494 thousand shares at an average price of $19.54 per share. Aircastle's Board of Directors previously authorized a $100 million share repurchase program, and there is approximately $86 million remaining under this authorization. Since 2011, the Company has repurchased 15.0 million shares at an average cost of $13.50 per share.\nConference Call\nIn connection with this earnings release, management will host an earnings conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 10:00 A.M.

We use EBITDA to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance, and we believe this non-U.S. GAAP measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance.\nThis measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance. It provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed.\nEBITDA provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. Accordingly, this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely the cost structure, or expenses, of the organization. EBITDA is one of the metrics used by senior management and the Board of Directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (as defined above) further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance as that term is defined in the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants.\nAircastle Limited and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted Net Income Reconciliation\n(Dollars in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n57,547\n$\n42,439\n(Gain) loss on mark-to-market of interest rate derivative contracts (1)\n(3,174)\n1,150\nNon-cash share-based payment expense (2)\n2,378\n2,102\nAdjusted net income\n$\n56,751\n$\n45,691\n(1) Included in Other income (expense).\n(2) Included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nManagement believes that ANI, when viewed in conjunction with the Company's results under U.S. GAAP and the above reconciliation, provides useful information about operating and period-over-period performance and additional information that is useful for evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business without regard to periodic reporting elements related to interest rate derivative accounting, changes related to refinancing activity and non-cash share-based payment expense.\nAircastle Limited and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nCash Return on Equity Calculation\n(Dollars in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nPeriod\nCFFO\nFinance\nLease\nCollections\nGain on Sale of Flt.

The calculation of net cash interest margin for all prior periods presented is revised to be comparable with the current period presentation.\n(2)\nExcludes loan termination payments of $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2013, $1.5 million and $3.5 million in the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively, and loan termination payments of $1.0 million in both the second and third quarters of 2017.\nWe define net cash interest margin as lease rentals from operating leases, interest income and cash collections from finance and sales-type leases minus interest on borrowings, net settlements on interest rate derivatives and other liabilities adjusted for loan termination payments divided by the average net book of flight equipment (which includes net investment on finance and sales-type leases) for the period calculated on a quarterly and annualized basis.\nManagement believes that net cash interest margin, when viewed in conjunction with the Company's results under U.S. GAAP and the above reconciliation, provides useful information about the effective deployment of our capital in the context of the yield on our aircraft assets, the utilization of those assets by our lessees, and our ability to borrow efficiently.\nAircastle Limited and Subsidiaries\nPresentation of Reclassification of Gain on Sale of Flight Equipment\n(Dollars in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nAs part of the Company's adoption of FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), we have reclassified Gain on sale of flight equipment from Other income (expense) to Revenues on our Consolidated Statement of Income as of March 31, 2018. We believe this better reflects the sale of flight equipment as part of our ordinary activities and conforms our presentation to those of our publicly traded peers. The presentation for the three months ended March 31, 2017, has also been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
