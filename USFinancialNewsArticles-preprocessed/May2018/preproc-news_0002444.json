Kellogg's products of U.S. Kellogg Company are offered at a supermarket of Swiss retail group Coop in Zumikon, Switzerland December 13, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nShares of Battle Creek, Michigan-based Kellogg rose 4.1 percent to $59.00 in premarket trading on Thursday after the results.\nTo better serve consumers who are ditching sugary foods including popular breakfast cereals, Kellogg has been acquiring companies that make healthier foods, such as protein bar maker RXBAR and Brazilian snack group Parati.\nItems made by RXBAR and Parati helped Kellogg’s sales rise 4.7 percent to $3.40 billion in the three months ended March 31.\nAnalysts on average had estimated sales of $3.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nKellogg said bit.ly/2jnkSRU net income rose to $444 million or $1.27 per share in the first quarter of 2018, from $266 million or 75 cents per share a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items, Kellogg earned $1.23 per share, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $1.08.
