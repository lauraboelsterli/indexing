    "text": "KIEV (Reuters) - The subway in Ukraine’s capital Kiev has reopened after a bomb warning proved to be a false alarm, the subway operator said on Saturday, just hours before the city hosts the UEFA Champions League final.\n“The stations are checked and open for passengers. Explosive items were not found,” the subway operator said on Facebook.\nEarlier on Saturday, the subway closed its five stations after it received a warning call.\nReporting by Pavel Polityuk; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
