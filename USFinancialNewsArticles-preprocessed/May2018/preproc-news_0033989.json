    "text": "Company Assists Leading Healthcare Organizations in Building Cybersecurity and Privacy Programs\nMISSION VIEJO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CynergisTek, Inc. (NYSE AMERICAN: CTEK), a leader in healthcare cybersecurity and information management, today announced financial results for the first quarter that ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial highlights for the first quarter 2018 include:\nRevenues for the first quarter were $16.4 million, a decrease of 10 percent from $18.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margins for the first quarter 2018 were 25 percent compared to 25 percent for the same period in 2017. GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $(0.7) million, or $(0.07) per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $0.01 million, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share in the same period of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP adjusted earnings exclude non-recurring charges related to our recent debt refinancing and the departure of a senior executive, totaling $0.7 million. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter 2018 was $0.06 per basic and $0.05 per diluted share, compared to $0.07 per basic and diluted share for the same period of 2017.\nRecent operational highlights include:\nAnnounced the first full-service managed print service contract that includes an integrated print security assessment component. Expanded managed services cross-selling efforts by successfully adding a three-year CAPP contract to our newest managed print service client. Maintained a 95 percent client renewal rate for the quarter. Grew the pipeline for both new and existing managed services, particularly Patient Privacy Monitoring, Incident Response, and Biomedical Device Security.\n“In Q1, our focus was to strengthen relationships with our clients, grow the managed services pipeline, and develop and improve our services offerings to better meet existing and emergent client needs,” said Mac McMillan, President and CEO of CynergisTek. “I am pleased with the progression we made in all three of those areas. This focus reiterates that we are here to help our clients build cybersecurity and privacy programs during a time where healthcare continues to experience an increase of cyber attacks.”\nFinancial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018\nRevenue decreased by approximately $1.9 million to $16.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017. This decrease is a result of approximately $2.5 million less in managed service revenues due to approximately $3.8 million in non-renewals of long-term contracts, partially offset by approximately $1.3 million in additional revenues from the expansion of existing customers and contracts from new customers; approximately $0.8 million in additional revenues from consulting and professional services provided to new and existing customers; and approximately $0.2 million less in equipment revenues in 2018.\nCost of revenue was $12.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $13.7 million for the same period in 2017. We incurred approximately $0.2 million less in staffing costs, and approximately $1.0 million less in supplies and third-party services, largely as a result of the net reduction in managed services contracts. Equipment costs decreased by approximately $0.2 million in 2018.\nGross margin remained at 25 percent of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. We were successful in adjusting our staffing to be reflective of our current service activity. Over the second half of 2018 and into next year, we expect gross margins to improve as we look to increase growth in our cybersecurity services.\nSales and marketing expenses were $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2017. Our tradeshow and forum related marketing expenses were approximately $0.1 million more in 2018 as we actively pursue new business.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase is attributed to approximately $0.6 million in severance paid to a departed executive offset by a decrease in professional fees and travel costs in 2018, where 2017 included higher costs in connection with the acquisition and integration of CTEK Security.\nIncome tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.2 million compared to income tax expense of $0.01 million for the same period in 2017. The 2018 benefit is based on an estimated annual income tax expense rate we anticipate for the year as we expect to be in a tax expense position by year-end. The 2017 expense was based on similar terms and was influenced by state minimum tax charges.\nNet loss was $(0.7) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, or $(0.07) per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $0.01 million, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share in the same period of 2017.\nThe reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP information can be found in the tables at the end of this release and provide the details of the Company’s non-GAAP disclosures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP information.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, when adding back stock-based compensation, non-recurring charges related to our recent debt refinancing and the departure of a senior executive was $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.5 million, or $0.06 per basic and $0.05 per diluted share after adjusting for non-cash income tax benefit, non-recurring charges related to our recent debt refinancing and the departure of a senior executive, amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and depreciation, with all adjustments totaling $1.2 million, compared to $0.6 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted share after adjusting for non-cash income tax expense, amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and depreciation, with all adjustments totaling $0.6 million, for the same period of 2017.\nCYNERGISTEK, INC.
