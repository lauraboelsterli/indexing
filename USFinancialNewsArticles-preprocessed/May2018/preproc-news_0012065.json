    "text": "2 COMMENTS Americans, it seems, are obsessed with the weather, whether it’s across town or across the country: torrential rains that result in “500-year floods”; snowstorms that close cities and major highways; and, over the next few months, tornadoes so devastating and unpredictable that they can destroy entire city blocks and yet leave an adjacent neighborhood untouched.\nTim Samaras was one of those weather obsessives. Growing up in suburban Denver, he watched storm systems pass overhead on their way to becoming tornadoes on the Great Plains. As a teenager, he started chasing these systems, his hobby eventually becoming a lifelong passion, earning him a regular spot on the television show “Storm Chasers” and no doubt inspiring a whole new generation of weather fanatics. He seemed to have an innate ability to predict the path of a tornado, allowing him to record some of the best data ever captured on these deadly storms.\nSamaras died at the age of 55 on May 31, 2013, chasing a storm just west of Oklahoma City, in the heart of Tornado Alley. The one that killed him—as well as his 24-year-old son Paul and fellow storm chaser Carl Young —turned out to be the widest ever recorded, expanding from approximately 1 mile across to 2.6 miles in about 30 seconds. It caught the veteran adventurers off-guard and whipped their Chevy Cobalt around in a subvortex, one of the deadliest kinds of tornadoes there is, with winds near 300 mph.\nSamaras’s story is told well in “The Man Who Caught the Storm” by Brantley Hargrove, himself a storm chaser and journalist. In researching the book, Mr. Hargrove not only spent time with Samaras’s immediate and weather-chasing family but followed in many of Samaras’s footsteps. In a bit of foreshadowing early in the book, Mr. Hargrove recounts a July 21, 1993, excursion south of Lindon, Colo., a small farming community about halfway between Denver and the Kansas border. “Tim isn’t a newbie—nor is he an old hand yet—but his forecast today is as spot-on as a professional’s. And like a pro, he knows well enough to give this one a wide berth. Getting too close to a rain-wrapped tornado is a bit like piloting a dinghy into a blind fog. Usually, the craft sails through without incident. But there’s always a chance that the dinghy takes the bow of an oil tanker broadside.”\nThat’s also exactly how it started the day Samaras was killed. But before we get to that, Mr. Hargrove weaves a tale with just enough background, just enough science and just enough adventure to keep us reading. He describes how Samaras had an early interest in electronics, first taking apart broken appliances his father found, then ham radios—another Samaras hobby. Following high school, he worked for the University of Denver Research Institute and the defense contractor Applied Research Associates—which did blast testing for the military—and was recognized by the National Transportation Safety Board for his investigative work on the crash of TWA Flight 800, which went down off the coast of New York in 1996. At the time, storm-chasing technology was still rudimentary. Ever the inveterate tinkerer, Samaras would apply to his early storm analysis everything he learned at work, including the use of high-speed cameras during blast tests, to help advance his hobby.\nThe Man Who Caught the Storm By Brantley Hargrove\nSimon & Schuster, 295 pages, $26\nFor much of Samaras’s storm-chasing career, the Holy Grail was to record data from inside a tornado. Not only was there much debate about what should be measured and how the measuring instruments should be designed, but there was wide disagreement over how to get the instruments inside a storm. Samaras inevitably knocked heads with scientists, seeing flaws in their designs. He ended up building his own instruments, which he called probes.\nOn June 24, 2003, outside Manchester, S.D., Samaras’s tinkering paid off. In a narrative that often reads like a thriller, we learn how, over the course of an afternoon, Samaras played cat and mouse with a fast-moving storm. “After gaining some distance,” Mr. Hargrove writes, “Tim plants a new probe he has outfitted with cameras. His white socks are pulled high over mud-slathered calves, and his dark hair is wet and matted against his forehead. . . . Suddenly the tornado curves northwest, toward the caravan.” Samaras plants his probe with little time to spare and speeds away from the fast-approaching tornado. Once the storm passes, Samaras returns to the probes, driving through “a freshly destroyed farmstead” and past “a flattened farm truck, the cab shorn flush with the dash panel. Tree-root boluses the size of tractor tires are upturned and naked.” In a scene straight out of the 1996 film “Twister,” a movie based in part on Samaras’s exploits, he and some of his fellow storm chasers are still debating the intensity of the tornado they just witnessed—was it an EF-4? An EF-5?—when he looks down at his intact probe and says, with a grin, “well, I can certainly tell you.” His probe, placed a mere 82 seconds ahead of the storm, captured the biggest drop in atmospheric pressure and the lowest pressure at the Earth’s surface ever recorded.\nBy the time he arrives in El Reno, Okla., in May 2013, Samaras is already a minor celebrity and a well-funded professional. He is also a different storm chaser than he was near Lindon 20 years before. “He’s spent so much time in the presence of violent storms that the old pang of fear has dulled,” Mr. Hargrove writes. “And while he has often said that nothing scares him more than the tornado he can’t see, he and Carl have penetrated the rain before not knowing what awaited them on the other side.” This time, what’s waiting on the other side is their ultimate undoing. But not before they change tornado forecasting forever, for the better.\n—Mr. Yost is a writer in New York.",
