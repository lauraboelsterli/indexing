    "text": "DUBLIN, Ireland, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trinity Biotech plc (Nasdaq:TRIB), a leading developer and manufacturer of diagnostic products for the point-of-care and clinical laboratory markets, today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQuarter 1 Results\nTotal revenues for Q1, 2018 were $23.8m which compares to $23.5m in Q1, 2017, an increase of $0.3m and were broken down as follows:\n2017\nQuarter 1 2018\nQuarter 1 Increase/\n(decrease) US$’000 US$’000 % Point-of-Care 4,010 3,776 (5.8 %) Clinical Laboratory 19,526 20,023 2.5 % Total 23,536 23,799 1.1 % Point-of-Care revenues for Q1, 2018 decreased from $4.0m to $3.8m when compared to Q1, 2017, a reduction of 5.8%. This was due to a combination of the impact of lower public health spending on U.S. HIV sales and the normal fluctuation of African HIV orders.\nClinical Laboratory revenues increased from $19.5m to $20.0m, which represents an increase of 2.5% compared to Q1 2017. As has been the case in previous quarters, this growth was due to higher Diabetes and Autoimmunity sales.\nGross profit for Q1, 2018 amounted to $10.4m representing a gross margin of 43.8%. This was higher than the 42% achieved in Q1, 2017 and was higher than the gross margin reported in each of the subsequent quarters of 2017.\nResearch and Development expenses remained flat at $1.3m whilst Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) fell slightly from $7.0m to $6.9m during the quarter.\nOperating profit for the quarter was $1.8m, which is higher than the $1.3m achieved in Q1, 2017 and this was attributable to the combination of the higher revenues and improved gross margin.\nFinancing income for the quarter was marginally higher at $0.2m reflecting higher available deposit interest rates. Meanwhile, interest payable, mainly arising on the Company’s exchangeable notes, remained static at $1.2m. A further non-cash expense of $0.3m was recognised in the quarter. This was due to a loss of $0.1m arising on an increase in the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with the exchangeable notes plus non-cash interest of $0.2m.\nThe profit after tax, before non-cash financial expenses, for the quarter was $0.7m and compares favourably to $0.2m for the equivalent period last year. This was primarily due to the improved operating profit this quarter.\nThe basic EPS (excluding non-cash financial expenses) for the quarter was 3.4 cents versus 1.0 cent in Q1, 2017. Unconstrained diluted EPS for the quarter amounted to 7.1 cents, which compares to 5.0 cents in the equivalent quarter in 2017.\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and share option expense for the quarter was $3.3m, compared with $2.7m in Q1, 2017.\nShare Buyback\nDuring the quarter, the Company bought back 27,000 shares at an average price of $5.15 and a total value of $0.1m. This brings the total purchased since the beginning of the program to over 2.5m shares with a total value of $17.5m.\nComments\nCommenting on the results, Kevin Tansley, Chief Financial Officer stated, “There were a number of positive aspects to our performance this quarter. In addition to our growth in revenues, we saw a significant improvement in gross margins to 43.8%, which is the highest we have recorded in the last six quarters. By maintaining the level of our indirect costs, this translated into an increase in operating profit from $1.3m to $1.8m – an increase of over 38%. Similarly our Diluted EPS increased from 5 cents to 7.1 cents.”\nRonan O’Caoimh, Chief Executive Officer stated, “Clinical Laboratory revenues grew by 2.5% this quarter. As in previous quarters, this was driven by the continued growth of our Diabetes and Autoimmunity businesses. Meanwhile, our Point-of-Care revenues fell by 5.8%. This partly due to the adverse impact of lower federal funding for public health programs on US HIV revenues. In addition, African HIV sales were slightly lower this quarter due to the normal fluctuations which are a feature of this market. Of greater importance is the fact that Trinity’s Uni-gold product remains the pre-eminent confirmatory HIV test in the African market.”\nForward-looking statements in this release are made pursuant to the \"safe harbor\" provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
