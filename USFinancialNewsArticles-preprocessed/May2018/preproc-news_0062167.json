    "text": "May 30 (Reuters) - British banknotes and passports maker De La Rue said operating profit fell 11.2 percent, in line with its lowered guidance, after it lost a key contract to print UK post-Brexit passports and suffered delays in some other contracts.\nThe company’s adjusted operating profit fell to 62.8 million pounds ($83.2 million) in the year ended March 31, from 70.7 million pounds a year earlier, it said on Wednesday.\nDe La Rue warned last month that underlying operating profit for the year would be in the low to mid 60s of millions of pounds.
