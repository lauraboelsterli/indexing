    "text": "MOSCOW, May 30 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov rejected a Ukrainian allegation that Moscow was behind the murder of dissident Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko in Kiev, calling it part of an anti-Russian campaign, the TASS news agency reported.\nBabchenko, a critic of President Vladimir Putin, was shot dead in Ukraine on Tuesday where he had fled into exile following threats.\nUkrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said in a social media posting late on Tuesday he was convinced that what he called “the Russian totalitarian machine” had not forgiven Babchenko for what Groysman called his honesty.
