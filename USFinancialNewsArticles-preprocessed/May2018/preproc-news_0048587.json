The appointment represents another significant investment by OAG in talent development, innovation and global growth.\n“As we strive to grow and scale faster across the world, building a deep and talented team remains a top priority. The COO position is critical to helping us deliver our vision, growth and operational strategy,” said Phil Callow, CEO of OAG. “Ben is an accomplished business leader with highly relevant experience.

He will support project and process governance, enhance internal systems performance, coordinate overall strategy and merger and acquisition activity, and drive talent and culture development.\nThis addition to OAG’s leadership team follows several other major appointments over the past 12 months, including Gehan Talwatte , formerly the CEO of Ascend, to Chairman and Vipul Nakum as Chief Product Officer.\n“OAG has a strong team in place and ambitious growth goals that they’re already successfully tracking towards,” said Hollins. “The opportunity to join a rapidly-growing business, with ambitious expansion goals and an aggressive investment strategy, is incredibly compelling. I look forward to working with the team to help facilitate OAG’s next phase of growth.”\nAbout OAG\nOAG is the leading global provider of digital flight information and provides accurate, timely and actionable information and applications across the travel sector to the world’s airlines, airports, government agencies, aircraft manufacturers, consultancies and travel-related companies.\nOAG has the world’s largest network of air travel data, including the definitive schedules database of more than 900 airlines and over 4,000 airports.
