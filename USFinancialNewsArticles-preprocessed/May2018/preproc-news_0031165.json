    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, May 14 (Reuters) - Argentina’s treasury minister, Nicolas Dujovne, said on Monday that he expected “somewhat less growth and more inflation” in Argentina as the peso weakens to record lows and the government negotiates a lifeline with the International Monetary Fund.\nDujovne said six weeks would be the standard timeframe to conclude a deal with the IMF, but said he hoped it would be faster. Argentina announced last week that it was requesting a financing arrangement with the IMF.
