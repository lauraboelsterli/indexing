    "text": "RED BANK, N.J., May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ZAIS Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZAIS) (\"ZAIS\"), today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. ZAIS conducts substantially all of its operations through ZAIS Group, LLC (\"ZAIS Group\"). ZAIS Group provides investment advisory and asset management services to private funds, separately managed accounts and structured vehicles. References to the \"Company\" herein refer to ZAIS, together with (where the context requires) its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nA summary of the Company's results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 are set forth below. All dollar amounts are presented in millions, with the exception of figures presented on a per share basis.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nU.S. GAAP\nNet income/(loss)\n$(2.8)\n$(5.4)\nNet income/(loss) per diluted weighted average share outstanding applicable to ZAIS Group Holdings, Inc.\n$(0.26)\n$(0.30)\nNet income/(loss) before income taxes\n$(2.8)\n$(5.4)\nNon-U.S. GAAP\nNet income/(loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group)\n$(5.6)\n$(6.2)\nNet income/(loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) per diluted weighted average share outstanding\n$(0.26)\n$(0.30)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$(5.3)\n$(5.0)\nThe consolidated financial statements include non-controlling interests of the members of ZAIS Group Parent, LLC (\"ZGP\") (the \"ZGP Founder Members\") which represent Class A Units of ZGP held by the ZGP Founder Members. ZGP, a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of ZAIS, is the sole member, and owns all of the equity, of ZAIS Group.\nCONSOLIDATED U.S. GAAP RESULTS\nThe Company recorded U.S. GAAP net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $(2.8) million compared with U.S. GAAP net loss of $(5.4) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease of $2.6 million in U.S. GAAP net loss was primarily driven by an increase in revenues of $2.6 million and a decrease in expenses of $0.1 million offset by a decrease in other income of $0.1 million. The U.S. GAAP results include the results of funds and structured financing entities which are consolidated by the Company (the \"Consolidated Funds\").\nTotal revenues increased by $2.6 million primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in management fee income and a $1.0 million increase in income of Consolidated Funds, offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in incentive income and a decrease of $0.2 million in reimbursement revenue from certain ZAIS Managed Entities for research and data services expenses.\nManagement fee income increased by $2.0 million primarily due to the increase in the number of CLOs managed by ZAIS and fees earned from a ZAIS CLO beginning in June 2017 which previously had its fees waived because all of its subordinated notes were collectively owned by certain vehicles managed by ZAIS. Income of Consolidated Funds related to ZAIS Zephyr A-6 LP's (\"Zephyr A-6\") investments in unconsolidated ZAIS managed CLOs increased by $1.0 million.\nIncentive income decreased by $0.2 million primarily due to lower performance related to ZAIS Managed Entities that crystalized incentive fees during the respective quarters.\nTotal expenses decreased by $0.1 million period over the period. Compensation and benefits decreased by $1.3 million primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in equity compensation expense relating to the vesting, in March 2017, of equity units previously awarded to certain employees and a $0.5 million decrease primarily due to reduced bonus expense. These favorable variances were offset by $0.1 million increase in severance costs.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses (\"G&A\") increased by $0.8 million primarily due to an increase of $0.8 million in legal fees as a result of an increase of $0.6 million related to a strategic review and an increase of $0.2 million due to payments made to the Company's former general counsel who was retained as a senior legal advisor that commenced in April 2017. G&A expenses also increased by $0.4 million due to investment banking services in connection with a potential take private transaction between the Company and Z Acquisition. These unfavorable variances were offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in expenses relating to research and data services borne by ZAIS Group and paid directly by ZAIS Group to vendors which are reimbursable from certain ZAIS Managed Entities and a decrease of $0.2 million in other expenses.\nExpenses of Consolidated Funds increased by $0.4 million primarily due to interest expense for the master repurchase agreement entered into by Zephyr A-6 in October 2017. Zephyr A-6 did not have any expenses related to repurchase agreements during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nOther income decreased by $0.1 million primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in net gain (loss) on investments in affiliates and a $0.6 million decrease in net gain (loss) on beneficial interest of collateralized financing entity, offset by a $1.0 million increase in net gain (loss) on Consolidated Funds' investments and a $0.1 million increase in other income.\nNet gain (loss) on investments in affiliates decreased by $0.7 million primarily due to losses of $0.6 million relating to the two ZAIS Managed Entities in which ZAIS Group had made investments that carry first loss risk (on March 12, 2018 ZAIS Group sent notice to terminate its management contracts for these two ZAIS Managed Entities effective March 16, 2018). The $0.6 million decrease in net gain (loss) on beneficial interest of consolidated collateralized financing entity relates to Zephyr A-6's investment in ZAIS CLO 5. ZAIS CLO 5 was a Consolidated Fund for the period from October 26, 2016 through August 10, 2017, the date which ZAIS CLO 5 was deconsolidated due to the sale of all of the Company's beneficial interests in ZAIS CLO 5. Net gain (loss) on Consolidated Funds' investments increased by $1.0 million driven by the net realized and unrealized gains and losses from Zephyr A-6's investments in ZAIS CLOs during the warehouse period and unconsolidated ZAIS CLOs.\nCONSOLIDATED NON-U.S. GAAP RESULTS\nPlease see the discussion of \"Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\", including the definitions of net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA, and reconciliations of such non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to the respective U.S. GAAP net income (loss) measures for the periods discussed above at the end of this press release.\nThe Company's U.S. GAAP net income (loss) and non-U.S. GAAP measures of income (loss) may fluctuate materially depending upon the performance of ZAIS Managed Entities as well as other factors. Accordingly, the U.S. GAAP net income (loss) and non-U.S. GAAP measures of income (loss) in any particular period should not be expected to be indicative of future results.\nLIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash and cash equivalents of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities, of $30.9 million and no debt obligations, excluding liabilities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nThe Company's First Quarter 2018 Supplemental Information – March 31, 2018, is available on ZAIS's website at www.zaisgroupholdings.com . To access the information, go to the \"ZAIS Shareholders\" section of the website.\nUSE OF NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), this press release includes certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information, including net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA (and per share measures). Net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) excluding the consolidating effects of the Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) excluding consolidating effects of the Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group, equity-based compensation, severance, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nThe Company believes that providing investors with this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, gives investors greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. However, because net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA are incomplete measures of the Company's financial performance and involve differences from net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the Company's net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nZAIS GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.
