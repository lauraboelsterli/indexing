    "text": "CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CVD Equipment Corporation (NASDAQ: CVV ), a leading provider of chemical vapor deposition systems, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results.\n“In the first quarter, we continued to execute on the core segment of our growth strategy by increasing our investment in the development of our new CVD Materials facility,” said Len Rosenbaum, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The new facility will provide a cost-effective infrastructure to utilize the latest technology to produce high quality materials for aerospace, medical and electronic applications. We also further strengthened our senior leadership team and increased our focus on sales to expand and commercialize our exciting new technologies.”\nRevenue for the first quarter was $9.2 million, compared to $9.8 million in the prior quarter and $9.7 million from the same period last year. Net income for the first quarter was $0.6 million compared to $1.6 million in the prior quarter and $1.0 million a year ago. The reduction in net income is primarily a result of the ongoing investment in the Materials business, the development of the new facility, and shifting some engineering and production personnel to the planning, outfitting and building of equipment for the new facility. Net earnings per diluted share were $0.09 compared to $0.24 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.16 a year ago. Backlog as of March 31, 2018 was $9.8 million compared to $15.5 million on December 31, 2017.\nCVD’s significant investment in the Materials facility will transform the Company over the long term: 1) CVD holds the proprietary knowledge and has the capability to build the production systems required to meet demand; 2) CVD possesses the intimate knowledge necessary to operate the systems in a cost-effective manner, providing a significant operational and financial competitive advantage; and 3) CVD is well capitalized to invest in the overhead and capital expenses required to take the Company to the next level. Execution of this growth strategy should provide an additional, diverse and stable revenue stream that should significantly improve growth and profitability over the long-term.\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its results today at 4:30 pm (Eastern Time).
