The Small Business Jobs Index fell 0.12 percent for the month and is down 0.96 over the past year to 99.53. Hourly earnings grew $0.70 to $26.56, up 2.69 percent from last year. One-month annualized hourly earnings growth in April was 3.25 percent, reaching a two-year high.\n\"The 2018 moderation in small business job growth continued apace in April, reflecting tightening labor markets across the country,\" said James Diffley, chief regional economist at IHS Markit.\n\"The low unemployment rate is contributing to steady increases in wage growth,\" said Martin Mucci , Paychex president and CEO. \"With tightening labor conditions and wages continuing to show positive momentum, business owners and HR managers will need to focus on recruitment and benefit strategies to attract and retain qualified talent.\"\nNational Jobs Index\nThe decline in 2018 has been slow and steady, falling 0.12 percent in April and 0.35 percent during the past quarter. At 99.53, the national index is down 0.96 percent from last year and is at its lowest level since 2010.\nNational Wage Report\nApril's 3.25 percent one-month annualized hourly earnings growth was the best rate in more than two years. Hourly earnings growth has been consistent the past quarter, though annualizing the one-month and three-month growth rates signals positive movement ahead.\nRegional Jobs Index\nClosing in on the top-ranked South, the Midwest was the only region to increase in April, 0.26 percent to 99.82. Ranked last among regions since September, the West has declined ten of the last 12 months.\nNote: Percentages displayed in the regional heat map reflect 12-month changes.\nRegional Wage Report\nThe Northeast was the only region to experience positive month-over-month hourly earnings growth in April, reaching the national level of 2.69 percent.

Washington State was the top-ranked state in February, but fell to fifth in April, following sharp declines during the past two months. Having the lowest index among states for the past six months, Missouri jumped four spots in April and has improved more than two percent already in 2018.\nNote: Analysis is provided for the 20 largest states based on U.S. population.\nState Wage Report\nFor the seventh consecutive month, Maryland showed positive gains across all earnings indicators in April.
