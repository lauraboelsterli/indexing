    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kindred Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: KIN), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on saving and improving the lives of pets, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided updates on its programs.\n\"We are excited about the recent approval of our first product, Mirataz™, for the management of weight loss in cats. This first-in-class medicine, which is the only FDA-approved treatment for this indication, and the first transdermal product ever approved for cats by FDA, will help millions of cats with a serious and potentially fatal unmet medical need,\" stated Richard Chin, CEO of KindredBio. \"In less than five years and at a cost of under $5 million, we have brought to market our first product, thereby validating our strategy of quickly and cost-efficiently developing therapeutics that improve the lives of pets. We are also very pleased with the progress across our rich pipeline, including epoCat™ and our monoclonal antibodies for atopic dermatitis, which represent large market opportunities.\"\nDevelopment and Corporate Milestones\nOn May 4, KindredBio received approval of Mirataz™ (mirtazapine transdermal ointment).\nMirataz is the first and only transdermal medication specifically developed, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, for the management of weight loss in cats. Weight loss in cats is a serious and potentially fatal condition. The Company's research estimates that U.S. veterinarians see as many as 9 million cats each year with unintended weight loss, making this condition the leading cause of visits to the veterinarian for cats. Mirataz, which is formulated with KindredBio's proprietary Accusorb™ technology, is applied topically to the cat's inner ear (pinna) once a day, providing a more attractive application route compared to oral administration. The product is classified as a weight gain drug and can be used in cats with various underlying diseases associated with unintended weight loss.\nThe Company will commence taking Mirataz orders within the next two weeks via distributors and KindredBio's team of sales specialists. The product will then ship within the next two to three months, once packaging has been updated based with the final FDA-approved label.\nThe FDA has approved the safety and effectiveness technical sections for Zimeta™ (dipyrone injection) for the control of pyrexia (fever) in horses. The FDA has indicated it does not have any additional questions or requests from KindredBio regarding the CMC technical section. The approval is pending a pre-approval inspection, or PAI, at the contract manufacturer of Zimeta IV scheduled by the FDA in July 2018, and an acceptable resolution by the contract manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dipyrone of findings identified during an inspection last month. The Company believes that the findings at the API manufacturer are minor and addressable. Regulatory approval is subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process. Preparations for the commercial launch remain on track.\nZimeta IV is expected to be the first FDA-approved product for the control of fever in horses, a significant unmet medical condition that affects millions of horses each year.\nThe pivotal field effectiveness study for Zimeta™ (dipyrone oral gel) has been completed with positive results. The target animal safety study is also complete, and the Zimeta Oral was found to be well-tolerated. KindredBio is in discussions with the FDA regarding the data required for submission and is in the process of transferring the product to the commercial manufacturer.\nZimeta Oral, which is a proprietary oral gel, is expected to expand use of the drug and build upon the success of Zimeta IV.\nKindredBio has initiated or is in the process of initiating pilot field effectiveness studies for several molecules for atopic dermatitis, including fully-caninized anti-IL31 antibody, fully-caninized anti-IL17 antibody, and canine anti-IL4/IL13 SINK molecule.\nAtopic dermatitis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition in dogs. It is one of the most common skin diseases in dogs and represents a significant unmet medical need, with the two lead products in the market expected to reach combined sales of over $500 million this year. KindredBio is pursuing a multi-pronged approach toward atopic dermatitis, with a portfolio of promising biologics.\nThe pilot field effectiveness study of the enhanced version of epoCat™ (long-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin) for the control of non-regenerative anemia in cats has been initiated and enrollment is ongoing.\nAnemia is a common condition in older cats which is often associated with chronic kidney disease, resulting in decreased levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Chronic kidney disease can affect approximately half of older cats. epoCat is a recombinant protein that has been specially engineered by KindredBio with a prolonged half-life compared to endogenous feline erythropoietin. The PK data suggest that the molecule may have a sufficiently long half-life to allow for once-monthly dosing.\nThe pilot field safety study of KIND-014 for the treatment of equine gastric ulcers has been completed and KIND-014 was well-tolerated. KindredBio has completed dose range finding and palatability studies and, based on the study results, the Company has advanced two formulations into pilot field studies. The pilot studies have been initiated and enrollment for one of the formulation candidates has been completed. By the end of the second quarter, the Company expects to have completed the review of data to determine which formulation will move into a pivotal field study, assuming the data support further development.\nThe pilot field efficacy study of KIND-011, an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody targeting sick or septic foals, has been completed, with positive results.\nSepsis in foals can cause up to 50% mortality and is an important unmet medical need. There is currently no FDA-approved therapy. KindredBio has optimized this fully-equinized anti-TNF monoclonal antibody and intends to continue field studies during the 2019 foaling season, following discussion with FDA regarding the development plan.\nA pilot field study assessing oral tolerability and palatability of KIND-015 for the management of clinical signs associated with equine metabolic syndrome has been completed. The Company has optimized the formulation for KIND-015 and has initiated a pilot field effectiveness study.\nThe Company has started construction on the biologics manufacturing lines in the Elwood, Kansas facility it acquired in August 2017. The facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for small molecule and biologics manufacturing. Construction to support KindredBio's initial production lines is expected to be completed by mid-2019.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, KindredBio reported a net loss of $10.0 million or $0.36 per share, as compared to a net loss of $6.5 million or $0.30 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nTotal research and development expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $5.3 million, compared to $3.8 million for the same period in 2017. The $1.5 million year-over-year increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher headcount and related expenses as the company focuses on advancing its biologics programs, as well as increased biologics batch production and testing costs, including lab supplies.\nTotal general and administrative expenses for the 2018 and 2017 first quarters were $4.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 increased across the board. The $2.1 million increase in the first quarter of 2018 over the same period in 2017 included a mix of higher payroll and related expenses, marketing, travel and conference expenses as a result of pre-launch activities and the build-out of a small commercial team. In addition, higher corporate infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense also contributed to the increase in expenses.\nAs of March 31, 2018, KindredBio had $70.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, compared with $82.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Net cash used in operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $11.2 million. The Company also invested approximately $0.4 million in capital expenditures for the build-out of its Elwood, Kansas manufacturing facility.\nFor the 2018 calendar year, the Company reiterates its previous guidance for operating expenses to be in the range of $44 million to $48 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and the impact of acquisitions, if any. The Company is preparing for the commercial launches of Mirataz and Zimeta including the scale up of a commercial team and will continue to focus on the development of its core pipeline candidates and programs. Additionally, KindredBio plans to invest $14.0 to $16.0 million in capital expenditures on the construction and build-out of its Elwood, Kansas facility for its biologics programs. Revenues for Mirataz and Zimeta are expected to have a substantial impact on cash utilization and expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nKindredBio will host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time.
