    "text": "May 30, 2018 / 4:46 AM / Updated 16 minutes ago Teamsters members go on strike at Canadian Pacific Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMay 29 (Reuters) - More than 3,000 locomotive engineers and conductors at Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) have gone on strike on Tuesday night, trade union Teamsters Canada said in a statement.\nThe negotiations between the union and the company are currently ongoing and Teamsters is working with federal mediators to reach a negotiated agreement, according to the statement.\nThe workers, whose collective agreement expired late last year, are asking for more predictable schedules to combat crew fatigue, among other demands.\nCanadian Pacific reached an agreement with unions in April to postpone a strike, which would have been the third in six years at the railroad.\nThe company could not be reached for comment outside business hours.\nThe labor strife comes at a time of tighter rail capacity in Canada, where CP and rival Canadian National Railway are facing strong demand for shipments of grain, potash and other commodities.
