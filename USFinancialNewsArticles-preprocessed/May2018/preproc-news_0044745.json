    "text": "Wilmer Flores lofted a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth inning Saturday night as the host New York Mets came back to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-4 at Citi Field.\nThe Mets have won the first two games of the three-game series for their first winning streak since they won nine in a row from April 3-13. The Diamondbacks have lost nine of 10.\nBrandon Nimmo led off the ninth against Andrew Chafin (0-1) with a double and went to third on a perfectly placed bunt single by Asdrubal Cabrera. Flores followed with a fly ball to deep left field. David Peralta, playing shallow, ranged back to make the catch but had no chance to throw out Nimmo.\nThe eighth walk-off RBI of Flores’ career capped a late-inning comeback for the Mets, who trailed 4-2 entering the eighth before Devin Mesoraco tied the game with a two-run homer.\nJeurys Familia (2-1) earned the win with a perfect ninth.\nJohn Ryan Murphy had three RBIs for the Diamondbacks via a second-inning single and fourth-inning homer. Michael Conforto hit a two-run homer in the second before the Diamondbacks took the lead in the fourth, when Paul Goldschmidt hit a leadoff homer — his first round-tripper in 105 at-bats — and Murphy homered with two outs.\nThe Mets left the bases loaded in the sixth, when the Diamondbacks used three pitchers to get three outs, but tied the game in the eighth, when Jay Bruce delivered a leadoff single and Mesoraco followed with his third homer in seven games since the Mets acquired him from the Cincinnati Reds on May 8.\nMesoraco’s homer ensured neither starter would factor into the decision.\nDiamondbacks left-hander Patrick Corbin allowed two runs on four hits and four walks while striking out six over 5 1/3 innings. Mets southpaw Steven Matz gave up four runs on six hits and one walk while striking out two over four innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
