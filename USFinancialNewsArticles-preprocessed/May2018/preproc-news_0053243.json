    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is set to demand that the European Union repay up to 1 billion pounds ($1.34 billion) if the bloc continues to force British companies out of the Galileo satellite navigation system, a government official said.\nFILE PHOTO: The Russian Soyuz VS01 rocket, carrying the first two satellites of Europe's Galileo navigation system, blasts off from its launchpad at the Guiana Space Center in Sinnamary, French Guiana, October 21, 2011. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo The Brexit ministry, officially known as the Department for Exiting the European Union, will publish a paper on Thursday raising the prospect of Britain recovering its investment in the project.\nBritain wants to continue to participate fully in the Galileo program, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May told reporters on Thursday, suggesting that negotiations with the EU were “constructive”.\nThe row over Galileo has become a flashpoint in Brexit negotiations after moves to shut British businesses out of the project before Britain’s exit from the EU in a year’s time.\nGalileo is the EU rival to the global positioning system (GPS) developed and controlled by the United States and used by millions of consumer devices globally. It was commissioned in 2003 and is due for completion by 2020.\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive, insists that Britain cannot be trusted with sensitive data that provides a secure back-up for the new satellite system after it leaves the bloc, even though up it has been heavily involved in the satellite’s development until now.\nThe EU has said Britain will be able to continue to use Galileo’s open signal, but that Britain’s military could be denied access to the encrypted version when the satellite becomes operational.\nBritain has signaled its determination to press ahead with the development of its own satellite navigation system if the EU continues to insist that it will be barred from the secure elements of the project.\nExperts say any rival British satellite navigation system could cost about 3 billion pounds.\nThe EU has also suggested that it may demand that key components are made on the continent after Brexit. In response, Britain is looking at preventing the transfer of technology and expertise relating to Galileo from Britain to the EU.\nReporting By Andrew MacAskill and Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Larry King\n ",
