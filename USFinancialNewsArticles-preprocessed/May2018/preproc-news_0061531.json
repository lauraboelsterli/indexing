    "text": "Jose Iglesias ripped a two-run, go-ahead single during a five-run uprising in the sixth inning, lifting the Detroit Tigers past the visiting Los Angeles Angels 6-1 on Wednesday.\nThe game was delayed 23 and 41 minutes by rain.\nLeonys Martin reached base four times and had a run, an RBI and a stolen base for Detroit. Nicholas Castellanos supplied three hits, including two doubles, and an RBI. Iglesias left the game after the sixth due to a right hip contusion.\nBoth starters came out after the second rain delay. Angels rookie sensation Shohei Ohtani gave up one run on three hits with three walks and five strikeouts in five innings. Detroit’s Mike Fiers allowed one run on seven hits with a walk and four strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings.\nLouis Coleman (2-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless inning to get the victory.\nLosing pitcher Cam Bedrosian (1-1) was charged with four runs while recording just one out.\nAlbert Pujols drove in Los Angeles’ lone run.\nWildness by Ohtani allowed the Tigers to push across a run in the first. Martin drew a leadoff walk and stole second. Victor Martinez walked with two outs, and Niko Goodrum smacked an RBI single.\nAngels leadoff hitter Ian Kinsler was caught stealing in the third, but Los Angeles still tied the score. Mike Trout followed with a double, and Pujols knocked him in with a single.\nThe Tigers had runners in scoring position in the bottom of the fifth with two out, but Ohtani retired Jeimer Candelario on a comebacker.\nDetroit got plenty of clutch hits the next inning while taking a 6-1 lead.\nBedrosian struggled immediately after replacing Ohtani. Martinez singled, Goodrum walked and JaCoby Jones was hit by a pitch. Grayson Greiner struck out, but Iglesias ripped a single to center, bringing in two runs. Jim Johnson replaced Bedrosian, but the Tigers kept scoring.\nJones came home on Dixon Machado’s fielder’s choice grounder, and Martin’s singled knocked in Iglesias to make it 5-1. Castellanos then ripped an RBI single.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
