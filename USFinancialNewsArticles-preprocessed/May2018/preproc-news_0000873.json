    "text": "ROANOKE, Va., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RGC Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGCO) announced consolidated Company earnings of $3,465,929 or $0.47 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This includes a $358,901 refund reserve for excess revenues billed to Roanoke Gas customers attributable to the reduction in the federal income tax rate. This compares to consolidated earnings of $3,225,199 or $0.45 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nEarnings for the twelve months ending March 31, 2018 were $6,300,839 or $0.87 per share compared to $6,230,046 or $0.87 per share for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017. CEO John D’Orazio attributed the increase to improved utility margins associated with infrastructure replacement programs, increased gas volumes attributed to customer growth and the investment in the MVP.\nRGC Resources, Inc. provides energy and related products and services to customers in Virginia through its operating subsidiaries Roanoke Gas Company and RGC Midstream, LLC.\nFrom time to time, the Company may publish forward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance, business prospects, technological developments, new products, research and development activities and similar matters. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company notes that a variety of factors could cause the Company’s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements.\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is not indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 as quarterly earnings are affected by the highly seasonal nature of the business and weather conditions generally result in greater earnings during the winter months. Past performance is not necessarily a predictor of future results.\nSummary financial statements for the second quarter and twelve months are as follows:\nRGC Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31, Twelve months ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Revenues $ 24,917,973 $ 21,900,013 $ 65,282,296 $ 61,964,060 Cost of sales 13,911,264 11,070,283 32,613,630 29,565,896 Gross margin 11,006,709 10,829,730 32,668,666 32,398,164 Equity in earnings of MVP 191,513 93,625 583,805 275,646 Other operating expenses, net 5,688,676 5,251,093 21,714,978 20,794,514 Interest expense 633,186 469,480 2,235,084 1,740,026 Income before income taxes 4,876,360 5,202,782 9,302,409 10,139,270 Income tax expense 1,410,431 1,977,583 3,001,570 3,909,224 Net income $ 3,465,929 $ 3,225,199 $ 6,300,839 $ 6,230,046 Net earnings per share of common stock: Basic $ 0.47 $ 0.45 $ 0.87 $ 0.87 Diluted $ 0.47 $ 0.45 $ 0.86 $ 0.86 Cash dividends per common share $ 0.1550 $ 0.1450 $ 0.6000 $ 0.5600 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Basic 7,371,694 7,215,329 7,270,727 7,186,730 Diluted 7,413,351 7,244,845 7,317,112 7,204,684\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited) March 31, Assets 2018 2017 Current assets $ 18,532,600 $ 15,621,491 Total property, plant and equipment, net 155,594,897 141,531,553 Other assets 24,401,409 19,912,761 Total Assets $ 198,528,906 $ 177,065,805 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Current liabilities $ 16,089,641 $ 18,551,673 Long-term debt 55,490,316 50,096,333 Deferred credits and other liabilities 47,649,723 48,463,998 Total Liabilities 119,229,680 117,112,004 Stockholders’ Equity 79,299,226 59,953,801 Total Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity $ 198,528,906 $ 177,065,805 Contact: Paul W.
