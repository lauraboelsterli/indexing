The Blue Jays won 7-2. Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY Sports / Reuters Picture Supplied by Action Images (TAGS: Sport Baseball MLB) *** Local Caption *** 2016-04-14T0 Z_649843802_NOCID_RTRMADP_3_MLB-NEW-YORK-YANKEES-AT-TORONTO-BLUE-JAYS.JPG Venditte, 32, is recognized as baseball’s only active switch-pitcher. He joined the Dodgers on a minor league contract with a spring invite during the offseason.\nVenditte made his major league debut as a member of the Oakland Athletics in 2015, becoming the first ambidextrous pitcher to play in the big leagues since Greg Harris on Sept. 28, 1995. He last pitched in the majors with the Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners in 2016 and has a 4.97 career ERA in 41 big league appearances.\nHe had a 1.53 ERA in 15 appearances with Oklahoma City to begin this season.\nDue to Venditte’s ability to throw with each hand, Major League Baseball created a rule, referred to as the “Pat Venditte Rule,” which states an ambidextrous pitcher must declare which hand he use to pitch to a batter prior to the start of the at-bat. The pitcher must use that hand only for the remainder of the at-bat.\nStewart, 26, has a 3.18 ERA in three appearances with the Dodgers this season. He pitched Friday, allowing one run in three innings.\nTo make room for Venditte on the 40-man roster, the Dodgers transferred shortstop Corey Seager to the 60-day disabled list. Seager is out for the season after undergoing Tommy John surgery.\n ",
