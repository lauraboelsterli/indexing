A settlement in principle with all parties in the Oregon proceeding has been reached. The parties intend to file the full settlement agreement with the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (\"OPUC\") later this month. The settlement agreement is subject to the review and approval by the OPUC.\n\"This is yet another key milestone as we navigate the path toward completing this transaction,\" said Mayo Schmidt, President and CEO, Hydro One. \"Once complete, this merger of two leading institutions will generate tremendous value for our organization, as well as our shareholders, employees and customers. We are very pleased by the progress we have been able to achieve in cooperation with all parties involved.\"\n\"This is a significant achievement and the result of the collaboration and diligent efforts of all the parties in Oregon over the last several months,\" Avista Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott L. Morris said. \"We're pleased that the parties support this as a settlement that benefits all stakeholders, and we look forward to filing the settlement agreement later in May.\"\nThe settlement in principle includes provisions related to financial protections for the utility and its customers, financial benefits through a rate credit for all Oregon customers and funding for low income customer conservation.\nAll of these items and other terms of the settlement agreement will be disclosed in detail when the settlement agreement is finalized and filed for approval by the OPUC.\nIn addition to Hydro One and Avista, the parties to the merger proceeding in Oregon include the OPUC staff, Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, Alliance of Western Energy Consumers and the Oregon and Southern Oregon District Council of Laborers.\nApplications for regulatory approval of the transaction are still pending with utility commissions in Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Montana.
