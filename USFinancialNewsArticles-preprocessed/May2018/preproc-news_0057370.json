    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â€” The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local):\n4 p.m.\nEnergy companies and oil prices took their worst losses in months following reports that OPEC countries plan to produce more oil soon.\nThe drops Friday left major U.S. market indexes mostly lower at the end of an indecisive week.\nU.S. crude oil sank 4 percent after multiple reports indicated that Russia and OPEC could start producing more crude. Chevron lost 3.5 percent and Exxon Mobil gave up 1.9 percent.\nGap plunged 14.6 percent after reporting a weak first quarter.\nThe S&P 500 index fell 6 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,721.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average lost 58 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,753. The Nasdaq composite rose 9 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,433.\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.93 percent.\n11:45 a.m.\nStocks are mostly lower as energy companies sink following reports OPEC countries plan to produce more oil soon.\nChevron lost 3.8 percent Friday and Exxon Mobil gave up 2.4 percent.\nAirlines climbed as investors anticipated lower fuel costs. Alaska Air jumped 4.3 percent and Delta rose 2.6 percent.\nFalling bond yields put pressure on banks, even as they help dividend-payers like household goods makers.\nGap plunged 13.6 percent after reporting a weak first quarter as its namesake brand continued to struggle.\nThe S&P 500 index fell 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,723.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average lost 34 points, or 0.1 percent, to 24,777. The Nasdaq composite rose 22 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,447.\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.93 percent.\n9:35 a.m.\nStocks are opening modestly lower on Wall Street as energy companies sink along with the price of crude oil.\nChevron lost 2.3 percent early Friday and Exxon Mobil gave up 1.9 percent.\nThat came as the price of U.S. crude fell 2.7 percent to $68.74 a barrel. Oil fell following reports that OPEC and Russia could start pumping more oil soon.\nGap dropped 10.2 percent after reporting earnings that fell short of analysts' estimates as sales fell in its flagship stores.\nThe S&P 500 index fell 6 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,720.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average lost 70 points, or 0.3 percent, to 24,739. The Nasdaq composite edged down 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,420.\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.94 percent.",
