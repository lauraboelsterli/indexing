(NYSE: NCI) announced today that Alma Angotti and Salvatore LaScala have been named co-leaders of its global investigations and compliance (GIC) practice. Both executives have extensive public and private sector experience detecting and preventing money laundering, corruption, and fraud at financial institutions and other companies around the world.\nAngotti has been a managing director at Navigant since 2014, and previously held senior enforcement positions at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Before joining Navigant in 2010 as a managing director, LaScala was executive director at Daylight Forensic and Advisory, managing director of KPMG’s forensic practice and, earlier in his career, a special agent with the Internal Revenue Service.\nNavigant’s GIC practice was previously led by Ellen Zimiles, managing director and leader of the firm's Financial Services Advisory and Compliance segment, which includes GIC. Angotti and LaScala were appointed co-leaders of GIC to allow Zimiles to focus more time on the growth and development of the segment.\n\"Having worked with both Sal and Alma for a number of years, I can attest to the invaluable leadership and expertise they will continue to provide our GIC practice,” said Zimiles. \"The evolving global regulatory landscape for financial institutions and other companies continues to pose new challenges, demanding trusted and experienced partners to make sense of complex compliance and investigatory issues. Alma and Sal have helped cement the GIC practice as an industry leader, and I am confident it will continue to grow and excel under their watch.\"\nAlma Angotti , GIC Co-Lead and Managing Director, Washington, DC\nA widely recognized anti-money laundering (AML) expert, Angotti has trained and advised the financial services industry as well as other regulators and government officials worldwide on AML and combating the financing of terrorism compliance. Angotti has counseled large global financial institutions and regional institutions in a variety of projects, including gap analyses, compliance program reviews, risk assessments, remediation efforts, and transaction reviews. At FinCEN and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), she designed and led the AML enforcement programs. As an enforcement attorney at the SEC, she conducted investigations involving a variety of matters under the federal securities laws.\nSalvatore LaScala , GIC Co-Lead and Managing Director, New York\nLaScala applies his 25 years of hands-on experience to conduct compliance reviews and investigations on behalf of financial institution clients responding to AML, Bank Secrecy Act, USA PATRIOT Act, and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulatory and law enforcement matters. He leads the GIC technology team and developed Navigant’s proprietary AML/OFAC/Customer Due Diligence (CDD) remediation tool, S.T.A.R., a technology platform that expedites historical transaction review and know your customer/CDD/enhanced due diligence file remediations. LaScala’s expertise also includes assisting clients with the selection, implementation, optimization, and validation of AML and OFAC compliance technology. He also provides AML managed services, whereby Navigant’s investigators work on-site or off-site to augment client teams.\nNavigant's Financial Services Advisory and Compliance practice advises banking, insurance, and investment management firms to enhance and streamline compliance, manage risk, safeguard reputations, and create competitive advantage. Navigant helps clients address issues related to regulatory compliance, risk management, process improvement, business model transformation, information technology, and outsourcing.\nAbout Navigant Consulting\nNavigant Consulting, Inc.
