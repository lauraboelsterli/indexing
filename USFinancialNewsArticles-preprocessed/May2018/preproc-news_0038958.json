Generated distributable cash flow (1) of $35.3 million, or $0.44 per common unit, and total cash flow from vessel operations (1) of $117.6 million in the first quarter of 2018. Since the beginning of 2018, the Partnership has taken delivery of four LNG carrier newbuildings, all on long-term charters, and one mid-sized LPG carrier newbuilding. Re-chartered the Arctic Spirit and Polar Spirit LNG carriers for four years and one year, respectively, and extended the charter on the Torben Spirit LNG carrier until December 2018. In May 2018, refinanced an outstanding debt facility of $58 million due in 2018 with a new $90 million long-term debt facility secured by seven mid-sized LPG carriers trading in the Teekay Multigas Pool.\nHAMILTON, Bermuda, May 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teekay GP L.L.C., the general partner of Teekay LNG Partners L.P. ( Teekay LNG or the Partnership ) (NYSE:TGP), today reported the Partnership’s results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31, 2017 (in thousands of U.S. Dollars) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Voyage revenues 115,306 126,307 101,180 Income from vessel operations 25,142 62,378 46,078 Equity income 26,724 2,992 5,887 Net (loss) income attributable to the partners and preferred unitholders (6,894 ) 39,877 29,057 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Total cash flow from vessel operations (CFVO) (1) 117,595 126,833 109,211 Distributable cash flow (DCF) (1) 35,341 52,054 43,227 Adjusted net income attributable to the partners and preferred unitholders (1) 22,058 33,972 21,093\n(1) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to “Definitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the Appendices to this release for definitions of these terms and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures as used in this release to the most directly comparable financial measures under United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). GAAP net (loss) income was impacted for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, by various items, including: a provision relating to a potential tax indemnification guarantee liability, the write-down of three conventional tankers in the first quarter of 2018, and restructuring charges incurred in association with the sale of a conventional tanker in the first quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by an increase in unrealized gains on derivative instruments.\nIn addition, GAAP net (loss) income and non-GAAP adjusted net income were positively impacted by the deliveries of seven liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) and three liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) carrier newbuildings between February 2017 and February 2018 and the commencement of short-term charter contracts for certain of the vessels in the Partnership’s 52 percent-owned joint venture with Marubeni Corporation (the Teekay LNG-Marubeni Joint Venture ). These increases were partially offset by the sale of a conventional tanker and an LPG carrier in the first quarter of 2018, lower rates earned in 2018 on two conventional tankers upon the expiration of their fixed-rate charter contracts in 2017, and lower rates earned in 2018 on six LPG carriers upon the termination of their previous charter contracts.\nCEO Commentary\n“The results for the first quarter of 2018 included certain non-recurring items relating to a tax indemnification guarantee liability and lower utilization on some of our LPG carriers as they are transitioning into our Teekay Multigas Pool,” commented Mark Kremin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Teekay Gas Group Ltd. “Despite these items, we continue to generate stable cash flows and I am pleased to report that since releasing our earnings in mid-February, we have made significant progress on various initiatives across the organization.”\n“We have continued to take delivery of vessels on schedule as part of the world’s largest LNG carrier newbuilding orderbook. In addition, we recently completed another 2018 refinancing and are making significant progress on the remaining refinancings, which are on track to be completed within the third quarter of 2018. Finally, the Partnership successfully re-chartered the Arctic Spirit and Polar Spirit LNG carriers for four years and one year, respectively, upon their redeliveries from Teekay Corporation in May and March of this year. These new charter contracts, which will service the fast-growing LNG import market in China, will add further stability to Teekay LNG’s market-leading portfolio of forward fixed-rate revenues. Looking ahead, we are excited by the strong LNG demand fundamentals and our position as one of the world’s largest LNG transportation companies.”\nMr. Kremin continued, “Over the past seven months, we have taken delivery of only seven vessels out of our total LNG newbuilding program of 18 LNG carriers and a regasification terminal and therefore, a significant portion of the incremental $310 million of annual cash flow from vessel operations we expect to generate from this program when fully delivered, has not yet been reflected in our financial results. As the remaining newbuildings deliver through early-2020, which are all contracted on long-term charters, we expect further cash flow growth and natural delevering of our balance sheet.”\nSummary of Recent Events\nLNG and LPG Mid-sized Carrier Newbuilding Deliveries\nIn January 2018, the Partnership’s 50 percent-owned joint venture with China LNG Shipping (Holdings) Limited ( China LNG ) (the Yamal LNG Joint Venture ) took delivery of its first ARC7 LNG carrier newbuilding, the Eduard Toll , which immediately commenced its 28-year charter contract with the Yamal LNG project.\nIn January 2018, the Partnership’s 30 percent-owned joint venture with China LNG and CETS (an affiliate of China National Offshore Oil Corporation ( CNOOC )) took delivery of one LNG carrier newbuilding, the Pan Americas , which immediately commenced its 20-year charter contract with Royal Dutch Shell ( Shell ).\nIn February and May 2018, the Partnership took delivery of two M-Type, Electronically Controlled, Gas Injection ( MEGI ) LNG carrier newbuildings, the Magdala and Myrina , both of which immediately commenced their respective charter contracts with Shell ranging between six and eight years in duration, plus extension options.\nIn March 2018, the Partnership’s 50 percent-owned joint venture with Exmar NV (the Exmar LPG Joint Venture ) took delivery of its seventh LPG carrier newbuilding, the Kapellen , which is currently trading in the spot market.\nRe-chartering Activities\nIn March 2018, upon the scheduled redelivery from Teekay Corporation, the Partnership re-chartered the Polar Spirit to an Asian-based energy company for a period of approximately three months and then subsequently secured forward employment beginning in July 2018 for nine months with a subsidiary of Petroliam Nasional Berhad ( Petronas ). In addition, the Partnership secured a four-year charter contract for the Arctic Spirit , also with a subsidiary of Petronas, which commenced immediately upon redelivery from Teekay Corporation in May 2018.\nIn May 2018, the Partnership agreed to a six-month charter extension of the Torben Spirit MEGI LNG carrier to a major energy company out to December 2018.\nTeekay Nakilat Capital Lease\nThe Partnership owns a 70 percent interest in Teekay Nakilat Corporation (the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture ), which wholly owns a subsidiary which was the lessee under three separate 30-year capital lease arrangements for three LNG carriers (the RasGas II LNG Carriers ). Under the terms of these leases, the lessor claimed tax depreciation on the capital expenditures incurred to acquire these vessels and paid the lessee an upfront benefit in the amount of $60.9 million at the lease inception. As is typical in these leasing arrangements, tax and change of law risks were assumed by the lessee, in this case the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture. Lease payments under the lease arrangements were based on certain tax and financial assumptions at the commencement of the leases in 2006 and subsequently adjusted to maintain the lessor's agreed after-tax margin. On December 22, 2014, the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture terminated the leases of the RasGas II LNG Carriers; however, it remained obligated to the lessor for changes in tax treatment.\nThe UK taxing authority ( HMRC ) has challenged the use by third parties of similar lease structures in the UK courts. One of those challenges was eventually decided in favor of HMRC, with the lessor and lessee choosing not to appeal further. This case concluded that capital allowances are not available to lessors. On the basis of this conclusion, HMRC is now asking lessees on other leases, including the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture, to accept that capital allowances are not available to their lessors. Under the terms of the lease, the lessor is entitled to make a determination that additional rentals are due, even where a court has not made a determination on whether capital allowances are available or where discussions are otherwise ongoing with HMRC on the matter (such that additional rental paid may be rebated in due course if the final tax position is not as determined by the lessor). On May 10, 2018, the lessor made a determination that additional rentals are due under the leases. As a result, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture has recognized an additional tax indemnification guarantee liability of $53.0 million for a total liability of $65.6 million (46.9 million GBP) as at March 31, 2018. The Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture is in discussions with HMRC in relation to the correct tax treatment to be applied to the leases and with the lessor regarding the timing and amount of this potential liability for additional rentals.\nDebt Financing Update\nIn May 2018, the Partnership refinanced an outstanding debt facility of $58 million maturing in 2018 and secured by five mid-sized LPG carriers, with a new $90 million long-term debt facility maturing in 2024 and secured by seven mid-sized LPG carriers.\nOperating Results\nThe following table highlights certain financial information for Teekay LNG’s two segments: the Liquefied Gas Segment and the Conventional Tanker Segment (please refer to the “Teekay LNG’s Fleet” section of this release below and Appendices C through E for further details).\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 (in thousands of U.S. Dollars) (unaudited) (unaudited) Liquefied\nGas\nSegment Conventional\nTanker\nSegment Total Liquefied\nGas\nSegment Conventional\nTanker\nSegment Total GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Voyage revenues 105,049 10,257 115,306 88,947 12,233 101,180 Income (loss) from vessel operations 44,545 (19,403 ) 25,142 43,336 2,742 46,078 Equity income 26,724 — 26,724 5,887 — 5,887 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON CFVO from consolidated vessels (i) 73,498 1,506 75,004 71,783 5,379 77,162 CFVO from equity-accounted vessels (i) 42,591 — 42,591 32,049 — 32,049 Total CFVO (i) 116,089 1,506 117,595 103,832 5,379 109,211\n(i) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to “Definitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the Appendices to this release for definitions of these terms and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures as used in this release to the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP. Liquefied Gas Segment\nIncome from vessel operations and CFVO from consolidated vessels for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, increased primarily due to the deliveries of four LNG carrier newbuildings, the Torben Spirit, Macoma, Murex and Magdala between February 2017 and February 2018. This increase was partially offset by lower rates earned by six of the Partnership's LPG carriers following the Partnership's termination of their charter contracts due to non-payment by the charterer.\nEquity income and CFVO from equity-accounted vessels increased for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher fleet utilization in the Teekay LNG-Marubeni Joint Venture since certain of the joint venture’s vessels commenced short-term charter contracts; the delivery of the Eduard Toll ARC 7 LNG carrier in January 2018 to the Yamal LNG Joint Venture; the deliveries of the Pan Asia and Pan Americas LNG carriers in October 2017 and January 2018, respectively, in the Partnership’s 30-percent owned joint venture with China LNG and CETS; and the deliveries of three LPG carriers in the Exmar LPG Joint Venture. These increases were partially offset by the sale of the Courcheville LPG carrier in January 2018; lower rates earned in the Exmar LPG Joint Venture; and the sale of the S/S Excelsior LNG carrier in the Partnership’s 50-percent owned joint venture with Exmar NV (the Excelsior Joint Venture ) in January 2018. Equity income was also positively impacted by an increase in net unrealized gains on designated and non-designated derivative instruments in our equity-accounted vessels and a gain recorded on the Partnership’s sale in January 2018 of its 50-percent owned investment in the Excelsior Joint Venture.\nConventional Tanker Segment\n(Loss) income from vessel operations and CFVO from consolidated vessels for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, were impacted primarily by the sale of the Teide Spirit in February 2018 and associated restructuring charges as a result of the sale; and lower rates earned in 2018 on the African Spirit and European Spirit upon the expiration of their fixed-rate charter contracts in 2017. Loss from vessel operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was also impacted by write-downs of the Alexander Spirit , African Spirit and European Spirit conventional tankers to their current estimated fair values.\nTeekay LNG's Fleet\nThe following table summarizes the Partnership’s fleet as of May 17, 2018, excluding the Partnership’s 30 percent interest in a regasification facility currently under construction:\nNumber of Vessels Owned and In-\nChartered Vessels (i) Newbuildings Total LNG Carrier Fleet 38 (ii) 11 (iii) 49 LPG/Multigas Carrier Fleet 27 (iv) 2 (v) 29 Conventional Tanker Fleet 4 (vi) — 4 Total 69 13 82\n(i) Owned vessels includes vessels accounted for as vessels related to capital leases.

(iv) The Partnership’s ownership interests in these vessels range from 50 percent to 99 percent. (v) The Partnership’s ownership interests in these newbuildings is 50 percent. (vi) Two of the Partnership's conventional tankers are classified as held for sale. Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Partnership had total liquidity of $463.5 million (comprised of $197.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $266.5 million in undrawn credit facilities).\nConference Call\nThe Partnership plans to host a conference call on Thursday, May 17, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss the results for the first quarter of 2018.

By accessing the webcast, which will be available on Teekay LNG’s website at www.teekay.com (the archive will remain on the website for a period of one year).\nAn accompanying First Quarter 2018 Earnings Presentation will also be available at www.teekay.com in advance of the conference call start time.\nAbout Teekay LNG Partners L.P.\nTeekay LNG Partners is one of the world's largest independent owners and operators of LNG carriers, providing LNG, LPG and crude oil marine transportation services primarily under long-term, fee-based charter contracts through its interests in 49 LNG carriers (including 11 newbuildings), 29 LPG/Multigas carriers (including two newbuildings) and four conventional tankers. The Partnership's interests in these vessels range from 20 to 100 percent. In addition, the Partnership owns a 30 percent interest in a regasification facility, which is currently under construction. Teekay LNG Partners is a publicly-traded master limited partnership formed by Teekay Corporation (NYSE: TK) as part of its strategy to expand its operations in the LNG and LPG shipping sectors.\nTeekay LNG Partners’ common units and preferred units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “TGP”, “TGP PR A” and “TGP PR B”, respectively.\nFor Investor Relations\nenquiries contact:\nRyan Hamilton\nTel: +1 (604) 609-2963\nWebsite: www.teekay.com\nDefinitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release includes various financial measures that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These non-GAAP financial measures, which include Cash Flow from Vessel Operations, Adjusted Net Income, and Distributable Cash Flow, are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these measures do not have standardized meanings across companies, and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Partnership believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Partnership’s financial performance, as does management.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCash Flow from Vessel Operations ( CFVO ) represents income from vessel operations before depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of in-process revenue contracts, vessel write-downs, losses on the sales of vessels and adjustments for direct financing leases to a cash basis, but includes realized gains or losses on a derivative charter contract. CFVO from Consolidated Vessels represents CFVO from vessels that are consolidated on the Partnership’s financial statements. CFVO from Equity-Accounted Vessels represents the Partnership’s proportionate share of CFVO from its equity-accounted vessels. The Partnership does not control its equity-accounted vessels and as a result, the Partnership does not have the unilateral ability to determine whether the cash generated by its equity-accounted vessels is retained within the entities in which the Partnership holds the equity-accounted investments or distributed to the Partnership and other owners. In addition, the Partnership does not control the timing of such distributions to the Partnership and other owners. Consequently, readers are cautioned when using total CFVO as a liquidity measure as the amount contributed from CFVO from Equity-Accounted Vessels may not be available to the Partnership in the periods such CFVO is generated by its equity-accounted vessels. CFVO is a non-GAAP financial measure used by certain investors and management to measure the operational financial performance of companies. Please refer to Appendices D and E of this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to income from vessel operations and income from vessel operations of equity-accounted vessels, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures reflected in the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted Net Income excludes items of income or loss from GAAP net (loss) income that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of the Partnership’s financial results. The Partnership believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Partnership’s financial performance, as does management. Please refer to Appendix A of this release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net (loss) income, and refer to footnote (3) of the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income for a reconciliation of adjusted equity income to equity income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure reflected in the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.\nDistributable Cash Flow ( DCF ) represents GAAP net income adjusted for an additional tax indemnification guarantee liability, depreciation and amortization expense, deferred income tax and other non-cash items, estimated maintenance capital expenditures, unrealized gains and losses from non-designated derivative instruments, ineffectiveness for derivative instruments designated as hedges for accounting purposes, distributions relating to equity financing of newbuilding installments, distributions relating to preferred units, adjustments for direct financing leases to a cash basis and foreign exchange related items, including the Partnership’s proportionate share of such items in equity-accounted for investments. Maintenance capital expenditures represent those capital expenditures required to maintain over the long-term the operating capacity of, or the revenue generated by, the Partnership’s capital assets. DCF is a quantitative standard used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community and by management to assist in evaluating financial performance. Please refer to Appendix B of this release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure reflected in the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.\nTeekay LNG Partners L.P. Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income (in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except units outstanding) Three Months Ended March 31, December 31 March 31, 2018 2017 2017 (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) Voyage revenues 115,306 126,307 101,180 Voyage expenses (5,801 ) (4,303 ) (1,437 ) Vessel operating expenses (28,467 ) (27,026 ) (23,388 ) Depreciation and amortization (29,267 ) (27,651 ) (26,120 ) General and administrative expenses (6,571 ) (4,949 ) (4,157 ) Write-down of vessels (1) (18,662 ) — — Restructuring charges (2) (1,396 ) — — Income from vessel operations 25,142 62,378 46,078 Equity income (3) 26,724 2,992 5,887 Interest expense (24,706 ) (23,333 ) (16,988 ) Interest income 914 880 854 Realized and unrealized gain on non-designated derivative instruments (4) 8,001 3,066 1,187 Foreign currency exchange loss (5) (1,273 ) (2,436 ) (3,568 ) Other (expense) income (6) (52,582 ) 424 391 Net (loss) income before tax expense (17,780 ) 43,971 33,841 Income tax (expense) recovery (779 ) 319 (157 ) Net (loss) income (18,559 ) 44,290 33,684 Non-controlling interest in net (loss) income (11,665 ) 4,413 4,627 Preferred unitholders’ interest in net (loss) income 6,425 5,541 2,812 General Partner’s interest in net (loss) income (272 ) 687 525 Limited partners’ interest in net (loss) income (13,047 ) 33,649 25,720 Weighted-average number of common units outstanding: • Basic 79,637,607 79,626,819 79,590,153 • Diluted 79,637,607 79,839,231 79,690,391 Total number of common units outstanding at end of period 79,687,499 79,626,819 79,626,819\n(1) The African Spirit and European Spirit were classified as vessels held for sale upon the expiration of their time-charter contracts in 2017. The Partnership recorded an aggregate write-down of $5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 on these two conventional tankers since the estimated fair values of these vessels have decreased. In addition, the Partnership recorded a write-down of $13.0 million relating to the Alexander Spirit conventional tanker to its estimated fair value, using an appraised value. This was as a result of changes in the Partnership's expectations of the vessel's future opportunities once its current contract ends in 2019. (2) In February 2018, the Teide Spirit, was sold and as a result of this sale, the Partnership recorded restructuring charges of $1.4 million relating to seafarer severance costs. (3) The Partnership’s proportionate share of items within equity income as identified in Appendix A of this release is detailed in the table below. By excluding these items from equity income, the Partnership believes the resulting adjusted equity income is a normalized amount that can be used to better evaluate the financial performance of the Partnership’s equity-accounted investments. Adjusted equity income is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31 March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Equity income 26,724 2,992 5,887 Proportionate share of unrealized gain on non-designated derivative instruments (8,221 ) (4,404 ) (1,784 ) Proportionate share of ineffective portion of hedge-accounted interest rate swaps (3,259 ) 566 (543 ) Proportionate share of write-down and loss on sale of vessel 257 5,500 — Gain on sale of equity-accounted investment (5,563 ) — — Proportionate share of other items 128 191 30 Equity income adjusted for items in Appendix A 10,066 4,845 3,590\n(4) The realized (losses) gains on non-designated derivative instruments relate to the amounts the Partnership actually paid or received to settle non-designated derivative instruments and the unrealized gains (losses) on non-designated derivative instruments relate to the change in fair value of such non-designated derivative instruments, as detailed in the table below:\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31 March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Realized (losses) gains relating to: Interest rate swap agreements (4,478 ) (5,012 ) (4,675 ) Interest rate swaption agreements termination — — 395 Toledo Spirit time-charter derivative contract 309 152 15 (4,169 ) (4,860 ) (4,265 ) Unrealized gains (losses) relating to: Interest rate swap agreements 11,898 8,182 4,302 Interest rate swaption agreements 2 518 30 Toledo Spirit time-charter derivative contract 270 (774 ) 1,120 12,170 7,926 5,452 Total realized and unrealized gains on non-designated derivative instruments 8,001 3,066 1,187\n(5) For accounting purposes, the Partnership is required to revalue all foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities based on the prevailing exchange rates at the end of each reporting period. This revaluation does not affect the Partnership’s cash flows or the calculation of distributable cash flow, but results in the recognition of unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.\nForeign currency exchange loss includes realized losses relating to the amounts the Partnership paid to settle the Partnership’s non-designated cross-currency swaps that were entered into as economic hedges in relation to the Partnership’s Norwegian Kroner ( NOK ) denominated unsecured bonds. Foreign currency exchange loss also includes unrealized gains (losses) relating to the change in fair value of such derivative instruments, partially offset by unrealized gains (losses) on the revaluation of the NOK bonds as detailed in the table below:\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31 March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Realized losses on cross-currency swaps (1,384 ) (2,125 ) (3,537 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on cross-currency swaps 22,334 (9,081 ) 2,699 Unrealized (losses) gains on revaluation of NOK bonds (17,487 ) 7,760 (606 )\n(6) The Partnership owns a 70 percent interest in the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture, which wholly owns a subsidiary which was the lessee under three separate 30-year capital lease arrangements with a third party for the RasGas II LNG Carriers. Under the terms of these leases, the lessor claimed tax depreciation on the capital expenditures it incurred to acquire these vessels and paid the lessee an upfront benefit in the amount of $60.9 million at the lease inception. As is typical in these leasing arrangements, tax and change of law risks were assumed by the lessee, in this case the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture. Lease payments under the lease arrangements were based on certain tax and financial assumptions at the commencement of the leases in 2006 and subsequently adjusted to maintain the lessor's agreed after-tax margin. On December 22, 2014, the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture terminated the leases of the RasGas II LNG Carriers; however, it remained obligated to the lessor for changes in tax treatment.\nHMRC has been challenging the use by third parties of similar lease structures in the UK courts. One of those challenges was eventually decided in favor of HMRC, with the lessor and lessee choosing not to appeal further. This case concluded that capital allowances are not available to the lessor. On the basis of this conclusion, HMRC is now asking lessees on other leases, including the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture, to accept that capital allowances are not available to their lessors. Under the terms of the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture lease, the lessor is entitled to make a determination that additional rentals are due, even where a court has not made a determination on whether capital allowances are available or where discussions are otherwise ongoing with HMRC on the matter (such that additional rentals paid may be rebated in due course if the final tax position is not as determined by the lessor). On May 10, 2018, the lessor made a determination that additional rentals are due under the leases.

(2) See Note 2 to the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income included in this release for further details. (3) Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains primarily relate to the Partnership’s revaluation of all foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities based on the prevailing exchange rate at the end of each reporting period and unrealized (gains) losses on the cross-currency swaps economically hedging the Partnership’s NOK bonds. This amount excludes the realized losses relating to the cross-currency swaps for the NOK bonds. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income included in this release for further details. (4) Reflects the gain on sale by the Partnership of its investment in the Excelsior Joint Venture (which owns one regasification unit) , unrealized gains due to changes in the mark-to-market value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, any ineffectiveness for derivative instruments designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and write-down and loss on sale of vessel within the Partnership’s equity-accounted investments. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income included in this release for further details.

(7) Items affecting net (loss) income include items from the Partnership’s consolidated non-wholly-owned subsidiaries. The specific items affecting net (loss) income are analyzed to determine whether any of the amounts originated from a consolidated non-wholly-owned subsidiary. Each amount that originates from a consolidated non-wholly-owned subsidiary is multiplied by the non-controlling interests’ percentage share in this subsidiary to arrive at the non-controlling interests’ share of the amount. The amount identified as “non-controlling interests’ share of items listed above” in the table above is the cumulative amount of the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the other specific items affecting net (loss) income listed in the table.\nTeekay LNG Partners L.P.

The additional tax indemnification guarantee liability relates to an up-front benefit on the RasGas II LNG Carriers leasing arrangements that the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture initially received which is now expected to be repaid to the lessor. From a DCF perspective, the Partnership's application of its 70 percent share of the benefit related to the RasGas II LNG Carriers leasing arrangements had the effect of increasing DCF by a total of $3.8 million from the delivery of these vessels up to March 31, 2018 on a cumulative basis. This was a result of the Partnership adjusting its estimated maintenance capital expenditures on the RasGas II LNG Carriers for the up-front benefit it received and amortizing this benefit over the life of the vessels. (2) The estimated maintenance capital expenditures relating to the Partnership’s share of equity-accounted joint ventures were $8.2 million and $7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTeekay LNG Partners L.P.
