FILE PHOTO: FA Cup Final - Chelsea vs Manchester United - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - May 19, 2018 Chelsea fans shield their eyes from the sun during the match REUTERS/Andrew Yates/File Photo\nKhan, owner of the NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars, wants to buy the stadium in a deal that could be worth up to 1 billion pounds ($1.40 billion).\nIn a letter answering questions from FA Council members, Clarke outlined some of the detail of the bid and offered reassurances that the iconic venue, opened in 2007 after being built on the site of the old Wembley Stadium, would remain at the heart of English football.\n“It’s important to remember that The FA did not own Wembley Stadium before 1999, so this is not a historic situation we are unwinding,” Clarke said.\n“There are very few national governing bodies that own and operate their own stadiums.

The emotional reactions and arguments are entirely understandable and that is why it is important that any owner of Wembley Stadium respects its role as the home of English football.”\nClarke said that while Wembley holds a special place in English football, many people regard the “soul” of the English game as being the “clubs, leagues and volunteers”.\nThe FA, Clarke says, has funds in place to repay the remaining debt on Wembley by 2024, after which the organisation would be £3 million pounds a year better off.
