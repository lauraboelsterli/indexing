The addition of RetailMeNot Rx Saver helps RetailMeNot consumers save on more of the things they need, making this another step toward RetailMeNot becoming the ultimate savings destination.\"\nLowestMed, founded in 2009, was one of the first websites and mobile apps to give consumers the ability to compare prescription prices at nearby pharmacies.

Consumers simply enter the name of a prescription drug, and RetailMeNot Rx Saver shows how much that medication costs at different nearby pharmacies after discounts are applied.\nVisit RetailMeNot Rx Saver online at www.retailmenot.com/RxSaver , or find it in the App Store and Google Play.\n\"Prescription drugs are expensive, and Americans have to fill medications they aren't necessarily prepared to pay for on a daily basis,\" said Brad Bangerter, CEO and founder, LowestMed. \"RetailMeNot Rx Saver allows consumers to compare nearby pharmacy prices and get coupons to help alleviate the burden associated with those costs.\"\nThe savings found on prescription drugs with RetailMeNot Rx Saver is another way RetailMeNot fulfills its mission to be the leading savings destination.
