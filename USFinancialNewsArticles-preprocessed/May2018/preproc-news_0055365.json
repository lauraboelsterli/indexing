REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\nRBS said it would no longer directly finance new coal-fired power stations or thermal coal mines, oil sands or Arctic oil projects and unsustainable vegetation or peatland clearance projects.\nIt also said it would no longer lend money to mining companies that generate more than 40 percent of their revenues from thermal coal or power companies that generate more than 40 percent of their electricity from coal. The previous threshold for both was 65 percent.\nIn April, HSBC also said it would stop funding new coal power plants, oil sands and arctic drilling, following on from other large banks such as ING and BNP Paribas.
