Qatar Electricity and Water declined 4.1 percent and heavyweight Industries Qatar ended 3.9 percent lower.\nBoth QNB and QIB had risen sharply since mid-May, when equity index compiler MSCI said it would increase their weightings at the end of this month after the companies increased their foreign ownership ceilings.\nOn Wednesday, buying by passive funds tracking the weightings continued but many other investors took profits, accounting for the big trading volumes.\nMeanwhile, the Dubai index slipped 0.5 percent, dragged down by property and banking shares such as DAMAC , which fell 2.5 percent.\nThe Dubai index dropped back below the level where it was trading at the start of last week when the United Arab Emirates announced it would grant long-term visas of up to 10 years to some foreigners, and raise the ceiling for foreign ownership of companies in some sectors.\nThe announcement triggered a brief rally in the stock market last week because of hopes it would encourage residential real estate buying by foreigners. But details of the measures have not been revealed, and investors are uncertain whether they will have a major economic impact.\nBucking the downtrend, DXB Entertainments, which owns and operates theme parks in Dubai, rose 4.1 percent.\nAbu Dhabi’s index ended 0.4 percent lower, weighed down by developer Aldar Properties, which fell 1.9 percent.\nThe Saudi index edged up 0.1 percent as travel company Al Tayyar rose 1.0 percent after saying it had repaid early, using its own resources, a 307 million riyal ($81.9 million) long-term loan that had been due to mature between 2019 and 2021.\nOutside the Gulf, Egypt’s benchmark index dropped 1.4 percent, weighed down by property firm Talat Mostafa , down 6.3 percent and investment bank EFG Hermes , down 4.0 percent.\nSAUDI ARABIA * The index gained 0.1 percent to 8,010 points. DUBAI * The index fell 0.5 percent to 2,909 points. ABU DHABI * The index fell 0.4 percent to 4,557 points. QATAR * The index fell 2.3 percent to 8,916 points. KUWAIT * The index lost 0.2 percent to 4,704 points. BAHRAIN * The index fell 0.2 percent to 1,261 points. OMAN * The index edged down 0.01 percent to 4,597 points. EGYPT * The index fell 1.4 percent to 16,760 points.
