Core FFO, Stabilized Rental NOI Margin and Stabilized Rental Core FFO are non-GAAP performance measures that Front Yard believes are useful to assist investors in gaining an understanding of the trends and operating metrics for Front Yard’s core business. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, Front Yard’s reported results under U.S. GAAP.\nThe following provides related definitions of, and a reconciliation of Front Yard’s U.S. GAAP results to, FFO, Core FFO, Stabilized Rental Core FFO and Stabilized Rental NOI Margin for the periods presented:\nStabilized Rental: We define a property as stabilized once it has been renovated and then initially leased or available for rent for a period greater than 90 days. All other homes are considered non-stabilized. Homes are considered stabilized even after subsequent resident turnover. However, homes may be removed from the stabilized home portfolio and placed in the non-stabilized home portfolio due to renovation during the home lifecycle or because they are identified for sale.\nFFO, Core FFO, Stabilized Rental FFO and Stabilized Rental Core FFO: Funds from Operations (“FFO”) is a supplemental performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) used by industry analysts and investors in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons between periods and among peer companies. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) as GAAP net income or loss excluding gains or losses from sales of property, impairment charges on real estate and depreciation and amortization on real estate assets adjusted for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments.\nWe believe that FFO of our total operations and of our stabilized rental portfolio (“Stabilized Rental FFO”) is a meaningful supplemental measure of our overall operating performance and the operating performance of our stabilized rental portfolio, respectively, because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation. Because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management considers FFO and Stabilized Rental FFO an appropriate supplemental performance measure because it excludes historical cost depreciation, impairment charges and gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes from GAAP net income. By excluding depreciation, impairment and gains or losses on sales of real estate, FFO and Stabilized Rental FFO provide measures of our returns on our investments in real estate assets. However, because both FFO and Stabilized Rental FFO exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes, all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations, the utility of FFO and Stabilized Rental FFO as measures of our performance is limited.\nOur Core FFO and Stabilized Rental Core FFO begin with FFO and Stabilized Rental FFO, respectively, and are adjusted for share-based compensation; acquisition fees and costs; non-cash interest expense related to deferred debt issuance costs, amortization of loan discounts and mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate derivatives and other non-comparable items, as applicable. We believe that Core FFO and Stabilized Rental Core FFO, when used in conjunction with the results of operations under GAAP, are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as FFO and Stabilized Rental FFO and are further helpful as they provide a consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period.\nAlthough management believes that FFO, Core FFO, Stabilized Rental FFO and Stabilized Rental Core FFO increase our comparability with other companies, these measures may not be comparable to the FFO or Core FFO of other companies because 1) other companies may adopt a definition of FFO other than the NAREIT definition, may apply a different method of determining Core FFO or may utilize metrics other than or in addition to Core FFO and 2) in the case of Stabilized Rental FFO and Stabilized Rental Core FFO, we base these measures only on our stabilized rental portfolio.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to full-company Core FFO:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 GAAP net loss $ (27,350 ) Adjustments to determine FFO: Real estate depreciation and amortization 19,190 Selling costs and impairment 7,575 Net loss on real estate and mortgage loans 1,634 FFO 1,049 Adjustments to determine Core FFO: Acquisition fees and costs 33 Non-cash interest expense 1,526 Share-based compensation (414 ) Other adjustments 307 Core FFO $ 2,501 Weighted average common stock outstanding - basic and diluted 53,454,063 FFO per share - basic and diluted $ 0.02 Core FFO per share - basic and diluted $ 0.05 The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Stabilized Rental Core FFO:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 GAAP net loss $ (27,350 ) Adjustments to determine Stabilized Rental FFO: Net loss on real estate and mortgage loans 1,634 Residential property operating expenses on non-stabilized rentals and REOs 2,972 Real estate depreciation and amortization 19,190 Selling costs and impairment 7,575 Mortgage loan servicing costs 355 Other expenses allocable to mortgage loans, non-stabilized rentals and REOs 2,130 Stabilized Rental FFO 6,506 Adjustments to determine Stabilized Rental Core FFO: Conversion fees 63 Non-cash interest expense 1,346 Share-based compensation (307 ) Other adjustments 722 Stabilized Rental Core FFO $ 8,330 Weighted average common stock outstanding - basic and diluted 53,454,063 Stabilized Rental Core FFO per share - basic and diluted $ 0.16 Stabilized Rental Net Operating Income (“Stabilized Rental NOI”) and Stabilized Rental NOI Margin: Stabilized Rental NOI is a non-GAAP supplemental measure that we define as rental revenues less residential property operating expenses of the stabilized rental properties in our rental portfolio. We define Stabilized Rental NOI Margin as Stabilized Rental NOI divided by rental revenues.\nWe consider Stabilized Rental NOI and Stabilized Rental NOI Margin to be meaningful supplemental measures of operating performance because they reflect the operating performance of our stabilized properties without allocation of corporate level overhead or general and administrative costs, acquisition fees and other similar costs and provide insight to the ongoing operations of our business. These measures should be used only as supplements to and not substitutes for net income or loss or net cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. These net operating income measures should not be used as indicators of funds available to fund cash needs, including distributions and dividends. Although we may use these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to other REITs, not all REITs may calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same way, and there is no assurance that our calculation is comparable with that of other REITs. While management believes that our calculations are reasonable, there is no standard calculation methodology for Stabilized Rental NOI Margin, and different methodologies could produce materially different results.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Stabilized Rental NOI and Stabilized Rental NOI Margin:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 GAAP net loss $ (27,350 ) Adjustments: Net loss on real estate and mortgage loans 1,634 Residential property operating expenses on non-stabilized rentals and REOs 2,972 Real estate depreciation and amortization 19,190 Acquisition fees and costs 33 Selling costs and impairment 7,575 Mortgage loan servicing costs 355 Interest expense 16,063 Share-based compensation (414 ) General and administrative 2,673 Management fees to AAMC 3,790 Other income (576 ) Stabilized Rental NOI $ 25,945 Rental revenues $ 39,765 Stabilized Rental NOI Margin 65.2 %\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robin N.
