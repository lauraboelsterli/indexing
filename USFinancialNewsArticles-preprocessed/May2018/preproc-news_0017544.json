SunTel co-founders Gary Jackson and Don Jackson continued to lead SunTel after the acquisition, and will stay in their leadership roles following the rebranding campaign.\n“The integration with CBTS has allowed SunTel to deliver a new set of cloud-based solutions to our existing customer base, and to keep growing our footprint throughout the Midwest,” said co-founder Gary Jackson. “The rebranding from SunTel to CBTS is a natural next step as we focus on delivering best-in-class customer service to our clients.”\nCBTS serves enterprise and midmarket clients across the United States and Canada. CBTS is organized into four practices – Communications, Cloud, Infrastructure, and Consulting Services - and includes 20 offices, access to 50 data centers, and more than 1,500 employees serving over 2,400 customers internationally.\nCBTS helps companies of all sizes – including dozens of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 customers – across all verticals navigate and leverage technology to support growth objectives, reduce costs, and deliver measurable business outcomes.\n“SunTel has always focused on providing solutions and building long-term relationships with customers,” said CBTS President Scott Seger. “That client-first approach made SunTel a natural fit with CBTS, and we are committed to continuing that tradition as SunTel transitions into the CBTS brand.”\nAbout CBTS\nCBTS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Bell (NYSE:CBB) that serves enterprise and midmarket clients in all industries across the United States and Canada.
