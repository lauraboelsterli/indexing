    "text": "JAKARTA, May 24 (Reuters) - Indonesia central bankâ€™s newly minted governor Perry Warjiyo said it will focus its policies in the near term on maintaining currency stability, while remaining committed to supporting economic growth.\nAfter his inauguration on Thursday, Warjiyo told reporters that BI will continue to intervene in currency and bond markets to stabilise the rupiah, and so far this year has bought 50 trillion rupiah ($3.54 billion) worth of government bonds from foreign sellers.\nMeanwhile, he said the central bank will support growth with marcroprudential policies, improve the payment system and deepen the financial market.
