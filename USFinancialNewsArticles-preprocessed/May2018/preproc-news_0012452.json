FILE PHOTO: Jaguar cars are seen parked in rows at the Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham, central England, January 19, 2009. REUTERS/Darren Staples/File Photo\nRegistrations last month came to 1.22 million cars, as many markets saw a higher number of selling days than in April 2017, the consulting firm said on Friday. Its numbers are based on national data and estimates for some smaller markets.\nThe seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of western European sales rose by a more modest 1.1 percent from 14.27 million cars in March to 14.42 million in April - still below the average 14.72 million rate for the year to date.\n“The results were solid rather than spectacular,” said LMC analyst David Oakley.\nSales rose 6.5 percent in Italy, 8 percent in Germany, 9 percent in France, 10.4 percent in Britain and 12.3 percent in Spain, according to data published in recent days.
