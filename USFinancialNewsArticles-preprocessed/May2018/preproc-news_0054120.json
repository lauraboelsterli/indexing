    "text": "May 24 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers International Union (UAW) has filed a complaint accusing Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk of illegally threatening to take away benefits from workers who join the union.\nThe UAW, which is seeking to represent workers at Tesla’s facility in Fremont, California, filed the complaint with the National Labor Relations Board late Wednesday.\nMusk in a tweet on Monday said there was nothing stopping Tesla workers from joining a union, but “why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?” (Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York)\n ",
