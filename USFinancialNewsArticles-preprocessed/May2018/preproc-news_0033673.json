    "text": "Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Results Exceed Guidance\nAppointment of Anne MacDonald to Board of Directors\nIRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BOOT) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the 13-week fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nNet sales increased to $170.8 million, driven by a 12.1% increase in same store sales, with double-digit same store sales growth in both retail stores and online. This compares to $163.0 million in the prior-year period, which was a 14-week quarter. Net income was $6.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share (and compared to adjusted net income of $3.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share) in the prior-year period, which was a 14-week quarter.\nFor the 52-week fiscal year ended March 31, 2018:\nNet sales increased 7.6% to $677.9 million, compared to $629.8 million in the prior year, which was a 53-week year. Same store sales increased 5.2%. Net income was $28.9 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share (and compared to adjusted net income of $14.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share) in the prior-year, which was a 53-week year. Added 9 stores through new openings and acquisitions and closed two underperforming stores, bringing the total count at fiscal year-end to 226 stores.\nNote: Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure. An explanation of the computation of this measure and a reconciliation to GAAP net income is included below. See also \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nThe Company announced that Anne MacDonald, an experienced branding and marketing executive, has been appointed to its Board of Directors. Ms. MacDonald will replace Fred Simmons, who has resigned from the Board.\nOver the course of her career, Ms. MacDonald has served as Chief Marketing Officer for several global companies including Macy’s, Citigroup, and Travelers Insurance. In addition to her executive experience, Ms. MacDonald has had extensive agency experience advising iconic brands including, Procter & Gamble, AT&T and Pizza Hut. Presently she works as a strategic advisor to several clients through her own firm.\nJim Conroy, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are very pleased with the top-line momentum our business experienced across most of the country both in store and online during the fourth quarter. Our investments in merchandising, marketing and omni-channel fueled double-digit gains in retail comparable sales and helped return our e-commerce business to double-digit growth as well. Importantly, we held true to our full-price selling model, which combined with a meaningful increase in our exclusive brand penetration, yielded a 90 basis point improvement in merchandise margin. Our strong sales and margin performance enabled us to exceed our earnings guidance for the quarter and further solidify our industry leading position.”\nMr. Conroy continued, “I am equally excited about the business in April and May as our double-digit same store sales growth has continued. We are looking forward to fiscal 2019 and the opportunities we have to drive profitable growth, re-accelerate store expansion, build out our multi-brand e-commerce strategy, and further develop our exclusive brands.”\nRegarding the change in the Board of Directors, Jim Conroy commented, “I am excited to welcome Anne MacDonald to the Board of Directors. She brings a world-class marketing background that will enhance our ability to develop both the Boot Barn brand and each of our exclusive brands. Anne’s combination of company and agency experience will further enhance the composition of our Board as we continue to grow the Boot Barn business across the country. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Fred Simmons for his contributions since December 2011. Fred’s guidance and strategic counsel have helped lead the growth of Boot Barn into a national lifestyle brand with revenue growing 300% during his tenure. On a personal note, Fred has been inspiring, motivational and uplifting to me and the entire management team.”\nOperating Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nNet sales increased to $170.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 (13 weeks), from $163.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 (14 weeks). Net sales increased due to a 12.1% increase in same store sales, the sales contribution from 9 stores added over the past twelve months, and sales from the Country Outfitter site that was acquired in February 2017. Sales growth was partially offset by sales from the 14th week in the prior-year period. Gross profit was $52.9 million, or 31.0% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to gross profit of $49.3 million, or 30.3% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Gross profit increased primarily due to increased sales and an increase in merchandise margin rate. Gross profit rate increased primarily as a result of a 90 basis point increase in merchandise margin rate partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in buying and occupancy costs. The higher merchandise margin rate was driven by more full-price selling, fewer promotions, and increased exclusive brand penetration. The increase in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales resulted from fixed costs deleveraging in a 13-week quarter in the current year compared to a 14-week quarter in the prior-year period. Selling, general and administrative expense was $41.6 million, or 24.4% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $41.3 million, or 25.3% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Excluding $1.2 million of store impairment charges in the prior-year period, adjusted selling, general and administrative expense was $40.1 million, or 24.6% of net sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of increased sales, compensation expense and additional costs for both new and acquired stores. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased as a result of expense leverage on higher sales. Income from operations increased 39.9%, to $11.3 million, or 6.6% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 (13 weeks), compared to $8.1 million, or 4.9% of net sales, in the prior-year period (14 weeks). Excluding the impact of the store impairment charges in the prior-year period, adjusted income from operations was $9.2 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Net income was $6.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 (13 weeks), compared to $2.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the prior-year period (14 weeks). Excluding the impact of the store impairment charges, adjusted net income was $3.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, which was a 14-week quarter. Net income per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 includes approximately $0.06 per share of tax benefit related to stock option exercises and $0.02 per share related to improved tax rate, partially offset by $0.01 per share of secondary offering costs.\nA reconciliation of adjusted selling, general and administrative expense, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, each a non-GAAP financial measure, to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nOperating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2018\nNet sales for fiscal year 2018 (52 weeks) increased to $677.9 million from $629.8 million in fiscal year 2017 (53 weeks). Net sales increased due to a 5.2% increase in same store sales, the sales contribution from 9 stores added over the past twelve months and sales from the Country Outfitter site that was acquired in February 2017. Sales growth was partially offset by sales from the 53 rd week in the prior-year. Gross profit for fiscal year 2018 was $207.9 million, or 30.7% of net sales, compared to gross profit of $189.9 million, or 30.1% of net sales, in fiscal year 2017. Gross profit increased primarily due to increased sales. Gross profit rate increased as a result of a 50 basis point increase in merchandise margin rate. Selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2018 was $161.7 million, or 23.8% of net sales, compared to $152.1 million, or 24.1% of net sales, in fiscal year 2017. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expense in fiscal year 2017 was $150.9 million, or 24.0% of net sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of additional costs associated with the opening of new and acquired stores over the last twelve months, compensation expense and incremental operating costs associated with the growth in the business. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased as a result of expense leverage on higher sales. Income from operations for fiscal year 2018 (52 weeks) increased 22.3%, to $46.3 million, or 6.8% of net sales, compared to $37.8 million, or 6.0% of net sales, in fiscal year 2017 (53 weeks). Adjusted income from operations in fiscal year 2017 was $39.0 million, or 6.2% of net sales. Net income for fiscal year 2018 (52 weeks) was $28.9 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to $14.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2017 (53 weeks). Adjusted net income in fiscal year 2017 was $14.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in fiscal year 2018 includes approximately $0.25 per share of tax benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, approximately $0.06 related to stock option exercises and $0.04 related to improved tax rate from tax reform. The Company added 9 stores through new openings and acquisitions and closed two underperforming stores, bringing the total count at year-end to 226 stores.\nA reconciliation of adjusted selling, general and administrative expense, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, each a non-GAAP financial measure, to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data. See also \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nBalance Sheet Highlights as of March 31, 2018\nCash of $9.0 million. Average inventory per store increased 4.4% on a comp store basis compared to April 1, 2017. Total net debt of $204.2 million, including $21.0 million drawn under the revolving credit facility.\nFiscal Year 2019 Outlook\nFor the fiscal year ending March 30, 2019 the Company expects:\nTo open 23 new stores. Same store sales growth of mid-single digits. Income from operations between $52.5 million and $56.5 million. Interest expense of $17.0 million to $18.0 million. Net income of $26.2 million to $29.2 million. Net income per diluted share of $0.92 to $1.02 based on 28.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor the fiscal first quarter ending June 30, 2018 the Company expects:\nSame store sales growth of approximately 10%. Net income per diluted share of $0.10 to $0.12 based on 28.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss the financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 is scheduled for today, May 15, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET (1:30 p.m. PT).

These non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. The Company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with transparency and help illustrate financial results by excluding items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company’s core operating results, thereby providing a better baseline for analyzing trends in the underlying business. See the table at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of adjusted selling, general and administrative expense to selling, general and administrative expense, adjusted income from operations to income from operations, adjusted net income to net income, and adjusted net income per diluted share to net income per diluted share.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements refer to our current expectations and projections relating to, by way of example and without limitation, our financial condition, liquidity, profitability, results of operations, margins, plans, objectives, strategies, future performance, business and industry. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as \"anticipate\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"project\", \"plan“, \"intend\", \"believe\", “may”, “might”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “can have”, “likely”, “outlook” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events, but not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that the Company’s management has made in light of their industry experience and on their perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you consider this press release, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company’s control) and assumptions. These risks, uncertainties and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the following: decreases in consumer spending due to declines in consumer confidence, local economic conditions or changes in consumer preferences and the Company’s ability to effectively execute on its growth strategy; the failure to maintain and enhance its strong brand image; to compete effectively; to maintain good relationships with its key suppliers; and to improve and expand its exclusive product offerings. The Company discusses the foregoing risks and other risks in greater detail under the heading “Risk factors” in the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect the Company’s actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Because of these factors, the Company cautions that you should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for the Company to predict those events or how they may affect the Company. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made.
