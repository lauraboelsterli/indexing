    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” A U.S. appeals court says a shoe made by American footwear giant Skechers is nearly identical to an iconic Adidas shoe and likely confuses consumers about their manufacturers.\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld a lower court ruling blocking Skechers from selling its Onix shoe.\nAdidas argued in a lawsuit that the Onix was an illegal rip-off of its Stan Smith tennis shoe.\nThe 9th Circuit judges said the shoes had only minor differences, and there was evidence that Skechers intended to confuse consumers.\nAn email to Skechers spokeswoman Jennifer Clay seeking comment was not immediately returned.\nThe 9th Circuit allowed Skechers to sell its Cross Court shoe, saying Adidas failed to show irreparable harm from the sale of those shoes.",
