FILE PHOTO: Basque separatist group ETA supporters wear masks to cover their faces as they hold up an ETA flag and raise their fists next to the coffin of alleged ETA leader Ignacia Ceberio during her funeral in her hometown of Lizarza June 7, 1998. REUTERS/Pablo Sanchez/File photo\nIn a letter read out at the headquarters of a Geneva-based conflict resolution group, ETA, founded to fight for an independent state in northern Spain and southern France, said its journey had ended.\n“We have made this, our last decision, in order to foster a new historical phase,” said the letter, signed Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA - Basque Country and Freedom in English).\n“ETA was born from the people and now it dissolves back into the people,” said the letter, which was read by David Harland, executive director of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue.\nIn a letter dated April 16 and made public on Wednesday on news website El Diario, the group said it had completely dismantled all its structures. El Diario said the letter had been sent to Basque organisations including trade unions.\nThe group is due to formalise its dissolution at an official event in France on Friday.
