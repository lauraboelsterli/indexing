    "text": "LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - British defence company BAE Systems stuck to its forecast for flat earnings this year and said there were good prospects for adding to its order backlog later this year.\nBAE said in a statement ahead of its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday that in 2018 it had opportunities to win contracts in the U.S. on amphibious combat vehicles and in Australia to help build military ships.\nThe company added that negotiations with Saudi Arabia over the terms of its intention to buy 48 Typhoon fighter jets were progressing.
