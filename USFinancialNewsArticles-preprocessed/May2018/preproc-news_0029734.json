    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif., May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Smart Cannabis Corp. (OTC: SCNA) announced today that its newly formed subsidiary, SAP Investments, Inc., has secured a Letter of Intent to acquire a cannabis cultivation license in Northern California.\nAccording to Smart Cannabis President John Taylor, \"This is a significant development in the growth and evolution of our company. The reaction from potential partners and investors to us establishing SAP Investments has been exceptionally positive and we are encouraged to be working our first deal so quickly. Our team will urgently proceed with formalizing necessary contracts so we can decisively maximize the revenue potential while conforming to applicable laws. There are several paths open to us, but adding a large scale California cultivation license has greater potential to accelerate our overall revenue and market share growth in the cannabis industry.\"\nSAP Investments was formed so Smart Cannabis Corp. can leverage its expertise across the cannabis spectrum, including special purpose real estate acquisitions, and the building, licensing, and management or sale of fully compliant turnkey facilities for cannabis-based products. Company plans range from building out cannabis specific business parks for sale or lease, to acquisitions of licenses and/or facilities for cultivation, nurseries, processing, and manufacturing.\nThe company will provide additional public details in the near future.
