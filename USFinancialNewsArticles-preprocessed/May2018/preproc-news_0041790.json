    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 8:31 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Vermont signs law to allow import of prescription drugs from Canada Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Vermont Governor Phil Scott signed a law on Wednesday that will allow the import of prescription drugs from Canada into the U.S. state in a move that would help tackle rising drug prices. Vermont governor Phil Scott speaks to the press in his offices at the State Legislature in Montpelier, Vermont, U.S., March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Christinne Muschi\nThe law is yet to be certified by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is opposed to the idea.\n\"Canada simply doesn't have enough drugs to sell them to us for less money, and drug companies won't sell Canada or Europe more just to have them imported here,\" HHS Secretary Alex Azar said here on Wednesday.\nThe Trump administration is instead considering expanding Medicare’s ability to negotiate drug prices by giving private payers a role in setting the cost of medicines administered in hospitals and doctors’ offices.
