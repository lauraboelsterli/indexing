The transaction will strengthen Janney’s leadership in the M&A space and enhance its comprehensive advisory services expertise, particularly in the business services, technology and industrial sectors.\nThe combined firms will expand Janney’s existing M&A platform by adding six (6) Managing Directors and 11 total professionals to Janney’s Investment Banking group, resulting in a combined total of 51 investment banking professionals.
