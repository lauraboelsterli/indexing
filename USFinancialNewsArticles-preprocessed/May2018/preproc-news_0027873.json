    "text": "Reports Preliminary Revenue of $221.8 Million\nProvides Third Quarter Revenue Guidance of $255 to $270 Million\nSINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: KLIC) (“Kulicke & Soffa”, “K&S” or the “Company”), announced today that it will not be filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC in a timely manner. Following the end of the fiscal quarter, the Company learned of certain unauthorized transactions by a senior finance employee of the Company. The Company has undertaken an investigation of these transactions with the assistance of outside advisors. In the course of this investigation, the Company discovered that certain warranty accruals in prior periods had been accounted for incorrectly and therefore misstated. The Board of Directors of the Company has therefore determined that the Company’s previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 can no longer be relied upon due to the misstated warranty accruals made in prior periods.\nAlthough the investigation into warranty accruals and other matters is continuing, the Company currently expects that the warranty accrual adjustment for fiscal year 2017, when finalized, would not be materially adverse to the Company. The Company will reschedule the release of its full second fiscal quarter results following the restatement of those financial statements and the closure of its internal and external review process for the second fiscal quarter. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the restatement on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and whether any other prior periods were materially impacted and need to be restated.\nThe Company also reported preliminary second quarter net revenue of $221.8 million, an 11.1% increase from the second fiscal quarter of the prior year. During its second fiscal quarter, K&S repurchased $21.5 million of common stock in open market transactions, ending the quarter with $628.7 million in total cash and investments.\nCapital Equipment segment revenue increased by 3.2% from the prior fiscal quarter to $177.1 million and the Aftermarket Products and Services (APS) segment revenue increased by 6.1% from the prior fiscal quarter to $44.7 million during the March quarter. The Company remains committed to tactically enhancing market share in both Capital Equipment and APS segments.\nPreliminary Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights\nThe Company has announced the following second quarter financial numbers which are preliminary and subject to change based on the ongoing review.\nNet revenue of $221.8 million Net income of approximately $36 million Diluted EPS of approximately $0.51 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments were $628.7 million as of March 31, 2018 The Company repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares of common stock at a cost of $21.5 million\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook\nThe Company currently expects net revenue in the third fiscal quarter of 2018 ending June 30, 2018 to be approximately $255 million to $270 million. For the first three quarters of 2018, this guidance represents an increase of 17.7% over the same period in the prior year.\nDr. Fusen Chen, Kulicke & Soffa's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “While we are disappointed to delay filing our quarterly report, demand for our offerings remains strong and we continue to execute our near and long-term strategies effectively. We are confident in our growth potential based on our exposure to memory, automotive, LED, advance packaging and general semiconductor unit growth projections. Our financial performance and long-term growth prospects enable us to continue aggressively returning capital to investors. We also do not believe that the unauthorized transactions noted above or the misstated warranty accruals have had a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations or business prospects.”\nEarnings Conference Call Details\nA conference call to discuss these results will be held today, May 10, 2018, beginning at 6:00 pm (EDT).
