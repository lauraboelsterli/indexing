The company beat revenue and profit expectations in its March quarter, with its shares ending the regular session up 2.3 percent.\nOn Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.27 percent while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 percent.\nThe dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies traded near a four-month high set on Tuesday, with the dollar having surged into positive territory for 2018 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision.\nThe dollar index eased 0.1 percent to 92.403. It had risen on Tuesday to a peak near 92.570, its strongest level in nearly four months.\nThe dollar was underpinned by the outlook for a strong U.S. economy amid signs of slowdown elsewhere, especially in Europe.\nThe euro zone’s economic momentum has been faltering and that seems to have prompted market players to trim their long positions in the euro, said Hirofumi Suzuki, an economist for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.\nAgainst this backdrop, the dollar-buying trend will probably persist for a while, Suzuki added.\nThe euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2002. On Tuesday, the common currency had touched a low of $1.1981, its weakest level since Jan. 11.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar struck its highest level in nearly three months at 109.92 yen in early Asian trade. It later pulled back to 109.78 yen, down 0.1 percent.\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was steady on the day at 2.979 percent.\nLast week, the U.S. 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, had set a four-year high of 3.035 percent as bond prices fell on worries about the growing supply of government debt and inflationary pressures from rising oil prices.\nOil prices were stable on Wednesday, supported by concerns that the United States may re-impose sanctions on major exporter Iran, although soaring U.S. supplies capped gains.\nBrent crude oil futures edged up 0.1 percent to $73.20 a barrel. Last week, Brent crude had hit a three-year high of $75.47.\nReporting by Masayuki Kitano Editing by Eric Meijer\n ",
