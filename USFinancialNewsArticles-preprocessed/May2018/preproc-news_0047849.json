    "text": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Five people were killed and 22 wounded by a Houthi missile fired at the Yemeni city of Marib, which falls under control of the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the SABA news agency reported on Tuesday.\n“Iran-backed Houthi launched a Katyusha missile targeting a crowded popular market in the city center of Marib, killing 5 people and wounding 22,” SABA said.\nBacked by the Saudi-led Arab coalition, Hadi’s government has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement since 2015 in a war that has driven the country to the verge of famine.\nThe United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the three-year-old war, and three out of four Yemenis - 22 million civilians - need relief aid.\nReporting by Mohammed Ghobari and Mohamed el Sherif; Writing by Marwa Rashad; Editing by Sandra Maler and Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
