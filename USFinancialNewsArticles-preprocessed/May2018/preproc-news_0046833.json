    "text": "Pivotal regulatory milestone in high stakes applications\nCellvizio first-to-market in key neurosurgery field\nProvides unique response to unmet needs during brain and spinal surgeries\nPARIS & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nRegulatory News:\nMauna Kea Technologies (Paris:MKEA) (OTCQX:MKEAY) (Euronext: MKEA, OTCQX: MKEAY) inventor of Cellvizio®, the multidisciplinary confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) platform, today announced that it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance of the Cellvizio® 100 series F400 and F800 with a new Confocal Miniprobe™, the CranioFlex™, to be used during neurosurgical procedures. This marks the 15 th U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance of Cellvizio® and the first-ever FDA clearance for CLE applications in neurosurgery.\nThe Cellvizio® 100 with the CranioFlex™ provides imaging of tissue internal microstructures and allows the identification of cells and vessels and their organization within the central nervous system during cranial diagnostic and therapeutic procedures such as tumor biopsy and resection. The Cellvizio 100 series F400 model operates at 488 nm and the F800 model at 800 nm, two highly relevant wavelengths commonly used during brain surgery for imaging and navigation.\n“This is an important regulatory and business milestone for the Company, opening new avenues for market development and strategic partnerships,” said Sacha Loiseau, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Mauna Kea Technologies. “It also unlocks a new era in neurosurgery, paving the way toward more precise resection of brain and spinal tumors. Cellvizio® is now the first to market endomicroscopic visualization platform providing neurosurgeons for the first time the ability to perform real-time optical biopsies to help determine, for instance, if the tumor is completely excised. This clearance builds on many years of clinical development and is happening at a time when the neurosurgery community recognizes the potential benefits of real-time digital visualization of nervous system tissue microstructures.”\nAbout Mauna Kea Technologies\nMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company focused on eliminating uncertainties related to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases thanks to real time in vivo microscopic visualization. The Company’s flagship product, Cellvizio®, has received clearance/approval in a wide range of applications in more than 40 countries, including the United States, Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Brazil and Mexico.
