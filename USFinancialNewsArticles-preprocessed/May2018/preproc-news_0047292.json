    "text": "PARIS, May 21 (Reuters) - Shares in EuropaCorp, the film and TV studio group chaired by well-known French film director Luc Besson, slumped on Monday following the emergence of a rape allegation against Besson, which Besson denies.\nEuropaCorp shares were down 13.3 percent in early session trading.\nOver the weekend, Besson’s lawyer Thierry Marembert told Reuters that Besson “categorically denied” the allegation, made by an unnamed actress.
