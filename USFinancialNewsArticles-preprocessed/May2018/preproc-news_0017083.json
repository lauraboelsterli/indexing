    "text": "JAKARTA, May 7 (Reuters) - Indonesian retail sales grew 2.5 percent in March from a year earlier, a central bank survey showed on Monday, up from February’s figure.\nGrowth was mainly supported by a higher sales of motor vehicle spare parts and accessories, food, beverages as well as tobacco, it said.\nFebruary retail sales grew 1.5 percent year-on-year on the back of apparel sales.\nThe survey of 700 retailers in 10 major cities projected retail sales would grow 3.4 percent in April from a year earlier.\nThe growth would be driven by sales of motor vehicle spare parts and accessories, as also apparel.\nWeak increase in consumption have kept down Indonesia’s growth rate, with the country’s first-quarter GDP growth coming in at 5.06 percent year on year, from 5.19 percent in the preceding quarter.
