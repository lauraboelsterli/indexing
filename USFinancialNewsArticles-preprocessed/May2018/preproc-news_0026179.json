FILE PHOTO: Shoppers look at luxury goods displayed in a window in downtown Milan December 8, 2011. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini\nA source told Reuters in December that Valentino was preparing to list on the Milan bourse sometime from late 2018, with its Qatari owner planning to sell around a quarter of the company in an initial public offering.\nIn a statement, Valentino also said 2017 revenues rose 7 percent at constant exchange rates to 1.16 billion euros (1.02 billion pounds), while core earnings fell to 190 million euros from 206 million a year earlier, hit by costs relating to marketing and industrial investments.\n“The company’s objective remains focused on realising the brand’s full potential,” it said in a statement.
