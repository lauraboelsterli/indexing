    "text": "TORONTO, May 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biome Grow (“Biome”) announced today that Mark Lievonen has been appointed as an Observer to the Board of Directors effective immediately. Mr. Lievonen is expected to stand for election to the Board of Directors at Biome’s next annual general meeting.\nMark Lievonen is the former President of Sanofi Pasteur Limited (“SPL”), the Canadian vaccine division of Sanofi. Mr. Lievonen has been involved in the biopharmaceutical industry for over 30 years. He started at SPL in 1983 in a finance capacity and ultimately spearheaded the company into a billion-dollar commercial enterprise in Canada. Highlights of his stewardship include leading a cancer vaccine program in 1997, support of a pertussis vaccine that is still widely used today, and the manufacture of over 50 million doses of vaccines for domestic and international markets.\nPrior to joining Sanofi, Mr. Lievonen was a chartered accountant and received his designation while working with PricewaterhouseCoopers and was elected as a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario in 2007. Currently, he is also a Director of Oncolytics Biotech Inc., Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Quest PharmaTech Inc., and the Gairdner Foundation.\nIn addition to his biopharmaceutical industry and private sector governance work, Mr. Lievonen has a strong passion for public health access, education, and the overall improvement of society. These ambitions have led him to previously Chair Rx&D (now Innovative Medicines Canada), BIOTECanada, the Markham Stouffville Hospital Foundation, as well as serve as Vice-Chair of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Director of the Public Policy Forum, and as a Governor of York University.\nBiome is delighted to have Mark join its Board of Directors and bring his incredible business acumen to the fast-growing company. He has extensive board leadership and governance experience, along with a wealth of knowledge in economic development and a passion for giving back to the community, which is aligned with Biome’s core principles.\n“I am looking forward to working with Biome’s Board of Directors and bringing my experience to the company,” said Mark Lievonen. “Biome is on the path to changing Canada’s cannabis industry and I am excited to be part of that growth and evolution.”\nMr. Lievonen’s long list of recognitions for contributions to business and global society include the Order of Canada in 2015, a Chevalier de l’Ordre National de Merite by the government of France in 2007, the Queen’s Gold and Diamond Jubilee Medallions, and induction into the Canadian Healthcare Marketing Hall of Fame in 2013.\nAbout Biome Grow\nBiome (whose corporate legal entity name is Cultivator Catalyst Corp.) wholly owns Highland Grow Inc., an Authorized Licensed Producer in Nova Scotia under the ACMPR, P-209 Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and in the late stages of applying for a license under the ACMPR. Biome also wholly owns The Back Home Medical Cannabis Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and in the late stages of applying for a license under the ACMPR. Biome plans on operating a diversified mix of low cost licensed cannabis production facilities across Canada and other jurisdictions in the coming years. Additional growth will be achieved through a mixture of acquisitions and organic growth. Moreover, Biome will integrate a complimentary platform of technologies and services targeted at both the Canadian and international cannabis markets.\nBiome has entered into an amalgamation agreement dated April 25, 2018 (the “Amalgamation Agreement”) with Orca Touchscreen Technologies Ltd. (“Orca”) (CSE:OAA), pursuant to which 1151856 B.C. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orca, will acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Biome by way of a three cornered amalgamation transaction (the “Transaction”). A copy of the Amalgamation Agreement and a press release announcing the Transaction can be found on SEDAR under Orca’s profile.\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain statements or projections contained in this document are forward-looking statements, including Biome’s expectation that Mr. Lievonen will stand for election at its next annual general meeting, its plans to operate a diversified mix of low cost licensed cannabis production facilities across Canada and other jurisdictions and its plans to integrate a complimentary platform of technologies and services targeted at both the Canadian and international cannabis markets. Such forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and are based on assumptions made by and information currently available to Biome, including the assumption that Mr. Lievonen will remain interested in standing for election at Biome’s next annual general meeting, it will be able to obtain all necessary regulatory licenses, permits and approvals to produce and sell cannabis and generally operate its business in both Canada and internationally, labour, construction, and other costs will remain low for its licensed cannabis production facilities, there will be no labour disputes, there will be no unexpected delays in construction and sufficient financial resources will be available.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, among other things, Mr. Lievonen decides not to stand for election at Biome’s next annual general meeting, a failure to obtain or delays in obtaining the required regulatory licenses, permits, or approvals, changes to legislation, changes in cannabis research or the general public’s perception of cannabis, crop failure, labour disputes, increases in labour and/or construction costs, rising energy costs, an inability to access financing as needed and a general economic downturn. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Biome, or any of its subsidiaries undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\nMedia Contact\nColleen Ryan\n647-232-6867\ncryan@sussex-strategy.com\nSource: Biome Grow",
