(Nasdaq: PLSE), a medical technology company developing a proprietary therapeutic tissue treatment based on its Nano-Pulse Stimulation platform, today reported recent corporate developments and financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRecent Developments\nExpanded management team with key executive hires: Jeff Kmetz, 30-year pharmaceutical executive, joined as Chief Business Officer. Mr. Kmetz brings over 30 years of experience within the pharmaceutical industry specializing in oncology at companies including Pharmacyclics and Berlex/Bayer. Mr. Kmetz was instrumental in the launch of IMBRUVICA, Pharmacyclics non-Hodgkin lymphoma drug. William Knape, joined as Vice President, Clinical, Regulatory and Quality. Mr. Knape brings 25 years of clinical and regulatory affairs experience overseeing and managing worldwide clinical trials and regulatory strategy. Mr. Knape has led numerous successful regulatory filings with FDA, including 510(k)’s, PMA’s, and NDA’s. Presented favorable data from Pulse Biosciences’ first application clinical study evaluating Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) for the treatment of seborrheic keratosis (SK) at the 38 th American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS) Conference on Energy-Based Medicine & Science in Dallas, Texas. At the 106-day assessment mark, 82% of treated lesions were evaluated as clear or mostly clear by study investigators, 71% during blinded independent photographic review, and 78% of patients rated lesion outcomes as satisfied or mostly satisfied. No adverse events were reported during the study that included 472 NPS application cycles. Awarded “Best of Session for Basic Science and Translational Research” by ASLMS for Pulse Biosciences’ clinical study presentation: “A dose-response study of a novel non-thermal method of selectively modifying cellular structure in skin with low energy nanosecond electrical stimulation.”\n“We continue to make progress towards our goal of introducing our Nano-Pulse Stimulation technology into areas of unmet dermatological and oncological clinical needs across multiple applications,” said Darrin Uecker, Pulse Biosciences President and Chief Executive Officer. “Leveraging the strong safety profile established to date, favorable data from our recently completed SK study, input from clinical advisors, and a portfolio of potential targets including sebaceous hyperplasia, keloid scars, warts, actinic keratosis, and syringoma, we are now preparing to proceed with multiple studies in parallel commencing in Q2 2018 and beyond to demonstrate the utility of our technology.”\nFinancial Highlights\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $33.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $38.1 million at December 31, 2017. Cash use totaled $4.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to cash use of $3.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. 2018 Cash use is currently anticipated to total $22 million.\nOperating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, totaled $8.7 million, compared to $3.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included non-cash stock-based compensation of $3.4 million, compared to non-cash stock-based compensation of $0.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nConference Call Details\nPulse Biosciences will host an investor call on May 8, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. PDT / 4:30 p.m. EDT.

NPS is a non-thermal, precise, focal, drug-free tissue treatment technology utilizing nanosecond (billionth of a second) range pulsed electric fields that directly affect the cell membrane and intracellular structures and initiates programmed cell death in treated cells. The unique ability of NPS to initiate cell death has the potential to significantly benefit patients in a wide variety of medical applications including applications in immuno-oncology and dermatology, and other potential applications we may pursue in the future. The initiation of programmed cell death by NPS results in a minimal inflammatory response, which improves healing outcomes and supports the replacement of treated tissue cells with healthy tissue cells. In cancerous lesions, NPS has been shown in preclinical models to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), which exposes the unique antigens of the treated cells to the immune system and enrolls immune system cells, such as cytotoxic T-cells to mount an adaptive immune response. Pulse Biosciences is investigating a variety of applications for its technology that exploits the technology’s unique biologic effect, including immuno-oncology and dermatology. More information is available at www.pulsebiosciences.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nAll statements in this press release that are not historical are forward-looking statements, including, among other things, statements relating to Pulse Biosciences’ expectations regarding regulatory clearance and the timing of FDA filings or approvals, the mechanism of action of NPS treatments, current and planned future clinical studies, other matters related to its pipeline of product candidates, future financial performance, anticipated cash use and other future events. These statements are not historical facts but rather are based on Pulse Biosciences’ current expectations, estimates, and projections regarding Pulse Biosciences’ business, operations and other similar or related factors. Words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” and other similar or related expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult or impossible to predict and, in some cases, beyond Pulse Biosciences’ control. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described in Pulse Biosciences’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pulse Biosciences undertakes no obligation to revise or update information in this release to reflect events or circumstances in the future, even if new information becomes available.\nPULSE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, December 31, (in thousands)\n2018 2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and investments $ 33,375 $ 38,069 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 368 412 Total current assets 33,743 38,481 Leasehold improvements and equipment, net of Accumulated depreciation 2,451 2,570 Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization 5,712 5,878 Goodwill 2,791 2,791 Other assets 101 101 Total assets $ 44,798 $ 49,821 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 944 $ 782 Accrued expenses 846 1,034 Deferred rent, current 401 397 Total current liabilities 2,191 2,213 Long term liabilities: Deferred rent 1,512 1,613 Total liabilities 3,703 3,826 Stockholders’ equity: Common stock 87,939 84,219 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (3 ) (51 ) Accumulated deficit (46,841 ) (38,173 ) Total stockholders’ equity 41,095 45,995 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 44,798 $ 49,821 PULSE BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited)\nThree-Month Periods Ended March 31, March 31, (in thousands, except per share amounts)\n2018 2017 Revenue $ — $ — Operating expenses: General and administrative 5,383 1,344 Research and development 3,175 1,727 Amortization of intangible assets 166 166 Total operating expenses 8,724 3,237 Other income: Interest income 56 39 Total other income 56 39 Net loss $ (8,668 ) $ (3,198 ) Net loss per share: Basic and diluted net loss per share $ (0.51 ) $ (0.23 ) Weighted average shares used to compute net loss per common share — basic and diluted 16,842 13,803\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006706/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nPulse Biosciences, Inc.\nBrian Dow\nSr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIR@pulsebiosciences.com\nor\nSolebury Trout\nGitanjali Jain Ogawa, 646-378-2949\ngogawa@troutgroup.com\nor\nMedia:\nSam Brown, Inc.\nChristy Curran, 615-414-8668\nchristycurran@sambrown.com\nSource: Pulse Biosciences, Inc.",
