Israel has every right to defend itself,” the spokesman told reporters.\n“We call on Iran to refrain from any further attacks and for calm on all sides. We call on Russia to use its influence in Syria to prevent further Iranian attacks.” (Reporting by Elizabeth Piper. Editing by Andrew MacAskill)",
