FILE PHOTO: Tennis - Australian Open - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 19, 2018. Netherlands' Kiki Bertens in action during her match against Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\nBertens, who reached the 2016 French Open semi-finals, beat the 27-year-old Dane 6-2 6-2 in an hour to claim the biggest scalp of her career.\nAustralian Open champion Wozniacki had to win the Madrid title to overhaul Simona Halep in the top spot but her defeat means the Romanian will retain first place.\nBertens’ will face five-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova or Kristina Mladenovic of France in the last eight.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Halep strolled into the quarter-finals with a 6-1 6-4 win over Czech Kristyna Pliskova. Tennis - WTA Mandatory - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 9, 2018 Romania’s Simona Halep celebrates winning her third round match against Czech Republic’s Karolina Pliskova REUTERS/Sergio Perez\nHalep, the two-time defending champion, struck 20 winners and broke Pliskova’s serve three times as she extended her winning streak in the Spanish capital to 15 straight matches.\nAfter conceding the opener in 29 minutes, Pliskova produced a better second set but failed to deliver consistently as Halep saved all five of the break points she faced.\n“I think she served much better (in the second set) and I couldn’t do much with the return,” Halep told a news conference.\n“But I served well, too. I feel like it was a very good match, the hardest here. She has improved a lot since last year, we played together here, and she was a different player.”\nHalep will next face Krystyna’s twin sister Karolina Pliskova, who raced past American Sloane Stephens 6-2 6-3.
