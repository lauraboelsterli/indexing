A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables in this press release.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Definitions:\n\"EBITDA\" is a non-GAAP measure defined by BioLife Solutions, Inc., as net income/(loss) excluding interest expense/(income), income tax expense, depreciation expense, and amortization expense. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is a non-GAAP measure defined by BioLife Solutions, Inc., as net income/(loss) excluding interest expense/(income), income tax expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and the loss/(gain) on equity method investments.\nMedia & Investor Relations\nRoderick de Greef\nChief Financial Officer\n(425) 686-6002\nrdegreef@biolifesolutions.com\nBIOLIFE SOLUTIONS, INC.\nUnaudited Condensed Statement of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Month Period Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nProduct revenue\n$\n3,815\n$\n2,366\nCost of product sales\n1,364\n928\nGross profit\n2,451\n1,438\nGross margin\n64%\n61%\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development\n346\n287\nSales and marketing\n612\n512\n1,353\n1,103\nTotal operating expenses\n2,311\n1,902\nOperating income/(loss)\n140\n(464)\nOther income/(expense)\nInterest income/(expense), net\n7\n(83)\nAmortization of debt discount\n––\n(94)\nLoss from equity-method investment\n(144)\n(229)\nTotal other income/(loss)\n(137)\n(406)\nNet income/(loss)\n3\n(870)\nLess: preferred stock dividends\n(106)\n––\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders\n$\n(103)\n$\n(870)\nBasic and diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n(0.07)\nBasic and diluted weighted average common shares used to calculate net loss per common share\n14,099\n12,965\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation:\nThree Month Period Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income/(loss)\n$\n3\n$\n(870)\nInterest expense/(income), net\n(7)\n83\nDepreciation expense\n77\n90\nAmortization of debt discount\n––\n94\nEBITDA\n73\n(603)\nShare-based compensation (non-cash)\n373\n330\nLoss from equity-method investment (non-cash)\n144\n229\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n590\n$\n(44)\nBIOLIFE SOLUTIONS, INC.\nUnaudited Condensed Balance Sheet Information\n(In thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\n$\n7,032\n$\n6,663\nAccounts receivable, net\n1,044\n1,021\nInventories\n1,837\n1,847\nTotal current assets\n10,244\n9,931\nTotal assets\n12,293\n12,143\n1,312\n1,513\nTotal liabilities\n1,822\n2,051\nTotal Shareholders' equity\n10,471\n10,092\nBIOLIFE SOLUTIONS, INC.\nUnaudited Condensed Statement of Cash Flows Information\n(In thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nCash provided/(used) by operating activities\n$\n392\n$\n(169)\nCash provided/(used) by investing activities\n(41)\n(37)\nCash provided by financing activities\n18\n1,090\nNet increase in cash and equivalents\n$\n369\n$\n884\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biolife-solutions-announces-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300646686.html\nSOURCE BioLife Solutions, Inc.",
