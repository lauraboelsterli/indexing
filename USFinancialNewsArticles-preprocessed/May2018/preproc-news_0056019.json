Cricket - England vs Pakistan - First Test - Lord's Cricket Ground, London, Britain - May 25, 2018 Pakistan's Babar Azam (L) celebrates with Sarfraz Ahmed after reaching a half century Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley\nThe 23-year-old righthander top-scored with 68 to help the tourists reach 350-8, a lead of 166, but retired hurt before the close of play after being struck by a Ben Stokes delivery.\n\"In that last session we took him off the field because he couldn't grip his bat properly, we treated him for pain,\" Pakistan physiotherapist Cliffe Deacon said in an interview on the Pakistan Cricket Board's official Twitter account twitter.com/TheRealPCBMedia.\n“We decided to do a precautionary X-ray at the end of the day’s play ... when we got to the hospital the X-ray confirmed that there was a fracture of the forearm, just above the wrist.”\n“Normally with these sort of fractures (recovery) varies between four to six weeks.” Writing by Ken Ferris; Editing by Nick Mulvenney",
