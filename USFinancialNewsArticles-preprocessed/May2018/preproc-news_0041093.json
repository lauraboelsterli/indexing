On Wednesday it had touched a five-month high of 93.632.\nOil prices gained on Wednesday, shaking off the effects of a strengthening dollar, after an inventory report showed U.S. crude and gasoline stocks fell more than expected.\nBrent crude futures gained 85 cents to settle at $79.28 a barrel on Wednesday.\nReporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ",
