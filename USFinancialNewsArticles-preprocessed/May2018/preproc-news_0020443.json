    "text": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran is continuing to implement its nuclear commitments under a deal with major powers, the U.N. atomic watchdog policing the deal said on Wednesday, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington was pulling out of the accord.\n“Iran is subject to the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime under the JCPOA, which is a significant verification gain,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Yukiya Amano said in a statement, using the deal’s official name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n“As of today, the IAEA can confirm that the nuclear-related commitments are being implemented by Iran,” he said, adding that the IAEA was “closely monitoring developments” related to the deal.\nReporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
