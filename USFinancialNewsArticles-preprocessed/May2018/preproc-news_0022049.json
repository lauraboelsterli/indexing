Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 excludes approximately $1.7 million in pre-tax expenses associated with the voluntary reduction in force program announced on March 12, 2018, as well as the applicable tax effect of the adjustment.

Consolidated income from operations before interest income and income taxes in the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $6.2 million, compared to consolidated income from operations before interest income and income taxes of $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the decrease in revenue, expenses associated with the voluntary reduction in force program, and an increase in general and administrative expenses. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were approximately 16.5 million and 16.3 million, respectively.\nAdjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 excludes approximately $1.7 million in pre-tax expenses associated with the voluntary reduction in force program announced on March 12, 2018, as well as the applicable tax effect of the adjustment. The workforce reduction was substantially completed on April 1, 2018. For additional information regarding adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure), please refer to \"GAAP to Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation\" in the financial tables that follow.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 were approximately $186.2 million, compared to $179.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.7 million in the prior year period.

American Public Education believes that the use of adjusted net income is useful because it allows investors to better compare results to prior year periods.\nThis non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The principal limitation of adjusted net income is that it excludes expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded. In addition, non-GAAP measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses are excluded.\nAmerican Public Education is presenting adjusted net income in connection with its GAAP results and urges investors to review the reconciliation of adjusted net income to the comparable GAAP financial measures that is included in the tables following this press release (under the caption \"GAAP to Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation\") and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook:\nThe following statements are based on American Public Education's current expectations. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason unless required by law.\nAmerican Public Education anticipates an increase in second quarter 2018 consolidated revenues of between 0% and 2% year-over-year, compared to the second quarter of 2017. The Company expects consolidated net income of between $0.29 and $0.34 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018.\nAmerican Public Education also expects the following results from its subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2018:\nAt APUS, net course registrations by new students are expected to decrease between 8% and 3% year-over-year and the change in net course registrations is expected to be between a 2% decrease and a 2% increase year-over-year. 1 At HCN, new student enrollment increased by approximately 5% year-over-year and total student enrollment increased by approximately 17% year-over-year for the three months ended June 30, 2018 (Spring 2018). 3\nWebcast:\nA live webcast of the Company's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call will be broadcast today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.
