    "text": "Published: May 14, 2018 8:02 p.m. ET Share\nNHTSA sent letters to 12 car manufacturers seeking information on their progress\nBy Mike Spector\nA dozen auto makers failed to meet a deadline to repair millions of air bags that risk exploding in crashes, prompting the U.S.’s senior-most traffic-safety regulator to summon them to meetings.\nThe auto makers regulators singled out on Monday include Honda Motor Co. HMC, +0.70% , Toyota Motor Corp. TM, +0.05% , Nissan Motor Co., General Motors Co. GM, -0.70% , Ford Motor Co. F, -0.09% and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU, -0.66% , among others. Ford said it was cooperating with regulators’ order, parts are available for repairs and urged consumers to seek fixes. The other companies either had no immediate comment or didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nUnder an unprecedented government order, auto makers were required to address by the end of 2017 vehicles with Takata Corp. air bags at the highest risk of rupturing and spraying metal shards. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Monday it was “concerned that certain higher-risk vehicles with defective Takata air bags remain unrepaired,” adding that the agency had contacted 12 auto makers to ensure “repairs are completed immediately.”\nAuto makers have made “continued progress” in repairing those at the highest risk of rupturing, according to a letter NHTSA Deputy Administrator Heidi King sent to the dozen car companies.\nBut King, who faces a Senate hearing later this week to consider her nomination by President Donald Trump to lead the traffic-safety agency, lamented that the car companies had missed the end-of-year deadline for completing all repairs.\n“I am deeply concerned that, despite this progress, millions more vehicles with defective Takata air-bag inflaters remain on the roads,” Ms. King wrote in letters to auto makers earlier this month inviting them to meetings to discuss repair plans. The agency released a sample version of the letters on Monday. “We look forward to hearing your plans to complete the remedy program for these highest-priority vehicles and your proposed timeline for doing so.” ",
