    "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The South African Weather Service said on Monday that it saw an El Nino weather pattern developing during the regionâ€™s winter and spring but it was too early to forecast if it would last into the summer growing season.\nThe last El Nino was linked to a severe drought that hit crop production and economic growth across southern Africa, and the region is still emerging from its affects two years later.\nReporting by Ed Stoddard; Editing by Joe Brock\n ",
