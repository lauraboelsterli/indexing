(NASDAQ:CDXS), a leading protein engineering company, announces financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and provides a business update.\n“We began the year with strong first quarter revenues of $14 million, a 76% increase over the prior-year period,” said Codexis President and CEO John Nicols. “That growth was driven by a 230% increase in R&D revenue with major contributions from our marquis customers Nestlé Health Science, Merck, Tate & Lyle and another global pharmaceutical customer.\n“We also are off to an excellent start so far this year in delivering against the company’s strategic objectives. In the Performance Enzymes segment, we began efforts to scale-up and commercialize enzymes we engineered for our second food ingredients partnership with Tate & Lyle, plus we commenced a new partnership with Porton Pharma Solutions to deepen our penetration into pharmaceutical manufacturing processes,” said Nicols. “In our Novel Biotherapeutics segment, we advanced the development of our oral enzyme therapeutic candidate CDX-6114 for phenylketonuria, or PKU, and are on track to receive regulatory approval for a Phase 1 clinical trial before the end of the second quarter of 2018.\n“Supported by the $37 million net proceeds from the follow-on equity capital raise completed in April, we are well positioned to advance our Novel Biotherapeutics pipeline, and to capitalize on a wealth of additional opportunities with our proprietary CodeEvolver ® protein engineering platform technology,” he added.\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\nBeginning in 2018, Codexis is reporting two business segments. These segments are 1) its Performance Enzymes business, which consists of its protein catalyst and enzyme product and service offerings with a focus on pharmaceutical, food, molecular diagnostics and other industrial markets, and 2) its Novel Biotherapeutics discovery and development business.\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $14.0 million, up 76% from $8.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Product revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.2 million, up 10% from $5.6 million for the prior-year period, primarily due to higher demand for enzymes. Research and development (R&D) revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.9 million, up 230% from $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, with the increase mainly attributable to collaborations with Nestlé Health Science and Tate & Lyle, as well as recognition of a license fee from Merck. R&D revenue for the first quarter of 2018 included $4.6 million from the Performance Enzymes segment and $3.3 million from the Novel Biotherapeutics segment. The company did not record R&D revenue from the Novel Biotherapeutics segment in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross margin on product revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was 38%, compared with 46% for the first quarter of 2017, with the decrease due to product mix.\nR&D expenses were $7.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $5.8 million for the first quarter of 2017, with the increase due primarily to higher outside services related to CDX-6114 and increased costs associated with higher headcount and lab supplies. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2018 included $5.1 million from the Performance Enzymes segment and $1.9 million from the Novel Biotherapeutics segment. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2017 included $4.1 million from the Performance Enzymes segment and $1.5 million from the Novel Biotherapeutics segment.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $7.7 million, compared with $6.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to an increase in outside services, accounting fees, employee compensation and recruiting costs and legal fees, partially offset by lower depreciation expense. SG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 included $2.1 million from the Performance Enzymes segment, $0.1 million from the Novel Biotherapeutics segment and $5.4 million in corporate costs. The company did not record SG&A expenses from the Novel Biotherapeutics segment in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.7 million, or $0.10 per share, compared with a net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $7.5 million, or $0.18 per share. Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.5 million, or $0.05 per share, compared with a non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $5.5 million, or $0.13 per share. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided below.\n as of March 31, 2018 were $24.3 million, compared with $31.2 million as of December 31, 2017. In April 2018, Codexis completed a public offering for net proceeds of $37.2 million.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nCodexis is affirming financial guidance for 2018, as follows:\nTotal revenues are expected to be $60 million to $63 million, representing an increase of 20% to 26% over 2017; Product revenue is expected to be $25 million to $28 million; and Gross margin on product revenue is expected to be 45% to 48%.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, financial measures exclude non-cash items such as depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP financial measures presented are: non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share (basic and diluted) and non-GAAP operating expenses, including non-GAAP research and development expense and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense and depreciation of fixed assets.\nCodexis management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and evaluate the Company’s operating results and trends on an ongoing basis, and internally for operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Codexis management believes the non-GAAP information is useful for investors by offering them the ability to identify trends in what management considers to be Codexis’ core operating results and to better understand how management evaluates the business. These non-GAAP measures have limitations, however, because they do not include all expenses that affect Codexis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measurements required by GAAP, and therefore these non-GAAP results should only be used for evaluation in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. A description of the non-GAAP calculations and reconciliation to comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the accompanying table entitled “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nConference Call and Webcast\nCodexis will hold a conference call and audio webcast today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) (In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts) Three Months Ended March\n31, 2018 2017 (i) Research and development expense Research and development expense - GAAP $ 7,178 $ 5,839 Non-GAAP adjustments: Depreciation expense (a) (57 ) (178 ) Stock-based compensation (b) (435 ) (323 ) Research and development expense - Non-GAAP $ 6,686 $ 5,338 (ii) Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses - GAAP $ 7,746 $ 6,606 Non-GAAP adjustments: Depreciation expense (a) (181 ) (148 ) Stock-based compensation (b) (1,545 ) (1,346 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses - Non-GAAP $ 6,020 $ 5,112 (iii) Net loss Net loss - GAAP $ (4,694 ) $ (7,460 ) Non-GAAP adjustments: Depreciation expense (a) 238 326 Stock-based compensation (b) 1,980 1,669 Net loss - Non-GAAP $ (2,476 ) $ (5,465 ) (iv) Net loss per share Net loss per share - GAAP, basic and diluted $ (0.10 ) $ (0.18 ) Adjustments to GAAP net loss per share (as detailed above) 0.05 0.05 Net loss per share - Non-GAAP, basic and diluted $ (0.05 ) $ (0.13 ) These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items:\n(a) Depreciation expense: we provide non-GAAP information which excludes depreciation expense related to the depreciation of property and equipment. We believe that eliminating this expense from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because the acquisition of property and equipment, and the corresponding depreciation expense, can be inconsistent in amount and can vary from period to period.\n(b) Stock-based compensation: we provide non-GAAP information which excludes expenses for stock-based compensation. We believe the exclusion of this item allows for financial results that are more indicative of our operations. We also believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of Codexis' operating results to prior periods as the calculations of stock-based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types.\nSource:Codexis, Inc.",
