    "text": "Achieved Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth of 35%\nMALVERN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- USA Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:USAT) (“USAT”), a premier payment technology service provider of integrated cashless and mobile transactions in the self-service retail market, today reported results for its third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Financial Highlights:\nRevenue of $35.8 million, increased 35% year-over-year, marking the 34 th consecutive quarter of growth On a pro-forma basis, as if the acquisition of Cantaloupe had occurred on July 1, 2016, overall revenue increased 12% year-over-year and License and transaction fee revenue increased 25% year-over-year New net connections of 64,000 bring total connections to 969,000 License and transaction fee revenue of $27.0 million, an increase of 55% year-over-year Gross margins of 33.3% increased from 25.0% in third quarter of fiscal year 2017 License and transaction margin of 40.7% increased from 32.0% in third quarter of fiscal year 2017 Operating loss of $(0.5) million Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) of $2.0 million Net income of $1.2 million, or $0.02 per share Non-GAAP net income of $2.2 million, or $0.04 per share Adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million, an increase of 130% year-over-year Ended the quarter with $17.1 million in cash\n“Our third fiscal quarter results demonstrate the successful integration of Cantaloupe, including additional cross-selling wins, improved operational efficiencies, as well as revenue and margin expansion across our business,” said Stephen P. Herbert, USA Technologies’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our commercial success in cross-selling our combined offering is allowing us to reach new customers, displace competitive solutions, as well as expand our footprint within our existing customer base. Additionally, subsequent to quarter end, we announced a new three-year strategic agreement with Ingenico. We are thrilled to strengthen our relationship with Ingenico via this strategic alliance, which we believe will help expand our reach in North America, as well our global presence into agreed upon markets, ultimately positioning us to gain additional penetration and market share in the global unattended retail market.”\n“We are pleased to have exceeded the long-term margin targets relating to our gross margins, license and transaction fees, and equipment revenues that we set less than six months ago,” said Priyanka Singh, USA Technologies’ Chief Financial Officer. “Our third quarter L&T margin was the highest we have seen in the past 5 years, reflecting our commitment to driving L&T margin expansion. Additionally, certain actions made in connection with our integration of Cantaloupe have resulted in approximately $3 million in annualized cost savings.”\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nFor full fiscal year 2018, the company expects revenue to be between $138 million to $142 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $14.5 million and $15.0 million. USAT expects total connections to its service as of the end of the fiscal year to be in the 1.03 million to 1.07 million range. USAT continues to expect the Cantaloupe transaction to be accretive in fiscal 2018, net of one-time transaction and integration expenses and any purchase accounting adjustments.\nUSA Technologies has not reconciled the company’s adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net income (loss) due to the uncertainty and potential variability of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and integration and acquisition costs, each of which is a reconciling item between adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income (loss). Because these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, cannot be reasonably predicted, and could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net income (loss), USA Technologies has not provided guidance for GAAP net income (loss) or a reconciliation of the company’s adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net income (loss). Accordingly, a GAAP net income (loss) outlook and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort. For information regarding the reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures, see \"Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below and the reconciliation tables included in this press release under “Financial Schedules”.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nUSA Technologies will host a conference call and webcast the event beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today, May 8, 2018.\nTo participate in the conference call, please dial (866) 393-1608 approximately 10 minutes prior to the call.

For more information, please visit the website at www.usatech.com .\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). Reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth below in Financial Schedule E.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures are discussed herein: adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. The presentation of these additional financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, superior to, as a substitute for, or as a measure of, the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, including the net income or net loss of USAT, net cash provided/used by operating activities, profitability or net earnings. Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with USAT's net income or net loss as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not required by or defined under GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. USAT has provided below in Financial Schedule E the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAs used herein, non-GAAP net income (loss) represents GAAP net income (loss) excluding costs or benefits relating to any adjustment for fair value of warrant liabilities, non-cash portions of the Company’s income tax benefit (provision), non-recurring fees and charges that were incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Cantaloupe during the current fiscal year and VendScreen, Inc. (“VendScreen”) during the prior fiscal year, and non-cash expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. Non-GAAP income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Management believes that non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share are important measures of the Company's business. Management uses the aforementioned non-GAAP measures to monitor and evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and to gain an understanding of our comparative operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures serve as a useful metric for our management and investors because they enable a better understanding of the long-term performance of our core business and facilitate comparisons of our operating results over multiple periods, and when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and our reconciliations, enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current and future financial performance. Additionally, the Company utilizes non-GAAP net income (loss) as a metric in its executive officer and management incentive compensation plans.\nAs used herein, Adjusted EBITDA represents net loss before interest income, interest expense, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation, amortization, non-recurring fees and charges that were incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Cantaloupe during the current fiscal year and VendScreen during the prior fiscal year, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and stock-based compensation expense. We have excluded the non-operating item, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, because it represents a non-cash gain or charge that is not related to the Company’s operations. We have excluded the non-cash expense, stock-based compensation, as it does not reflect the cash-based operations of the Company. We have excluded the non-recurring costs and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Cantaloupe during the current fiscal year and VendScreen during the prior fiscal year in order to allow more accurate comparison of the financial results to historical operations. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is useful to investors as a measure of comparative operating performance. Additionally, the Company utilizes Adjusted EBITDA as a metric in its executive officer and management incentive compensation plans.\nAs used herein, adjusted operating income represents operating income before the non-recurring costs and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Cantaloupe during the current fiscal year and VendScreen during the prior fiscal year, and the amortization expenses related to our acquisition-related intangibles. We have excluded these non-recurring costs and expenses in order to allow more accurate comparison of the financial results to historical operations and we believe such a comparison is useful to investors as a measure of comparative operating performance.\nForward-looking Statements:\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this release, including without limitation the business strategy and the plans and objectives of USAT's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this release, words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", and similar expressions, as they relate to USAT or its management, identify forward looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of USAT's management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to USAT's management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, the ability of management to accurately predict or forecast future financial results, including earnings or taxable income of USAT; the incurrence by USAT of any unanticipated or unusual non-operational expenses which would require us to divert our cash resources from achieving our business plan; whether our alliance agreement with Ingenico Inc. would result in expansion of our global presence as each of USAT and Ingenico would have to agree upon any such expansion; the ability of USAT to retain key customers from whom a significant portion of its revenues is derived; the ability of USAT to compete with its competitors to obtain market share; whether USAT's customers continue to utilize USAT's transaction processing, route scheduling, inventory management, and related services, as our customer agreements are generally cancelable by the customer on thirty to sixty days' notice; the ability of USAT to raise funds in the future through the sales of securities or debt financings in order to sustain its operations if an unexpected or unusual non-operational event would occur; the ability to prevent a security breach of our systems or services or third party services or systems utilized by us; whether any patents issued to USAT will provide USAT with any competitive advantages or adequate protection for its products, or would be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others; the ability of USAT to operate without infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of others; the effect that the integration of Cantaloupe into USAT’s business will have on USAT’s forecasted revenues, connections, or adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2018; the possibility that all or a portion of the expected benefits and efficiencies from the combined offering of the services of USAT and Cantaloupe, including increases in revenue, business efficiencies and competitiveness, and decrease in operational costs, will not continue to be realized or would not be realized within the expected time period; and whether USAT's existing or anticipated customers purchase, rent or utilize ePort or Seed devices or our other products or services in the future at levels currently anticipated by USAT. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this release speaks only as of the date of this release. Unless required by law, USAT does not undertake to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nFinancial Schedules:\nA.
