    "text": "0 COMMENTS Rising interest rates were supposed to suck money back into U.S. markets. In reality, they are driving Americans to invest abroad.\nOne key reason: Because of the gulf between rising U.S. interest rates and negative rates in Europe and Japan , a common technique of using currency forwards to hedge out foreign-exchange risk is basically paying investors to take risk abroad.\n“If you look at a U.S.-based investor, they actually get a significant yield pickup going into Japan and Europe—it’s very interesting from a flow perspective,” said Jamie Fahy, global macro strategist at Citigroup, who added that the boost to returns could be one reason that European equity markets are outperforming the U.S. so far this year.\nU.S. investors have poured $78 billion into Japanese and eurozone equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the past year, according to figures provided by data firm EPFR.\nBy contrast, the move in currency forwards has made the cost to hedge dollar investments exorbitant for European and Japanese investors. Over the same period, eurozone and Japanese investors pulled $160.8 billion more than they invested from U.S. equity funds.\nEuro, Hong Kong dollar, U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese 100-yuan banknotes in a picture illustration. Photo: jason lee/Reuters In the past year, major U.S. ETFs tracking Japanese and eurozone equity markets have grown significantly. Assets held by the iShares MSCI Japan and iShares MSCI Eurozone ETFs have risen 35% and 34%, to $14 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively.\nData from the U.S. Treasury International Capital surveys, which cover a broader group of investments, show an even more dramatic picture. During the year to January, U.S. holdings of eurozone and Japanese stocks increased at the fastest rate in at least five years, rising by $1.124 trillion.\nThe mechanics of the currency forwards mean that a U.S. investor can use $120.80 to buy €100 today, and then use a forward contract to sell that €100 for $124.60 in 12 months—a 3.14% return on the initial expenditure, the highest amount since the common currency was launched in 1999.\nIn the interim, the investor can use the euros purchased to buy European stocks. The Euro Stoxx index currently has a dividend yield of around 3.4%. Combined with the return from the currency forward, that investment would return around 6.5% if the price of the stock stayed the same.\nThe return to a U.S. investor buying Japanese yen in the spot market and selling it in forward markets is roughly the same.\n“You’re getting paid not to take that risk, basically. It’s an unusual scenario,” said Thushka Maharaj, global multiasset strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\nThere are other reasons for U.S. investors to be optimistic about European and Japanese equities. In both markets, valuation metrics like price-to-earnings ratios suggest stocks are less expensive than at home.\nThe phenomenon is the same reason that higher U.S. bond yields aren’t encouraging international investors to buy U.S. debt. Unless a buyer wants to take additional risk in the foreign-exchange market, U.S. Treasury bonds provide little to no additional return compared with local government bonds for Japanese and European investors.\nOn the flip side, it may make sense for U.S. investors to go abroad. “If you want to buy a 10-year German bond from the U.S., you can get about 3.5%. They’ve got no issuance issues, probably a supportive central bank, no inflation issues,” said Jon Day, fixed-income portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management.\nThe flow of U.S. investors into Europe has also helped keep interest rates lower in riskier parts of the Continent. Despite political gridlock in Italy , the eurozone’s third-biggest economy, the spread between 10-year Italian and German government debt has declined 0.4 percentage point this year.\n“When you’re talking about risk assets, one of the reasons we’ve seen Italian peripheral spreads as stable is the factor that yield pickup in the periphery is particularly attractive to U.S. investors,” added JPMorgan Asset Management’s Ms. Maharaj.\nWrite to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.com",
