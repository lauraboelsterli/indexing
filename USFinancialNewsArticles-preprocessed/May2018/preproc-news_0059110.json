REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\nSainsbury’s, which last month announced plans to acquire no.3 Asda, posted sales growth of 1 percent in the period, behind market growth of 2.7 percent, and its market share dropped 0.2 percentage points to 15.7 percent, according to the Kantar Worldpanel data.\nThe country’s biggest grocer Tesco ( TSCO.L ) posted sales growth of 2.2 percent, with sales at Walmart-owned ( WMT.N ) Asda up 2.8 percent, and no.4 player Morrisons ( MRW.L ) posting a 2.9 percent rise.\n“The sun shone on the grocery market over the past month with record-breaking temperatures, a bank holiday weekend and Royal Wedding fever all contributing to a bumper period,” Kantar’s consumer specialist Chris Hayward said on Wednesday.\nSales of BBQ-related foods like sausages and burgers soared, as did demand for sun cream, Kantar said.
