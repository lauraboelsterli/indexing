    "text": "206 COMMENTS RALEIGH, N.C.—Roughly two-thirds of North Carolina’s children were out of school Wednesday as thousands of teachers marched on the state Capitol in support of increased school funding.\nThe districts that canceled class, affecting nearly one million students, are concentrated in the state’s urban and suburban counties, while most of the state’s 100 counties are rural and their school districts will be open.\nThat divergence isn’t a coincidence, and reflects the growing divide in the state between the liberal cities that drive the state’s economy and the conservative small towns and rural areas that control state politics.\nThe Wake County Public School System, the Raleigh-based district that is the state’s largest with 160,000 students, canceled school after more than 2,500 teachers requested the day off. “We are extremely aware that disrupting family routines puts a burden on parents,” Monika Johnson-Hostler, chair of the Wake County Board of Education, said in a note to parents. “At the same time, the voices of our teachers need to be heard.”\nSouthwest of Wake in rural, chicken-and-pig farming Harnett County, there was no serious discussion of canceling schools, spokeswoman Natalie Ferrell said. Eighty-nine teachers requested the day off, out of 1,500 total, she said, and there were more than enough substitutes available for the county’s 21,000 students.\nThe divide between urban and rural North Carolina is mirrored in the Capitol, where the reaction has split along ideological lines.\nThe state Democratic Party made a promise to invest in schools the first plank in its new policy platform. Many urban Democratic legislators have said they intend to go “RedforEd,” donning red T-shirts and marching alongside teachers.\nIn contrast, the state Republican Party said the protest is wrongheaded and unnecessarily inconveniencing parents and students. The state GOP is renting an indoor bounce-house park Wednesday and inviting children to play for free on the unexpected day off.\nRepublican House Speaker Tim Moore said teachers aren’t giving the legislature credit for increasing teacher pay for the past four years, with another increase scheduled for next year.\n“When we peel back the political rhetoric on teacher pay, the facts indicate North Carolina educators received considerable gains,” he said in a statement.\nThe average teacher salary in North Carolina is an estimated $50,861 this year, compared with a national average of $60,483, according to an April report from the National Education Association. North Carolina ranks 37th in teacher pay, according to the report.\nNorth Carolina is a right-to-work state, and teachers typically must request permission to take a personal day off for this type of action, and be willing to cover the cost of hiring a substitute. The state’s big school boards canceled classes after more teachers requested personal time off than there were substitutes available.\nKeith Poston, executive director of the Public School Forum of North Carolina, which isn’t affiliated with the march but advocates increased state spending, said he sees the rally as teachers reacting to a decade of declining overall spending, from fewer school nurses and teaching assistants to less money for supplies and professional development.\n“They have a front-row seat for the disinvestment in public education,” Mr. Poston said. “Our elected officials, whatever party they’re in, should listen to what they’re saying.”\nThe one-day rally is expected to tie up traffic in downtown Raleigh for most of the day, as teachers and other protesters travel from the North Carolina Association of Educators headquarters to the General Assembly on its opening legislative day.\nTerry Stoops, a former public-school teacher who researches education for Raleigh’s libertarian-leaning John Locke Foundation, said the North Carolina rally is different from those in other states because it is unlikely to change public policy.\n“People will harden their positions,” Mr. Stoops said. “The real motive here is to replace the Republican majority in the General Assembly.”\nDemocratic Sen. Jeff Jackson of Charlotte said that since next year’s budget is essentially set, it is unlikely that the legislature would move money around, as legislators did in West Virginia when they awarded striking teachers a pay raise. Instead the march’s repercussions could be political, he said.\n“My guess is that legislative leaders won’t hear the teachers tomorrow,” he said. “But parents will. When thousands of teachers protest, millions of parents see it.”\nWrite to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com",
