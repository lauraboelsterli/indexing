    "text": "Completes Significant Refinancings\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Clipper Realty Inc. (NYSE:CLPR) (the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of multifamily residential and commercial properties in the New York metropolitan area, today announced financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nGrew revenues by 6.4% to $26.9 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 Completed refinancings of debt at the Flatbush Gardens and Tribeca House properties Declared a dividend of $0.095 per share for the first quarter 2018\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company completed the refinancings (the “Refinancings”) of existing debt on its Flatbush Gardens and Tribeca House properties that lower the interest rates on the loans, fix the rates on the debt of all of its operating properties, reduce annual debt service by approximately $6.6 million and provide additional liquidity. With the proceeds of the Refinancings, the Company repaid the Flatbush Gardens and the Tribeca House loans, and the net remaining proceeds of $21.5 million increased the Company’s cash position.\nDavid Bistricer, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented,\n“We are pleased with the completion of our previously announced debt refinancings at our Flatbush Gardens and Tribeca House properties in February. These new facilities improve our capital structure, mitigate interest rate risk, reduce annual debt service requirements, and provide greater flexibility and liquidity for Clipper Realty to execute our strategic plan.”\n“We are also satisfied with our first quarter 2018 results, which demonstrate solid revenue growth reflecting the quality of our property portfolio and the operational excellence of our team. With strong management and prudent capital improvements, we believe our properties will contribute meaningfully to our cash flow growth over time. As we progress through 2018 and beyond, we remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives, which include driving cash flow, increasing scale, enhancing efficiencies through asset repositioning and expertly operating our high-quality portfolio, to create long-term value for our shareholders. We are excited to continue to grow our portfolio through the development of 107 Columbia Heights and 10 West 65 th Street, which we acquired last year.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenues grew by $1.6 million, or 6.4%, to $26.9 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $25.3 million for the first quarter 2017. The growth was attributable to the acquisition of the 10 West 65 th Street property in October 2017 and increases in residential rent per square foot and occupancy at the Flatbush Gardens and Tribeca House properties.\nNet loss for the first quarter 2018 was $9.0 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to $1.3 million, or $0.03 per share, for the first quarter 2017. Excluding the loss on extinguishment of debt related to the refinancings of approximately $7.0 million, net loss was $2.0 million, or $0.05 per share. Net loss, exclusive of loss on extinguishment of debt, reflects the increase in revenues discussed above, higher real estate taxes, higher general and administrative costs and higher depreciation expense from property improvements and purchase accounting amortization related to the acquisition of the 10 West 65 th Street property.\nAdjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) for the first quarter 2018 was $3.2 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to $4.0 million, or $0.10 per share, for the first quarter 2017. AFFO for the first quarter of 2018 reflects the above-mentioned improvements in revenues and increases in expenses, in addition to higher interest expense preceding the refinancings. AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” at the end of this release.\nBalance Sheet\nNotes payable (excluding unamortized loan costs) was $883.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $855.1 million at December 31, 2017. The balance at March 31, 2018, increased primarily as a result of the Refinancings discussed below.\n2018 Refinancings\nAs previously disclosed, in February 2018, the Company completed the refinancings of the debt of the Flatbush Gardens and Tribeca House properties.\nThe Company refinanced Flatbush Gardens with a ten-year $246 million initial fixed rate secured first mortgage loan with New York Community Bank, the property’s current lender, which matures March 2028, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.5% per annum for the first five years and is interest-only for thirty months.\nThe Company refinanced Tribeca House with a ten-year $360 million fixed rate secured loan which matures March 2028, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.506% per annum and is interest-only for the entire term.\nWith the proceeds, the Company repaid (i) both of the Tribeca House loans totaling $410 million due November 2018, which bore interest at a blended one-month LIBOR + 3.75% annual rate, and (ii) both of the Flatbush Gardens mortgage loans totaling approximately $168 million due October 2024, which bore interest at a fixed 3.875% annual rate. Net remaining proceeds of $21.5 million increased the Company’s cash position.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company continues to strategically develop its properties, selectively repositioning assets and driving ongoing rent growth. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company incurred $12.6 million of capital expenditures, compared to $3.1 million in the same period in 2017. These capital expenditures were largely related to renovation projects at 107 Columbia Heights to develop the property; since acquisition, the Company has funded $2.2 million of these expenditures under a $14.7 million construction loan. Other capital expenditures occurred at the Tribeca House and Flatbush Gardens properties, principally to upgrade units and complete projects previously undertaken. These include the lobbies at Tribeca House and, at Flatbush Gardens, the terrace, security cameras, lighting, mailbox and laundry room installations, and basement area refurbishment.\nDividend\nThe Company today declared its first quarter dividend of $0.095 per share to shareholders of record on May 22, 2018, payable May 29, 2018.\nConference Call and Supplemental Material\nThe Company will host a conference call on May 10, 2018, at 5:00 PM Eastern Time to discuss first quarter 2018 results.

We believe that to understand our performance further, FFO, AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA, and NOI should be compared with our reported net income or income from operations and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nFunds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations\nFFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and impairment adjustments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO is consistent with FFO as defined by NAREIT.\nAFFO is defined by us as FFO excluding amortization of identifiable intangibles incurred in property acquisitions, straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, amortization costs incurred in originating debt, interest rate cap mark-to-market, amortization of non-cash equity compensation, acquisition costs and loss on extinguishment of debt, less recurring capital expenditures.\nHistorical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. FFO is intended to be a standard supplemental measure of operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation and valuation adjustments from net income. We consider FFO useful in evaluating potential property acquisitions and measuring operating performance. We further consider AFFO useful in determining funds available for payment of distributions. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent net income or cash flows from operations computed in accordance with GAAP. You should not consider FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to net income as reliable measures of our operating performance; nor should you consider FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as measures of liquidity.\nNeither FFO nor AFFO measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities computed in accordance with GAAP. Further, FFO and AFFO as disclosed by other REITs might not be comparable to our calculations of FFO and AFFO.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO and AFFO for the periods presented to net loss before allocation to non-controlling interests, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 FFO Net loss $ (8,994 ) $ (1,298 ) Real estate depreciation and amortization\n4,596 3,935 FFO $ (4,398 ) $ 2,637 AFFO FFO $ (4,398 ) $ 2,637 Amortization of real estate tax intangible 118 392 Amortization of above- and below-market leases (479 ) (434 ) Straight-line rent adjustments 256 77 Amortization of debt origination costs 521 721 Interest rate cap mark-to-market (227 ) 137 Amortization of LTIP awards 568 595 Acquisition costs - 21 Loss on extinguishment of debt 6,981 - Recurring capital spending (141 ) (136 ) AFFO $ 3,199 $ 4,010 AFFO Per Share/Unit $ 0.07 $ 0.10 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before allocation to non-controlling interests, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, amortization of identifiable intangibles, straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, amortization of non-cash equity compensation, interest expense (net), acquisition costs and loss on extinguishment of debt.\nWe believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP income from operations or net income. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a meaningful financial measure of our core operating performance.\nHowever, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. Further, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Adjusted EBITDA, and accordingly, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that of other REITs.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented to net loss before allocation to non-controlling interests, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (8,994 ) $ (1,298 ) Real estate depreciation and amortization 4,596 3,935 Amortization of real estate tax intangible 118 392 Amortization of above- and below-market leases (479 ) (434 ) Straight-line rent adjustments 256 77 Amortization of LTIP awards 568 595 Interest expense, net 8,543 8,652 Acquisition costs - 21 Loss on extinguishment of debt 6,981 - Adjusted EBITDA $ 11,589 $ 11,940 Net Operating Income\nWe believe that NOI is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as income from operations plus real estate depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs, amortization of identifiable intangibles and straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases. We believe that this measure is widely recognized and provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income. We use NOI to evaluate our performance because NOI allows us to evaluate the operating performance of our company by measuring the core operations of property performance and capturing trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. NOI is also a widely used metric in valuation of properties.\nHowever, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. Further, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of NOI for the periods presented to income from operations, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 NOI Income from operations $ 6,530 $ 7,354 Real estate depreciation and amortization 4,596 3,935 General and administrative 3,138 2,196 Acquisition costs - 21 Amortization of real estate tax intangible 118 392 Amortization of above- and below-market leases (479 ) (434 ) Straight-line rent adjustments 256 77 NOI $ 14,159 $ 13,541\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006106/en/\nClipper Realty Inc.\nInvestors:\nMichael Frenz, 718-438-2804 x2274\nHead of Capital Markets\nM: 917-576-7750\nmfrenz@clipperrealty.com\nSource: Clipper Realty Inc.",
