Here’s essential reading on today’s developments.\nMUST READS FROM WSJ CITY\nSix years after the eurozone stepped back from the brink, investors once again fear for its future. Markets globally convulsed as investors came to terms with an Italian political crisis that some fear could morph into an existential threat to Europe’s common currency.\nEurope’s deepening troubles and disappointing global growth signals are sparking a rally in haven bonds. The gap between 10-year German and Italian bond yields has now risen above 2.5 percentage points, its widest since 2013. Risk aversion is back, writes Richard Barley for WSJ Heard on the Street.\nEven worse than the sell-off in Italian government bonds and European bank stocks has been the reaction of investors in banks’ bonds, writes Paul J Davies for Heard on the Street. This matters because it feeds directly into the cost of funding for banks and the lending they can supply to the wider economy.\nThe US is planning to announce in the coming weeks a list of Chinese imports that will be subject to 25% tariffs, as well as new China investment restrictions and controls, the White House said. The planned trade and investment barriers are part of a wide-ranging investigation into Chinese violations of US intellectual property.\nThe owner of Dr Pepper and Krispy Kreme is deepening its bet on prepared food through the purchase of Pret A Manger. Privately held JAB Holding said it would acquire the British sandwich chain from Bridgepoint Advisers in a deal that values Pret at around $2 billion including debt.\nOil prices are climbing to levels not seen since before the price crash of late 2014, and the market is ignoring what is often a considerable obstacle for most commodities: a stronger dollar. The traditionally inverse relationship between the dollar and oil prices has been set aside.\nAmazon and Walmart are betting billions on India, but their mightiest rival might be small, family-run shops. These tiny stores, known as kiranas, pay low wages and have little or no rent and many cater to their neighbourhoods by offering instant delivery, interest-free credit and other personalised services.\nIN THE PAPERS\nThree Killed in Suspected Terror Attack in Belgium – WSJ\nItaly’s Democratic Party Say League and Five Star Had Euro Exit Plan – Bloomberg (£)\nNo. 10 Says Abramovich Cannot Work in UK on Israeli Passport – The Guardian\nSturgeon: UK’s Brexit Position ‘Unsustainable’ – Politico\nUS Sanctions Start to Pinch Shipping in Iran – WSJ\nMARKETS TODAY\nUncertainty about Italy’s future in the eurozone weighed on global stocks and continued to push up the country’s borrowing costs.\nShares in Europe fell sharply, with the Stoxx Europe 600 down 1.4%. Italy’s FTSE MIB Index skidded 2.7%, lagged by banks. UniCredit , fell around 6% to bring its losses for the week to 9.6%, while Unione di Banche Italiane, BPER Banca and Intesa Sanpaolo also notched steep declines.\nYields on Italian government debt spiked. Yields on the benchmark 10-year BTP rose 41 basis points, while those on the two-year note rose 148 points. Yields rise as prices fall.\nSpain’s prime minister Mariano Rajoy’s travails were another source of angst as Spanish shares fell 2.6%.\nUS shares were lower in midday trading, with sharp declines for the Dow and S&P 500. The DJIA was 1.5% lower, while the S&P 500 shed 1.2%.\nShare this: WSJ City Previous Amid Eurozone Woes, French Bonds Feel Macron Bump Next Europe's Troubles Ripple Across to Polish, Czech, Swedish Currencies",
