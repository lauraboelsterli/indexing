FILE PHOTO - U.S. Chief of Naval Operations U.S. Navy Admiral John Richardson testifies during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 19, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\nTrump said last week that the United States was withdrawing from a 2015 deal negotiated by the Obama administration.\nThe withdrawal has upset Washington’s European allies, cast uncertainty over global oil supplies and raised the risk of conflict in the Middle East.\n“It is a period of uncertainty that we are entering into right, how the whole world will respond to this latest development,” Chief of U.S. Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson told a small group of reporters.\n“(We have to) remain alert, I mean even a little bit more alert than usual to just be open to any kind of response or new development or something like that,” Richardson added.
