Service firms Schlumberger, Halliburton , and producers Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips were down between 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent.\nThe S&P energy index closed down 1.7 percent on Thursday, while the main indexes ended only slightly lower after recovering from what market participants said was a knee-jerk reaction to President Donald Trump cancelling a planned summit.\nNorth Korea said on Friday it was still open to talks with the United States, saying it hoped the “Trump formula” could resolve the standoff over its nuclear weapons program.\n“With the long weekend ahead low volume should be expected, paving the way for a range bound trading session,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.\nMarkets are closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.\n“When you have light volume is that sometimes it can have a larger impact on the market versus when they (volume) are heavy,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\nAt 8:55 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 56 points, or 0.23 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 7.25 points, or 0.27 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 3 points, or 0.04 percent.\nAmong other stocks, Foot Locker surged 14.2 percent after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Nike , for whom the footwear retailer is often seen as a leading indicator, gained 1.1 percent.\nGap plunged 7 percent after quarterly same-store sales came below estimates.\nAutodesk fell 5 percent after the AutoCAD owner forecast second-quarter profit below expectations.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on “Financial Stability and Central Bank Transparency” at a conference in Stockholm, Sweden at 09:20 a.m. ET.
