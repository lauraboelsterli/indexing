(CSE:KBB) (“ Kaneh Bosm ” or the “Company” ) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Marathon Global Inc. to acquire 50% of its issued and outstanding shares.\nMarathon Global has an exclusive agreement with Cosmos Holdings, a European based Pharmaceutical distributor to procure and distribute medical cannabis products and all cannabis derivatives for clients of Cosmos in approved Countries within their distribution network of 110 clients representing approximately 35,000 pharmacies in 16 Countries.\nThis relationship brings an unparalleled ability to supply the overwhelming demand for Cannabis and Cannabis extracts in Europe as COSMOS brings generations worth of experience and relationship to Kaneh Bosm.\n“We are pleased to be Marathon’s exclusive partner and look forward to fulfilling the demand in the European medical cannabis space now and in the future, “states Grigorios Siokas, Cosmos CEO.\nMarathon's other major shareholder represents a number of Canadian LPs that are positioned to provide the supply needed under the arrangement.\nThis distribution carries on the Company's existing distribution business through the BioCanna ADM.\nThe Company's BioCanna ADM automated retail system is a valuable tool for retailers to control product access and as a labour saving device.\nThe BioCanna ADM retail system is unique in this sector as it encompasses the 5 crucial elements identified by Ret. Major Neill Franklin, executive director for LEAP, for safe, reliable, and successful automated Cannabis retail. Those elements are:\naccess control (no minors or un-prescribed patients) purchase volume control (monthly or daily quantity limits) secure storage of product (climate controlled and theft proof) transactional oversight by regulators via software monitoring a proven track record in a controlled substance/products environment\nThe Company sees a unique marriage between its agreements with Marathon and access to 35,000 pharmacies in Europe, Marathon's integrated Canadian LP suppliers, and its agreements with the ADM retail system. Presently, there are several thousand of our Kiosk manufacturer’s units operating across western Europe with many in the retail pharmaceutical dispensing marketplace. The Kiosks are proven to be reliable and profitable.\nThe Company is continuing discussions with each group to further identify synergy and expand each relationship to maximize the cross-pollination between existing agreements.\nUnder the terms of the transaction the company is paying CAD$1 million and 15 million shares.\nA finder’s fee is payable on this transaction.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of Kaneh Bosm Biotechnology Inc.\n“ Michael Martinz ”\nMichael Martinz\nPresident, Director\nTHE CSE HAS NOT REVIEWED AND DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS RELEASE.\nThis news release includes certain statements that may be deemed “ forward-looking statements”.
