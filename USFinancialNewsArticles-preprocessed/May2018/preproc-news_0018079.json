    "text": "ONEONTA, Ala., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Otelco Inc. (NASDAQ:OTEL), a wireline telecommunications services provider in Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia, today announced results for its first 2018. Key highlights for Otelco include:\nTotal revenues of $16.7 million. Operating income of $4.1 million. Net income of $2.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) of $6.1 million.\nRevenue and operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, declined 3.8% and 19.1%, respectively, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. It should be noted that nearly half of the operating income decline was related to one-time expenses, including the special bonus given to Otelco employees during first quarter, as the Company shared a portion of the benefit of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.\n“Holding our operating margins, in spite of continued declines in our residential subscriber base, remains our focus,” commented Rob Souza, President and CEO of Otelco. “And, we continue to work on minimizing the impact of service delivery cost increases during first quarter. In addition, we have made modest price-point adjustments and fee changes to help support operating margins. Our team continues to identify efficiencies in our customer service processes to meet customer expectations while improving the cost structure of our business. In addition, we are analyzing new revenue opportunities resulting from expanding the reach of our fiber network for both current and future customers.”\nNet income increased to $2.0 million in first quarter 2018 from $1.6 million in the same quarter of 2017. Cash increased $2.7 million during first quarter 2018 to $6.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $3.6 million at the end of 2017. Both measures were positively affected by a reduction in cash interest expense of $1.0 million associated with the Company’s new credit agreement. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the provision for taxes and created a tax refund of $1.0 million during first quarter 2018. In addition to its scheduled principal payment for second quarter 2018, the Company anticipates making a voluntary prepayment to CoBank to continue to reduce its long-term debt. The Company’s ratio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined below), was 2.95 at March 31, 2018.\nThe Company expects to make capital investments in its network and the new billing and operations support system in 2018 at a level similar to the $8.5 million it invested in 2017. Going forward, the Company will continue to deploy new fiber to meet its ten-year ACAM commitment of providing high-speed Internet service options to its customers. In April 2018, the FCC announced that another $500 million would be included in the Connect America Fund. The additional funding is expected to be apportioned to companies already receiving ACAM and Legacy support. Once finalized by the FCC, the additional funding is expected to increase Otelco’s overall support with some of the funding being paid retroactively for 2017. Otelco would recognize this additional revenue as it is received and adjust its build-out program for the marginal increase in speed and location commitments.\n“After nearly eighteen months of investigation, vendor selection, conversion planning, system’s development and employee training, we are preparing to convert all of our operational and billing systems onto a single platform during second quarter 2018,” noted Souza. “The process has been designed to have minimal impact on serving our customers. However, there are short planned periods where we will have to delay new customer orders while the databases of the old systems are rolled over to the new system. Our employees have worked hard throughout this conversion process. We are excited to be updating to the new technology and look forward to the operational benefits it will offer our customers and the financial benefits our stockholders will see in our financial results.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2018 2017 Amount Percent Revenues $ 16,726 $ 17,380 $ (654 ) (3.8 ) % Operating income $ 4,061 $ 5,020 $ (959 ) (19.1 ) % Interest expense $ (1,459 ) $ (2,611 ) $ (1,152 ) (44.1 ) % Net income $ 1,996 $ 1,608 $ 388 24.1 % Net income per share $ 0.59 $ 0.48 $ 0.11 22.9 % Diluted net income per share $ 0.58 $ 0.47 $ 0.11 23.4 % Consolidated EBITDA (a) $ 6,137 $ 7,198 $ (1,061 ) (14.7 ) % Capital expenditures $ 1,175 $ 1,270 $ (95 ) (7.5 ) % Reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to Net Income Twelve Months Three Months Ended March 31, Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 Net income $ 1,996 $ 1,608 $ 12,502 Add: Depreciation 1,735 1,739 6,997 Interest expense less interest income 1,337 2,302 7,463 Interest expense - amortized loan cost 121 310 4,634 Income tax expense 774 1,004 (8,086 ) Amortization - intangibles 84 101 359 Loan fees 19 39 2,426 Stock-based compensation (senior management) 71 95 285 Consolidated EBITDA (a) $ 6,137 $ 7,198 $ 26,580 (a) Consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus consolidated net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and certain other fees, expenses and non-cash charges reducing consolidated net income. Consolidated EBITDA is a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Consolidated EBITDA corresponds to the definition of Consolidated EBITDA in the Company’s credit facility. The lenders under the Company’s credit facility utilize this measure to determine compliance with credit facility requirements. The Company uses Consolidated EBITDA as an operational performance measurement to focus attention on the operational generation of cash, which is used for reinvestment into the business; to repay its debt and to pay interest on its debt; to pay income taxes; and for other corporate requirements. The Company reports Consolidated EBITDA to allow current and potential investors to understand this performance metric and because the Company believes that it provides current and potential investors with helpful information with respect to the Company’s operating performance. However, Consolidated EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s presentation of Consolidated EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nOtelco Inc. - Key Operating Statistics March 31, December 31, % Change from 2018 2017 December 31, 2017 Business/Enterprise CLEC Voice lines 16,030 16,239 (1.3 ) % HPBX seats 11,369 11,338 0.3 % Data lines 3,325 3,359 (1.0 ) % Wholesale network lines 2,398 2,417 (0.8 ) % RLEC Voice lines 15,212 15,400 (1.2 ) % Data lines 1,586 1,602 (1.0 ) % Access line equivalents (b) 49,920 50,355 (0.9 ) % Residential CLEC Voice lines 621 628 (1.1 ) % Data lines 2,792 2,815 (0.8 ) % RLEC Voice lines 18,725 19,147 (2.2 ) % Data lines 18,558 18,771 (1.1 ) % Other services 3,485 3,561 (2.1 ) % Access line equivalents (b) 44,181 44,922 (1.6 ) % Otelco access line equivalents (b) 94,101 95,277 (1.2 ) % (b ) The Company defines access line equivalents as retail and wholesale voice lines, data lines (including cable modems, digital subscriber lines, other broadband connections and dedicated data access trunks) and other services (including entertainment and security services).\nThe Company uses the ratio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EBITDA for the last twelve months as an operational performance measurement. Such ratio is a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company reports such ratio to allow current and potential investors to understand this performance metric. The Company also believes that it provides current and potential investors with helpful information with respect to the Company’s operating performance, including the Company’s ability to generate earnings sufficient to service its debt, and enhances understanding of the Company’s financial performance and highlights operational trends. However, such ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s presentation of such ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled ratios used by other companies. The table below provides the calculation of such ratio as of March 31, 2018.\nRatio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EBITDA as of March 31, 2018 ($000) Notes payable $ 82,946 Debt issuance costs 1,879 Notes outstanding $ 84,825 Less cash (6,288 ) Notes outstanding, net of cash $ 78,537 Consolidated EBITDA for the last twelve months $ 26,580 Ratio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EBITDA 2.95 FINANCIAL DISCUSSION FOR FIRST QUARTER 2018:\nRevenues\nTotal revenues decreased 3.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, to $16.7 million from $17.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the traditional access revenue affected by the FCC’s inter-carrier compensation reform order (the “FCC’s order”) and the decrease in residential RLEC access line equivalents. The table below provides the components of the Company’s revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period of 2017.\nThree Months Ended March 31, Change 2018 2017 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) (Unaudited) Local services $ 5,489 $ 5,599 $ (110 ) (2.0 )% Network access 5,234 5,712 (478 ) (8.4 ) Internet 3,896 3,909 (13 ) (0.3 ) Transport services 1,191 1,149 42 3.7 Video and security 740 765 (25 ) (3.3 ) Managed services 176 246 (70 ) (28.5 ) Total $ 16,726 $ 17,380 $ (654 ) (3.8 ) Local services revenue decreased 2.0% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, to $5.5 million from $5.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decline in RLEC residential voice access lines on local service and long distance and the impact of the FCC’s order, which reduced or eliminated intrastate and local cellular revenue, accounted for a decrease of $0.2 million. A portion of the RLEC decrease is recovered through the Connect America Fund, which is categorized as interstate access revenue. Wholesale services in a municipality in Massachusetts provided an increase of $0.1 million. Network access revenue decreased 8.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, to $5.2 million from $5.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. A $0.2 million decrease in switched and special access, a $0.2 million decrease in end user-based fees and a $0.1 million decrease in the Connect America Fund and transition payments accounted for the decline. Internet revenue was unchanged at $3.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, and three months ended March 31, 2017. Increased speed and additional data customers in a municipality in Massachusetts were offset by the reduction in residential RLEC customers. Transport services revenue increased 3.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, to $1.2 million from $1.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting small increases in both wide area network and wholesale transport services. Video and security revenue decreased 3.3% to just over $0.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, from just under $0.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting an increase in IPTV revenue, offset by decreases in basic cable and pay-per-view revenue. Managed services revenue decreased 28.5% to just under $0.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, from just over $0.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting one-time revenue in first quarter 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased 2.5% to $12.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $12.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Cost of services increased 1.9% to $8.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $7.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Cable and internet; central office and circuit; pole rental; and network operations expenses each increased $0.1 million while access and toll expense decreased $0.2 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.4% to $2.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $2.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was attributable to $0.2 million in training expense associated with the Company’s new billing and operating support system, which will be implemented in second quarter 2018, and $0.1 million in higher legal expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in senior management and stock compensation expense. Depreciation and amortization was unchanged at $1.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017.\nOperating Income\nOperating income in the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased 19.1% to $4.1 million from $5.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, based on the mentioned changes in revenue and operating expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased 44.1% to $1.5 million from $2.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Lower interest rates accounted for just under $1.0 million of the decrease and lower loan cost amortization accounted for just under $0.2 million.\nOther Income\nOther income was unchanged at $0.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017. The Company received dividends from CoBank related to loans with the bank for a partial year in both 2016 and 2017, which were paid in the subsequent year. These dividends constitute the majority of other income.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, implemented at the end of 2017, increased bonus depreciation from 50% to 100% and reduced the maximum federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. While lower interest expense increased net income, the net effect of the new law was to lower the provision for federal income taxes and raise the provision for state income taxes, producing a reduction of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to the same period in 2017.\nNet Income\nBased on the changes noted above, net income increased $0.4 million to $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily driven by the reductions in interest with the implementation of the new CoBank credit facility and the lower effective tax rate inherent in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nConsolidated EBITDA\nBased on the changes noted above, Consolidated EBITDA decreased $1.1 million to $6.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, when compared to $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Stock based compensation and other excluded expenses are added back in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA. See financial tables for a reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to net income.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 million compared to $3.6 million at December 31, 2017. A $1.1 million principal payment was made at the end of March 2018, reducing the outstanding balance on our credit facility to $84.8 million. The Company’s ratio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EBITDA for the last twelve months was 2.95 at March 31, 2018.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.3 million in the same period in 2017.\nFirst Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nOtelco has scheduled a conference call, which will be broadcast live over the internet, on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time).
