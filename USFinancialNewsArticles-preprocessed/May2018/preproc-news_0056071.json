    "text": "0 COMMENTS MEXICO CITY—Mexico ran up a moderate $289 million trade deficit in April as both imports and exports posted double-digit growth from a year earlier, unfazed by negotiations to redraw a pact with the country’s main trading partner.\nExports expanded 17% from April of 2017 to $37.2 billion, including a 54% jump in oil exports and a 15% rise in shipments of factory-made goods, the National Statistics Institute said Friday.\nImports rose 21% to $37.5 billion, with Mexico bringing in more petroleum products, equipment and machinery, and producer goods such as components for manufacturing, the agency said.\nThe increases in imports and exports from a year before were positively affected by the shift in the Easter holiday week to March this year, which meant April had more working days than in 2017.\nThe country’s overall trade continues expanding from last year’s record $829 billion, unaffected by occasionally contentious talks between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nRelated\nNafta Talks Stalled on U.S. Auto Demands Mexican Inflation Eased Further in Early May Mexican Economy Picked Up Steam in First Quarter Analysis: How to Navigate the Tumult on Trade Exports in the first four months of 2018 rose 12.6% to $142.4 billion and imports were up 12.6% at $144.5 billion.\n“The existing Nafta is still working, our exports are growing. Of course there’s uncertainty, which is what we want to combat,” Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told the Televisa network Friday.\nMr. Guajardo said he thinks there is a 40% chance an agreement can be reached before Mexico’s presidential election on July 1, and an 80% chance of getting a deal done before the U.S. midterm elections in November.\nNafta negotiations have recently been bogged down over rules of origin in the auto sector and U.S. demands such as a so-called sunset clause that would allow the pact to expire after five years unless explicitly renewed and the elimination of certain mechanisms for settling disputes.\nVehicles and auto parts, which account for a third of Mexico’s manufacturing exports, are at the center of the Nafta negotiations where the U.S. is demanding greater regional and U.S. content.\nEnergy trade is less controversial for the U.S., as Mexico imports most of its gasoline and natural gas from its northern neighbor. Mexico ran up a $6.5 billion petroleum trade deficit in the January-April period, partly offset by a $4.4 billion surplus in non petroleum trade.\nWrite to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com",
