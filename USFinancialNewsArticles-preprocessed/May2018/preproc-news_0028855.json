Fourth quarter fiscal 2018 diluted EPS was $0.06 on a GAAP basis, and $0.55 on a non-GAAP basis, up 17% sequentially. Fiscal year 2018 revenue of $1,020.7 million increased 18.9% year-over-year. Fiscal year 2018 diluted EPS was $(0.09) on a GAAP basis, inclusive of an impact from U.S. tax reform of ($0.77). Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.63, up 30.4% year-over-year. Integration of eTouch acquisition on track, strengthening Virtusa’s leadership in digital engineering and deepening the Company’s tech domain expertise.\nSOUTHBOROUGH, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virtusa Corporation (NASDAQ GS: VRTU), a global provider of digital engineering and IT outsourcing services that accelerate business outcomes for its clients, today reported consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Consolidated Financial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $281.3 million, an increase of 6.6% sequentially and 24.5% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, (1) fourth quarter revenue increased 5.7% sequentially and 21.7% year-over-year. Virtusa’s previously announced acquisition of eTouch, which closed on March 12, 2018, contributed approximately $5.7 million of revenue to the fiscal fourth quarter.\nVirtusa reported GAAP income from operations of $16.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase from $13.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and $10.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nGAAP net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to net loss of ($11.1) million, or ($0.38) per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and net income of $10.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Fourth quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP net income includes $4.6 million of net unrealized foreign exchange losses and $3.2 million of mandatory repatriation tax due to increased ownership in Polaris, which were not included in Virtusa’s prior guidance.\nNon-GAAP Results :\nNon-GAAP income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and acquisition related charges, was $27.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase from $26.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and from $18.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income was $18.3 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $15.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and compared to $12.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFiscal Year 2018 Consolidated Financial Results\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, revenue was $1,020.7 million, an increase of 18.9% compared to $858.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 18.2% year-over-year.\nVirtusa reported GAAP income from operations of $46.4 million for fiscal year 2018, an increase from $18.4 million for fiscal year 2017.\nGAAP net loss available to common shareholders was ($2.7) million for fiscal year 2018, or a loss of ($0.09) per diluted share, compared to net income of $11.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share for fiscal year 2017. Virtusa’s fiscal year 2018 GAAP net loss includes a tax expense of $22.7 million, or ($0.77) per diluted share, related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted in December 2017.\nNon-GAAP Results:\nNon-GAAP income from operations was $87.1 million for fiscal year 2018, an increase from $55.7 million for fiscal year 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income was $52.8 million for fiscal year 2018, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $37.6 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe Company ended fiscal year 2018 with $244.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments (2) . Cash flow from operations was $8.5 million for the fourth quarter and $62.7 million for fiscal year 2018.\nManagement Commentary\nKris Canekeratne, Virtusa’s Chairman and CEO, stated, “We are pleased with our strong fiscal 2018 financial results, increasing our top-line by 19% and ending the year in excess of $1 billion of revenue for the first time in our company’s history. Our continued above-industry growth is a testament to the success of our strategy. As we look to fiscal 2019 and beyond, we believe Virtusa is in a position of strength, given our ability to help transform our clients’ businesses at every level through end-to-end digital transformation and IT platform rationalization and modernization, driving significant ROI for our clients. ”\nRanjan Kalia, Chief Financial Officer, said, “We delivered strong fiscal year 2018 financial results highlighted by approximately 19% revenue growth, 200 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin accretion, and 30% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Our fourth quarter revenue was modestly below the midpoint of our guidance range, and our non-GAAP EPS was above the midpoint driven by slightly better than expected eTouch contribution. Looking to fiscal 2019, our current guidance calls for continued above-industry organic revenue growth, coupled with earnings growing faster than consolidated revenue growth.”\nFinancial Outlook\nVirtusa management provided the following current financial guidance:\nFirst quarter fiscal 2019 revenue is expected to be in the range of $293.5 to $301.5 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.13. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.51. Fiscal year 2019 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,230 to $1,270 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.66. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.32.\nIn accordance with US GAAP, Virtusa applies the if-converted method to its convertible preferred shares when reporting its fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 results. The if-converted method is used to calculate the share impact of convertible securities. Under this method, only when the convertible securities are considered dilutive are they then included in the computation of weighted average shares outstanding in reported results and full year guidance.\nFourth quarter GAAP Income per share was calculated by including the impact of dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares in net income available to common stockholders and excluding the impact of the convertible preferred shares from the weighted average shares. Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was calculated by excluding the impact of dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares from net income available to common stockholders and including the impact of the convertible preferred shares in the weighted average shares outstanding as these shares were dilutive on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP EPS guidance was calculated under the assumption that these convertible preferred shares will be anti-dilutive in fiscal 2019. Thus, in determining full fiscal year 2019 GAAP EPS guidance, dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares are deducted from net income available to common stockholders and the convertible preferred shares have been excluded from weighted average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS guidance was calculated under the assumption that these convertible preferred shares will be dilutive in fiscal year 2019. Thus, in determining full fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP EPS guidance, dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares are excluded from net income available to common stockholders and the impact of the convertible preferred shares are included in the weighted average shares outstanding.\nThe Company’s first quarter and fiscal year 2019 diluted GAAP EPS estimates are both based on average share counts of approximately 30.5 million (assuming no further exercises of stock-based awards). The Company’s first quarter and fiscal year 2019 diluted Non-GAAP EPS estimates are both based on average share counts of approximately 33.5 million (assuming no further exercises of stock-based awards). GAAP and Non-GAAP average share counts assume a stock price of $49.01, which was derived from the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the five trading days ended on May 9, 2018. Deviations from this stock price may cause actual diluted EPS to vary based on share dilution from Virtusa’s stock options and stock appreciation rights.\nConference Call and Webcast\nVirtusa will host a conference call today, May 15, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results, current financial guidance, and other corporate developments.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with Virtusa’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nVirtusa believes the following financial measures will provide additional insights to measure the operational performance of the business.\nVirtusa presents constant currency revenue growth rates to provide insights into, and a framework for assessing, how Virtusa's revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations (see footnote 1). Virtusa presents a reconciliation of its cash and cash equivalents to total cash, cash equivalents, short term and long term investments which Virtusa believes provides insight into its cash position and overall liquidity (see footnote 2). Virtusa also presents the following consolidated statements of income (loss) measures that exclude, when applicable, acquisition-related charges, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, non-recurring third party financing costs, the tax impact of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and the impact from the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation (“Tax Act”) to provide further insights into the comparison of Virtusa’s operating results among the periods: Non-GAAP income from operations: income from operations, as reported on Virtusa’s consolidated statements of income, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges. Non-GAAP operating margin: non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of reported revenues. Non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders: net income (loss) available to Virtusa common stockholders, as reported on our consolidated statements of income (loss), excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, restructuring charges, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, non-recurring third party financing costs, the tax impact of the above items, the tax impact of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and the impact from the Tax Act. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: diluted earnings (loss) per share, as reported on Virtusa’s consolidated statements of income (loss) available to Virtusa common stockholders, excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, restructuring charges, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, non-recurring third party financing costs, the tax impact of the above items, the tax impact of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and the impact from the Tax Act. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is also subject to dilutive and anti-dilutive requirements of the if-converted method related to our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that could result in a difference between GAAP to non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of each Non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure:\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended March 31, Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 GAAP income from operations $ 16,375 $ 10,224 $ 46,387 $ 18,371 Add: Stock-based compensation expense 7,363 5,100 27,411 22,123 Add: Acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges (a) 4,191 3,430 13,278 15,217 Non-GAAP income from operations $ 27,929 $ 18,754 $ 87,076 $ 55,711 GAAP operating margin 5.8 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 2.1 % Effect of above adjustments to income from operations 4.1 % 3.8 % 4.0 % 4.4 % Non-GAAP operating margin 9.9 % 8.3 % 8.5 % 6.5 % GAAP net income (loss) available to Virtusa common stockholders $ 1,795 $ 10,465 $ (2,709 ) $ 11,858 Add: Stock-based compensation expense 7,363 5,100 27,411 22,123 Add: Acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges (a) 4,259 3,430 13,346 15,217 Add: Non-recurring third party financing costs (i) 701 - 701 - Add: Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses (b) 4,562 (5,811 ) 3,543 (3,009 ) Add: Impact from Tax Act (h) 2,909 - 22,724 - Tax adjustments (c) (4,239 ) 536 (14,037 ) (6,861 ) Noncontrolling interest, net of taxes (d) (143 ) (824 ) (1,469 ) (1,699 ) Non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders $ 17,207 $ 12,896 $ 49,510 $ 37,629 GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share (f) $ 0.06 $ 0.34 $ (0.09 ) $ 0.39 Effect of stock-based compensation expense (g) 0.22 0.17 0.85 0.73 Effect of acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges (a) (g) 0.13 0.12 0.41 0.51 Effect of non-recurring third party financing costs (i) (g) 0.02 - 0.02 - Effect of foreign currency transaction (gains) losses (b) (g) 0.14 (0.19 ) 0.11 (0.10 ) Effect of tax impact from Tax Act (g) (h) 0.09 - 0.70 - Effect of tax adjustments (c) (g) (0.13 ) 0.02 (0.43 ) (0.22 ) Effect of noncontrolling interest (d) (g) - (0.03 ) (0.05 ) (0.06 ) Effect on dividend on Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (f) (g) 0.03 - 0.10 - Effect of change in dilutive shares for non-GAAP (f) (0.01 ) - 0.01 - Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (e) (g) $ 0.55 $ 0.43 $ 1.63 $ 1.25 (a) Acquisition-related charges include, when applicable, amortization of purchased intangibles, external deal costs, acquisition-related retention bonuses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, changes in fair value related to deferred acquisition payments, charges for impairment of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs including integration expenses consisting of outside professional and consulting services and direct and incremental travel costs.

(d) Noncontrolling interest represents the minority shareholders interest of Polaris. (e) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is subject to rounding. (f) During the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2018, the weighted average shares outstanding of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of 3,000,000 and 2,728,022 respectively, were excluded from the calculations of GAAP diluted earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive using the if-converted method.\nThe following table provides the non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders and non-GAAP dilutive weighted average shares outstanding using if-converted method to calculate the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders $ 17,207 $ 12,896 $ 49,510 $ 37,629 Add: Dividends and accretion on Series A Convertible Preferred Stock $ 1,088 $ - $ 3,262 $ - Non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders and assumed conversion $ 18,295 $ 12,896 $ 52,772 $ 37,629 GAAP dilutive weighted average shares outstanding 30,427,258 30,151,590 29,397,350 30,129,378 Add: Dilutive effect of employee stock options and unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units - - 728,820 - Add: Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as converted 3,000,000 - 2,250,000 - Non-GAAP dilutive weighted average shares outstanding 33,427,258 30,151,590 32,376,170 30,129,378 (g) To the extent the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is dilutive using the if-converted method, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is included in the weighted average shares outstanding to determine non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. (h) The U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017. This resulted in a tax expense of $22.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, comprised of a provisional repatriation tax expense of $17.8 million and a provisional net deferred tax expense of $4.9 million. The adjustment to GAAP net income (loss) available to Virtusa common stockholders only includes these provisional impacts. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. The GAAP earnings (loss) per share impact on the Tax Act adjustment using GAAP weighted average shares outstanding was $(0.77). The non-GAAP earnings per share impact on the Tax Act adjustment using non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding was $(0.70). (i) Non-recurring third party financing costs related to the new credit facility Footnotes\n(1) To determine sequential revenue change in constant currency for the Company's fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue from entities reporting in U.K. Pounds (GBP), Euros, and Swedish Krona (SEK) were converted into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect for the three months ended December 31, 2017, rather than the actual exchange rate in effect for the three months ended March 31, 2018. To determine year-over-year revenue change in constant currency for the Company's fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue from entities reporting in U.K. Pounds (GBP), Euros, and Swedish Krona (SEK) were converted into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect for the three months ended March 31, 2017, rather than the actual exchange rate in effect for the three months ended March 31, 2018. To determine year-over-year revenue change in constant currency for the Company's full fiscal year 2018, revenue from entities reporting in U.K. Pounds (GBP), Euros, and Swedish Krona (SEK) were converted into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, rather than the actual exchange rate in effect for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018. The average exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 are included in the table below:\nAverage U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 GBP 1.24 1.33 1.40 1.30 1.33 Euro 1.07 1.18 1.23 1.10 1.18 SEK 0.11 0.12 0.12 0.11 0.12 2) The Company considers the total measure of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments to be an important indicator of the Company's overall liquidity. All of the Company's investments are classified as available-for-sale, including the Company's long-term investments which consist of fixed income securities, including government agency bonds and municipal and corporate bonds, which meet the credit rating and diversification requirements of the Company's investment policy as approved by the Company's audit committee and board of directors.\n(3) Earnings per share amounts for each quarter may not necessarily total to the yearly earnings per share due to the weighting of shares outstanding on a quarterly and year to date basis.\n(4) On March 3, 2016 Virtusa acquired a majority interest in Polaris. In accordance with US GAAP, Polaris financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 and assets and liabilities as of that date have been consolidated in full into Virtusa’s financial statements. Net assets attributable to ownership in Polaris by minority shareholders (Non-controlling Interest) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $17.5 million at March 31, 2018. Profit attributable to minority shareholders (Non-controlling Interest) in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $1.7 million on a GAAP basis and $1.9 million on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding, the benefits of Virtusa’s organizational changes, management's forecast of financial performance, the growth of our business and management's plans, objectives, and strategies.
