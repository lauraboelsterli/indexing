Cordani, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to deliver exceptional value for our customers and clients with market-leading solutions that provide greater affordability, personalization and predictability.”\nTotal revenues 1 in the quarter were $11.4 billion, an increase of 9% over first quarter 2017, led by continued strong business growth in Cigna's Commercial Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits segments.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, shareholders’ net income was $915 million, or $3.72 per share, compared with $598 million, or $2.30 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nCigna's adjusted income from operations 2 for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.0 billion, or $4.11 per share, compared with $719 million, or $2.77 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.

Cigna's medical customer base 3 grew by 327,000 customers in first quarter 2018 to a total of 16.2 million customers, driven by continued organic growth in our Select, Individual and Middle Market segments.

For more information about Cigna's proposed acquisition of Express Scripts, please visit http://www.makinghealthcaresimple.com .\nNotes:\n1.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” through full retrospective restatement. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 had no impact to shareholders’ net income, adjusted income from operations or cash flows, however the adoption resulted in certain reclassifications in the Consolidated and Global Health Care Segment income statements. Additional information regarding adoption of the new revenue accounting standard is available in the Company’s Form 10-Q expected to be filed on May 3, 2018.\n2.\nAdjusted income (loss) from operations is defined as shareholders’ net income (loss) excluding the following after-tax adjustments: net realized investment results, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. Special items are identified in Exhibit 2 of this earnings release.\nAdjusted income (loss) from operations is a measure of profitability used by Cigna’s management because it presents the underlying results of operations of Cigna’s businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders’ net income. This consolidated measure is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders’ net income. See Exhibits 1 and 2 for a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to shareholders’ net income.\n3.\nGlobal medical customers include individuals who meet any one of the following criteria: are covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement, or service agreement issued by Cigna; have access to Cigna's provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or have medical claims and services that are administered by Cigna.\n4.\nManagement is not able to provide a reconciliation to shareholders’ net income (loss) on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results and (ii) future special items. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. As such, any associated estimate and its impact on shareholders’ net income could vary materially.\n5.\nThe Company’s outlook excludes the potential effects of any share repurchases or business combinations that may occur after the date of this earnings release. Also, the Company’s outlook is presented on the basis of the new revenue accounting standard (ASU 2014-09) adopted effective January 1, 2018.\n6.\nThe measure “consolidated operating revenues” is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, “total revenues.” We define consolidated operating revenues as total revenues excluding realized investment results. We exclude realized investment results from this measure because our portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each segment. As a result, gains or losses created in this process may not be indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business. See Exhibit 1 for a reconciliation of consolidated operating revenues to total revenues.\n7.\nAdjusted margin, after-tax, is calculated by dividing adjusted income (loss) from operations by operating revenues for each segment.\n8.\nOperating ratios are defined as follows:\n• Total Commercial medical care ratio represents medical costs as a percentage of premiums for all commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally.\n• Total Government medical care ratio represents medical costs as a percentage of premiums for Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicaid products.\n• Global Health Care operating expense ratio represents operating expenses excluding acquisition related amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue in the Global Health Care segment.\n9.\nGlobal Health Care medical costs payable are presented net of reinsurance and other recoverables. The gross Global Health Care medical costs payable balance was $2.93 billion as of March 31, 2017 and $2.72 billion as of December 31, 2017.\n10.\nCigna owns a 50% noncontrolling interest in its China joint venture. Cigna's 50% share of the joint venture’s earnings is reported in Other Revenues using the equity method of accounting under GAAP. As such, the premiums and fees and policy counts for the Global Supplemental Benefits segment do not include the China joint venture.\n11.\nThe measure “consolidated adjusted tax rate” is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, “consolidated effective tax rate.” We define consolidated adjusted tax rate as the income tax rate applicable to the Company’s pre-tax income excluding net realized investment results, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. Management is not able to provide a reconciliation to the consolidated effective tax rate on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results and (ii) future special items.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release, and oral statements made with respect to information contained in this release, may contain within the meaning of the Private 1995.
