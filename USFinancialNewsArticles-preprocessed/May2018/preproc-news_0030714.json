REUTERS/Antonio Bronic/File Photo\nDalic, who also quit her job as economy minister, denied any wrongdoing but said she did not want to be a burden on the government.\nThere was no immediate comment from Agrokor or its creditors and it was not immediately clear if Dalic’s departure would hold up the efforts to save Croatia’s largest private company from bankruptcy.\nDalic led efforts to save the food producer and retailer after it was put under state-run administration in April 2017, weighed down by debt accrued during an ambitious expansion drive.\nLast week, local news portal Index.hr published what it said was one-year-old email correspondence between Dalic and financial and legal experts she consulted while preparing an emergency law to save the firm which is the Balkans’ biggest employer.\nSome of the experts named in that correspondence were later engaged as consultants by a firm advising the government during the restructuring process.\nThe opposition, led by the Social Democrats and centre-right Most (“Bridge”) party, said it was unacceptable that Dalic had allowed the same consultants who drew up the rescue plan to be paid to roll it out, calling it a conflict of interest.\n“I have done nothing wrong nor illegal but the perception, which in the politics matters, is as it is,” Dalic told reporters.\n“I don’t want to a burden to the government. I expect the relevant bodies to investigate who revealed the fragments of the email correspondence which is against the law,” she said.\nAgrokor creditors, which include foreign and local banks, bondholders and suppliers, must vote on a settlement outlined in the emergency law by July 10.\nPrime Minister Andrej Plenkovic accepted Dalic’s resignation and said the government would press on with the process.\n“The basic goal of our efforts over Agrokor, in which Dalic had a leading role, has been achieved,” he said.\n“I’m satisfied with that. I just regret that the process was not a bit more transparent. I’m sorry about Dalic leaving the government. It is our task now to reach the settlement within the legal deadline,” he added.\nHe did not name her replacement. Reporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Andrew Heavens",
