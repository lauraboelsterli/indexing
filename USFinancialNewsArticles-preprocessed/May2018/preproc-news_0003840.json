    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (“CorEnergy” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the first quarter, ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Performance Summary\nFirst quarter financial highlights are as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Per Share Total Basic Diluted Net Income (Attributable to Common Stockholders) 1 $ 5,310,833 $ 0.45 $ 0.45 NAREIT Funds From Operations (NAREIT FFO) 1\n$ 11,449,252 $ 0.96 $ 0.89 Funds From Operations (FFO) 1 $ 11,413,799 $ 0.96 $ 0.89 Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) 1 $ 12,027,196 $ 1.01 $ 0.91 Dividends Declared to Common Stockholders $ 0.75 1 Management uses AFFO as a measure of long-term sustainable operational performance. NAREIT FFO, FFO, and AFFO are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of NAREIT FFO, FFO and AFFO, as presented, to Net Income Attributable to CorEnergy Stockholders are included at the end of this press release. See Note 1 for additional information.\nRecent Developments\nMaintained dividend: Declared common stock dividend of $0.75 per share for the first quarter 2018, in line with the previous ten quarterly dividends Received participating rents: Continued to receive participating rents on the Pinedale LGS Tenant relationship: Entered into discussions with Energy XXI Gulf Coast (EGC) regarding its post-bankruptcy recovery efforts, while intending to preserve long-term value for our investors MoGas Pipeline: Continued preparation of the FERC rate case to be filed in second quarter 2018\n“During the first quarter, we prepared for the upcoming FERC rate case for the MoGas Pipeline and commenced our annual asset inspections, including the Grand Isle Gathering System and the Portland Terminal. Regarding our offer to enter into discussions with EGC, traditionally we have expressed that any potential solution accommodating tenant distress would need to preserve the present value of our assets,” said CorEnergy CEO Dave Schulte. “The CorEnergy team is also diligently pursuing a number of promising acquisition opportunities with the objective of closing one or more in 2018. Upstream operators are open to creative funding options, such as those provided by CorEnergy, including selling dedicated infrastructure assets and redeploying proceeds into projects with greater return opportunities.”\nPortfolio Update\nPinedale LGS: Since the beginning of the year, the market pricing of both Ultra Petroleum's bonds and equity seem to be reflecting lower expected cash flow as a result of actual and forward prices for Rockies gas. However, UPL’s active horizontal drilling results are reported as economic even at lower realized prices, and the utilization of our Liquids Gathering System remains at robust levels. CorEnergy continues to receive participating rents, which contribute to increased dividend coverage.\nGrand Isle Gathering System: Following its emergence from bankruptcy in December 2016, Energy XXI Gulf Coast has undertaken the task of realigning costs and developing efficiencies to strengthen its financial stability and fund future production. Given the quality of the long-term reserves behind our GIGS system, CorEnergy has offered to enter discussions with its tenant to analyze the possibility of assisting with further recovery efforts, including a potential lease restructuring, among other considerations. Provided that the long-term value of GIGS is preserved, CorEnergy is willing to find an outcome which will also support EGC’s future success.\nOutlook\nCorEnergy regularly assesses its ability to pay and grow its dividend to common stockholders above the current level of $0.75 per quarter. The Company targets long-term revenue growth of 1-3% annually from existing contracts, through inflation-based and participating rent adjustments and additional growth from acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any potential acquisition opportunities will result in consummated transactions.\nDividend Declaration\nCommon Stock: A first quarter 2018 dividend of $0.75 per share was declared for CorEnergy’s common stock. The dividend is payable on May 31, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 17, 2018.\nPreferred Stock: For the Company’s 7.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, a cash dividend of $0.4609375 per depositary share was declared. The preferred stock dividend, which equates to an annual dividend payment of $1.84375 per depositary share, is payable on May 31, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 17, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call\nCorEnergy will host a conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, at 1:00 p.m. Central Time to discuss its financial results.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included herein are \"forward-looking statements.\" Although CorEnergy believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, they do involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and these expectations may prove to be incorrect. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in CorEnergy’s reports that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. Other than as required by law, CorEnergy does not assume a duty to update any forward-looking statement. In particular, any distribution paid in the future to our stockholders will depend on the actual performance of CorEnergy, its costs of leverage and other operating expenses and will be subject to the approval of CorEnergy’s Board of Directors and compliance with leverage covenants.\nNotes\n1 NAREIT FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses of depreciable properties, real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs or loan origination costs) and other adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and non-controlling interests. Adjustments for non-controlling interests are calculated on the same basis. FFO as we have presented it here, is derived by further adjusting NAREIT FFO for distributions received from investment securities, income tax expense (benefit) from investment securities, net distributions and dividend income and net realized and unrealized gain or loss on other equity securities. CorEnergy defines AFFO as FFO Adjusted for Securities Investment plus (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for loan losses, net of tax, transaction costs, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of deferred lease costs, accretion of asset retirement obligation, income tax expense (benefit) unrelated to securities investments, non-cash costs associated with derivative instruments, and certain costs of a nonrecurring nature, less maintenance, capital expenditures (if any), amortization of debt premium, and other adjustments as deemed appropriate by Management. Reconciliations of NAREIT FFO, FFO Adjusted for Securities Investments and AFFO to Net Income Attributable to CorEnergy Stockholders are included in the additional financial information attached to this press release.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets (Unaudited) Leased property, net of accumulated depreciation of $77,452,422 and $72,155,753 $ 460,659,797 $
