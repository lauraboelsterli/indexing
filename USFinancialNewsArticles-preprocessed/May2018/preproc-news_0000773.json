    "text": "MILPITAS, Calif., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumentum Holdings Inc. (\"Lumentum\" or the \"Company\") today reported results for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet revenue for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $298.8 million, with GAAP net income of $2.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Net revenue for fiscal second quarter of 2018 was $404.6 million, with GAAP net income of $204.8 million, or $3.05 per diluted share. Net revenue for the fiscal third quarter of 2017 was $255.8 million, with GAAP net loss of $(56.0) million, or $(0.92) per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP net income for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 was $50.6 million, or $0.78 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal second quarter of 2018 was $107.8 million, or $1.67 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the fiscal third quarter of 2017 was $30.8 million, or $0.49 per diluted share.\nThe Company held $692.8 million in total cash and short-term investments at the end of the fiscal third quarter of 2018.\n\"Our strategy of investing in differentiated products and technologies, focusing on close relationships with market leading customers, and leveraging our technologies across multiple growing end markets, is working. Driven by strong customer demand and execution on capacity expansion, in the third quarter we achieved new record Lasers revenues, which increased 18% sequentially, and grew Telecom revenues by more than 11% sequentially, with notable strength in ROADMs, which were up 27% sequentially,\" said Alan Lowe, President and CEO. \"Though seasonally down, we made good progress on new 3D sensing customer programs and are well positioned for new customer product introductions during FY19. During the third quarter, we announced reaching an agreement to acquire Oclaro and we continue to work with Oclaro on this pending transaction.\"\nFinancial Overview – Fiscal Third Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nGAAP Results ($ in millions)\nQ3\nQ2\nQ3\nChange\nFY 2018\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nNet revenue\n$298.8\n$404.6\n$255.8\n(26.1)%\n16.8%\nGross margin\n32.5%\n42.3%\n32.1%\n(980)bps\n40bps\nOperating margin\n8.5%\n22.4%\n5.3%\n(1,390)bps\n320bps\nNon-GAAP Results ($ in millions)\nQ3\nQ2\nQ3\nChange\nFY 2018\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nNet revenue\n$298.8\n$404.6\n$255.8\n(26.1)%\n16.8%\nGross margin\n36.3%\n44.9%\n34.4%\n(860)bps\n190bps\nOperating margin\n16.5%\n28.3%\n12.6%\n(1,180)bps\n390bps\nNet Revenue by Segment ($ in millions)\nQ3\n% of\nQ2\nQ3\nChange\nFY 2018\nNet Revenue\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nOptical Communications\n$246.3\n82.4%\n$360.1\n$216.1\n(31.6)%\n14.0%\nLasers\n52.5\n17.6%\n44.5\n39.7\n18.0%\n32.2%\nTotal\n$298.8\n100.0%\n$404.6\n$255.8\n(26.1)%\n16.8%\nThe tables above provide comparisons of quarterly results to prior periods, including sequential quarterly and year-over-year changes. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is contained in this release under the section titled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company expects the following for the fiscal fourth quarter 2018:\nNet Revenue to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million Non-GAAP Operating margin of 14.0% to 16.0% Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.75\nNote: Earnings per share based on approximately 65.3 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis\nOur projection of 65.3 million shares outstanding does not include the potentially dilutive effect of the convertible notes, as we have the ability and intent to settle the face value in cash; and therefore, we use the treasury stock method for calculating the dilutive impact of the 2024 Notes. The notes will have an impact on our diluted earnings per share when the average price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of $60.62.\nWe have not provided reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP measures for our outlook. A large portion of non-GAAP adjustments, such as derivative liability adjustments, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, litigation, acquisition related costs, non-cash income tax expense and credits, and other costs and contingencies unrelated to current and future operations are by their nature highly volatile and we have low visibility as to the range that may be incurred in the future. For example, in the fiscal second quarter of 2018, we had a credit of $207.0 million primarily related to a release of a U.S. valuation allowance, which was offset by a write-down of deferred tax assets in the amount of $83.0 million due to the lower corporate tax rate enacted under the 2017 \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" reform.\nConference Call\nLumentum will host a conference call on May 2, 2018 at 5:30am PT/8:30am ET.

These statements include our expectations for our markets, including future product shipments and associated revenue, any anticipation or guidance as to future financial performance, including future net revenue, earnings per share, and operating margins, number of outstanding shares, our proposed acquisition of Oclaro, including the anticipated closing date, anticipated sales trends across our businesses, customer plans and demand for our products, our ability to effectively and efficiently design products, and our ability to scale production on our various products and the 3D sensing market and our position in that market. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated are: (a) quarter-over-quarter product mix fluctuations which can materially impact profitability measures due to the broad gross margin ranges across our portfolio; (b) continued decline of average selling prices across our businesses; (c) effects of seasonality; (d) the ability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers to meet production and delivery requirements to our forecasted demand; (e) inherent uncertainty related to global markets and the effect of such markets on demand for our products; (f) changes in customer demand; and (g) our ability to attract and retain new customers, particularly in the 3D sensing market, (h) the risk that the Oclaro transaction does not close, due to the failure of one or more conditions to closing or the failure of the businesses (including personnel) to be integrated successfully after closing; (i) the risk that synergies and non-GAAP earnings accretion will not be realized or realized to the extent anticipated; (j) uncertainty as to the market value of the Lumentum merger consideration to be paid in the merger; (k) the risk that required governmental or Oclaro stockholder approvals of the merger (including U.S. or China antitrust approvals) will not be obtained or that such approvals will be delayed beyond current expectations; (l) the risk that following this transaction, Lumentum's financing or operating strategies will not be successful; (m) litigation in respect of either company or the merger; and (n) disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain customer, supplier, key personnel and other strategic relationships. For more information on these and other risks, please refer to the \"Risk Factors\" section included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the S-4 to be filed by Lumentum with the Securities and Exchange Commission at a future date in connection with the Oclaro transaction and in the documents which are incorporated by reference therein, and in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Lumentum believes this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance and has therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. Specifically, the Company believes that providing this information allows investors to better understand the Company's financial performance and, importantly, to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such operating performance. However, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.\nNon-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per share, Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP income (loss) before income taxes and non-GAAP expenses exclude (i) workforce related charges such as severance, retention bonuses and employee relocation costs related to formal restructuring plans, (ii) costs for facilities not required for ongoing operations, and costs related to the relocation of certain equipment from these facilities and/or contract manufacturer facilities, (iii) stock-based compensation, (iv) amortization of acquired developed technologies, (v) non-cash interest expense, (vi) unrealized loss on derivative liability, (vii) warranty charges related to our vendor quality issues with expected future recoveries, (viii) release of a U.S. valuation allowance and the write down of deferred tax assets due to the 2017 \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\", and (ix) other charges comprised mainly of inventory write-downs due to cancelled programs, as well as, acquisition, integration, litigation and other costs and contingencies unrelated to current and future operations. Management does not believe that these non-GAAP items are reflective of the Company's underlying operating performance. The presentation of these and other similar items in Lumentum's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.\nA quantitative reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data with respect to historical periods is included in the supplemental financial table attached to this press release.\nLUMENTUM HOLDINGS INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(in millions, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nApril 1, 2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nApril 1, 2017\nGross profit on GAAP basis\n$\n97.0\n$\n82.1\n$\n336.6\n$\n250.8\nStock-based compensation\n2.4\n1.9\n9.5\n6.0\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities (a)\n8.3\n2.2\n24.5\n12.1\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n0.8\n1.7\n2.4\n5.1\nGross profit on non-GAAP basis\n$\n108.5\n$\n87.9\n$\n373.0\n$\n274.0\nResearch and development on GAAP basis\n$\n38.2\n$\n37.3\n$\n118.3\n$\n112.9\nStock-based compensation\n(3.6)\n(3.0)\n(10.5)\n(8.8)\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities\n0.4\n(0.1)\n(1.4)\n(0.7)\nResearch and development on non-GAAP basis\n$\n35.0\n$\n34.2\n$\n106.4\n$\n103.4\nSelling, general and administrative on GAAP basis\n$\n33.2\n$\n28.1\n$\n95.5\n$\n84.2\nStock-based compensation\n(5.0)\n(3.2)\n(15.1)\n(10.1)\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities\n(4.1)\n(3.3)\n(6.4)\n(7.1)\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n—\n(0.1)\n—\n(0.3)\nSelling, general and administrative on non-GAAP basis\n$\n24.1\n$\n21.5\n$\n74.0\n$\n66.7\nIncome from operations on GAAP basis\n$\n25.5\n$\n13.6\n$\n119.0\n$\n43.7\nStock-based compensation\n11.0\n8.1\n35.1\n24.9\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities (a)\n12.0\n5.6\n32.3\n19.9\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n0.8\n1.8\n2.4\n5.4\nRestructuring and related charges\n0.1\n3.1\n3.8\n10.0\nIncome from operations on non-GAAP basis\n$\n49.4\n$\n32.2\n$\n192.6\n$\n103.9\nInterest and other (expense) income, net on GAAP basis\n$\n(2.1)\n$\n(1.4)\n$\n(8.7)\n$\n(1.4)\nNon-cash other income (expense)\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n(0.3)\nEffective interest expense on convertible notes\n4.2\n1.0\n12.4\n1.0\nInterest and other (expense) income, net on non-GAAP basis\n$\n2.0\n$\n(0.5)\n$\n3.6\n$\n(0.7)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes on GAAP basis\n$\n2.7\n$\n(44.4)\n$\n101.7\n$\n(32.2)\nStock-based compensation\n11.0\n8.1\n35.1\n24.9\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities (a)\n12.0\n5.6\n32.3\n19.9\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n0.8\n1.8\n2.4\n5.4\nRestructuring and related charges\n0.1\n3.1\n3.8\n10.0\nNon-cash other income (expense)\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n(0.3)\nEffective interest expense on convertible notes\n4.2\n1.0\n12.4\n1.0\nUnrealized loss on derivative liabilities\n20.7\n56.6\n8.6\n74.5\nIncome before income taxes on non-GAAP basis\n$\n51.4\n$\n31.7\n$\n196.2\n$\n103.2\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes on GAAP basis\n$\n—\n$\n11.6\n$\n(112.9)\n$\n15.4\nImpact of non-GAAP income tax (benefit) expense (b)\n0.8\n(10.7)\n122.9\n(9.6)\nProvision for income taxes on non-GAAP basis\n$\n0.8\n$\n0.9\n$\n10.0\n$\n5.8\nNet income (loss) on GAAP basis\n$\n2.7\n$\n(56.0)\n$\n214.6\n$\n(47.6)\nStock-based compensation\n11.0\n8.1\n35.1\n24.9\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities (a)\n12.0\n5.6\n32.3\n19.9\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n0.8\n1.8\n2.4\n5.4\nRestructuring and related charges\n0.1\n3.1\n3.8\n10.0\nNon-cash other income (expense)\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n(0.3)\nEffective interest expense on convertible notes\n4.2\n1.0\n12.4\n1.0\nUnrealized loss on derivative liabilities\n20.7\n56.6\n8.6\n74.5\nImpact of non-GAAP income tax benefit (expense) (b)\n(0.8)\n10.7\n(122.9)\n9.6\nNet income on non-GAAP basis\n$\n50.6\n$\n30.8\n$\n186.2\n$\n97.4\nNet income per share on non-GAAP basis\n$\n0.78\n$\n0.49\n$\n2.88\n$\n1.55\nShares used in per share calculation -

This adjustment amount is added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis as we had a net income on a non-GAAP basis for all periods presented.\n(d)\nFor all periods presented, 1.5 million shares related to the potential conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock were added to the calculation of diluted shares available on a non-GAAP basis because their inclusion results in more dilutive earnings per share.\nLUMENTUM HOLDINGS INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED EBITDA\n(in millions)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nApril 1, 2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nApril 1, 2017\nGAAP net income (loss)\n$\n2.7\n$\n(56.0)\n$\n214.6\n$\n(47.6)\nInterest and other expense (income), net\n2.1\n1.4\n8.7\n1.4\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (a)\n—\n11.6\n(112.9)\n15.4\nDepreciation\n18.4\n14.1\n53.3\n39.1\nAmortization\n0.8\n1.8\n2.4\n5.4\nEBITDA\n24.0\n(27.1)\n166.1\n13.7\nRestructuring and related charges\n0.1\n3.1\n3.8\n10.0\nStock-based compensation\n11.0\n8.1\n35.1\n24.9\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities (b)\n12.0\n5.6\n32.3\n19.9\nUnrealized loss on derivative liabilities\n20.7\n56.6\n8.6\n74.5\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n67.8\n$\n46.3\n$\n245.9\n$\n143.0\n(a)\nThe change during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a credit of $207.0 million related to a release of a U.S. valuation allowance, which was offset by the write-down of deferred tax assets due to the 2017 \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" reform in the amount of $83.0 million.\n(b)\nThe change during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 primarily relates to set-up costs of our Thailand facility, including costs of transferring product lines to Thailand, as well as inventory write-downs due to cancelled programs.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lumentum-announces-fiscal-third-quarter-2018-results-300641029.html\nSOURCE Lumentum",
