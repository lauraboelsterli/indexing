    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. cable company Liberty Global ( LBTYA.O ) has offered concessions to win over EU antitrust regulators which are examining its takeover of Dutch peer Ziggo for the second time after an EU court threw out its 2014 approval of the deal.\nFormer state telecoms monopoly KPN ( KPN.AS ) had complained to the court about the combined market power of Liberty Global’s Dutch unit UPC and Ziggo, the two largest cable network operators in the Netherlands.\nLiberty Global submitted its proposal on May 3, according to a filing on the European Commission site. No details were provided in line with EU policy. It will decide by May 30 whether to clear the bid after getting feedback from third parties.\nThe company offered to sell its premium pay TV film channel Film1 and scrapped clauses which restrict broadcasters’ ability to sell their channels and content over the internet.\nThe Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest, in October last year rejected the Commission’s ruling because it had failed to properly explain the effects of the merger on the market for pay TV sports channels.\nLiberty Global has since joined forces with Vodafone ( VOD.L ) in the Netherlands to create VodafoneZiggo.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Keith Weir\n ",
