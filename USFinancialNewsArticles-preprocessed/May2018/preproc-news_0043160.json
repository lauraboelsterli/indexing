In places such as Los Angeles, Miami and Boston, the company will make real-time information about on-street parking available to car manufacturers.\nBosch Consumer Goods offers convenience with connectivity\nSales for Bosch’s Consumer Goods business sector in North America were $2.5 billion. BSH Home Appliances recently announced the largest and most significant launch in the 102-year history of its Thermador™ brand, debuting 300 new products with more than 800 innovations. Thermador also introduced the Thermador Connected Experience by Home Connect™, an industry-exclusive app that connects the consumer to exclusive personalized content, unique partnerships and customized product guidance. Bosch Home Connect is a dynamic ecosystem created to connect home appliances to the Internet of Things. Through its powerful open platform, Home Connect leads the appliance industry by providing a growing network of partners and services.\nThe Power Tools division continues to embrace the maker movement. In September, Dremel introduced the first-of-its-kind Dremel DigiLab Laser Cutter , designed to cleanly slice through materials like wood, acrylic, leather and paper, as well as neatly engrave surfaces such as glass and anodized metal. Dremel designed this machine to provide makers of all levels and practices with an outlet for innovation. As the brand’s latest addition to its lineup of digital fabrication tools, it has the ability to customize a variety of materials more quickly and easily than ever before. Backed by 85 years of Dremel brand legacy, the Dremel DigiLab Laser Cutter will provide a higher level of safety, ease, reliability and quality to users. Additionally, Dremel released the Stylo+ , the brand’s first specialized arts and crafts tool. Crafted with the comfortable ergonomics of a pen, the Stylo+ is a lightweight crafting tool that empowers creative makers to engrave, carve, polish and sand with ease. Dremel also released the brand’s first-ever powered cleaning tool, the Dremel Versa , which features four interchangeable accessories for indoor and outdoor cleaning.\nBosch Power Tools also announced an open pilot for its Bluehound asset tracking solution , a major step toward total connectivity on a complex construction site. In addition, the Bosch CORE18V battery continues to be a game-changer for professional users in construction and the trade markets, who demand more power and greater runtime.\nIndustrial Technology provides connected industry products\nThe Industrial Technology sector’s sales reached $1.4 billion in North America. Bosch Rexroth, one of the world’s leading suppliers in drive and control technologies, saw strong growth in mobile hydraulics resulting from recovery in the construction, mining, offshore and other industries. Rexroth also launched numerous innovations to empower modern manufacturing, from data visualization tools such as ActiveCockpit , IoT Gateway and Improvidus to a broad range of connected hydraulics for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring in heavy machines and equipment. These Industry 4.0 solutions save time and costs. The digital transformation in manufacturing will continue to influence growth in this segment for the coming years. By 2020 the Bosch Group aims to generate more than a billion euros with connected industry.\nEnergy and Building Technology grows with thermotechnology, video cameras\nSales for the Energy and Building Technology sector in the region were $800 million.

After achieving record results in 2017, and in light of economic and geopolitical risks, the Bosch Group expects its sales revenue to grow by 2 to 3 percent in 2018. In the first three months, the sales revenue generated by the company matched the high level of the same period of the previous year, and even increased by around 5 percent when adjusted for exchange-rate effects.\n“Our company is unequaled when it comes to combining comprehensive connectivity expertise with broad industry and product know-how. This is the Bosch Group’s unique selling proposition,” said the Bosch CEO Dr. Volkmar Denner, speaking at the annual press conference in Renningen. Denner sees improving the quality of life and contributing to eco- and climate-friendliness at the top of Bosch’s agenda: “Our ‘Invented for life’ ethos is our motivation for developing the best possible technologies for environmental protection. We want to help keep people mobile, while improving air quality.”\nTo make practically zero-emissions traffic reality, the company is making heavy investments – both in making electromobility a market success and in enhancing the combustion engine. Bosch has now achieved a breakthrough in diesel technology: With their new diesel technology, Bosch engineers have succeeded in getting NOx emissions down to one-tenth of the legally permitted limit. On average, test vehicles equipped with the enhanced technology already emit no more than 13 milligrams of NOx per kilometer, or far less than the 120 milligrams that will be permitted in Europe after 2020. “There’s a future for diesel. It will remain integral to tomorrow’s mobility solutions,” the Bosch CEO said.
