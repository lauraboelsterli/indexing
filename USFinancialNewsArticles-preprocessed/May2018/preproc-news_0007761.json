    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 5:07 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Southern Europe bond spreads defy the odds even as ECB pullback looms Abhinav Ramnarayan , Fanny Potkin 6 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - At a time when the impending withdrawal of European Central Bank stimulus was expected to hurt southern European bond markets, so-called “peripheral” euro zone debt continues to outperform its higher-rated peers. The logo of the European Central Bank (ECB) is pictured outside its headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nItalian, Spanish and Portuguese bonds have been among the bloc’s best performers over the past year, and yield premia — or spreads — over benchmark German debt have narrowed relentlessly.\nTheir out performance has even defied data indicating Europe’s growth acceleration may be running out of steam.\nAnd despite recent volatility in the wake of Italy’s inconclusive March 4 election, spreads remain near their tightest levels in months, or even years.\nStrengthening economy underpins Italian spread - reut.rs/2KlBZQj\n“There has been a regime change in sovereign spreads, which are now reacting mostly to economic developments. As long as growth remains healthy, we can see spreads tighten further,” said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet.\nReasons for the “regime change”?\nFirst, the three Southern European countries are well and truly out of recession, helped by 2.55 trillion euros (2.24 trillion pounds) in ECB stimulus. The euro bloc posted its fastest economic growth in a decade last year at 2.7 percent.\nEven if growth slows from there, it is a far cry way from 2010-2012, when Spain and Portugal required bailouts and Italy’s debt levels spiralled to record highs.\nSecond, unlike a year ago, anti-establishment parties such as Italy’s 5-Star Movement are not considered an existential threat to the single currency. Italy may not have a government yet, but the Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread is near the tightest since August 2016 at 110 bps.\nSo can it continue?\nThe Italy/Germany spread can go all the way to 90 basis points, Nick Gartside, chief investment officer at JP Morgan Asset Management, told Reuters in January when the spread was 145 bps.\nThat target now seems within reach, especially as U.S. Treasuries look expensive, once currency hedging costs are taken into account. That means many European investors who would have bought nominally higher-yielding Treasuries, may seek domestic alternatives.\n“Ten-year Italian government bonds at nearly 1.8 percent, or even (German government bonds) at 0.6 percent, yield more than the near-zero yield on equivalent currency-hedged U.S. Treasury bonds,” said Andrew Bosomworth, head of portfolio management, Germany, for PIMCO, the world’s largest bond manager.\nIn addition, Italy’s “real” yield, a measure looked at by some investors that discounts the effect of inflation, is higher than that of the United States.\nCost of FX hedging cuts U.S. yield advantage for Europeans - reut.rs/2JGE0Fv\nItaly \"real\" yield higher than that of the U.S. - reut.rs/2rcVC5c\nPERIPHERY TO SEMI-CORE\nRabobank strategist Richard McGuire predicts Italy/Germany will reach 100 bps but reckons Spain will outperform.\nSpanish spreads stand around 72 basis points, having tightened from around 150 bps a year ago ES10YT=RR.\n“The Spanish spread (over Germany) has traditionally found resistance at the 100 basis-point mark ever since the crisis,” McGuire said. “But right now it is well below that level and we think it could go as low as 50 basis points.”\nSpain may represent the best “regime change” example, in fact. With sovereign credit ratings back in “A” territory, many see Spain following Ireland’s example to transition out of the periphery into “semi-core” - market jargon for the debt of Belgium, France and Ireland.\nPortuguese spreads meanwhile recently touched 109 bps, their tightest since 2010. It caps a remarkable comeback for a country until recently classed as junk by the big ratings agencies.\nS&P Global and Fitch late last year raised their Portuguese ratings back to investment grade, helping push its 10-year borrowing costs below Italy’s.\nIn early 2017, they were 200 basis points higher.\nFor this reason, the Portugal/Germany spread is the one which may not have legs — investors do not see it sustainably trading tighter than Italy, a larger economy with a far more liquid bond market.\nPortugal goes from outlier to outperformer - reut.rs/2JGPEQN PERIPHERAL DANGER\nThe periphery trade however faces the same danger as it always did - the end of ECB bond-buying. ING analysts for instance predict Italian and Spanish spreads will widen to 150 bps and 80 bps respectively by the end of 2018.\nSome investors such as Eric Brard, head of fixed income at Amundi, may also switch back to higher-rated French and German debt should yields there rise. German 10-year yields hitting 1 percent would be the time to return to the euro zone “core”, Brard said.\n“That would also mean the French (government bond) market would be above 1.20 percent on the 10-year, we would rather be in these better-rated names,” he added.\nIn February, when German 10-year yields rose above 0.80 percent, that day looked ominously close.\nBut with euro zone growth seemingly cooling — the economy grew just 0.4 percent in the first quarter — and the ECB sounding cautious on monetary policy, German yields are back at 0.6 percent. This suggests the gravy train will chug along for southern Europe in the foreseeable future.\nCost of FX hedging cuts U.S. yield advantage for Europeans (interactive) - tmsnrt.rs/2r2clIg Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan and Fanny Potkin; Graphics by Abhinav Ramnarayan and Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Sujata Rao and Hugh Lawson",
