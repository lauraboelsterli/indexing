    "text": "David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Technicians work on machinery at the Applied Materials facility in Santa Clara, California.\nShares of Applied Materials fell sharply Friday after the company lowered its current-quarter revenue and sales projections in its semiconductor business below Wall Street expectations.\nApplied Materials, which makes equipment used to produce chips, saw its stock fall more than 9.5 percent Friday morning, on track for its worst day since February 2009.\nAs one of the globe's largest supplier of tools used by chipmakers, the company's disappointing forecast only fueled investor anxiety that a plateauing smartphone market could finally curb demand for flash memory chips.\nAs a barometer for the rest of the industry, Applied Materials' top customers include other large multinational companies like Samsung Electronics, Micron , and Intel .\n\"Smartphone sales have been below expectations, particularly for high-end models. And in response, both semiconductor and display suppliers have made adjustments to their capacity planning,\" chief executive Gary Dickerson told investors on Thursday's earnings call.\nApplied Materials said it expects semiconductor sales revenue to grow 7 percent in the current quarter, well short of the 13.8 percent boost expected by the Street, according to FactSet.\nThe disappointing guidance drew critical comments from Goldman Sachs analysts, who downgraded the company's shares to neutral from buy on Friday.\n\"We downgrade Applied Materials from buy to neutral as we reduce our estimates and price target to reflect the underwhelming market share outlook in the core Semi Cap Equipment business, worse-than-feared fundamentals in Display, and a muted gross margin outlook,\" analyst Toshiya Hari wrote.\nHari, who emphasized Goldman remains \"constructive\" on Applied Materials' competitive positioning, nonetheless cut the company's price target to $58 from $65, implying 7 percent upside over the next 12 months.\nDespite the lackluster guidance, Applied Materials did post second-quarter results that beat consensus expectations.\nThe company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 versus expectations of $1.14, while revenue of $4.57 billion topped forecasts of $4.45 billion.\nâ€” CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",
