    "text": "NEW YORK, May 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc., (OTCQB: JMDA) (the \"Company\" or \"Jerrick\"), a digital media and technology company, today reported financial results for its full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal year 2017 marked the year that Jerrick cultivated and scaled its core technology platform, Vocal, increasing the platform's user base and enhancing the user experience. In December 2016, Vocal hosted a handful of creators and less than 10 submissions daily; Vocal now receives hundreds of content submissions daily by its over 200,000 content creators as the platform continues to grow.\n\"A great deal of my personal focus was spent working with, and solving problems for, talented creators and their communities. The evolving digital landscape has compelled creators and brands to increasingly value sustainable partnerships and meaningful connectivity. Vocal facilitates these relationships and generates revenues from both brands and creators within its virtual marketplace,\" said Jerrick co-founder Rick Schwartz.\nRevenues for 2017 were $95,653, accounting for a receivables adjustment of $25,722. The majority of revenues were from multiple lines of scalable business opportunities and technology features that were beta tested in anticipation of broad releases during fiscal year 2018. The majority of the $223,927 of revenues generated in fiscal year 2016 were directly attributed to ongoing sales and monetization of the Company's legacy media assets and IP. During fiscal 2017, legacy-related revenues were deliberately curtailed, for a period of expansion and optimization of the underlying IP assets and their core value. Management expects these assets to begin to contribute in a more material fashion during the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company expects a material increase in total gross revenues during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 from both the increase of legacy performing assets and, more significantly, the broad release of technology and Vocal revenue-related features.\nCorporate History\nJerrick was founded in 2012 by long-time friends and business partners Jeremy Frommer and Rick Schwartz. Initially a private media company leveraging Frommer's background in the financial services industry as well as Schwartz's successes in the entertainment industry, the partners created a diversified portfolio combining technology, data analytics, and media related product tools. Jerrick's growing portfolio of brands and content quickly outpaced the available commercial technology that supported it.\nIn 2015, after interviewing multiple consultants and development groups, management discovered CEO Jed Watson's company, Thinkmill , a design and development group based in Sydney, Australia. Jerrick engaged Thinkmill to create a best-in-class content management system (CMS).\nInitially envisioned to be used for Jerrick's growing portfolio of media assets and IP, proprietary development plans were accelerated as management discovered a need to accommodate an expanding network of brands and influencers. The product quickly evolved from a proprietary CMS tool to plans for a robust long-form social publishing platform. The successful working relationship between Thinkmill and Jerrick led to a signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in early 2018. The proposed joint venture will further leverage technology development, white labeling opportunities for both companies, and a combined working business group of 50 professionals.\nIn early 2016, Jerrick's media IP and technology, which encompassed the research and development of the Vocal platform, was absorbed into a single entity through a reverse merger, forming the publicly traded entity Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB:JMDA). Over two years ago in a March 2016 press release , CEO Jeremy Frommer stated, \"Jerrick is designing a unique proprietary digital content platform with an eye towards profitable monetization of that content across the digital spectrum.\"\nThroughout 2016, Jerrick progressed from a research and development entity to a product-oriented company with the release of Vocal . The Vocal platform is home to a network of communities and a suite of publishing tools that enable new generations of content creators to grow their audience and monetize their creations. \"Before Vocal, there was no obvious home for diverse creators, and monetization tools were limited. Vocal is designed as a canvas for creators who are seeking to have their voices heard and be rewarded for their work,\" explained Sharon Solomon, Jerrick's Director of Marketing.\nThe company expects 2018 to validate and scale revenue-generating features provided to Vocal's creators, brands, and audiences.\n\"We have provided proof of concept that the creative community is in serious need of a centralized solution within a fragmented digital environment of creator tools and monetization features. Jerrick's flagship product Vocal is uniquely positioned to provide a scalable, valued-added solution for creators and brands, and by extension, for Jerrick's (JMDA) shareholders,\" said Frommer.\nKey Operational and Financial Metrics\nGrew unique monthly visitors over tenfold, from an early start of 500,000 monthly visitors during Q1 2017 to an excess of 6 million monthly engagements in Q1 2018. The Company expects that number to reach seventeen million before Q3 2019.",
