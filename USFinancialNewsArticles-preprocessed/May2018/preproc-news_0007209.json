    "text": "ROSEMONT, Ill., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wintrust Financial Corporation (“Wintrust”) (Nasdaq:WTFC) today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Chicago Shore Corporation (“CSC”). CSC is the parent company of Delaware Place Bank, an Illinois state-chartered bank, which operates a banking location in the Gold Coast/Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. As of March 31, 2018, Delaware Place Bank had approximately $245 million in assets, approximately $165 million in loans and approximately $215 million in deposits.\nEdward J. Wehmer, President and CEO of Wintrust, said, “This transaction provides a wonderful opportunity to expand and complement our market presence in the heart of the City of Chicago. We look forward to continuing the community banking approach that Delaware Place Bank has established and to providing its customers with an expanded array of products, services and resources.”\n“We are very pleased with the opportunity to join the Wintrust banking family,” said James W. Aldrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chicago Shore Corporation and Delaware Place Bank. “This transaction brings together two companies that share core community banking philosophies and cultures. Wintrust’s Chicago-based leadership and its track record of serving families, individuals and businesses in Chicago’s neighborhoods and surrounding communities made it an attractive partner. This partnership offers our customers and employees the long-term benefits that being part of a successful, growing and caring organization brings.” Mr. Aldrich emphasized that by joining forces with Wintrust, “the transaction allows us to continue focusing on serving our customers, while at the same time providing our customers with access to a wider range of products, services and resources. We see many advantages for our customers and stockholders and we look forward to joining the Wintrust family.”\nTerms of the Transaction\nSubject to possible adjustment, the aggregate purchase price (which takes into account the appreciated value of a five-story building located in the Gold Coast/Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago) will be approximately $34 million. Shares of CSC common stock outstanding at the time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive per share merger consideration paid in cash.\nSubject to approval by banking regulators and CSC’s stockholders and certain closing conditions, in connection with the closing, all other outstanding securities of CSC (including trust preferred securities of its trust subsidiaries and preferred stock of CSC) will be redeemed in accordance with their terms. The transaction is expected to close late in the third quarter 2018, and is not expected to have a material effect on Wintrust’s 2018 earnings per share.\nAdvisors\nPiper Jaffray acted as exclusive financial advisor to CSC in the transaction and provided a fairness opinion to its Board of Directors. Sullivan and Cromwell LLP acted as CSC’s transaction counsel, and Schiff Hardin LLP served as transaction counsel to Wintrust.\nAbout Wintrust\nWintrust is a financial holding company with assets of approximately $28 billion whose common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Built on the \"HAVE IT ALL\" model, Wintrust offers sophisticated technology and resources of a large bank while focusing on providing service-based community banking to each and every customer. Wintrust operates fifteen community bank subsidiaries with over 150 banking locations located in the greater Chicago and southern Wisconsin market areas. Additionally, the Company operates various non-bank business units, including one of the largest commercial insurance premium finance companies operating in the United States and Canada, a company providing short-term accounts receivable financing and value-added out-sourced administrative services to the temporary staffing services industry, a business unit engaging primarily in the origination and purchase of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market throughout the United States, and companies providing wealth management services.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws relating to the proposed acquisition of Chicago Shore Corporation and its integration with Wintrust, the combination of their businesses and projected revenue, as well as profitability and earnings outlook.
