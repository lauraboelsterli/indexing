    "text": "Highlights for First Quarter 2018:\nRevenues of $70.9 million; Recurring revenues up 3% sequentially, 8% year over year; TruBridge revenues up 22% year over year; 12-month backlog of $264.6 million; Quarterly bookings of $22.1 million; GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.29 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.59; GAAP net income of $4.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 million; Cash provided by operations of $3.1 million; and Quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share.\nMOBILE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CPSI (NASDAQ: CPSI), a community healthcare solutions company, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, payable on June 1, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 17, 2018.\nTotal revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $70.9 million, compared with total revenues of $64.1 million for the prior-year period. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $4.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared with net income of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Cash provided by operations for the first quarter was $3.1 million, compared with cash provided by operations of $9.7 million for the prior-year period.\n“Our first quarter results were solid from a revenue and earnings standpoint, including a 22% increase in revenue year over year from TruBridge, our business management, consulting, and managed IT services business,” said Boyd Douglas, president and chief executive officer of CPSI. “We also welcomed 14 community hospitals to the CPSI family this quarter. With this strong start and a healthy sales pipeline, we remain well positioned for continued revenue and earnings growth in 2018.”\nCommenting on the Company’s financial performance for the quarter, Matt Chambless, chief financial officer of CPSI, stated, “Robust revenue growth at TruBridge, coupled with our continued sales of EHR systems pursuant to CMS’ healthcare IT initiatives, resulted in total revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter that were our second highest since the Healthland acquisition. These results were only surpassed by those during the fourth quarter of 2017, where revenues related to stage 3 of “meaningful use” propelled a strong finish to the year. Optically, cash flow provided by operations appear light, decreasing $6.6 million from the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by the payment of 2017 annual bonuses and the timing of payroll expenditures, which required approximately $6.0 million in cash during the first quarter. Despite this decrease in operating cash flows, we were able to achieve an incremental reduction in amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and move closer toward reaching our target leverage of 2.5 times Adjusted EBITDA, which we hope to achieve by the end of 2018.”\nDouglas added, “CPSI has an eye to the future, as we are nearing the conclusion of a period focused on assisting our customers with meeting federally mandated EHR requirements. We are encouraged by meaningful growth opportunities in revenue cycle management and other community healthcare solutions, as we see continued demand from our clients to help them make the shift to value-based care.”\nCPSI will hold a live webcast to discuss first quarter 2018 results today, Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. A 30-day online replay will be available approximately one hour following the conclusion of the live webcast.

NOL Utilization was approximately $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nCOMPUTER PROGRAMS AND SYSTEMS, INC. Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net income, as reported $ 3,967 $ 246 Pre-tax adjustments for Non-GAAP EPS: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 2,602 2,601 Stock-based compensation 1,939 1,281 Transaction-related costs - 5 Non-recurring severance - 397 Non-cash interest expense 86 182 After-tax adjustments for Non-GAAP EPS: Tax-effect of pre-tax adjustments, at 21% and 35%, respectively (972 ) (1,563 ) Tax shortfall from stock-based compensation 362 764 Non-GAAP net income $ 7,984 $ 3,913 Weighted average shares outstanding, diluted 13,475 13,347 Non-GAAP EPS $ 0.59 $ 0.29\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or “GAAP.” However, management believes that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in order to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors.\nAs such, to supplement the GAAP information provided, we present in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP net income, and Non-GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”).\nWe calculate each of these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA – Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income (loss) as reported and adjusts for: (i) depreciation; (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; (iii) stock-based compensation; (iv) transaction-related costs; (v) non-recurring severance; (vi) interest expense and other, net; and (vii) the provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP net income – Non-GAAP net income consists of GAAP net income (loss) as reported and adjusts for (i) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; (ii) stock-based compensation; (iii) transaction-related costs; (iv) non-recurring severance; (v) non-cash charges to interest expense and other; and (vi) the total tax effect of items (i) through (v). Non-GAAP EPS – Non-GAAP EPS consists of Non-GAAP net income, as defined above, divided by weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) in the applicable period.\nCertain of the items excluded or adjusted to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures are described below:\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets - Acquisition-related amortization expense is a non-cash expense arising primarily from the acquisition of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions or investments. We exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets. Investors should note that the use of these intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation, and the related amortization expense will recur in future periods. Stock-based compensation - Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing and valuation of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods, and such expense will recur in future periods. Non-recurring expenses and transaction-related costs - Non-recurring expenses relate to certain severance and other charges incurred in connection with activities that are considered one-time. Transaction-related costs are the non-recurring costs related to specific acquisitions (such as the Healthland acquisition). We exclude non-recurring expenses and transaction-related costs from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods. Non-cash charges to interest expense and other - Non-cash charges to interest expense and other includes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. We exclude non-cash charges to interest expense and other from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe these non-cash amounts relate to specific transactions and, as such, may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Tax shortfall (excess tax benefit) from stock-based compensation – ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, became effective for the Company during the first quarter of 2017 and changes the treatment of tax shortfall and excess tax benefits arising from stock-based compensation arrangements. Prior to ASU 2016-09, these amounts were recorded as an increase (for excess benefits) or decrease (for shortfalls) to additional paid-in capital. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, these amounts are now captured in the period’s income tax expense. We exclude this component of income tax expense from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses or benefits in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations; (ii) such expenses or benefits can vary significantly between periods as a result of the valuation of grants of new stock-based awards, the timing of vesting of awards, and periodic movements in the fair value of our common stock; and (iii) excluding these amounts assists in the comparability between current period results and results during periods prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.\nManagement considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends, in particular the extent to which ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance. In addition, management may use Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP net income and/or Non-GAAP EPS to measure the achievement of performance objectives under the Company’s stock and cash incentive programs. Note, however, that these non-GAAP financial measures are performance measures only, and they do not provide any measure of cash flow or liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures are not alternatives for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, there is no certainty that we will not incur expenses in the future that are similar to those excluded in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release. Investors and potential investors are encouraged to review the “Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006465/en/\nCPSI\nTracey Schroeder, 251-639-8100\nChief Marketing Officer\nTracey.schroeder@cpsi.com\nSource: CPSI",
