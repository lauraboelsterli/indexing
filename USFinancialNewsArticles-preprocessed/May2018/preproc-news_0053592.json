REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\nWilliams was world number one before leaving the tour last year to have a baby but the 23-times grand slam champion enters Roland Garros ranked 453rd.\nThe three-times French Open champion was not granted a seed by tournament organisers, triggering criticism from women’s groups and tennis pundits.\n“This is ridiculous. @SerenaWilliams is a formidable athlete (best ever!) and loving new mother,” Trump, daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump, wrote on Twitter.

The #WTA should change this rule immediately. #FrenchOpen.”\nWilliams returned to the professional Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) tour in March at Indian Wells in Southern California.\nShe won her first two matches before losing to sister Venus Williams. Two weeks later, she fell to Japan’s Naomi Osaka in the opening round of the Miami Open. Reporting by Steve Keating in Indianapolis. Editing by Ian Ransom",
