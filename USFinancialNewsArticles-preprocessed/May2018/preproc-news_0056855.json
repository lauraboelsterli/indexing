    "text": "0 COMMENTS Two Canadian banks on Monday reported their customer accounts may have been breached.\nBank of Montreal BMO -0.62% said some personal and financial information for fewer than 50,000 customers may have been stolen. Simplii Financial, an online bank unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , CM -0.84% reported that information for roughly 40,000 customers may have been stolen.\nBoth banks said they were contacted Sunday by “fraudsters” claiming they were in possession of the information. BMO, Canada’s fourth-largest bank by assets, said it believes the attack originated from outside of Canada.\n“They appear to be related,” a BMO spokesman said in reference to the attacks, and said the claims were “unverified.”\n”We are working with the relevant authorities and are conducting a thorough investigation,” the spokesman said in an emailed statement.\nBMO said it is confident that “exposures identified related to customer data” have been closed off, and that it is contacting the customers who may have been affected.\nSimplii said there was no indication CIBC accounts were affected. The bank said it would return any money lost from Simplii accounts to clients affected by the fraud.\nThere were no signs other Canadian banks were affected.\nToronto-Dominion Bank “has not been contacted and there is no indication that our customers have been affected,” said a spokeswoman for Canada’s largest bank by assets.\nRoyal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia officials didn’t immediately return calls.\n— Colin Kellaher contributed to this article\nWrite to Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com",
