    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Daré Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ:DARE), a clinical-stage, women’s biopharmaceutical company focused on women’s sexual and reproductive health, announced today that President and CEO Sabrina Martucci Johnson is a finalist for the Entrepreneur Of The Year ® 2018 Award in San Diego. The awards program recognizes entrepreneurs who are excelling in areas such as innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to their businesses and communities. Sabrina was selected as a finalist by a panel of independent judges. Award winners for the San Diego region will be announced at a special event on June 7, 2018, in San Diego, California.\nNow in its 32nd year, the program has expanded to recognize business leaders in more than 145 cities and more than 60 countries throughout the world.\n“I am honored to be named a finalist in San Diego for EY’s Entrepreneur Of The Year Award,” said Sabrina. “Entrepreneur Of The Year is a highly regarded program that is known for promoting passionate, dedicated and forward-looking entrepreneurs as well as the emerging products and services they believe will improve people’s lives. Being nominated for this prestigious award is both recognition and validation of the hard work we are doing at Daré to advance innovation in women’s health.”\nSabrina is a longtime life sciences executive with extensive experience in capital formation, business development, and commercial leadership. In 2015 she founded Daré Bioscience with the distinct mission to advance to market innovative therapeutics that clearly address unmet needs in women’s health, primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health, and fertility.\nThe company has two potential first-in-class product candidates in clinical development: Ovaprene®, a non-hormonal, monthly contraceptive vaginal ring and Topical Sildenafil (SST-6007), a potential treatment for female sexual arousal disorder utilizing the same active ingredient as Viagra ® . The company received a funding award to further the development of Ovaprene from the National Institutes of Health Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and recently initiated a post-coital test clinical trial for Ovaprene.\nIn addition to its lead programs, Daré is building a portfolio of innovative women’s health products. In 2018, the company licensed an intravaginal ring technology platform from Juniper Pharmaceuticals, including three pre-clinical candidates using the technology, and entered into an agreement with Pear Tree Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to acquire a potential treatment for vulvar and vaginal atrophy in patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Sabrina has been instrumental in guiding the company to identify, qualify and advance new product candidates for clear unmet needs, and employ a flexible, effective partnering strategy that leaves the option for in-licensing, out-licensing, as well as future potential collaborations.\nFor more information on Sabrina and Daré’s growing portfolio of unique women’s health product candidates, please visit www.darebioscience.com .\nAbout Daré Bioscience\nDaré Bioscience is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the advancement of innovative products for women’s reproductive and sexual health.
