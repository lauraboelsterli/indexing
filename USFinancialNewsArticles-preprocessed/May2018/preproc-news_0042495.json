REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo\nBy Sam Schechner Valentina Pop\nBRUSSELS—Top European lawmakers are set to interrogate Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday over the company’s handling of alleged data misuse and election interference on the platform, as the tech giant seeks to appease officials in a region where it is regulated strictly.\nThe event starts in Brussels around 6:30 p.m. local time, or 12:30 p.m. ET. Roughly a dozen of the European Parliament’s most senior members and its president will press the Facebook FB, +0.04% CEO, who testified on Capital Hill over similar issues last month , on a range of issues.\nRead: 5 things to know about the GDPR rules coming this week— which could cost big, bad tech billions\nLawmakers say they will seek answers about how Facebook will prevent further scandals like that involving data-analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly improperly obtained the personal information of as many as 87 million Facebook users. The data company has since announced it was closing down.\nIn his opening remarks, Zuckerberg is likely to outline the actions the company has taken, according to a company spokeswoman. He is expected to apologize for failing to do enough to combat fake news and foreign interference in elections, or to prevent developers from misusing user information, according to a copy of his remarks pre-released by Facebook.
