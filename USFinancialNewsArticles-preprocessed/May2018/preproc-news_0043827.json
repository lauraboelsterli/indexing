Picture taken January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/FIle Photo\nProtesters hoping to march to the prime minister’s offices, Government House, set off from Thammasat University early in the day but were blocked by rows of police in black uniforms.\nThe rare protest is also marking four years since Prayuth, then army chief, overthrew an elected government in a May 22, 2014, coup.\nThe military government initially promised to hold a general election in 2015 but has pushed back the date several times.
