    "text": "Carlos Hernandez-Artigas to Remain on Board of Directors\nANAHEIM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- iinside , a pioneer in human flow intelligence for smarter airport management, today announced that Sam Kamel has been named President and CEO by the company’s Board of Directors. Sam, a current Board of Directors member for iinside, will replace Carlos Hernandez-Artigas, who remains on the Board along with Sam.\n“As a Board member, Sam has brought a unique blend of inspirational leadership and strategic vision that will translate well to his new role as CEO,” said Houston Staton, Chairman of iinside. “It’s an exciting time in the company’s history and Sam is very well-suited to navigate the organization through the rapid growth and expansion that’s coming.”\nStaton added, “Our thanks to Carlos for his leadership at iinside. Through his efforts over the past year, we’ve successfully transitioned to newer, hyper-precise LiDAR sensor technology, making iinside the most advanced human flow facilitation solution for airports, large venues and smart cities around the world.”\nSam has experience as an entrepreneur, Fortune 100 executive, team builder, change agent, innovator, strategist and successful dealmaker. He has been at the center of some of the most disruptive changes in technology at companies such as Netscape, E-LOAN and Microsoft. Over the course of his career, he has raised more than $75 million in funding, overseen multiple acquisitions, and played a pivotal role in two IPO events. He has also served as a decorated officer in the U.S. Navy. Sam studied electrical engineering at Cornell, earned his MBA from Harvard and started his professional career at McKinsey & Company.\niinside’s analytics platform integrates data from various sensors and IoT devices to provide insights that improve the passenger journey, enhance airport operations and empower travelers through its API Travel Time platform. Its visual analytics helps airport operations act upon data-driven insights that improve efficiency and increase traveler satisfaction. iinside is also delivering innovative solutions in partnership with airports to create new “time to gate” use cases for travelers and new opportunities for airports to generate non-aeronautical revenue.\nTripIt, the popular online trip planning and itinerary management app owned by SAP Concur, utilizes the iinside API to issue wait-time alerts, as well as real-time queuing updates at several major U.S. airports. Based on iinside data, TripIt helps travelers plan their trip and select the best departure time for the airport by letting them know projected wait times at security checkpoints.\n“With airlines carrying a record 4.1 billion passengers last year alone, airports are more crowded than ever and time-to-gate information has become extremely valuable to travelers,” Sam said. “iinside is not only helping airports better understand how people move throughout their concourses, but we’re also innovating in new ways, partnering with leading companies across the travel ecosystem, to improve the overall passenger journey and help airports create new revenue models. We’re now able to see data that has been very difficult to accurately and efficiently capture at scale and share it with multiple partners and travelers in real time.”\nFor more information about iinside and to learn more about human flow analytics for better airport management, visit www.iinside.com .\nAbout iinside\niinside provides the most comprehensive end-to-end analytics suite for the worldwide travel market.
