    "text": "GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CSG (NASDAQ: CSGS), the trusted partner to simplify the complexity of business transformation in the digital age , today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKey Highlights:\nFirst quarter 2018 financial results: Total revenues were $201.7 million . GAAP operating income was $25.8 million , or 12.8% of total revenues and non-GAAP operating income was $35.3 million , or 17.5% of total revenues. GAAP earnings per diluted share (EPS) was $0.42 . Non-GAAP EPS was $0.69 . Cash flows from operations were $29.9 million . CSG declared its quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share of common stock, or a total of approximately $7 million , to shareholders. On February 28, 2018, CSG acquired Business Ink, a multi-channel business communications company based in Austin, Texas, which added $5 million of revenue for the one month of CSG’s ownership in its first quarter results. In March 2018, CSG refinanced its existing credit agreement, extending the term of the agreement through March 2023.\n“We executed well against our key initiatives aimed at creating long-term shareholder value,” said Bret Griess, president and chief executive officer for CSG. “We extended our partnership for ten years with one of Canada’s leading video entertainment and communications service providers. We added new logos with companies like Formula One, a global motor racing provider, and Rain, a next-generation mobile network operator in South Africa. And we acquired Business Ink, a leading provider of business communications, enabling us to leverage our operational talent, scale and platforms to drive value. We like our position as the financial strength of our business allows us to consistently return capital back to our shareholders, while also making smart and deliberate investments to grow our business like we did this past quarter.”\nFinancial Overview (unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\nQuarter Ended March 31, Percent 2018 2017 Changed Revenues $ 201,704 $ 192,470 5 % GAAP Results: Operating Income $ 25,767 $ 27,013 (5 %) Operating Margin 12.8 % 14.0 % — EPS $ 0.42 $ 0.62 (32 %) Non-GAAP Results: Operating Income $ 35,299 $ 34,645 2 % Operating Margin 17.5 % 18.0 % — EPS $ 0.69 $ 0.62 11 % For additional information and reconciliations regarding CSG’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the attached Exhibit 2 and the Investor Relations section of CSG’s website at www.csgi.com .\nResults of Operations\nTotal Revenues: Total revenues of 2018 were $201.7 million, a 5% increase when compared to revenues of $192.5 million of 2017, and a 2% decrease when compared to revenues of $205.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in revenues can be mainly attributed to the following: (i) one month of revenues of $5 million from our acquisition of Business Ink, a company that CSG acquired on February 28, 2018, and (ii) continued growth in CSG’s cloud solutions and managed services offerings, driven in large part by the full year impact of the Comcast customer conversions onto CSG’s platform that was completed last year. The sequential quarterly decrease can be primarily attributed to the higher level of revenues CSG typically experiences in the fourth quarter.\nGAAP Results: GAAP operating income of 2018 was $25.8 million, or 12.8% of total revenues, compared to $27.0 million, or 14.0% of total revenues, of 2017, and $26.0 million, or 12.7% of total revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP EPS of 2018 was $0.42, as compared to $0.62 of 2017, and $0.45 for the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP EPS is primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate of 9% of 2017, compared to an effective income tax rate of 31% for the current quarter. The lower first quarter 2017 income tax rate of 9% was primarily the result of an approximately $5 million net income tax benefit resulting from Comcast’s exercise of 1.4 million vested stock warrants in January 2017, which provided an approximately $0.15 GAAP EPS benefit.\nNon-GAAP Results: Non-GAAP operating income of 2018 was $35.3 million, or 17.5% of total revenues, compared to $34.6 million, or 18.0% of total revenues, of 2017, and $36.3 million, or 17.7% of total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP EPS of 2018 was $0.69, compared to $0.62 of 2017, and $0.62 for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe higher non-GAAP EPS of 2018 is primarily the result of a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 27%, compared to 34% of 2017, and 37% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate is due to the U.S. Tax Reform enacted in December 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at March 31, 2018 were $222.1 million, compared to $261.4 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease can be mainly attributed to the acquisition of Business Ink for approximately $70 million of cash in the quarter. CSG generated net cash flows from operations s ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 of $29.9 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and had non-GAAP free cash flow of $17.6 million and $20.4 million, respectively.\nSummary of 2018 Financial Guidance\nCSG is adjusting its financial guidance for the full year 2018 to include the ten months of its acquired Business Ink business as follows:\nAs of May 2, 2018 Previous GAAP Measures: Revenues $845 - $865 million $795 - $815 million Operating Margin Percentage 12.8% 14.5% EPS $1.89 - $2.02 $2.15 - $2.28 Cash Flows from Operating Activities $130 - $150 million $120 - $140 million Non-GAAP Measures: Operating Margin Percentage 16.9% 17.5% EPS $2.81 - $2.93 $2.76 - $2.89 For additional information and reconciliations regarding CSG’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the attached Exhibit 2 and the Investor Relations section of CSG’s website at www.csgi.com .\nConference Call\nCSG will host a conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, to discuss CSG’s first quarter results for 2018.

CSG believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with its GAAP financial measures, provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by CSG’s management in its financial and operational decision making. CSG uses these non-GAAP financial measures for the following purposes: Certain internal financial planning, reporting, and analysis; Forecasting and budgeting; Certain management compensation incentives; and Communications with CSG’s Board of Directors, stockholders, financial analysts, and investors.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided with the intent of providing investors with the following information:\nA more complete understanding of CSG’s underlying operational results, trends, and cash generating capabilities; Consistency and comparability with CSG’s historical financial results; and Comparability to similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not measures of performance under GAAP, and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. Limitations with the use of non-GAAP financial measures include the following items:\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles; The way in which CSG calculates non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the way in which other companies calculate similar non-GAAP financial measures; Non-GAAP financial measures do not include all items of income and expense that affect CSG’s operations and that are required by GAAP to be included in financial statements; Certain adjustments to CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures result in the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in CSG’s financial statements in future periods; and Certain charges excluded from CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures are cash expenses, and therefore do impact CSG’s cash position.\nCSG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement only. Additionally, CSG provides specific information regarding the treatment of GAAP amounts considered in preparing the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciles each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n Basis of Presentation\nThe table below outlines the exclusions from CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures:\nNon-GAAP Exclusions Operating\nIncome\nEPS Restructuring and reorganization charges X X Acquisition-related costs X X Stock-based compensation X X Amortization of acquired intangible assets X X Amortization of original issue discount (“OID”) — X Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt — X Unusual income tax matters — X CSG believes that excluding certain items in calculating its non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding CSG’s performance and these items are excluded for the following reasons:\nRestructuring and reorganization charges are expenses that result from cost reduction initiatives and/or significant changes to CSG’s business, to include such things as involuntary employee terminations, changes in management structure, divestitures of businesses, facility consolidations and abandonments, and fundamental reorganizations impacting operational focus and direction. These charges are not considered reflective of CSG’s recurring core business operating results. The exclusion of these items in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods. Acquisition-related costs relate to direct and incremental expenses related to business acquisitions, and thus, are not considered reflective of CSG’s recurring core business operating results. These costs typically include expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services. The exclusion of these costs in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods. Stock-based compensation results from CSG’s issuance of equity awards to its employees under incentive compensation programs. The amount of this incentive compensation in any period is not generally linked to the level of performance by employees or CSG. The exclusion of these expenses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to evaluate the non-cash expense related to compensation included in CSG’s results of operations, and therefore, the exclusion of this item allows investors to further evaluate the cash generating capabilities of CSG’s business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is the result of business acquisitions. A portion of the purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to acquired intangible assets (e.g., software, client relationships, etc.), which are then amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives. This annual amortization expense is generally unchanged from the initial estimates, regardless of performance of the acquired business in any one period. Also, the value assigned to acquired intangible assets in a business combination is based on various estimates and valuation techniques, and does not necessarily represent the costs CSG would incur to develop such capabilities internally. Additionally, amortization of acquired intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency, and can be significantly affected by the timing and size of an acquisition. The exclusion of these expenses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to evaluate the non-cash expense related to acquisitions included in CSG’s results of operations, and therefore, the exclusion of this item allows investors to further evaluate the cash generating capabilities of CSG’s business. The convertible notes OID is the result of allocating a portion of the principal balance of the debt at issuance to the equity component of the instrument, as required under current accounting rules. This OID is then amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective convertible debt instrument. The interest expense related to the amortization of the OID is a non-cash expense, and therefore, the exclusion of this item allows investors to further evaluate the cash interest costs of CSG’s convertible notes for cash flow, liquidity, and debt service purposes. Gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt are a result of the refinancing of CSG’s credit agreement and/or repurchase of CSG’s convertible notes. These activities are not considered reflective of CSG’s recurring core business operating results. Any resulting gain or loss is generally non-cash income or expense, and therefore, the exclusion of this item allows investors to further evaluate the cash impact of these repurchases for cash flow and liquidity purposes. In addition, the exclusion of these gains and losses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP EPS allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current operating results with historical and future periods. Unusual items within CSG’s quarterly and/or annual income tax expense can occur from such things as income tax accounting timing matters, income taxes related to unusual events, or as a result of different treatment of certain items for book accounting and income tax purposes. Consideration of such items in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods.\nCSG also reports non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP free cash flow. Management believes non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to investors in evaluating CSG’s operating performance, debt servicing capabilities, and enterprise valuation. CSG defines non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, foreign currency transaction adjustments, and unusual items, such as restructuring and reorganization charges, and gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt, as discussed above. Additionally, management uses non-GAAP free cash flow, among other measures, to assess its financial performance and cash generating capabilities, and believes that it is useful to investors because it shows CSG’s cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase its common stock, pay cash dividends, and fund ongoing operations. CSG defines non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less the purchases of property and equipment.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP Operating Income:\nThe reconciliations of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income for the indicated periods are as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 % of % of Amounts Revenues Amounts Revenues GAAP operating income $ 25,767 12.8 % $ 27,013 14.0 % Restructuring and reorganization charges (1) 900 0.4 % 248 0.1 % Acquisition-related costs 2,355 1.2 % - - % Stock-based compensation (1) 4,570 2.3 % 5,670 3.0 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 1,707 0.8 % 1,714 0.9 % Non-GAAP operating income $ 35,299 17.5 % $ 34,645 18.0 % (1) Stock-based compensation included in the tables above and following excludes amounts that have been recorded in restructuring and reorganization charges.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2017 the GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax rates were approximately 9% and 34%, respectively. The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax rate relates primarily to the timing treatment of the net income tax benefit from Comcast’s exercise of their vested stock warrants in January 2017.
