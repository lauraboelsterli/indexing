    "text": "LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - Standard Life Aberdeen on Wednesday said it expected to save an extra 100 million pounds ($132.64 million) a year in ‘efficiency savings’ by 2020 after it completes the sale of its insurance business to Phoenix Group .\nThe company, which on Tuesday said it planned to return as much as 1.75 billion pounds to investors, said the savings would come as a result of its revised operating model and were in addition to cost synergies of 250 million pounds a year.\n$1 = 0.7539 pounds Reporting by Simon Jessop; editing by Emma Rumney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
