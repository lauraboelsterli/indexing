    "text": "7 COMMENTS As mid-term elections get underway and lawmakers in Washington contemplate new rules to regulate political advertising online, the digital advertising industry is attempting to beat them to the punch.\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance, an organization that establishes and enforces guidelines across social media companies, consumer brands, advertising organizations and publishing outlets, on Tuesday announced a series of new rules aimed at making digital political ads more transparent.\nThe guidance requires advertisers to provide consumers with a link to a searchable database with more information about who placed the ad, their spending and contributions, and how the advertiser can be reached, among other things.\nThe disclosures apply to ads “that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office and in certain state-wide elections,” according to the Digital Advertising Alliance.\nRelated Video Based on the information that's now coming out of congressional committees, Russian goals to interfere in the 2016 election were very broad. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains just how sophisticated the Russian efforts were using social media. Photo: AP (Originally Published November 2, 2017) The new guidelines come as political advertising online is being subjected to heightened scrutiny from legislators and federal regulators. In the last year, Facebook , Twitter and Alphabet Inc.’s Google all revealed that Russian operatives use their advertising services in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.\nThose revelations spurred lawmakers to propose legislation that would require greater transparency for political ads aimed at consumers online. More broadly, non-political marketers and advertising platforms have a vested interest in cleaning up the digital ad ecosystem and making it more transparent, particularly as brand-safety concerns continue to crop up. Advertisers have threatened to curtail spending over concerns their messages are appearing alongside misleading political messages and violent or racist content.\n“The more that we can give consumers transparency, the better that ecosystem is for all the brands that use advertising,” said Lou Mastria, the executive director of the Digital Advertising Alliance.\nFacebook itself has announced plans to disclose additional information about the political ads purchased on its platform, a move that has rankled some publishers who are concerned that the social media giant’s guidelines are overbroad. Facebook’s guidelines will categorize ad spending on topics such as U.S. poverty, immigration and terrorism as political advertisements. Facebook participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance.\nThe centerpiece of the new initiative from the Digital Advertising Alliance is an icon, called “PoliticalAd,” that will be displayed on political advertisements and direct consumers to additional information about the advertiser. It is similar in size and appearance to the “AdChoices” logo, also developed by the group, which provides consumers with context about various advertisers.\nViolations of the new guidelines will be watchdogged by a group within the Council of Better Business Bureaus and the Data and Marketing Association, which can flag offenders and refer problems to the Federal Election Commission.\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance was launched in 2010 to provide greater transparency related to online ads based on consumer activity. The alliance is managed by a consortium of trade groups, including the 4A’s, Association of National Advertisers and the Interactive Advertising Bureau.",
