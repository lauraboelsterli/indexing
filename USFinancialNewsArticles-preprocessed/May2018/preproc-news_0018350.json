For the three months ended March 31, 2018, Delek Logistics reported net income attributable to all partners of $20.0 million, or $0.59 per diluted common limited partner unit. This compares to net income attributable to all partners of $14.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted common limited partner unit, in the first quarter 2017. Distributable cash flow was $27.3 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to $18.4 million in the prior-year period.\nFor the first quarter 2018, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") was $34.7 million compared to $23.9 million in the prior-year period. The contribution from the Big Spring logistics assets, higher gross margin per barrel in west Texas, improved performance from the Paline Pipeline and the East Texas marketing agreement were the primary factors in the year-over-year increase.\nUzi Yemin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Delek Logistics' general partner, remarked: \"During the first quarter, we achieved our highest quarterly EBITDA to date and our distributable cash flow coverage ratio was 1.14x, which was an improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis. As of March 31, 2018, we had $205.3 million of capacity on our credit facility, following the completion of the Big Spring logistics acquisition. Our financial position supported the 8.7 percent year-over-year increase in our declared first quarter distribution.\"\nYemin concluded, \"With the addition of the Big Spring logistics assets and expansion of the Paline pipeline to 42,000 barrels per day in March, we have created additional growth for Delek Logistics. Work continues on the announced joint venture with Green Plains Partners and its proposed purchase of two light product terminals from an affiliate of American Midstream as we move through the regulatory process. We continue to explore potential opportunities, including ways to partner with Delek US and third party growth options to create long-term value for our unit holders. We anticipate that the financial flexibility provided by our balance sheet and our focus on growth initiatives should support a distribution per limited partner unit increase of at least 10% annually through 2019.\"\nBig Spring Logistics Asset Acquisition\nThe acquisition of the Big Spring logistics assets was effective March 1, 2018. These assets consist of storage tanks, salt wells and products terminals and a new marketing agreement associated with Delek US' Big Spring, Texas refinery. The expected annual EBITDA is approximately $40.2 million and the purchase price was $315.0 million, which equates to a 7.8x EBITDA multiple. This transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings on the revolving credit facility.\nThis acquisition includes the following assets and agreements:\nStorage tanks and salt wells - Approximately 3.0 million barrels of aggregate shell capacity, consisting of 75 tanks, 4 salt wells and ancillary assets, including piping and pumps located at the refinery and at Duncan, Oklahoma.\nProducts terminals - An asphalt terminal that operated at 3,900 barrels per day during the second half of 2017 and a light products terminal with 54,000 barrels per day throughput capacity, which operated at 28,000 barrels per day during the second half of 2017.\nMarketing agreement - A new wholesale marketing agreement under which Delek Logistics provides services necessary to market various refinery products produced at Delek US' Big Spring refinery. During the second half of 2017, total sales volume for products covered by this agreement was approximately 74,700 barrels per day.\nDistribution and Liquidity\nOn April 26, 2018, Delek Logistics declared a quarterly cash distribution for the first quarter of $0.75 per limited partner unit, which equates to $3.00 per limited partner unit on an annualized basis. This distribution will be paid on May 15, 2018 to unitholders of record on May 7, 2018. This represents a 3.4 percent increase from the fourth quarter 2017 distribution of $0.725 per limited partner unit, or $2.90 per limited partner unit on an annualized basis, and an 8.7 percent increase over Delek Logistics’ first quarter 2017 distribution of $0.69 per limited partner unit, or $2.76 per limited partner unit annualized. For the first quarter 2018, the total cash distribution declared to all partners, including IDRs, was approximately $24.0 million. Based on the declared distribution for the first quarter 2018, the distributable cash flow coverage ratio for the first quarter was 1.14x.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Delek Logistics had total debt of approximately $737.7 million and cash of $4.8 million. Additional borrowing capacity, subject to certain covenants, under the $700.0 million credit facility was $205.3 million. The total leverage ratio for the first quarter 2018 was approximately 4.6 times, which is within the current requirements of the maximum allowable leverage of 5.5 times.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter 2018 was $167.9 million compared to $129.5 million in the prior year period. The increase in revenue is primarily due to higher sales prices in the west Texas wholesale business and the completion of the Big Spring acquisition effective March 1, 2018. Total operating expenses were $12.6 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to $10.4 million in the first quarter 2017. This increase was primarily due to the contribution from the Big Spring acquisition and variable expenses. Total segment contribution margin was $36.3 million in the first quarter 2018 compared to $26.5 million in the first quarter 2017. General and administrative expenses were $3.0 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $2.8 million in the prior year period.\nPipelines and Transportation Segment\nContribution margin in the first quarter 2018 was $19.7 million compared to $16.1 million in the first quarter 2017. This change was primarily due to the contribution from the Big Spring acquisition, combined with improved performance from the Paline Pipeline and Lion Pipeline system. These year-over-year improvements were partially offset by lower results from the SALA pipeline system. Operating expenses were $9.6 million in the first quarter 2017 compared to $8.2 million in the prior year period primarily due to the acquisition in March 2018 and variable costs.\nWholesale Marketing and Terminalling Segment\nDuring the first quarter 2018, contribution margin was $16.7 million, compared to $10.4 million in the first quarter 2017. This increase was primarily due to improved performance in the west Texas wholesale operations, the contribution from the Big Spring acquisition, and East Texas marketing agreement on a year-over-year basis. Operating expenses increased to $3.0 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to $2.2 million in the prior year period primarily due to the acquisition in March 2018.\nIn the west Texas wholesale business, average throughput in the first quarter 2018 was 15,942 barrels per day compared to 14,467 barrels per day in the first quarter 2017. The wholesale gross margin in west Texas increased year-over-year to $5.16 per barrel and included approximately $1.2 million, or $0.81 per barrel, from renewable identification numbers (RINs) generated in the quarter. During the first quarter 2017, the wholesale gross margin was $2.72 per barrel and included $1.1 million from RINs, or $0.86 per barrel. On a year-over-year basis, continued growth in drilling activity in the Permian Basin increased fuel demand and improved the supply/demand balance, which led to improved performance in the west Texas wholesale business.\nAverage terminalling throughput volume of 143,476 barrels per day during the quarter increased on a year-over-year basis from 114,900 barrels per day in the first quarter 2017 primarily due to higher throughput at the Tyler, Texas terminal and the addition of the Big Spring terminal. During the first quarter 2018, average volume under the East Texas marketing agreement with Delek US was 73,244 barrels per day compared to 63,396 barrels per day during the first quarter 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results | Conference Call Information\nDelek Logistics will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 7:00 a.m. Central Time.

EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow coverage ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other partnerships in its industry, Delek Logistics' definitions of EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other partnerships.
