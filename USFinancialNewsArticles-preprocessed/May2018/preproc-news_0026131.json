FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final First Leg - Liverpool vs Manchester City - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - April 4, 2018 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola before the match Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine/File Photo\nCity broke the Premier League points record by taking their season’s tally to 97 with a 3-1 win over Brighton and Hove Albion on Wednesday and victory over Southampton on Sunday will see them finish the campaign with a century.\nThey have also equalled the English top-flight record of 31 wins in a season and racked up a record 105 goals so far in 37 matches.\n“In the last few weeks these numbers have helped us keep focus,” Guardiola told a news conference.\n“There are so many (special moments)... the 18 games won in a row is the reason we have won the league. That was the key point of the season.”\nGuardiola has ruled out making wholesale changes to the squad in the transfer window but said he would like to add “one or two more players” to offer more tactical solutions on the pitch.\n“Maybe some are not happy, they want to play more and can ask to leave, but not too many,” he added.\n“We made a high investment last year because it was an old team – 10, 11 players more than 31 years old. Now we are going to change some details with Yaya (Toure) leaving, but not too many. One, maybe two (signings).”\nThe Spaniard confirmed he wants forwards Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling to stay at the club.\n“Last season, I said maybe 1,000 times that Sergio will stay until he decides his time is over,” Guardiola said.\nThe club are keen to hand Sterling a new long-term contract after his most successful season in the league in which has found the net 23 times in all competitions.\n“The club, chairman and myself want him to stay a long time, renew his contract — but we are going on holiday in a few days,” said Guardiola.\n“We all want him to stay as long as possible.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis",
