    "text": "May 28, 2018 / 2:02 PM / in 11 minutes Myanmar police witness says searched Reuters reporters' phones without warrant Sam Aung Moon , Yimou Lee 4 Min Read\nYANGON (Reuters) - Police in Myanmar examined the mobile phones of two Reuters reporters accused of possessing secret documents without a search warrant after their arrests in December, an officer told a court on Monday, in what has become a landmark press freedom case. Detained Reuters journalist Wa Lone leaves escorted by police after a court hearing in Yangon, Myanmar May 28, 2018. REUTERS/Ann Wang\nProsecution witness Major Aung Kyaw San said police did not have a warrant to search the phones because the reporters were accused under the Official Secrets Act, which gave officers the power to make arrests and begin an investigation without needing prior permission from a court.\nThat assertion was disputed by defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw, who told Reuters after the hearing that only the arrests were allowed before seeking the approval of a judge. “This is not acceptable,” he said. “Regarding (obtaining) evidence, a warrant is needed.”\n(Follow latest updates on detained reporters here )\nLead prosecutor Kyaw Min Aung declined to comment.\nMyanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay was not immediately available for comment. Previously, he has declined to discuss details of the proceedings or the police investigation, saying Myanmar’s courts were independent.\nThe court in Yangon has been holding hearings since January to decide whether Wa Lone, 32, and his Reuters colleague Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, will be charged under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.\nJudge Ye Lwin last week accepted as evidence printed copies of documents that Major Aung Kyaw San, a police IT expert, said were found on the reporters’ phones. The documents included alleged confidential government letters and plans for the development of an island off Myanmar’s west coast for tourism.\nDefense lawyers had argued the documents should not be admitted as evidence because it was unclear who had access to the phones after the reporters’ arrests on Dec. 12, and that the prosecution did not explain how the 21 documents were relevant to the case.\nSome of the documents came from the Facebook Messenger app, the defense said, and it was not clear the reporters themselves had accessed them.

REUTERS/Ann Wang\n“We don’t know anything about the documents they said they found in our phones,” Wa Lone told reporters after Monday’s hearing. “The documents can be sent automatically to Messenger.”\nAt the time of their arrests, the reporters had been working on an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys in a village in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state. The killings took place during a military crackdown that United Nations agencies say sent nearly 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.\nThe reporters have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some rolled up papers at a restaurant in northern Yangon by two policemen they had not met before, having been invited to meet the officers for dinner.\nLast month, Police Captain Moe Yan Naing testified that a senior officer had ordered his subordinates to plant secret documents on Wa Lone to “trap” the reporter.\nAt a news conference on May 15, Police Director General Aung Win Oo dismissed the testimony as untruthful.\nAfter his court appearance, Moe Yan Naing was sentenced to a year in jail for violating police discipline and his family was evicted from police housing. Police have said the eviction and his sentencing were not related to his testimony, but have declined to elaborate further.\nGlobal advocates for press freedom, human rights activists, as well the United Nations and several Western countries, have called for the release of the Reuters journalists.\nOn Monday, diplomats from France, Denmark and the European Union - as well as others - observed the proceedings.\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled for Tuesday.
