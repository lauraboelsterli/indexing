    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ooma, Inc. (NYSE:OOMA), a smart communications platform for businesses and consumers, today released financial results for the first quarter fiscal 2019 ended April 30, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2019 Financial Highlights\nRevenue : Total revenue was $30.2 million, up 10% year-over-year. Subscription and services revenue increased to $27.3 million and was 90% of total revenue, driven by 20% year-over-year growth in our business and residential subscription and services revenue. Net Loss : GAAP net loss was $3.7 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, in the first quarter fiscal 2018. Non-GAAP net loss was $0.8 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA : Adjusted EBITDA was ($0.5) million compared to $0.1 million in the prior year period.\nFor more information about non-GAAP net loss and Adjusted EBITDA, see the section below titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and the reconciliation provided in this release.\n“We executed well in Q1 and once again achieved 20% year over year growth in core recurring revenue,” said Eric Stang, chief executive officer of Ooma. “Our Q1 performance represents a solid start to our fiscal year 2019. Looking ahead, we remain committed to our three key FY19 strategic initiatives, which are to continue the fast growth of Ooma Office for small businesses, capitalize on our Voxter acquisition to serve larger businesses with custom UCaaS solutions, and bring our home security solution to fruition including integration of the Butterfleye video security camera.”\nBusiness Outlook\nOur guidance below includes the effects of the new accounting standard ASC 606 and the impact of our recent acquisitions.\nFor the second quarter fiscal 2019, Ooma expects to report:\nTotal revenue in the range of $30.5 million to $31.3 million. GAAP net loss in the range of $3.8 million to $4.3 million and GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.19 to $0.22. Non-GAAP net loss in the range of $0.8 million to $1.3 million and non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.04 to $0.07.\nFor the full fiscal year 2019, Ooma expects to report:\nTotal revenue in the range of $124.5 million to $127.0 million. GAAP net loss in the range of $14.2 million to $16.7 million, and GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.72 to $0.84. Non-GAAP net loss in the range of $2.5 million to $4.5 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.13 to $0.23.\nThe following is a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP net loss and GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share to non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share guidance for the second fiscal quarter and the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019 (in millions, except per share data):\nProjected range Three Months Ending Fiscal Year Ending July 31, 2018 January 31, 2019 (unaudited) GAAP net loss ($3.8)-($4.3) ($14.2)-($16.7) Stock-based compensation and related taxes 2.8 10.6-11.0 Acquisition-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets 0.2 1.1-1.2 Non-GAAP net loss ($0.8)-($1.3) ($2.5)-($4.5) GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share ($0.19)-($0.22) ($0.72)-($0.84) Stock-based compensation and related taxes 0.14 0.53-0.55 Acquisition-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets 0.01 0.06 Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share ($0.04)-($0.07) ($0.13)-($0.23) Weighted-average number of shares used in per share amounts: Basic and diluted 19.5 19.9 Conference Call Information:\nOoma will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time today, May 22, 2018. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the company's website prior to the conference call. Parties in the United States and Canada can access the call by dialing +1 (833) 233-4456, using conference ID 7132779. International parties can access the call by dialing +1 (647) 689-4135, using conference ID 7132779.\nThe webcast will be accessible on Ooma's investor relations website at http://investors.ooma.com for a period of one year. A telephonic replay of the conference call will be available through Tuesday, May 29, 2018. To access the replay, parties in the United States and Canada should call +1 (800) 585-8367 and use conference ID 7132779. International parties should call +1 (416) 621-4642 and enter conference ID 7132779.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents the net loss before interest and other expense or income, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization and other non-GAAP expenses.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related taxes, acquisition related costs, amortization of intangibles and non-cash income tax benefit.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results and core business operations. Ooma considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful measures of the operating performance of the company, because they contain adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers to be Ooma's core operating performance and are used by the company's management for that purpose. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures allow for a better evaluation of the company's performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of the company's core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance of a company.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only to aid an understanding of the company's operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments relate to items that the company generally expects to continue to recognize. The adjustment of these items should not be construed as an inference that the adjusted gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, both GAAP financial measures of Ooma's financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together. Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the tables below.\nDisclosure Information\nOoma uses the investor relations section on its website as a means of complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor Ooma's investor relations website in addition to following Ooma's press releases, SEC filings, and public conference calls and webcasts.\nLegal Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, statements regarding future economic performance, finances, and expectations and objectives of management constitute forward-looking statements.
