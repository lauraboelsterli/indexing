    "text": "Lawyers for Jay-Z say the Securities and Exchange Commission has gone on a \"celebrity hunt\" by demanding the rapper submit to unlimited questioning about various businesses.\nThe lawyers wrote in a court filing Monday that he has agreed to testify for a full day before the regulatory agency but is opposing appearing for as many days as the SEC would like.\nA hearing on the matter is set for Tuesday in Manhattan federal court.\nThe court filing was made in advance of the hearing scheduled by U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe.\nThe SEC has said it is investigating the Iconix Brand Group to learn if federal securities laws were violated when the company reported financial results.\nJay-Z sold his Rocawear apparel brand to Iconix over a decade ago.",
