(NASDAQ:MSBF) (the “Company”), parent company of Millington Bank, reported today the results of its operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company reported net income of $1.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $549,000, or $0.10 per diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the combined effects of an increase of net interest income of $707,000 and a decrease of $105,000 in the provision for loan losses, offset by an increase in non-interest expenses of $270,000.\nHighlights for the quarter:\nReturn on average assets was 0.74% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 0.48% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and return on average equity was 5.65% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 2.97% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 3.24% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 3.29% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 due to a change deposit pricing.\nThe efficiency ratio which is calculated by calculated by dividing non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, improved to 66.29% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 71.83% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 driven by an increase in net interest income year over year.\nNon-performing assets were at 0.64% of total assets at March 31, 2018 compared with 0.73% at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-performing loans was 153.24% at March 31, 2018 compared to 130.99% at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s balance sheet reflected total asset growth of $1.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to December 31, 2017, combined with improving asset quality, and capital levels that exceeded regulatory standards for a well-capitalized institution.\nDuring the quarter, the Company repurchased 244,537 shares of common stock for a total of $4.4 million as part of it's stock repurchase plan. The average price paid per share was $17.92.\nThe effective tax rate improved to 28.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 36.9% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nSelected Financial Ratios (unaudited; annualized where applicable) As of or for the quarter ended: 3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n6/30/2017\n3/31/2017\nReturn on average assets 0.74 % 0.20 % 0.90 % 0.59 % 0.48 % Return on average equity 5.65 % 1.48 % 6.31 % 3.91 % 2.97 % Net interest margin 3.24 % 3.30 % 3.37 % 3.35 % 3.29 % Loans / deposit ratio 110.85 % 105.46 % 116.04 % 109.31 % 112.26 % Shareholders' equity / total assets 12.37 % 12.97 % 13.39 % 14.79 % 15.37 % Efficiency ratio 66.29 % 62.26 % 64.21 % 68.02 % 71.83 % Book value per common share $ 12.63 $ 12.66 $ 12.57 $ 13.07 $ 12.93 Net Interest Income\nTotal interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $1.1 million, or 26.5%, to $5.4 million compared to $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. Interest income increased in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to a $100.9 million increase in average loan balances. Total interest expense increased by $429,000, or 61.5%, to $1.1 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to a mix of higher deposit rates and average deposit balances.\nNet interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $707,000, or 19.7% to $4.3 million compared to $3.6 million for the same three-month period in 2017. The change for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily a result of an increase in average earning assets of $94.4 million. The annualized net interest spread was 3.07% and 3.12% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company's annualized net interest margin decreased to 3.24% compared to 3.29% for the corresponding three-month period in 2017.\nOther Income and Other Expense\nOther income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $204,000, as compared to $187,000 for the same period in 2017. Other expense, which consists of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expense, professional services and other non-interest expenses totaled $3.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2017 with the $270,000 increase primarily attributable to salaries and employee benefits as a result of merit and infrastructure increases.\nTaxes\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a $407,000 tax provision compared to a provision of $321,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The effective tax rate improved to 28.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 36.9% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. As a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, the federal tax rate for corporations was reduced to 21% during 2018. The increase in tax provision is attributable to an increase in pre-tax income offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate.\nEarnings Summary for Period Ended March 31, 2018\nThe following table presents condensed consolidated statements of income data for the periods indicated.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income (unaudited) (dollars in thousands, except for per share data)\nFor the quarter ended: 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 9/30/2017\n6/30/2017 3/31/2017 Net interest income $ 4,302 $ 4,325 $ 4,190 $ 3,924 $ 3,595 Provision for loan losses 90 200 490 300 195 Net interest income after provision for loan losses 4,212 4,125 3,700 3,624 3,400 Other income 204 211 205 219 187 Other expense 2,987 2,824 2,822 2,818 2,717 Income before income taxes 1,429 1,512 1,083 1,025 870 Income taxes (benefit) 407 1,240 (86 ) 293 321 Net income $ 1,022 $ 272 $ 1,169 $ 732 $ 549 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 0.19 $ 0.05 $ 0.21 $ 0.13 $ 0.10 Diluted $ 0.19 $ 0.05 $ 0.21 $ 0.13 $ 0.10 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 5,470,349 5,577,314 5,563,938 5,539,796 5,519,849 Diluted 5,507,443 5,588,598 5,574,535 5,679,012 5,613,387 Statement of Condition Highlights at March 31, 2018\nBalance sheet growth, with total assets amounting to $564.0 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.0 million, or 0.18%, compared to December 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s total gross loans receivable were $486.4 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $7.6 million, or 1.6%, from December 31, 2017.\nSecurities held to maturity were $36.4 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 5.5%, compared to December 31, 2017.\nDeposits totaled $433.8 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 3.4%, compared to December 31, 2017.\nBorrowings totaled $58.1 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $20.4 million, or 54.1%, compared to $37.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table presents condensed consolidated statements of condition data as of the dates indicated.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Condition (unaudited) (in thousands) At: 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 Cash and due from banks $ 1,871 $ 2,030 $ 1,800 $ 1,839 $ 2,051 Interest-earning demand deposits with banks 15,484 20,279 6,971 7,195 9,198 Securities held to maturity 36,375 38,482 40,752 42,441 42,716 Loans receivable, net of allowance 480,916 473,405 461,285 426,370 398,447 Premises and equipment 8,580 8,698 8,804 8,902 8,918 Federal home Loan Bank of New York stock, at cost 3,049 2,131 3,512 2,263 2,626 Bank owned life insurance 14,294 14,197 14,097 13,996 13,891 Accrued interest receivable 1,642 1,607 1,548 1,402 1,277 Other assets 1,816 2,211 2,988 2,690 2,784 Total assets $ 564,027 $ 563,040 $ 541,757 $ 507,098 $ 481,908 Deposits $ 433,843 $ 448,913 $ 397,510 $ 390,063 $ 354,931 Borrowings 58,075 37,675 68,375 38,675 49,175 Other liabilities 2,350 3,427 3,332 3,371 3,735 Shareholders' equity 69,759 73,025 72,540 74,989 74,067 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 564,027 $ 563,040 $ 541,757 $ 507,098 $ 481,908 Loans\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s net loan portfolio totaled $480.9 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 1.6%, compared to $473.4 million at December 31, 2017.
