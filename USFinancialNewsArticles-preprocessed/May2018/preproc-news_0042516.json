    "text": "HONG KONG, May 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Value Exchange International, Inc. (OTCQB:VEII), a provider of IT and e-pay retail solutions, reported its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company filed its Form 10-Q quarterly report for fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission or “SEC” on May 9, 2018. All numbers are in U.S. Dollars.\nSummary of 2018 Financial Results and Other Business Highlights\nRecord Quarterly Revenues of $2.166 million, up 30.9% compared to same period from last year, mainly attributable to increased systems maintenance and product sales.\nNet income of $251,778, down 18.9% compared to same period from last year, mainly attributable to the increase in our cost of technical staff, contracting fees to suppliers and overhead.\nNet cash from operations increased 172.9%, compared to same period from last year.\nCompany increased support business from largest personal health care and beauty retailer in China.\nAs part of our effort to expand our product line, the Company started to sell smart luggage tags in a major Chinese airport.\nCompany CEO, Kenneth Tan said, \"Value Exchange continues to grow its core IT business. The expansion of business with the largest personal health care and cosmetic retailer in China and the acquisition of the Manilla, Philippines IT business are two recent examples of our ongoing efforts to expand our IT business. Increased costs for staff and overhead for the core IT business dampened net income in the quarter. Our challenge is increase profit and profit margins with increased revenues. We understand that this challenge requires better profit margins from core IT business as well as finding newer, higher profit margin IT products and services. Compared to the financial condition of the Company prior to 2016, we believe we have made significant strides in establishing a sustainable IT business, but we also understand and seek to address the challenges of our company to achieve and sustain better net income in the highly competitive IT business in our markets, especially with many larger competitors.”\nBusiness Outlook\nMr. Tan said, “We are encouraged by revenue growth in 1 st quarter of 2018. Key to continued revenue growth and improving net profit in fiscal year 2018 will be increasing net profit margins in existing IT business and new business from the Chinese personal health care and cosmetic retailer as well as any other new IT business.”\nFinancial Summary\nNet revenues . Net revenues were $2,166,441 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $1,654,562 for the same period in 2017, an increase of 30.9%. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in our revenue from i) systems maintenance with revenue increasing and ii) sales of hardware and consumables with revenue increasing; offset systems development and integration revenue decreasing from $117,944 to $98,839 for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nCost of services . Our cost of services increased to $1,605,218 or 74.1% of net revenues, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $962,305 or 58.2% of net revenues, for the same period in 2017, an increase of $642,913 or 66.8%. The increase in cost of services was mainly attributable to the increase in our cost of technical staff, contracting fees to suppliers and overhead.\nGross profit . Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $561,223 or 25.9% of net revenues, as compared to $692,257 or 41.8% of net revenues, for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $131,034 or 18.9%. The decrease of gross profit was largely due to the increase in cost of services, offset by the increase in net revenues compare to the same period of 2017.\nProfit from operations . As a result of the above, our profit from operations totaled $218,168 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $396,256 for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $178,088 or 44.9%.\nGeneral and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses increased 16.7% from comparable period last year. The primary reason for the increase was attributable to an increase in office rent and professional fee expenses.\nNet income . As a result of the foregoing, we had a net income of $251,778 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $435,617 for the same period in 2017, a decrease of $177,507 or 40.7%, as a result of the factors described above.\nThe financial summary above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form 10-Q Quarterly Report for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on May 9, 2018.\nMatthew Mecke Email: matthew@mecke.ch\nSource:Value Exchange International, Inc",
