It’s going to be a tough game — we know they have so much quality. But we don’t need to forget that we have so much quality as well.\n“We need to be going to Kiev with a lot of confidence... We deserve to be there, so we need to show that, be brave and do our thing. Then we’ll see what’s going to happen.”\nLiverpool’s leading scorer Mohamed Salah, along with Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, have combined to help the club score a record 46 goals in 14 Champions League matches on the way to the final.\nLiverpool head into the Madrid showdown on the back of a 4-0 win over Brighton and Hove Albion in their final league match but face a tough test as the Spanish side fight for their third consecutive Champions League crown and 13th overall.
