    "text": "May 5, 2018 / 6:32 PM / Updated 20 hours ago Golf-Uihlein and Mickelson make big moves as Woods's putting improves Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMay 5 (Reuters) - Peter Uihlein narrowly missed the course record and Phil Mickelson surged into contention as Tiger Woods enjoyed his best round of the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina on Saturday.\nUihlein shot a nine-under 62 for an early share of the tournament lead with late-starting overnight leader Peter Malnati at seven under par.\nThe former top-ranked amateur had five consecutive birdies from the fifth hole, then added an eagle and two birdies as he missed by one Rory McIlroyâ€™s 2015 Quail Hollow record.\nMickelson also took advantage of softer greens to shoot seven-under 64 and move into a tie for fifth at five-under 208.\nWoods, who has struggled with his putting this week, delivered six birdies on Saturday for a three-under 68 to go one-under 212, six strokes off the early lead.\nA bogey at the last, where Woods three-putted, tempered the improved play.\nThe former world number one had moved to four under with three consecutive birdies from the 13th.\nHe had two bogeys and three birdies on the front nine on a day when he narrowly missed several other birdie opportunities.\nMcIlroy also made a move with a five-under 66 to stand at three-under 210.\nThe Northern Irishman had four birdies in a row before also bogeying the final hole.
