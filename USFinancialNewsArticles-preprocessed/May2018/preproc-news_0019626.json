    "text": "BUENA, N.J., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teligent, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLGT), a New Jersey-based specialty generic pharmaceutical company, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nThe Company adopted ASC 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on January 1, 2018. To understand the financial impact of adopting ASC 606, see the Reconciliation of Revenue (net), Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin table included\nAfter adoption of ASC 606, total revenue of $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 26% over the same period in 2017. Total revenue was driven primarily by $8.9 million of sales generated by our U.S. generic topical and injectable pharmaceutical products, a decrease of 34% over the same quarter in 2017 and $4.3 million of international revenues, an increase of 46% over the same quarter in 2017\nAfter adoption of ASC 606, gross margin of 36% for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease from the 55% reported in the same period in 2017\nOperating loss of $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to operating income of $3.0 million in the same period in 2017\n$3.4 million of product development and research expenses in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2017\nDue to the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates during the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a non-cash gain in the amount of $1.3 million related to the foreign currency translation of our intercompany loans to three of our wholly-owned subsidiaries; and other balances held in currencies other than local currency, compared to a non-cash gain in the amount of $1.1 million in the same period in 2017\nAdjusted EBITDA, before product development and research expenses, in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.9 million, compared to $8.6 million for the same period in 2017\nYear to date, the Company received approval for four ANDAs in the U.S.\nYear to date, the Company launched four new products in the U.S.\n“We are pleased with our solid first quarter 2018 financial results, particularly the performance of our US portfolio of topical and injectable pharmaceutical products as well as the continued strong performance and further growth opportunities for our Canadian operations,” said Jason Grenfell-Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Grenfell-Gardner continued, “The expansion of our Buena, New Jersey manufacturing facility continues to progress, achieving two major milestones. I am proud to report the facility went clean on April 20th and manufactured our first injectable engineering batch on April 24th. In addition, we received four ANDA approvals year to date, Betamethasone Dipropionate Lotion USP (Augmented) 0.05%, Halobetasol Propionate Ointment, 0.05%, Ciclopirox Shampoo, 1%, and Clobetasol Propionate Cream USP, 0.05%. Collectively, these four products represent $189.6 million of addressable market per IQVIA data.”\n“We now have 29 ANDAs on file with the US FDA. Based on IQVIA data as of March 2018, these 29 ANDAs represent a total addressable market of approximately $1.8 billion. We remain confident in the growth of our business, our plans to work closely with all members of the organization to improve profitability, and our ability to deliver gross margin and EBITDA in line with our 2018 guidance.” Mr. Grenfell-Gardner concluded.\nAbout Teligent, Inc.\nTeligent is a specialty generic pharmaceutical company.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, and other statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts and statements identified by words such as “plan,” “believe,” “continue,” “should” or words of similar meaning. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations include, but are not limited to: our inability to meet current or future regulatory requirements in connection with existing or future ANDAs; our inability to achieve profitability; our failure to obtain FDA approvals as anticipated; our inability to execute and implement our business plan and strategy; the potential lack of market acceptance of our products; our inability to protect our intellectual property rights; changes in global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory factors; and our inability to complete successfully future product acquisitions. These statements are based on our current beliefs or expectations and are inherently subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in Teligent, Inc.’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Teligent, Inc. does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial information required in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Teligent is also presenting EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA which are non-GAAP financial measures. Since EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA before product development and research costs are non-GAAP financial measures, they should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Teligent's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Company, is calculated as follows:\nNet income (loss), plus:\nDepreciation expense\nAmortization of intangibles\nLoss on impairment\nInterest expense, net\nNon-cash interest expense\nProvision for income taxes\nInventory step up and acquisition costs related to acquisitions\nForeign currency exchange gain/loss\nNon-cash expenses, such as share-based compensation expense\nThe Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator, to both Company management and investors, of the past and expected ongoing operating performance of the Company. EBITDA is a commonly used and widely accepted measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is deemed by the Company to be a useful performance indicator because it includes an add back of non-cash and non-recurring operating expenses which have little to no bearing on cash flows and may be subject to uncontrollable factors not reflective of the Company's true operational performance.\nWhile the Company uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA before product development and research costs in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's performance, it is open to certain shortcomings. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not take into account the impact of capital expenditures on either the liquidity or the financial performance of the Company and likewise omit share-based compensation expenses, which may vary over time and may represent a material portion of overall compensation expense. Due to the inherent limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA before product development and research costs, the Company's management utilizes comparable GAAP financial measures to evaluate the business in conjunction with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and encourages investors to do likewise.\nThe Company also presents a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, to show the adjusted net income when EBITDA adjustments are added back or subtracted out of the traditional GAAP reported net income (loss). Adjusted diluted earnings per share, as defined by the Company, is equal to adjusted net income divided by the actual or anticipated diluted share count for the applicable period.\nTELIGENT, INC.
