    "text": "BRISBANE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for life-threatening food allergies, today announced financial results 2018. As of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $331.7 million.\n“We have come out of the first quarter of 2018 in a strong position with positive Phase 3 results for AR101, which have been met with widespread enthusiasm across the food allergy community,” said Stephen Dilly, MBBS, Ph.D., CEO of Aimmune. “Throughout 2018, we expect to present additional data from the AR101 Phase 3 program and to complete clinical and manufacturing activities in support of BLA and MAA filings. In parallel, we are ramping up precommercial activities for a potential commercial launch of AR101 in the United States in 2019. We are in a strong financial position following our successful public offering completed in the first quarter and continue to own world-wide rights to AR101 and all our other CODIT product candidates. We look forward to an event-rich year ahead as we continue to lead the way in developing therapies for life-threatening food allergies.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nAR101: Pivotal-stage biologic for the treatment of peanut allergy\nAnnounced positive results from the pivotal Phase 3 PALISADE trial and presented findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Completed enrollment in the PALISADE follow-on trial (ARC004), the real-world RAMSES trial, and the European ARTEMIS trial; data from RAMSES and ARC004 will support a Biologics License Application (BLA) in the United States, and data from ARTEMIS will support a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in Europe.\nCorporate\nStrengthened balance sheet with total net proceeds of $190.5 million from public offering of common stock. Broadened and extended supply agreement for the starting material of AR101 with Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts, a subsidiary of Archer Daniels Midland Company. Expanded the Aimmune Scientific Advisory Board with appointments of Prof. George du Toit and Dr. Wayne Shreffler, leading academic experts in allergy and immunology.\nUpcoming Anticipated Milestones\nTiming Anticipated Milestone 2Q 18 Presentation of Phase 3 PALISADE data at the EAACI 37 th Annual Congress 2H 18 RAMSES data available 2H 18 Initiate ARC005 trial of AR101 in infants and toddlers 2H 18 Data cut from ARC004 YE 18 Regeneron / Sanofi expected to initiate Phase 2 trial of AR101 with adjunctive dupilumab YE 18 Submit BLA for AR101 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration YE 18 Submit Investigational New Drug Application for AR201 in egg allergy 1H 19 ARTEMIS data available 1H 19 Submit MAA for AR101 to the European Medicines Agency 1H 19 Initiate Phase 2 clinical trial of AR201 in egg allergy 2H 19 Submit Investigational New Drug Application for AR301 in walnut allergy 2H 19 Initiate Phase 2 clinical trial of AR301 in walnut allergy 2H 19 Potential approval of AR101 in the U.S. First Quarter Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net loss was $49.5 million, compared to net loss of $25.9 million for the comparable period of 2017.\nOn a per share basis, net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $0.92, compared to net loss per share of $0.52 for the comparable period of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed an underwritten public offering for the sale and issuance of an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares of common stock, which includes the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares of common stock.\nResearch and development expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $33.4 million, compared to $17.4 million for the comparable period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the progression of the AR101 program, which includes the RAMSES, ARC008, ARTEMIS and ARC011 trials that commenced in 2017, and higher contract manufacturing costs to support clinical development.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $16.7 million, compared to $8.9 million for the comparable period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to additional employee-related costs and external professional services as Aimmune continues to build its infrastructure to support the development and potential commercialization of AR101. Stock-based compensation expense also increased primarily due to the January 2018 issuance of restricted common stock in connection with the expansion and extension of our long-term commercial supply agreement with Golden Peanut Company and modification of certain executives’ stock option arrangements.\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $331.7 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $182.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase primarily reflects net cash proceeds of $189.5 million received as of March 31, 2018 from an underwritten public offering, partially off-set by net cash used in operating activities of $39.8 million and purchase of property and equipment of $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nAbout Aimmune Therapeutics\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for life-threatening food allergies.
