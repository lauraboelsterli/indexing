    "text": "JASPER, Ind., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- German American Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GABC) reported record quarterly net income of $11.8 million, or $0.51 per share, for the first quarter of 2018. This earnings performance represents an increase of approximately $2.2 million, or 21% on a per share basis, over first quarter 2017 net income of $9.6 million, or $0.42 per share. The current quarter net income was comparable to fourth quarter 2017 reported net income of $11.6 million, or $0.51 per share.\nThe 2018 first quarter and the 2017 fourth quarter reported net income and earnings per share were positively impacted by the federal income tax reform legislation enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017. The lower federal income tax rate had a positive impact of approximately $1.5 million, or $0.06 per share, during the first quarter of 2018, while the fourth quarter 2017 results were enhanced by a net tax benefit of approximately $2.3 million, or $0.10 per share, related to a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the federal income tax reform legislation.\nIn addition to the federal income tax benefit noted above, the comparison of the record first quarter 2018 financial performance to that of the same quarter last year was largely attributable to a $1.3 million, or 16%, increase in non-interest income, primarily resulting from a $530,000 increase in trust and investment product fees, a $459,000 increase in interchange fee income, and a $290,000 increase in insurance revenues. Reported net interest income was also higher by $885,000, or 4%, in the first quarter of 2018 relative to that recorded in the first quarter of 2017, driven by a higher level of average loans outstanding. 2018 first quarter average loans outstanding increased by approximately $164.9 million, or 8%, from the average loans outstanding in the first quarter of the prior year. The year-over-year increase in loans outstanding was attributable to strong organic loan growth broadly based across the Company’s entire market area and within virtually all loan categories.\nThese net interest income and non-interest income revenue improvements, totaling approximately $2.2 million, were partially offset by approximately $1.4 million of increased non-interest expense, with the majority of that increase resulting from an additional $682,000 in salaries and benefits, primarily attributable to an increased number of full-time equivalent employees.\nCommenting on the Company’s record quarterly financial performance in the first quarter of 2018, Mark A. Schroeder, German American’s Chairman & CEO, stated, \"We continue to be extremely pleased with the pattern of consistent balance sheet growth and earnings improvement we’ve generated over the past several years. As evidenced by the strong level of loan growth we experienced within the past year and the current indication from our clients relative to future loan demand, our business and consumer clients throughout our market area continue to display a growing confidence in the vibrancy of the economy. Based on these trends, we continue to have a positive outlook regarding our ability to generate strong financial performance throughout the balance of 2018 and in the coming years.”\nThe Company also announced its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, which will be payable on May 20, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2018.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nTotal assets for the Company decreased to $3.125 billion at March 31, 2018, representing a decline of $19.3 million, or 2% on an annualized basis, compared with December 31, 2017 and an increase of $191.9 million, or 7%, compared with March 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, total loans increased $8.8 million, or 2% on an annualized basis, compared with December 31, 2017 and increased $166.9 million, or 8%, compared with March 31, 2017. The increase during the first quarter of 2018 was driven by an increase of approximately $21.2 million, or 9% on an annualized basis, of commercial real estate loans, partially mitigated by a decline of $4.4 million, or 4% on an annualized basis, of commercial and industrial loans, a seasonal decline of $4.1 million, or 5% on an annualized basis, of agricultural loans and a decline of $3.9 million, or 4% on annualized basis, of retail loans.\nEnd of Period Loan Balances 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 (dollars in thousands) Commercial & Industrial Loans $ 482,219 $ 486,668 $ 450,501 Commercial Real Estate Loans 947,948 926,729 865,717 Agricultural Loans 329,138 333,227 292,615 Consumer Loans 216,435 219,662 194,290 Residential Mortgage Loans 178,108 178,733 183,806 $ 2,153,848 $ 2,145,019 $ 1,986,929 Non-performing assets totaled $10.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $11.9 million of non-performing assets at December 31, 2017 and $5.9 million at March 31, 2017. Non-performing assets represented 0.34% of total assets at March 31, 2018 compared to 0.38% of total assets at December 31, 2017 and 0.20% of total assets at March 31, 2017. Non-performing loans totaled $10.6 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $11.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $5.7 million at March 31, 2017. Non-performing loans represented 0.49% of total loans at March 31, 2018 compared to 0.55% at December 31, 2017 and 0.29% at March 31, 2017. The decline in non-performing assets during the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to a partial charge-off on a single commercial lending relationship that was downgraded during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-performing Assets (dollars in thousands) 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Non-Accrual Loans $ 9,479 $ 11,091 $ 4,510 Past Due Loans (90 days or more) 1,105 719 1,183 Total Non-Performing Loans 10,584 11,810 5,693 Other Real Estate 68 54 208 Total Non-Performing Assets $ 10,652 $ 11,864 $ 5,901 Restructured Loans $ 124 $ 149 $ 28 The Company’s allowance for loan losses totaled $14.5 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $15.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $15.2 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses represented 0.67% of period-end loans at March 31, 2018 compared with 0.73% of period-end loans at December 31, 2017 and 0.76% of period-end loans at March 31, 2017. The decline in the allowance for loan losses during the first quarter of 2018 was largely related to the aforementioned partial charge-off on a single commercial lending relationship down-graded during the fourth quarter of 2017. From time to time, the Company has acquired loans through bank acquisitions with the most recent being in 2016. Under acquisition accounting treatment, loans acquired are recorded at fair value which includes a credit risk component, and therefore the allowance on loans acquired is not carried over from the seller. The Company held a net discount on acquired loans of $7.3 million as of March 31, 2018, $7.6 million at December 31, 2017 and $9.2 million at March 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits declined $16.9 million, or 3% on an annualized basis, as of March 31, 2018 compared with December 31, 2017 and increased $140.6 million, or 6%, compared with March 31, 2017.\nEnd of Period Deposit Balances 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 (dollars in thousands) Non-interest-bearing Demand Deposits $ 599,374 $ 606,134 $ 572,874 IB Demand, Savings, and MMDA Accounts 1,465,150 1,490,033 1,389,763 Time Deposits < $100,000 193,864 198,646 206,171 Time Deposits > $100,000 208,733 189,239 157,664 $ 2,467,121 $ 2,484,052 $ 2,326,472 Results of Operations Highlights – Quarter ended March 31, 2018\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $11,813,000, or $0.51 per share, which is relatively consistent with the fourth quarter 2017 net income of $11,621,000, or $0.51 per share, and an increase of 21% on a per share basis compared with the first quarter 2017 net income of $9,556,000, or $0.42 per share.\nThe first quarter of 2018 net income was positively impacted by lower federal income tax rates that resulted from the federal tax reform legislation enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017 that became effective January 1, 2018. The lower federal income tax rates had a positive impact of approximately $0.06 per share during the first quarter of 2018. The fourth quarter of 2017 results of operations were positively impacted by the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities related to the federal tax reform legislation. The revaluation resulted in a net tax benefit of $2,284,000, or approximately $0.10 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSummary Average Balance Sheet (Tax-equivalent basis / dollars in thousands) Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Principal\nBalance Income/\nExpense Yield/\nRate Principal\nBalance Income/\nExpense Yield/\nRate Principal\nBalance Income/\nExpense Yield/\nRate Assets Federal Funds Sold and Other Short-term Investments $ 8,556 $ 56 2.65 % $ 10,268 $ 34 1.33 % $ 12,554 $ 27 0.88 % Securities 753,589 5,708 3.03 % 755,659 6,001 3.18 % 731,871 5,834 3.19 % Loans and Leases 2,139,704 24,032 4.55 % 2,100,432 23,872 4.51 % 1,974,846 22,440 4.60 % Total Interest Earning Assets $ 2,901,849 $ 29,796 4.15 % $ 2,866,359 $ 29,907 4.15 % $ 2,719,271 $ 28,301 4.20 % Liabilities Demand Deposit Accounts $ 585,432 $ 598,107 $ 557,912 IB Demand, Savings, and MMDA Accounts $ 1,489,363 $ 1,275 0.35 % $ 1,488,671 $ 1,177 0.31 % $ 1,385,347 $ 738 0.22 % Time Deposits 398,397 1,008 1.03 % 376,585 889 0.94 % 401,155 705 0.71 % FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings 262,784 1,252 1.93 % 226,437 1,090 1.91 % 226,786 865 1.55 % Total Interest-Bearing Liabilities $ 2,150,544 $ 3,535 0.67 % $ 2,091,693 $ 3,156 0.60 % $ 2,013,288 $ 2,308 0.47 % Cost of Funds 0.49 % 0.44 % 0.34 % Net Interest Income $ 26,261 $ 26,751 $ 25,993 Net Interest Margin 3.66 % 3.71 % 3.86 % During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net interest income totaled $25,610,000, which represented an increase of $156,000, or 1%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 net interest income of $25,454,000 and an increase of $885,000, or 4%, compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2017 net interest income of $24,725,000. The increased level of net interest income during the first quarter of 2018 compared with the both the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2017 was driven primarily by a higher level of average earning assets resulting from an increased level of average loans outstanding partially offset by a higher cost of funds resulting from an increase in market interest rates.\nThe tax equivalent net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 3.66% compared with 3.71% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.86% in the first quarter of 2017. The lower federal income tax rates during the first quarter of 2018 had an approximately 9 basis point negative impact on the Company's net interest margin.\nAccretion of loan discounts on acquired loans contributed approximately 4 basis points to the net interest margin on an annualized basis in the first quarter of 2018, 6 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 17 basis points in the first quarter of 2017. The Company's cost of funds increased approximately 5 basis points in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and 15 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2017. The higher cost of funds was largely attributable to an increase in short-term market interest rates over the past several quarters.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for loan loss of $350,000 compared with a provision for loan loss of $650,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017 and a provision for loan loss of $500,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The provision during all periods was done in accordance with the Company's standard methodology for determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan loss.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, non-interest income totaled $9,492,000, an increase of $1,898,000, or 25%, compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of $1,304,000, or 16%, compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Non-interest Income 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 (dollars in thousands) Trust and Investment Product Fees $ 1,773 $ 1,378 $ 1,243 Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 1,471 1,608 1,484 Insurance Revenues 2,930 1,867 2,640 Company Owned Life Insurance 312 290 254 Interchange Fee Income 1,482 1,202 1,023 Other Operating Income 604 546 857 Subtotal 8,572 6,891 7,501 Net Gains on Loans 650 682 687 Net Gains on Securities 270 21 — Total Non-interest Income $ 9,492 $ 7,594 $ 8,188 Trust and investment product fees increased $395,000, or 29%, during the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $530,000, or 43%, compared with the first quarter of 2017. The increase was largely attributable to increased assets under management in the Company's wealth advisory group.\nInsurance revenues increased $1,063,000, or 57%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $290,000, or 11%, compared with the first quarter of 2017. The increase during the first quarter of 2018 compared with each of the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased contingency revenue. Contingency revenue during the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1,218,000 compared with no contingency revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $992,000 during the first quarter of 2017. The fluctuation in contingency revenue is a normal course of business variance and is reflective of claims and loss experience with insurance carriers that the Company represents through its property and casualty insurance agency. Typically, the majority of contingency revenue is recognized during the first quarter of the year.\nInterchange fees increased $280,000, or 23%, during the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $459,000, or 45%, compared with the first quarter of 2017. The increase during the first quarter of 2018 was largely attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard effective January 1, 2018. While the adoption of the standard did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial results, the recording of revenue gross versus net of certain expenses, in accordance with the standard, did result in the reclassification of some expenses associated with the interchange fee revenue during the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company realized $270,000 in gains on sales of securities during the first quarter of 2018 compared with $21,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017 and no gains in the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, non-interest expense totaled $20,455,000, an increase of $455,000, or 2%, compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of $1,419,000, or 7%, compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Non-interest Expense 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 (dollars in thousands) Salaries and Employee Benefits $ 12,126 $ 12,168 $ 11,444 Occupancy, Furniture and Equipment Expense 2,409 2,452 2,182 FDIC Premiums 237 242 239 Data Processing Fees 1,127 1,154 1,011 Professional Fees 871 550 803 Advertising and Promotion 701 820 778 Intangible Amortization 206 217 253 Other Operating Expenses 2,778 2,397 2,326 Total Non-interest Expense $ 20,455 $ 20,000 $ 19,036 Salaries and benefits declined $42,000, or just under 1%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $682,000, or 6%, compared with the first quarter of 2017. The increase in salaries and benefits during the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to an increased number of full-time equivalent employees.\nProfessional fees increased $321,000, or 58%, during the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $68,000, or 8%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase during the first quarter of 2018 was primarily related to professional fees associated with the pending acquisition of five banking branches in the Columbus and Greensburg, Indiana markets.\nOther operating expenses increased $381,000, or 16%, during the first quarter of 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $452,000, or 19%, compared with the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the first quarter of 2018 compared with all periods presented was largely attributable to the adoption of the aforementioned revenue recognition standard effective January 1, 2018.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate was 17.4% during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with an effective tax rate of 6.3% during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 28.6% during the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income tax expense of $2,484,000 compared with a provision for income tax expense of $777,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3,821,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The provision for income tax was positively impacted during the first quarter of 2018 by the reduction of federal income tax rates from a statutory rate of 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 related to the federal tax reform legislation enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 income tax provision was positively impacted by the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities also related to federal tax reform legislation. The revaluation resulted in a net tax benefit of $2,284,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAbout German American\nGerman American Bancorp, Inc., is a NASDAQ-traded (symbol: GABC) bank holding company based in Jasper, Indiana.
