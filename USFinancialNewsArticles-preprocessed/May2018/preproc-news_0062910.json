    "text": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Two assailants stabbed to death a traffic policeman in the western Saudi Arabian city of Taif and then exchanged gunfire with security forces at a nearby National Guard facility, a local newspaper reported on Thursday.\nThe attackers stole the policemanâ€™s vehicle and service weapon before entering the military site, according to online news site Sabq, which is seen as close to the authorities. One attacker was wounded and detained while the other one fled, the report said.\nSabq reported additional injuries among the security forces without providing details.\nThe Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nTaif is perched in the mountains just east of Mecca, the holiest site in Islam.\nReporting by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ",
