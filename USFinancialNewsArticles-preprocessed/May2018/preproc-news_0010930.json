(“ FBC ”), an investment fund managed by CCP, has acquired an additional 488,543 common shares (“ Common Shares ”) of Sphere 3D Corporation (“ Sphere 3D ”). On April 30, 2018, 141,845 Common Shares were issued to FBC in lieu of an interest payment of $96,498.58 (US$75,178.08) due on the 8% senior secured convertible debenture in the principal amount $24,500,000 issued by Sphere 3D to FBC (the “ Debenture ”). In addition, 346,698 Common Shares were issued to FBC in lieu of a payment in the amount of $235,861.50 (US$183,750) due as consideration for FBC’s entering into an amendment to the Debenture. The 488,543 Common Shares acquired by FBC on April 30, 2018 represent approximately 3.55% of the 13,748,744 issued and outstanding Common Shares of Sphere 3D as at such date (the 13,748,744 is comprised of the 13,260,201 issued and outstanding shares as at April 23, 2018 as disclosed in Sphere 3D’s management information circular filed on April 27, 2018, plus the 488,543 Common Shares issued to FBC on April 30, 2018).\nImmediately before April 30, 2018, CCP, through the FBC had indirect control over 1,216,976 Common Shares. CCP also had indirect control over 40,000 Warrants held by FBC and the Debenture that is convertible into 326,667 Common Shares.

This is calculated on the basis that there would have been 13,626,868 Common Shares of Sphere 3D issued and outstanding (comprised of the then issued 13,260,201 Common Shares, plus the 326,667 Common Shares issuable on the conversion of the Debenture and the 40,000 Common Shares issuable on the conversion of the Warrants).\nAfter the April 30 transaction, CCP, through FBC has indirect control over 1,705,519 Common Shares. CCP also has indirect control over 40,000 Warrants held by FBC and the Debenture that is convertible into 326,667 Common Shares. If FBC were to have converted the Debenture and the Warrants, FBC and the Funds would have held and CCP would have indirectly controlled, on a partially diluted basis, an aggregate of 2,072,186 Common Shares, or approximately 14.68% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares. This is calculated on the basis that there were 14,115,411 Common Shares of Sphere 3D issued and outstanding on April 30, 2018 (comprised of the then issued 13,260,201 Common Shares, plus the 326,667 Common Shares issuable on the conversion of the Debenture, the 40,000 Common Shares issuable on the conversion of the Warrants and the 488,543 Common Shares issued to FBC on April 30, 2018).\nFBC is a joint actor in connection with the disclosure required by this press release.\nOther Information\nCCP acquired indirect control over, and FBC and the Funds acquired ownership of, the Common Shares that are the subject of this report for investment purposes.\nNone of CCP or FBC has any current plans or future intentions which relate to or would result in any of the events, transactions or circumstances enumerated in paragraphs (a) - (k) of Item 5 of the “early warning” report on Form 62-103F1 being filed in connection with the matters disclosed in this release.
