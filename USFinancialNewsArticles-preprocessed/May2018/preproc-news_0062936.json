    "text": "May 30 (Reuters) - Russia’s biggest airline Aeroflot reported on Wednesday a first-quarter net loss of 11.54 billion roubles ($184.49 million) as fuel and staff costs outweighed revenue growth.\nIn its first ever publication of quarterly results, Aeroflot said the net loss more than doubled from the 5.34 billion roubles reported a year ago.\nAeroflot’s fuel costs surged 24.1 percent due to rising crude oil prices. This resulted in operating costs rising 14.3 percent to 123.54 billion roubles.\nAeroflot’s shares, though, were up 5 percent to 138.50 roubles as of 0825 GMT after the company recommended on Tuesday a larger than expected dividend for 2017.\n$1 = 62.5493 roubles Reporting by Anna Pruchnicka; Editing by Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
