These require the bulk grain handler to pay for transportation of a fixed amount of grain or pay a financial penalty.\nThe poor start has weighed on GrainCorp shares, which have lost about 12 percent so far in May, and hit a near three-month low on Friday.\nThe company declared an interim dividend of 8 Australian cents per share, down from 15 cents last year.\n$1 = 1.3278 Australian dollars Reporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; additional reporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ",
