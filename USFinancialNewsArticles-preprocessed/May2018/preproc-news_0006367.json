    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea and SAN JOSE, Calif., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE: MX) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nQ1 2018 Summary\nRevenue of $165.8 million exceeded the high-end of $158-164 million guidance range; revenue increased 2.5% YoY OLED display driver revenue of $34.3 million increased 112% YoY and 141% from Q4 2017; achieved 10 new design wins for OLED display drivers Gross profit margin of 26.9% in line with 26-28% guidance range; gross profit margin increased by 1.2 percentage points YoY and gross profit dollars increased 7.2% YoY Operating income of $7.4 million increased 15.9% YoY Adjusted EBITDA of $15.5 million increased 18.4% YoY\nCEO Comments : \"Revenue in the first quarter exceeded expectations, fueled by a sharp rebound in demand for our mobile OLED display drivers from smartphone makers, primarily in China,\" said YJ Kim, Chief Executive Officer. \"When we reported Q4 2017 financial results in February, we stated that OLED revenue in Q1 2018 had the potential to increase sequentially by more than 75%, and expressed confidence that OLED revenue was on track to exceed 50% growth in 2018 as compared to 2017 or clearly exceed $100 million for the full year. In fact, our OLED revenue in Q1 increased 141% sequentially and, based upon our current business visibility, we now anticipate OLED revenue growth in 2018 will surpass our previous targets.\" CEO Kim added, \"During Q1, MagnaChip secured a total of 10 new OLED design wins from smartphone makers in China and elsewhere in Asia, and sampled a new third-generation 40-nanometer rigid bezel-less OLED display driver that already has won design-in by a leading smartphone maker for a device targeted to the mainstream market in the second half of 2018.\"\nCFO Comments : \"Key financial indicators in the first quarter compared favorably with results achieved in the same year-ago period despite previously disclosed headwinds, including higher raw wafer costs and typical seasonal weakness.\" said Jonathan Kim, Chief Financial Officer. Revenue in Q1 2018 increased 2.5% as compared to Q1 2017, gross profit margin improved by 1.2 percentage points, gross margin dollars increased by 7.2%, operating income rose 15.9% and Adjusted EBITDA was higher by 18.4% as compared to the first quarter a year ago. Revenue from lower-margin products in the non-OLED portion of the Display business line decreased in Q1 due to a strategic portfolio optimization initiative to improve product mix and profitability over time. CFO Kim added, \"Our results in Q1 demonstrated our ongoing commitment to focus on achieving profitable growth.\"\nFirst Quarter Financial Review\nTotal Revenue\nTotal revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $165.8 million, up 2.5% as compared to $161.7 million from the first quarter of 2017, and down 5.0% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSegment Revenue and Segment Adjustments\nIn January 2018, as part of the Company's ongoing portfolio optimization effort to realign business processes and streamline the organizational structure, the Company transferred a portion of the non-OLED Display business, which was $4.4 million for Q1 2018, from the Standard Products Group to the Foundry Services Group. The transferred non-OLED Display business has characteristics more closely aligned with the Foundry business than with Standard Products and resided within the Display business line primarily as a result of a long standing customer relationship established many years ago. The historical financial results below are discussed both on an as reported and as adjusted basis for comparative purposes.\nFoundry Services Group revenue in the first quarter was $77.4 million, about flat with reported revenue of $77.5 million from the first quarter of 2017, and down 4.0% from the fourth quarter of 2017 on an as reported basis; and down 7.3% from the first quarter of 2017, and down 14.2% from the fourth quarter of 2017 on an as adjusted basis.\nFollowing the strategic realignment and portfolio optimization discussed above, Standard Products Group revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $88.4 million, up 5.0% year-over-year and down 5.9% sequentially on an as reported basis; and up 13.1% year-over-year and up 4.8% sequentially on an as adjusted basis. The improved results in the Standard Products Group reflected an improvement in mobile OLED driver revenue in connection with the introduction of new OLED smartphones from China manufacturers, higher demand for MOSFETS for mobile battery and television products, despite lower LCD display driver revenue. The sequential revenue decline in Q1 2018 as compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 stemmed primarily from a previously announced strategic plan to reduce business from lower-margin LCD display drivers in the Standard Products Group.\nTotal Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nTotal gross profit in the first quarter of 2018 was $44.6 million or 26.9% as a percentage of sales as compared with gross profit of $41.6 million or 25.7% gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2017, and $49.4 million or 28.3% gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSegment Gross Profit Margin\nFoundry Services Group gross profit margin was 26.7% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared with, on an as reported basis, 28.5% in the first quarter of 2017 and 31.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Foundry Services Group gross profit margin was, on an as adjusted basis, 27.9% in the first quarter of 2017 and 30.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Standard Products Group gross profit margin was 27.2% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared with, on an as reported basis, 23.1% in the first quarter of 2017, and 25.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Standard Products Group gross profit margin was, on an adjusted basis, 23.3% in the first quarter of 2017, and 26.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOperating Income, Net Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA\nOperating income, on a GAAP basis, for the first quarter was $7.4 million, as compared with $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, and $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet income, on a GAAP basis, for the first quarter was $2.8 million or $0.08 per basic share and diluted share, as compared with net income on a GAAP basis of $43.7 million or $1.30 per basic share and $1.05 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017, and compared with net income of $43.7 million or $1.28 per basic share and $0.99 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1.4 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, as compared with Adjusted Net Income of $0.5 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share in the first quarter of 2017, and compared with Adjusted Net Income of $9.1 million or $0.27 per basic share and $0.23 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the first quarter was $15.5 million or 9.3% of revenue, as compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $13.1 million or 8.1% of revenue in the first quarter of 2017, and compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $20.5 million or 11.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nManagement believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results, can provide a meaningful understanding of the factors and trends affecting MagnaChip's business and operations and assist in evaluating our core operating performance. However, such non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or as a better indicator of our operating performance than measures that are presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included in this press release.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $123.1 million at the end of the first quarter, down from $128.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNote: The following table sets forth information relating to our operating segments (in thousands). The historical amounts below are presented both on an as reported and as adjusted basis to show the impact of the strategic realignment and transfer of a portion of the non-OLED Display business from the Standard Products Group to the Foundry Services Group beginning in the first quarter of 2018:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nAs Reported\nMarch 31,\n2017\nAs Adjusted\nNet Sales\nFoundry Services Group\n$ 77,429\n$ 77,528\n$ 83,542\nStandard Products Group\nDisplay Solutions\n49,696\n48,879\n42,865\nPower Solutions\n38,667\n35,280\n35,280\nTotal Standard Products Group\n$ 88,363\n$ 84,159\n$ 78,145\nAll other\n27\n23\n23\nTotal net sales\n$ 165,819\n$ 161,710\n$ 161,710\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nAs Reported\nAs Adjusted\nAmount\n% of\nAmount\n% of\nAmount\n% of\nNet Sales\nNet Sales\nNet Sales\nGross Profit\nFoundry Services Group\n$\n20,664\n26.7\n%\n$\n22,087\n28.5\n%\n$\n23,312\n27.9\n%\nStandard Products Group\n24,039\n27.2\n19,460\n23.1\n18,235\n23.3\nAll other\n(122)\n(452)\n23\n100.0\n23\n100.0\nTotal gross profit\n$\n44,581\n26.9\n%\n$\n41,570\n25.7\n%\n$\n41,570\n25.7\n%\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Company Highlights\nMagnaChip:\nAnnounced it will host its Annual Foundry Technology Symposium in Santa Clara, California on May 23, 2018 Now offers automotive-grade 0.18 micron BCD process technology with up to 100V Operation Voltage Announced that Second-Generation 0.13 micron BCD process technology with high-density embedded flash memory is now available to Foundry customers Multi-level thick IMD process for capacity with ultra-high breakdown voltage is now available to Foundry customers\nSecond Quarter 2018 Business Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, MagnaChip anticipates:\nRevenue to be in the range of $182 million to $188 million, up sequentially 11.6% at the mid-point of the projected range.

EBITDA for the periods indicated is defined as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expenses (benefits) and depreciation and amortization. We prepare Adjusted Net Income by adjusting net income to eliminate the impact of a number of non-cash expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Net Income is particularly useful because it reflects the impact of our asset base and capital structure on our operating performance.
