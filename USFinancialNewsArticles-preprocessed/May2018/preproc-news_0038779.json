Although all three legal entities will continue to exist, they will now be integrated and operate under one management team. The integrated business will go to market as Active On-Demand 速 powered by Rich Logistics and USA Jet. On a combined basis this business platform has annual revenue in excess of $760 million with over 450 customers, nearly 1,000 drivers and pilots and over 625 other team members in 13 locations throughout the United States and Mexico.\nActive On-Demand will continue to deliver time and mission critical supply chain confidence for some of the nation's best known and successful manufacturing, distribution and consumer products companies.

The integration of our technology platforms will not only benefit our customers but also our team members and drivers by improving efficiency and ensuring industry leading on-time performance.\"\nShannon Everett added, \"This integration will provide a powerful asset backed solution for all of our customers' logistics needs. The combination of ground assets at Rich Logistics and air assets at USA Jet will give Active On-Demand an unprecedented capability to guarantee coverage of scheduled and unscheduled supply chain requirements.\"\nThe newly combined Active On-Demand entity will have five key areas of expertise including Scheduled Truckload, Ground Expedite, Air Charter, Hand Carry and International Airfreight.\nSubstantial work towards technology enhancements are already underway with satellite asset-tracking and bid-board systems being combined on one platform to provide seamless visibility across all modes of transportation including scheduled truckloads, expedite over-the-road and air charter services.
