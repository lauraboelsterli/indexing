REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\nHigher borrowing costs have not yet caused a meaningful squeeze on the housing market, as underlying demand remains solid, Freddie Mac chief economist Sam Khater said.\n“While this year’s higher mortgage rates have not caused much of a ripple in the strong demand levels for buying a home seen in most markets, inflationary pressures and the prospect of rates approaching 5 percent could begin to hit the psyche of some prospective buyers,” he said in statement.\nThirty-year mortgage rates averaged 4.61 percent in the week ended May 17, matching the level last seen in May 2011. A week earlier, 30-year rates averaged 4.55 percent, the U.S. mortgage finance agency said.\nAverage 15-year mortgage rates rose to 4.08 percent in the latest week from 4.01 percent, while interest rates on five-year adjustable mortgages averaged 3.82 percent, up from 3.77 percent a week earlier, Freddie Mac said.\nWorries about rising inflation and government borrowing lifted the 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR to 3.122 percent earlier Thursday, the highest since July 2011, Reuters data showed.\nTo view a graphic on U.S. 10-year bond yield vs 30-year mortgage rate, click: reut.rs/2ENzSFO Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Chris Reese",
