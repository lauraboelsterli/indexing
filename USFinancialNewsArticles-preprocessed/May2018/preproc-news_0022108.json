During fiscal 2018, we made significant progress toward achieving our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 30% plus as we expanded our margin by over 600 basis points to 25.8%. This was largely due to 19% subscription revenue growth on a constant currency basis,” said Stefan Joselowitz, Chief Executive Officer of MiX Telematics. “The strong performance was driven by the continued growth in our premium fleet subscriptions globally, improvements in ARPU and ongoing operating leverage in the business. Looking forward, we have entered fiscal 2019 with great momentum. We are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term goals given our strong pipeline and ability to further enhance margin accretion across the business.”\nFinancial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2018\nSubscription revenue: Subscription revenue was R373.6 million ($31.6 million), an increase of 16.1% compared with R321.7 million ($27.2 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Subscription revenue increased by 19.4% on a constant currency basis, year over year. Subscription revenue benefited from an increase of over 54,800 subscribers, representing an increase in the subscriber base of 8.8% from March 2017 to March 2018. Subscription revenue also benefited from an increase in average revenue per user. Reported subscription revenue was lower than the third quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the appreciation of the South African Rand in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 over the third quarter of fiscal 2018. If the same exchange rates used in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were used in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, subscription revenue would have been R391.6 million ($33.1 million), representing a constant currency increase of 4.1%.\nTotal revenue: Total revenue was R453.5 million ($38.4 million), an increase of 15.9% compared to R391.4 million ($33.1 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Total revenue increased by 18.7% on a constant currency basis. Hardware and other revenue was R79.9 million ($6.8 million), an increase of 14.6%, compared to R69.7 million ($5.9 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nGross margin: Gross profit was R296.0 million ($25.0 million), compared to R265.0 million ($22.4 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin was 65.3%, compared to 67.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company's gross profit margin in fiscal 2018 includes higher depreciation charges related to in-vehicle devices and high value peripherals used in certain of its bundled fleet contracts. These contracts generate higher ARPUs and in the long-term are expected to result in an increase in gross profit margins as they go through contract renewal cycles.\nOperating margin: Operating profit was R73.8 million ($6.2 million), compared to R40.9 million ($3.5 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating profit margin was 16.3%, compared to 10.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The margin expansion was attributable primarily to revenue growth leveraging our fixed overhead and ongoing cost management initiatives. Operating expenses of R223.7 million ($18.9 million) have declined by R0.3 million ($0.03 million), or 0.2%, since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS measure, was R130.2 million ($11.0 million), compared to R87.1 million ($7.4 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-IFRS measure, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was 28.7%, compared to 22.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.7% expanded by 2.8% from the Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.9% reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. A quarter over quarter increase in hardware revenues and resultant gross profit contributed 1.3% to this Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion.\nProfit for the period and earnings per share: Profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was R64.3 million ($5.4 million), compared to R31.2 million ($2.6 million) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the calculation was based on diluted weighted average ordinary shares in issue of 580.8 million compared to 568.2 million diluted weighted average ordinary shares in issue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%, compared to 15.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

Adjusted earnings per diluted ordinary share, also a non-IFRS measure, were 10 South African cents, compared to 5 South African cents in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOn a U.S. Dollar basis, and using the March 31, 2018 exchange rate of R11.8255 per U.S. Dollar, and at a ratio of 25 ordinary shares to one ADS, the adjusted profit for the period was $4.7 million, or 20 U.S. cents per diluted ADS, compared to $2.5 million, or 11 U.S cents per diluted ADS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nStatement of financial position and cash flow: At March 31, 2018, the Company had R290.5 million ($24.6 million) of net cash and cash equivalents, compared to R356.3 million ($30.1 million) at March 31, 2017.\nThe Company generated R121.4 million ($10.3 million) in net cash from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and invested R63.5 million ($5.4 million) in capital expenditures during the quarter (including investments in in-vehicle devices of R41.2 million or $3.5 million), leading to free cash flow, a non-IFRS measure, of R57.9 million ($4.9 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with free cash flow of R54.0 million ($4.6 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFinancial performance for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018\nSubscription revenue: Subscription revenue increased to R1,434.6 million ($121.3 million), up 15.7% from R1,239.9 million ($104.9 million) for fiscal 2017.

Subscription revenue benefited from an increase of over 54,800 subscribers since the end of fiscal 2017, representing an increase in subscribers of 8.8% from March 2017 to March 2018. Subscription revenue also benefited from an increase in average revenue per user.\nTotal revenue: Total revenue for fiscal 2018 was R1,712.5 million ($144.8 million), an increase of 11.2% compared to R1,540.1 million ($130.2 million) for fiscal 2017.

The Company's gross profit margin in fiscal 2018 includes higher depreciation charges related to in-vehicle devices and high value peripherals used in certain of its bundled fleet contracts. These contracts generate higher ARPUs and in the long-term are expected to result in an increase in gross profit margins as they go through contract renewal cycles.\nOperating margin: Operating profit for fiscal 2018 was R215.0 million ($18.2 million), compared to R137.9 million ($11.7 million) in fiscal 2017. The operating profit margin for fiscal 2018 was 12.6%, compared to the 9.0% in fiscal 2017.

Due to higher than expected hardware revenues, the fiscal 2018 ratio was marginally below the Company's estimates contained in its Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, in which the Company advised that in future periods it expected these costs to remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue (i.e.11% to 12% of revenue).\nFiscal 2018 administration and other costs were 42.6% of revenue, compared to 46.9% in fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA was R441.9 million ($37.4 million), compared to R301.6 million ($25.5 million) for fiscal 2017.

In respect of revenue, this method of measurement entails reviewing the segmental results based on external revenue only. In respect of Adjusted EBITDA (the non-IFRS profit measure identified by the Group), the margin generated by our Central Services Organization (“CSO”), net of any unrealized inter-company profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our Regional Sales Offices (“RSOs”).\nCSO continues as a central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs who, in turn, interface with our end-customers and distributors. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments. CSO's operating expenses are not allocated to each RSO.\nEach RSO's results reflect the external revenue earned, as well as the Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) by each operating segment before the CSO and corporate cost allocations.\nFor further information in this regard please refer to note 3 of the Group financial results for the fiscal year\nSegment Subscription Revenue\nFiscal\n2018\nR'000 Total Revenue\nFiscal\n2018\nR'000 Adjusted EBITDA\nFiscal\n2018\nR'000 % change on prior\nyear\nAdjusted EBITDA\nMargin\nFiscal\n2018 Africa 872,646 957,478 440,900 28.1% 46.0% Subscription revenue increased by 13.0% in the segment as a result of a 7.3% increase in subscribers since March 31, 2017 and an increase in the number of bundled subscriptions.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure, and it does not represent cash flows from operations for the periods indicated, and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's results of operations, or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the profit for the period before income taxes, net finance income/(costs) including foreign exchange gains/(losses), depreciation of property, plant and equipment including capitalized customer in-vehicle devices, amortization of intangible assets including capitalized in-house development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination, share-based compensation costs, restructuring costs, profits/(losses) on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries, insurance reimbursements relating to impaired assets and certain litigation costs.\nThe Company has included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in this press release because they are key measures that the Company's management and board of directors use to understand and evaluate its core operating performance and trends; to prepare and approve its annual budget; and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company's core business. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results.\nThe Company's use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the Company; and other companies, including companies in the Company's industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including operating profit, profit for the year and the Company's other results.\nHeadline Earnings\nHeadline earnings is a profit measure required for JSE-listed companies and is calculated in accordance with circular 2/2015 issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants. The profit measure is determined by taking the profit for the year prior to certain separately identifiable re-measurements of the carrying amount of an asset or liability that arose after the initial recognition of such asset or liability net of related tax (both current and deferred) and related non-controlling interest.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nAdjusted earnings per share is defined as profit attributable to owners of the parent, MiX Telematics Limited, excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.\nWe have included Adjusted earnings per share in this press release because it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company's core business by excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) from earnings. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted earnings per share provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating results.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow is determined as net cash generated from operating activities less capital expenditure for investing activities. We believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s cash flows as it provides detail of the amount of cash the Company generates or utilizes after accounting for all capital expenditures including investments in in-vehicle devices and development expenditure.\nConstant currency and US Dollar financial information\nFinancial information presented in United States Dollars (“U.S. Dollars” and “$”) and constant currency financial information presented as part of the segment commentary constitute pro forma financial information under the JSE Listings Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, MiX Telematics has translated U.S. Dollar amounts from South African Rand (“R”) at an exchange rate of R11.8255 per $1.00, which was the R/$ exchange rate reported by Oanda.com as at March 31, 2018.\nConstant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the Group’s results. Unless otherwise stated, the constant currency information has been determined by adjusting the current financial reporting year’s results to the prior year’s average exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates applicable to the year. The measurement has been performed for each of the Group’s currencies, including the U.S. Dollar and the British Pound. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated by utilizing the constant currency results compared to the prior year results.\nThis pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the Group’s board of directors and is presented for illustrative purposes. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information may not fairly present MiX Telematics’ financial position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma financial information does not constitute pro forma information in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the SEC or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. In addition, the rules and regulations related to the preparation of pro forma financial information in other jurisdictions may also vary significantly from the requirements applicable in South Africa. The pro forma financial information contained in this results announcement has been reviewed by our auditors, Deloitte & Touche and their unmodified report thereon is available for inspection at the Company's registered office.\nJSE Sponsor:\nJava Capital Trustees and Sponsors Proprietary Limited\nMIX TELEMATICS LIMITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS South African Rand United States

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS\n1. Basis of preparation and accounting policies\nThe preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) Listings Requirements for preliminary condensed financial statements and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to financial statements. The JSE Listings Requirements require preliminary condensed financial statements to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.\nThe accounting policies applied in the preparation of the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial statements, unless otherwise stated.\nThe preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared under the supervision of the Interim Group Chief Financial Officer, Paul Dell, CA(SA). The results were made available on May 10, 2018.\nThe Group has adopted all the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) which were effective for the Group from April 1, 2017, none of which had a material impact on the Group.\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the March 31, 2018 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group in fiscal 2018. The effect of adopting IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 is set out below.\nManagement is in the final stages of its project to adopt IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 and as such the figures mentioned below represent our current expectations of the impact from these standards.\nStandards and amendments Executive summary IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”) IFRS 9 addresses classification and measurement of financial assets and replaces the multiple classification and measurement models in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with a single model that has only two classification categories: amortized cost and fair value. IFRS 9 also introduces a new impairment model and aligns hedge accounting more closely with an entity’s risk management.\nThe standard is effective for the Group from April 1, 2018.\nThe most relevant change to the Group is the requirement to use an expected loss model instead of the incurred loss model which is currently being used when assessing the recoverability of trade and other receivables. Based on the expected loss model contained in IFRS 9, the expected increase in the provision for doubtful debts at April 1, 2018 is between R2.0 million ($0.2 million) and R4.0 million ($0.3 million).\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“IFRS 15”) IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts. It is a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and has the objective of achieving greater consistency in the recognition and presentation of revenue. In terms of the new standard, revenue is recognized based on the satisfaction of performance obligations, which occurs when control of goods or services transfers to a customer.\nThe revenue standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and therefore is applicable for the Group from April 1, 2018.\nThe standard permits a modified retrospective cumulative catch-up approach for the adoption, which the Group has decided to apply. Under this approach, the Group will recognize transitional adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application (i.e. April 1, 2018), without restating the comparative period. Under the practical expedient, the new requirements only need to be applied to contracts that are not completed as of April 1, 2018.\nThe Group has assessed the impact of applying IFRS 15 on its financial statements and has identified the following areas that will be affected:\n• Costs incurred in obtaining a contract:\nCommissions incurred to acquire contracts need to be capitalized and amortized, unless the amortization period is 12 months or less. Currently, the Group expenses commissions. Under IFRS 15, the amortization expense reflects the settlement of the related performance obligations, which, depending on the specific contract, may include hardware, installation, training and/or service. To the extent commission capitalized is commensurate, the commission attributable to service will be amortized over the minimum contractual period or, if shorter, the expected life of the contract. To the extent it is not commensurate, the commission capitalized that is attributable to service will be amortized over the expected life of the contract.\nThe expected impact on the Group at April 1, 2018 is as follows:\n• Capitalized commission asset with a net book value of between R43.0 million ($3.6 million) and R48.0 million ($4.1 million); and\n• Additional recurring commission liability of between R6.0 million ($0.5 million) and R8.0 million ($0.7 million).\nRecurring commission is commission which is payable for each month the customer remains with the Group. Since the commission relates to acquiring a customer contract, as part of the adoption of IFRS 15, a recurring commission liability will be recognized at the date on which the contract is acquired. The measurement will reflect the total commission payable over the minimum contractual period, or if shorter, the expected life of the contract, together with the effect of the time value of money, where significant. Under current accounting the recurring commissions are accrued for on a monthly basis.\nAmortization expense of external commissions capitalized under IFRS 15 will be recognized in cost of sales; while that of internal commissions will be recognized in sales and marketing costs. Commissions not capitalized under the 12-month practical expedient will also be classified in the same manner. This is in line with the current income statement presentation of the commission expense. The impact of IFRS 15 on both cost of sales and sales and marketing costs for fiscal 2019 is not expected to be material based on current forecasts.\n• Significant financing:\nIn respect of contracts for which the Group receives payment more than 12 months in advance, interest expense will need to be accrued on the income received in advance liability. This will result in the revenue being measured at a higher amount when it is recognized, compared to current accounting.\nAt April 1, 2018, it is expected that the income received in advance liability (which will be disclosed as 'liabilities related to contracts with customers') will be between R1.0 million ($0.1 million) and R3.0 million ($0.3 million) higher than the balance at March 31, 2018.\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“IFRS 15”) • Fixed escalations :\nFixed escalations will need to be spread evenly over the contract period resulting in the related revenue being different to what is actually billed. In the earlier part of the contract, revenue will be higher than the amount billed; while in the latter part it will be lower. Currently, the Group recognizes the increase in revenue due to fixed escalations only once the escalations are effective.\nA contract asset of between R1.0 million ($0.1 million) and R2.0 million ($0.2 million) is expected to be recognized on April 1, 2018 reflecting the amount by which revenue should have been higher under IFRS 15 in periods prior to March 31, 2018 as a result of straight-lining the fixed escalations.\nIFRS 16 Leases (“IFRS 16”) IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases and addresses the accounting and disclosures for leases.\nThe standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset is a low-value asset. Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16’s approach to lessor accounting remaining substantially unchanged from its predecessor, IAS 17.\nIFRS 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, but can be early adopted. Given that the Group will be applying IFRS 15 from April 1, 2018, the Group decided to also adopt IFRS 16 from this date.\nThe Group has chosen to apply the ‘simplified approach’ on adoption of IFRS 16 that includes certain relief related to the measurement of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at April 1, 2018, rather than full retrospective application. Furthermore, the ‘simplified approach’ does not require a restatement of comparatives.\nThe Group leases land and buildings, office equipment and vehicles which are currently treated as operating leases.\nThe expected impact on the Group at April 1, 2018 is as follows:\nRight-of-use asset with a net book value of between R29.0 million ($2.5 million) and R32.0 million ($2.7 million); and Lease liability (net of accruals/prepayments already recognized) of between R31.0 million ($2.6 million) and R35.0 million ($3.0 million). Summary of the expected impact at April 1, 2018 of adopting IFRS 9, IFRS 15 & IFRS 16:\nSouth African Rand United States Dollar IFRS 9 Assets (R2.0 million) to (R4.0 million) ($0.2 million) to ($0.3 million) IFRS 15 Assets R44.0 million to R50.0 million $3.7 million to $4.2 million IFRS 16 Assets R29.0 million to R32.0 million $2.5 million to $2.7 million Total Assets R71.0 million to R78.0 million $6.0 million to $6.6 million IFRS 15 Liabilities R7.0 million to R11.0 million $0.6 million to $0.9 million IFRS 16 Liabilities R31.0 million to R35.0 million $2.6 million to $3.0 million Deferred tax liabilities R6.0 million to R10.0 million $0.5 million to $0.8 million Total liabilities R44.0 million to R56.0 million $3.7 million to $4.7 million Net increase in equity R22.0 million to R27.0 million $1.9 million to $2.3 million Summary of the expected impact on fiscal 2019 results of adopting IFRS 9, IFRS 15 & IFRS 16:\nThe impact on profit after tax for fiscal 2019 is not expected to be material.\nPresentation currency and convenience translation\nThe Group’s presentation currency is South African Rand. In addition to presenting these preliminary condensed consolidated financial results in South African Rand, supplementary information in U.S. Dollars has been prepared for the convenience of users of the Group financial results. Unless otherwise stated, the Group has translated U.S. Dollar amounts from South African Rand at the exchange rate of R11.8255 per $1.00, which was the R/$ exchange rate reported by Oanda.com as at March 31, 2018. The U.S. Dollar figures may not compute as they are rounded independently.\nThe supplementary information prepared in U.S. Dollars constitutes pro forma financial information under the JSE Listings Requirements. This pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the Group’s board of directors and is presented for illustrative purposes. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information may not fairly present MiX Telematics’ financial position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma financial information does not constitute pro forma information in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the SEC or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. In addition, the rules and regulations related to the preparation of pro forma financial information in other jurisdictions may also vary significantly from the requirements applicable in South Africa.\n2. Independent review\nThe preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018 have been reviewed by Deloitte & Touche, who expressed an unmodified review conclusion thereon, which is available for inspection at the Company's registered office. The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all the information contained in these financial results. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's engagement they should obtain a copy of the auditor's report together with the accompanying financial information from the Company's registered office. Any reference to future financial performance, included in this announcement, has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company’s auditors.\n3. Segment information\nOur operating segments are based on the geographical location of our Regional Sales Offices (“RSOs”) and also include our Central Services Organization (“CSO”). CSO is our central services organization that wholesales our products and services to our RSOs who, in turn, interface with our end-customers, distributors and dealers. CSO is also responsible for the development of our hardware and software platforms and provides common marketing, product management, technical and distribution support to each of our other operating segments.\nThe chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) reviews the segment results on an integral margin basis as defined by management. The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified collectively as the executive committee and the Chief Executive Officer who make strategic decisions. In respect of revenue, this method of measurement entails reviewing the segmental results based on external revenue only. In respect of Adjusted EBITDA (the profit measure identified by the CODM), the margin generated by CSO, net of any unrealized intercompany profit, is allocated to the geographic region where the external revenue is recorded by our RSOs. The costs remaining in CSO relate mainly to research and development of hardware and software platforms, common marketing, product management and technical and distribution support to each of the RSOs. CSO is a reportable segment of the Group because it produces discrete financial information which is reviewed by the CODM and has the ability to generate external revenues.\nEach RSO's results therefore reflect the external revenue earned, as well as the Adjusted EBITDA earned (or loss incurred) by each operating segment before the remaining CSO and corporate costs allocations. Segment assets are not disclosed as segment information is not reviewed on such a basis by the CODM.\nSEGMENTAL ANALYSIS South African Rand\nFigures are in thousands unless otherwise stated Subscription\nrevenue\nHardware and\nother revenue\nTotal\nrevenue Adjusted\nEBITDA\nYear ended March 31, 2018 (Reviewed) Regional Sales Offices Africa 872,646 84,832 957,478 440,900 Europe 115,199 78,061 193,260 65,326 Americas 194,890 32,715 227,605 79,127 Middle East and Australasia 200,241 78,424 278,665 106,835 Brazil 50,735 3,695 54,430 16,747 Total Regional Sales Offices 1,433,711 277,727 1,711,438 708,935 Central Services Organization 904 140 1,044 (149,878 ) Total Segment Results 1,434,615 277,867 1,712,482 559,057 Corporate and consolidation entries — — — (117,191 ) Total 1,434,615 277,867 1,712,482 441,866\nSouth African Rand\nFigures are in thousands unless otherwise stated Subscription\nrevenue\nHardware and\nother revenue\nTotal\nrevenue Adjusted\nEBITDA\nYear ended March 31, 2017 (Audited) Regional Sales Offices Africa 772,224 86,945 859,169 344,077 Europe 113,223 64,108 177,331 52,369 Americas 121,462 38,957 160,419 26,804 Middle East and Australasia 199,474 104,976 304,450 91,149 Brazil 32,653 5,158 37,811 9,394 Total Regional Sales Offices 1,239,036 300,144 1,539,180 523,793 Central Services Organization 878 — 878 (127,828 ) Total Segment Results 1,239,914 300,144 1,540,058 395,965 Corporate and consolidation entries — — — (94,352 ) Total 1,239,914 300,144 1,540,058 301,613\nSEGMENTAL ANALYSIS United States Dollar\nFigures are in thousands unless otherwise stated Subscription\nrevenue\nHardware and\nother revenue\nTotal\nrevenue Adjusted\nEBITDA\nYear ended March 31, 2018 (Unaudited) Regional Sales Offices Africa 73,794 7,174 80,968 37,284 Europe 9,742 6,601 16,343 5,524 Americas 16,480 2,766 19,246 6,691 Middle East and Australasia 16,933 6,632 23,565 9,034 Brazil 4,290 311 4,601 1,416 Total Regional Sales Offices 121,239 23,484 144,723 59,949 Central Services Organization 76 14 90 (12,674 ) Total Segment Results 121,315 23,498 144,813 47,275 Corporate and consolidation entries — — — (9,909 ) Total 121,315 23,498 144,813 37,366\nUnited States Dollar\nFigures are in thousands unless otherwise stated Subscription\nrevenue\nHardware and\nother revenue\nTotal\nrevenue Adjusted\nEBITDA\nYear ended March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Regional Sales Offices Africa 65,302 7,352 72,654 29,096 Europe 9,574 5,421 14,995 4,428 Americas 10,271 3,294 13,565 2,267 Middle East and Australasia 16,868 8,877 25,745 7,708 Brazil 2,761 437 3,198 794 Total Regional Sales Offices 104,776 25,381 130,157 44,293 Central Services Organization 75 — 75 (10,810 ) Total Segment Results 104,851 25,381 130,232 33,483 Corporate and consolidation entries — — — (7,980 ) Total 104,851 25,381 130,232 25,503\n4.

Share Repurchase\nFiscal 2018\nOn May 23, 2017, the MiX Telematics board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to R270 million ($22.8 million) under which the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares, including American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”). The Company may repurchase its shares from time to time at its discretion through open market transactions and block trades, based on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the Company, the market price of its securities and general market conditions. This share repurchase program may be discontinued at any time by the board of directors, and the Company has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its securities under the program. The repurchase program will be funded out of existing cash resources.\nAt March 31, 2018, the following purchases had been made under the share repurchase program:\nSouth African Rand\nFigures are in\nthousands unless\notherwise stated\nTotal number of\nshares\nrepurchased\nAverage price\npaid per\nshare (1)\nShares canceled\nunder the share\nrepurchase\nprogram\nTotal value of\nshares\npurchased as\npart of\npublicly\nannounced\nprogram\nMaximum value\nof\nshares that may\nyet\nbe purchased\nunder\nthe program\nJune 2017 5,015,660 3.72 5,015,660 18,666 251,334 5,015,660 5,015,660 18,666 251,334 United States Dollar\nFigures are in\nthousands unless\notherwise stated\nTotal number of\nshares\nrepurchased\nAverage price\npaid per\nshare (1)\nShares canceled\nunder the share\nrepurchase\nprogram\nTotal value of shares\npurchased as part of\npublicly announced\nprogram\nMaximum value of\nshares that may yet\nbe purchased under\nthe program\nJune 2017 5,015,660 0.31 5,015,660 1,578 21,254 5,015,660 5,015,660 1,578 21,254 (1) Including transaction costs.\nSubsequent to the repurchase, the shares were delisted and now form part of the authorized unissued share capital of the Company. At March 31, 2018, the Company had 564,420,145 ordinary shares of no par value in issue (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares held by MiX Investments).\nFiscal 2017\nOn April 29, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement (the “share repurchase agreement”) with Imperial Holdings Limited (“Imperial Holdings”) and Imperial Corporate Services Proprietary Limited (“Imperial Corporate Services”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Holdings, to repurchase all 200,828,260 of the Company’s shares held by Imperial Corporate Services (the “repurchase shares”) at R2.36 ($0.20) per repurchase share, for an aggregate repurchase consideration of R474.0 million or $40.1 million (the “repurchase”). At the general meeting held on August 1, 2016, shareholders of the Company approved the repurchase in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and the South African Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, at which point the transaction was accounted for in terms of IFRS. The repurchase was implemented on August 29, 2016. Subsequent to the repurchase, the shares were delisted and now form part of the authorized unissued share capital of the Company.\nIn fiscal 2017, the financial effect of the transaction was as follows:\nYear ended Year ended March 31, March 31, 2017 2017 South African\nRand\nUnited States\nDollar\nAudited Unaudited Aggregate repurchase consideration 473,955 40,079 Impact of discounting related to the fiscal 2017 share repurchase transaction (3,222) (272) Transaction costs capitalized 2,949 249 Total share repurchase cost 473,682 40,056 10. Dividends Paid\nDuring fiscal 2016 the board of directors decided to reintroduce the Company’s policy of paying regular dividends. Dividend payments are currently considered on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nThe following dividends were declared by the Company in fiscal 2018 (excluding dividends paid on treasury shares):\nIn respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a dividend of R11.3 million ($1.0 million) was declared on May 23, 2017 and paid on June 19, 2017. Using shares in issue of 563,514,561 (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares), this equated to a dividend of 2 South African cents or 0.2 U.S. cents per share. In respect of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, a dividend of R14.0 million ($1.2 million) was declared on August 1, 2017 and paid on August 28, 2017. Using shares in issue of 558,898,901 (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares), this equated to a dividend of 2.5 South African cents or 0.2 U.S. cents per share. In respect of the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, a dividend of R14.0 million ($1.2 million) was declared on October 31, 2017 and paid on November 27, 2017. Using shares in issue of 559,418,095 (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares), this equated to a dividend of 2.5 South African cents and 0.2 U.S. cents per share. In respect of the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, a dividend of R14.0 million ($1.2 million) was declared on January 30, 2018 and paid on February 26, 2018. Using shares in issue of 562,320,145 (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares), this equated to a dividend of 2.5 South African cents and 0.2 U.S. cents per share.\nThe following dividends were declared by the Company in fiscal 2017:\nIn respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, a dividend of R15.2 million ($1.3 million) was declared on May 24, 2016 and paid on June 20, 2016. Using shares in issue of 761,337,500 (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares), this equated to a dividend of 2 South African cents and 0.2 U.S. cents per share. In respect of the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, a dividend of R15.3 million ($1.3 million) was declared on August 4, 2016 and paid on August 29, 2016. Using shares in issue of 763,087,500 (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares), this equated to a dividend of 2 South African cents and 0.2 U.S. cents per share. In respect of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, a dividend of R11.3 million ($1.0 million) was declared on November 3, 2016 and paid on November 28, 2016. Using shares in issue of 563,434,240 (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares), this equated to a dividend of 2 South African cents and 0.2 U.S. cents per share. In respect of the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, a dividend of R11.2 million ($0.9 million) was declared on February 2, 2017 and paid on February 27, 2017. Using shares in issue of 563,434,240 (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares), this equated to a dividend of 2 South African cents and 0.2 U.S. cents per share.\n11. Acquisition of non-controlling interest\nIn June 2014, the Group entered into a quotaholders agreement with Edge Gestão Empresarial LTDA (“Edge”), whereby Edge was granted a 5% holding in the equity interest of MiX Telematics Serviços De Telemetria E Rastreamento De Veículos Do Brazil Limitada (“MiX Brazil”). Prior to this quotaholders agreement, Edge held a non-controlling interest in MiX Brazil of 0.0025%. Edge is a Brazilian-based investment company controlled by Luiz Munhoz, the Managing Director of MiX Brazil. The increase in the equity interests granted to Edge was in respect of services provided by Luiz Munhoz to MiX Brazil, in his role as Managing Director of MiX Brazil. In terms of the quotaholders agreement, Edge had an option to transfer its interest in MiX Brazil back to the Group at fair value. The quotaholders agreement with Edge represented a cash-settled share-based payment.\nIn September 2017, Edge exercised the put option in the quotaholders agreement. In terms of the subsequent sale agreement, MiX Investments acquired Edge’s 5% equity interest in MiX Brazil for R1.4 million ($0.1 million) which increased the Group's interest in MiX Brazil to 100%. As a result, the Group recognized a cash-settled share-based payment expense and liability of R1.4 million ($0.1 million), which was subsequently settled. The non-controlling interest related to MiX Brazil of R1.5 million ($0.1 million) was also transferred to other reserves within equity.\n12. Fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost\nThe fair values of trade and other receivables, restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables, accruals, bank overdrafts and other payables approximate their book values as the impact of discounting is not considered material due to the short-term nature of both the receivables and payables.\n13. Contingencies\nService agreement\nIn terms of an amended network services agreement with Mobile Telephone Networks Proprietary Limited (“MTN”), MTN is entitled to claw back payments from MiX Telematics Africa Proprietary Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, in the event of early cancellation of the agreement or certain base connections not being maintained over the term of the agreement. No connection incentives will be received in terms of the amended network services agreement. The maximum potential liability under the arrangement is R43.7 million ($3.7 million). No loss is considered probable under this arrangement.\n14. Change in estimate of useful lives of product development costs capitalized\nDuring fiscal 2018, the CSO segment reassessed the useful lives of certain projects where, on average, the useful lives were increased from 5.0 years to 6.5 years. The reassessment of the useful lives resulted in a R4.5 million ($0.4 million) reduction in the product development amortization expense relative to what it would have been in fiscal 2018 had the change not occurred. The amortization reduction expected to be charged to the income statement over the future fiscal years is as follows:\nFigures are in thousands Year ended March 31, 2019\n2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 South African Rand 1,694 611 748 457 334 303 158 106 106 27 United States Dollar 143 52 63 39 28 26 13 9 9 2 15. Taxation\nSection 11D Allowances relating to tax assets recognized\nMiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited (“MiX International”), a subsidiary of the Group, historically claimed a 150% allowance for research and development spend in terms of section 11D (“S11D”) of the South African Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962 (“the Act”). As of October 1, 2012, the legislation relating to the allowance was amended. The amendment requires pre-approval of development project expenditure on a project specific basis by the South African Department of Science and Technology (“DST”) in order to claim a deduction of the additional 50% over and above the expenditure incurred (150% allowance). Since the amendments to S11D of the Act, MiX International had been claiming the 150% deduction resulting in a recognized tax benefit. MiX International has complied with the amended legislation by submitting all required documentation to the DST in a timely manner, commencing in October 2012.\nIn June 2014, correspondence was received from the DST indicating that the research and development expenditure on certain projects for which the 150% allowance was claimed in the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years did not, in the DST’s opinion, constitute qualifying expenditure in terms of the Act. MiX International, through due legal process, had formally requested a review of the DST’s decision not to approve this expenditure. While approvals were obtained for a portion of this project expenditure as a result of a further review performed by the DST in February 2017, we continue to seek approval for the remaining projects and as such the legal process is ongoing. In addition to the approvals that were subject to the legal process, further approvals have been obtained for certain project expenditure, relating to both current and prior financial years. However, at period end, an uncertain tax position remains in relation to S11D deductions in respect of which approvals remain pending.\nSince the introduction of the DST pre-approval process, the Group has recognized in the income statement cumulative tax incentives in addition to the incurred cost of R20.5 million ($1.7 million) in respect of S11D deductions, of which R2.3 million ($0.2 million) was recognized in the current financial year. R17.7 million ($1.5 million) relates to deductions in respect of development project expenditure which has been approved by the DST. R2.8 million ($0.2 million) relates to an uncertain tax position in respect of projects where approvals have not yet been received from the DST. If the Group is unsuccessful in this regard, the Group will not recover the R2.8 million ($0.2 million) raised at March 31, 2018.\nImpact of foreign exchange movements\nThe impact of foreign exchange movements and the related tax effects on the Group's effective tax rate is shown below:\nSouth African Rand Year ended March 2018 Year ended March 2017 Reviewed Unaudited Profit for the period Foreign exchange gains Adjusted earnings Profit for the period Foreign exchange gains Adjusted earnings Profit before tax 214,883 5,073 219,956 148,253 (1,476 ) 146,777 Taxation (33,690 ) (29,403 ) (63,093 ) (26,812 ) (15,307 ) (42,119 ) Profit after tax 181,193 (24,330 ) 156,863 121,441 (16,783 ) 104,658 Attributable to: Owners of the parent 181,134 (24,330 ) 156,804 121,458 (16,783 ) 104,675 Non-controlling interests 59 — 59 (17 ) — (17 ) 181,193 (24,330 ) 156,863 121,441 (16,783 ) 104,658 Effective tax rate 15.7 % — 28.7 %\n18.1 % — 28.7 % United States Dollar Year ended March 2018 Year ended March 2017 Reviewed Unaudited Profit for the period Foreign exchange gains Adjusted earnings Profit for the period Foreign exchange gains Adjusted earnings Profit before tax 18,172 429 18,601 12,537 (125 ) 12,412 Taxation (2,849 ) (2,486 ) (5,335 ) (2,267 ) (1,294 ) (3,561 ) Profit after tax 15,323 (2,057 ) 13,266 10,270 (1,419 ) 8,851 Attributable to: Owners of the parent 15,318 (2,057 ) 13,261 10,271 (1,419 ) 8,852 Non-controlling interests 5 — 5 (1 ) — (1 ) 15,323 (2,057 ) 13,266 10,270 (1,419 ) 8,851 Effective tax rate 15.7 % — 28.7 % 18.1 % — 28.7 % Excluding the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses and its related tax consequences, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 is consistent with fiscal 2017.\n16.
