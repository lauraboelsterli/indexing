Reports say Comcast CMCSA, +0.46% is also showing interest in Fox .\nOn an earnings call in December, CEO Robert Iger said that James Murdoch would help integrate the companies “and during that period of time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not.” Inside Disney, a role for him was always seen as uncertain, according to people familiar with the matter.\nIn recent weeks James Murdoch has begun to tell associates that he isn’t going to Disney, according to people familiar with the matter.\n(James Murdoch is a director on the board of News Corp., the parent company of The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch. His father, Rupert Murdoch, is executive chairman.) ",
