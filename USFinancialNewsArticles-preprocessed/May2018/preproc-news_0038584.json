[nL3N1KB3P4]\nTianjin will pour the funds into developing sectors such as intelligent robots and hardware and software. It will also set aside 30 billion yuan in a sub-fund for intelligent devices and intelligent upgrades for traditional industries.\nSun Wenkui, vice mayor of Tianjin, pledged financial support of up to 30 million yuan for each scientific research institution, whether a provincial- or national-level body, that sets up in Tianjin.\nTianjin will also set up a separate fund worth 10 billion yuan to promote intelligent manufacturing, Xinhua added, but did not specify a timetable for setting up the fund.
