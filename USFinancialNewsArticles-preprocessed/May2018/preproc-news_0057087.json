    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Reuters) - German investment house ATON will raise its $400 million bid for South African builder Murray & Roberts by 13 percent, the company said on Friday.\nThe decision comes after ATON raised its stake in Murray & Roberts to 44 percent at 17 rand per share, triggering a rule under South African capital market regulations to offer all shareholders the same amount.\nBefore raising the bid, the company already held nearly 40 percent of the stock.
