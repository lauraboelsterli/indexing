    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will crack down on organized crime in the countryside in a bid to prevent gangs from manipulating elections or exploiting rural resources, the civil affairs ministry said.\nThe Ministry of Civil Affairs said in comments published on its website late on Wednesday it would crack down on attempts by rural gangsters to intervene in village-level politics, monopolize rural resources, take over collectively owned assets and use “clan power” to oppress village communities.\nThe ministry also said it would improve the education and supervision of rural officials and fight against bureaucratism as part of the “protracted battle” against rural organized crime.\nIt said only a small minority of village committee members were involved in organized crime but local civil affairs departments needed to provide more staff and funding to help fight against violations.\nReporting by David Stanway; Editing by Paul Tait\n ",
