Given our now well established NewGen distribution engine via the VaporBeast and Vapor Shark businesses, we intend to release operational and financial synergies through thoughtful integration and a transfer of best-in-class business practices.”\n“Given our existing NewGen infrastructure, we are confident we can increase operating contribution over the next eighteen months through a variety of actions including improved purchasing power, broadened product selection, accelerated sales growth and business process optimization,” said Graham Purdy, President, New Ventures. “This acquisition further demonstrates TPB’s continued commitment to the vaping segment.
