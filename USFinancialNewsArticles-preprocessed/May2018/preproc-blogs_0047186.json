Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Recent technology demonstrations from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc .’s Google illustrate dramatic shifts in the evolving conversation between humans and machines. Increasingly, machines are talking back. Microsoft this week showed how its Xiaoice social chatbot can have full conversations with users… on the phone. Google earlier this month demonstrated how its personal digital assistant can make calls and carry on conversations for the purposes of tasks like scheduling appointments.\nGoing full duplex. Harry Shum, Microsoft’s executive vice president for artificial intelligence and research, calls “full duplex” tech capable of engaging in “human-like verbal conversations” the next step in a world transformed by AI. “We need agents and bots to balance the smarts of IQ with EQ – our emotional intelligence,” he writes in a recent blog post .\nComing to your phone? Microsoft says that Xiaoice, Chinese for “little Bing,” according to the Verge, already has talked with over 600 thousand people on the phone since its launch. Many in the West aren’t aware of the bot’s popularity, but that may change. The company recently acquired Berkeley-based Semantic , which uses machine learning to add context to conversations that people have with chatbots, taking information received by AI systems and applying it to future dialogue.\nA United Technologies digital team scales in Brooklyn. The industrial conglomerate is working to scale its digital and data analytics capabilities across the business, with employees in its Brooklyn office developing predictive maintenance applications for jet engines and smart-building tools that let workers hail an elevator using their smartphone. CIO Journal’s Steven Norton visits the 67,000-square-foot primary space, located in the borough’s trendy DUMBO neighborhood.\nCYBERSECURITY\nIntel Corp. plans to release patches for a new vulnerability affecting its chips. Photo: SASCHA STEINBACH/EPA/SHUTTERSTOCK\nNew Intel chip flaws found. Intel Corp. plans to release patches for a new vulnerability affecting its chips, the second time this year it has addressed flaws known as Spectre and Meltdown. The fix is unlikely to be the last, the Journal’s Robert McMillan reports .\nElection security? U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen told reporters that she has never read the 25-page report written by the FBI, CIA, and NSA detailing Russian efforts at election meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Quartz says .\nFACIAL RECOGNITION TECH\nSinger Jacky Cheung performs in November in Xiamen, China; arrests at his concerts have earned the Cantopop legend a new title in Chinese media: The Nemesis of Fugitives. Photo: VCG/GETTY IMAGES\n‘Video Killed the Radio Star’ needs a rewrite. Police and state media credit facial-recognition technology and other high-tech tools for the arrests over the last two months of three wanted men at concerts staged in China by pop star Jacky Cheung. The first arrest took place on April 7 in the southeastern city of Nanchang, where security personnel used facial-recognition gear to identify a suspect in an “economic crime” from a crowd of more than 60,000 people, state media said. The WSJ reports that Hong Kong’s “God of Songs” has a new nickname: “The Nemesis of Fugitives.”\nSome see Amazon’s facial recognition tech as going too far. The American Civil Liberties Union , along with two dozen civil rights organizations, are calling upon Amazon.com Inc. to stop selling to law enforcment agencies a cloud-based facial recognition system called Rekognition. The New York Times says the groups’ actions may be due in part to Amazon’s “prominence and what they see as a departure from the company’s oft-stated focus on customers.”\nMORE TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nNOAH BERGER/REUTERS Photo: The Apple Campus 2 is seen under construction in Cupertino, Calif.\nApple avoids Amazon’s beauty contest in new campus search.

Roy Cooper to discuss possibly putting a major new customer-service facility in the Raleigh-Durham area.\nBlockchain talent wars escalate, hindering product development. Pay packages for cryptocurrency talent “have gotten insane,” David Schwartz, the chief cryptographer at blockchain startup Ripple Inc ., tells the WSJ’s Yuliya Chernova . Some 4,500 job openings with the terms “blockchain,” “bitcoin” or “cryptocurrency” in the title were posted on LinkedIn this year through mid-May, according to the company. That is up 151% over the total in all of 2017. Just 645 such job openings were posted in 2016.\nThe highest-paid software and services CEOs. The median pay figure for the software and services industry was $10.7 million, below the overall median of $12.1 million for full-year CEOs at all S&P 500 companies, according to a Journal analysis of proxy filings by S&P 500 firms. Highest paid? Gary Norcross, chief executive of Jacksonville, Fla.-based Fidelity National Information Services Inc. took in $29.1 million.\nCambridge Analytica tells staff it’s liquidating.

Speaking at a hearing at the European Parliament Tuesday Mark Zuckerberg apologized over the fake-news and privacy scandals engulfing Facebook Inc ., but rebuffed suggestions that the company has outsize market power, the WSJ reports .

Mr. Zuckerberg chose to ignore many questions including whether he thought it was morally correct to collect data on people who don’t use Facebook.\nCongressional opposition mounts over White House approach to Chinese tech deals. Lawmakers are moving to thwart Trump administration efforts to ease restrictions on Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp. and other sensitive technology, the Journal’s Kate O’Keeffe and Bob Davis report . On Tuesday the Senate Banking Committee unanimously approved legislation that would tighten national-security reviews of Chinese tech deals, strengthen export controls and prohibit the Trump administration from lifting stiff penalties imposed on ZTE.\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nCongress took a big step Tuesday to relax a wave of crisis-era restrictions placed on financial firms, as the House approved a plan to ease rules for small and midsize banks.
