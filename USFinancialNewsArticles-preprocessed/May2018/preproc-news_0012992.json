    "text": "Ian Desmond’s second solo homer Sunday afternoon snapped an eighth-inning tie and lifted the Colorado Rockies to a 3-2 win over the New York Mets and a sweep of the three-game series at Citi Field.\nThe Rockies won the final five games of a nine-game road trip and finished 6-3 on the first of their three nine-game trips this season.\nThe Mets finished 0-6 on a six-game homestand and have lost 14 of 20 following an 11-1 start.\nThe two-homer game was Desmond’s second as a member of the Rockies, with whom he signed prior to last season, and the fourth of his career. His first homer Sunday cut the Mets’ lead to 2-1 in the second inning and his second blast put starting pitcher Kyle Freeland (2-4) in line for the win.\nGerardo Parra had two hits and drew a bases-loaded walk for the Rockies, who also received two hits from David Dahl.\nThe Mets jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first against Freeland, who allowed three straight singles, including a run-scoring hit by Asdrubal Cabrera, and a sacrifice fly to the first four batters he faced. But Freeland retired 21 of his final 23 batters beginning with Todd Frazier’s sacrifice fly.\nFreeland allowed four hits and one walk while striking out eight in authoring the Rockies’ eighth straight quality start, the team’s longest streak since 2009. Colorado starters have compiled a 2.11 ERA in the last 10 games.\nBryan Shaw, Jake McGee and Adam Ottavino combined to allow one hit over the final two innings, with Ottavino earning his first save after stranding two runners in the ninth.\nHansel Robles (2-1) took the loss.\nMets starter Noah Syndergaard allowed two runs on six hits and four walks while striking out five over six innings.\nMets left fielder Yoenis Cespedes, who had the second hit and scored the second run in the first inning, left after the inning due to a tight right hip.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
