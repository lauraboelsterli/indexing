    "text": "PARIS, May 8 (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron’s office said U.S. President Donald Trump had given the French leader no indication of what he planned to say about the Iran nuclear deal later on Tuesday.\nIn answer to a Reuters question, Macron’s office denied a story by the New York Times which said Trump had told Macron the United States was going to pull out of the agreement.\nTrump was due to announce his final decision at 1800 GMT.
