    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 23 (Reuters) - Uber has shut down its self-driving car operations in Arizona two months after a fatal crash involving one of its vehicles, the company said on Wednesday.\nUber Technologies Inc is not shuttering its entire autonomous vehicle program, a spokeswoman said, but rather is focused on more limited testing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and California. It aims to resume self-driving operations this summer.\nThe ride-hailing company had suspended its self-driving program in Arizona and elsewhere after one of its SUVs hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Tempe while operating in autonomous mode, marking the first fatality involving an autonomous vehicle.
