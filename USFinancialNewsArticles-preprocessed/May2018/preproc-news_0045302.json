However, they will need to forego that amount should they get promoted, meaning their minimum net uplift would be 160 million pounds.\nThe change from three to two years of parachute payments was enforced from the 2016-17 season. This means that any club that gets relegated after just one season in the Premier League is only entitled to two years of parachute payments.\nThe 2018-19 Premier League campaign will be final season under a 5.1 billion pound domestic TV rights deal signed in 2015.\nThe value of the broadcasting rights have since dropped after the Premier League sold the majority of the packages for the next cycle for almost 4.5 billion pounds in February.\n“Whilst sale of domestic rights has so far produced a lower value relative to the current cycle we expect the combined value of domestic and international rights to remain at a healthy premium across 2019 to 2022 to any other football league,” Jones added.\n“The value of rights for the next cycle should reach current levels after the conclusion of the Premier League’s sale of domestic rights (two smaller packages remain unsold) and international rights.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
