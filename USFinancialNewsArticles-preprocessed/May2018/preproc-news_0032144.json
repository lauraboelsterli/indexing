    "text": "(Reuters) - Messaging service WhatsApp rolled out new group-chat features on Tuesday, including more controls for administrators as well as regular group members.\nFILE PHOTO: The WhatsApp app logo is seen on a smartphone in this picture illustration taken September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Users can now leave a group permanently to avoid being repeatedly added back after they have left, Facebook Inc-owned WhatsApp said in a blog post.\nAdministrators can no longer be removed from a group they created and users can now quickly locate messages that mention them in a group conversation.\nGroups on WhatsApp have taken a central role in the messaging service that has more than 1 billion users, helping connect people with similar interests across the globe.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru\n ",
