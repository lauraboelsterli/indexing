    "text": "U.K. officials said Tuesday they will summon Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Parliament the next time he's in British territory if he does not volunteer to do so.\nIt would be the first governmental summons for Zuckerberg in the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica data leak and widespread concerns around user privacy.\n\"It's worth noting that, while Mr. Zuckerberg does not normally come under the jurisdiction of the UK Parliament, he will do so the next time he enters the country,\" Damian Collins, a Conservative member of Parliament, wrote in a letter published Tuesday .\nshow chapters Here are the 6 best exchanges from Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress 9:46 AM ET Mon, 23 April 2018 | 02:02 \"There are over 40 million Facebook users in the UK and they deserve to hear accurate answers from the company he created and whether it is able to keep their users' data safe,\" Collins wrote.\nHere's the full letter:\ntweet with letter\nFacebook sent CTO Mike Schroepfer last week to answer questions before a parliamentary committee .\nSchroepfer admitted during the hearing that Facebook did not read the terms of service of the app that improperly shared user data with Cambridge Analytica. He also testified that Facebook was investigating whether defense contractor Palantir had improper access to Facebook user data .\nCollins' letter said Schroepfer \"failed to answer fully on nearly 40 separate points.\"\nCollins submitted 39 questions for written response in his letter, encompassing everything from the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency to the number of \"clicks or swipes\" it takes to change personal privacy settings on a smartphone.\nFacebook is expected to submit a response, including whether Zuckerberg will voluntarily testify, by May 11.\nFacebook was not immediately available for comment following the publication of the letter.",
