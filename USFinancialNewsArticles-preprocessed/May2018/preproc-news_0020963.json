    "text": "SEOUL, May 9 (Reuters) - South Korea’s energy ministry said on Wednesday it will seek an exemption to any renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran following U.S President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran.\n“We will seek a discussion with U.S. authorities to get an exemption on Iranian crude imports,” South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a statement.\nSouth Korea, one of Asia’s major Iranian oil customers, mainly buys an ultra-light form of oil known as condensate.
