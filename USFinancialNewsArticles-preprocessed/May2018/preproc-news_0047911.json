    "text": "MOORESVILLE, N.C., May 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW) today reported net earnings of $988 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.19 for the quarter ended May 4, 2018, compared to net earnings of $602 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.70 in the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share increased 15.5 percent from adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 of $1.03 in the same period a year ago.\nSales for the first quarter increased 3.0 percent to $17.4 billion from $16.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017, and comparable sales increased 0.6 percent. Comparable sales for the U.S. home improvement business increased 0.5 percent.\nDuring the quarter, the company adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard ASU No. 2014-09. As a result, the company reclassified certain items within operating income. This change resulted in an increase to sales of approximately $130 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by the reclassification of the profit sharing income from the company's proprietary credit program from selling, general and administrative expense. This accounting standard had no impact on comparable sales or diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018. It has been adopted on a modified retrospective basis, therefore the prior year has not been adjusted.\n\"We drove solid performance in indoor categories and continued to grow our sales to Pro customers. However, prolonged unfavorable weather across geographies led to a delayed spring selling season which impacted results in outdoor categories,\" commented Robert A. Niblock, Lowe's chairman, president and CEO. \"Spring has now arrived and we are encouraged by strong sales in the month of May.\n\"We continue to work diligently to improve conversion, better manage inventory and stabilize gross margin, while investing in the capabilities required to deliver simple and seamless customer experiences,\" Niblock added. \"I'd like to thank our employees for their commitment and dedication to helping people love where they live.\"\nDelivering on its commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the company repurchased $750 million of stock under its share repurchase program and paid $340 million in dividends in the first quarter.\nAs of May 4, 2018, Lowe's operated 2,154 home improvement and hardware stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico representing 215.1 million square feet of retail selling space.\nA conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 operating results is scheduled for today (Wednesday, May 23) at 9:00 am ET. The conference call will be available by webcast and can be accessed by visiting Lowe's website at www.Lowes.com/investor and clicking on Lowe's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call Webcast. Supplemental slides will be available fifteen minutes prior to the start of the conference call. A replay of the call will be archived on Lowes.com/investor until August 21, 2018.\nLowe's Business Outlook\nThe company has reflected the impact of its adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard in its Business Outlook, which resulted in the reclassification of certain items within operating income. Although this change has no effect on operating income, it does positively impact total sales growth by approximately 1 percent and negatively impact operating margin by approximately 10 basis points.\nFiscal Year 2018 (comparisons to fiscal year 2017; based on U.S. GAAP)\nTotal sales are expected to increase approximately 5 percent. Comparable sales are expected to increase approximately 3.5 percent. The company expects to add approximately 10 home improvement and hardware stores. Operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) is expected to decrease approximately 40 basis points. 2 The effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 25.5%. Diluted earnings per share of $5.40 to $5.50 are expected for the fiscal year ending Feb. 1, 2019.\n1 Adjusted diluted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation\" section of this release for additional information as well as a reconciliation between the Company's GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.\n2 Includes 4 basis point net negative impact from the gain on the sale of the company's interest in its Australian joint venture (2Q 2017) and the one-time bonus paid to eligible hourly U.S. employees (4Q 2017).\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Forward-looking statements involve estimates, expectations, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results, Lowe's plans, objectives, business outlook, priorities, expectations and intentions, expectations for sales growth, comparable sales, earnings and performance, shareholder value, capital expenditures, cash flows, the housing market, the home improvement industry, demand for services, share repurchases, Lowe's strategic initiatives, including those relating to acquisitions by Lowe's and the expected impact of such transactions on our strategic and operational plans and financial results, and any statement of an assumption underlying any of the foregoing and other statements that are not historical facts.

The company believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company's operational performance.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, the company recognized a $464 million or $0.33 per share loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with a $1.6 billion cash tender offer.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the company's diluted earnings per share as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company's methods of determining this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies for this or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies.\nDetailed reconciliations between the company's GAAP and non-GAAP financial results are shown below and available on the company's website at www.lowes.com/investor .\nThree Months Ended\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nMay 4, 2018\nMay 5, 2017\n(millions, except per share data)\nPre-Tax\nEarnings\nTax\nNet\nEarnings\nPre-Tax\nEarnings\nTax\nNet\nEarnings\nDiluted earnings per share, as reported\n$\n1.19\n$\n0.70\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n—\n0.54\n(0.21)\n0.33\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n$\n1.19\n$\n1.03\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lowes-reports-first-quarter-sales-and-earnings-results-300653221.html\nSOURCE Lowe's Companies, Inc.",
