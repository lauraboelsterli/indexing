    "text": "MAYFIELD VILLAGE, Ohio, May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Preformed Line Products Company (NASDAQ: PLPC) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $98.1 million, an increase of 16%, compared to $84.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company posted net income for the first quarter of 2018 of $5.5 million, or $1.09 per share, compared to $1.5 million, or $.30 per share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nCurrency translation rates had a favorable impact on 2018 first quarter net sales of $2.7 million, with only a $.1 million favorable effect on net income. Additionally, gains on foreign currency transactions had a favorable impact of $.1 million on pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2018 compared to a $.2 million favorable impact for the same period in 2017.\nRob Ruhlman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"The first quarter of 2018 marked our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. Leveraging our global manufacturing infrastructure allowed us to expand our profit margins during this period. Raw material cost increases, competitive pricing and an uncertain tariff picture point to a challenging future. We believe our goal of consistent, profitable growth is best served through our ongoing concentration on high-quality products and focused customer service.\"\nFounded in 1947, Preformed Line Products is an international designer and manufacturer of products and systems employed in the construction and maintenance of overhead and underground networks for energy, communications and broadband network companies.\nPreformed's world headquarters are in Cleveland, Ohio, and the Company operates two domestic manufacturing centers located in Rogers, Arkansas, and Albemarle, North Carolina. The Company serves its worldwide market through international operations in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, England, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain and Thailand.\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding the Company, including those statements regarding the Company's and management's beliefs and expectations concerning the Company's future performance or anticipated financial results, among others.
