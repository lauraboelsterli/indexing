Germany’s DAX declined 0.3 percent while Britain’s FTSE 100 was flat in percentage terms.\nThough moves at the index level were muted, M&A news livened up trading. Shares in Sika soared nearly 10 percent to the top of the STOXX after the Swiss chemicals company reached an agreement with French building materials firm Saint-Gobain to end a long-standing legal dispute.\nSaint-Gobain, whose shares rose 2.7 percent, is to take a large stake in Sika, but not majority control.\n“We see this as positive for (Saint Gobain), which we believe has been negatively impacted, with some investors preferring to remain on the side lines because of the uncertainties linked to the Sika operation,” analysts at Raymond James said in a note.\nShares in Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) were last up 2.4 percent, giving up some gains after jumping as much as 9.4 percent, after U.S.-based private equity firm Silver Lake Management Company agreed to acquire ZPG, the owner of British property websites Zoopla and PrimeLocation, for 2.2 billion pounds ($3 billion).\nDMGT is the biggest shareholder in ZPG, whose shares rocketed around 30 percent to a record high. Shares in fellow British classifieds websites Rightmove rose 6.2 percent and Auto Trader rallied 3.8 percent.\n“A lot of companies that hold overseas money (are) looking in and realising that they’re getting a bit of value at the moment with how weak the pound is, relatively speaking,” Jasper Reimers, market analyst at Vertex Capital Group, said, referring to the UK equity market.\nWhile the first quarter earnings was winding down in Europe, basic resources was the best-performing sector after shares in ArcelorMittal rose 2.3 percent. The world’s biggest steelmaker beat earnings forecasts and gave an upbeat outlook for 2018.\nSo far blended year-on-year earnings growth for the first quarter has come in at 16 percent for MSCI EMU, in dollar terms, compared with 26 percent for the S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nHealth care stocks were a weak spot, however, with the sector index down 0.9 percent. Shares in AstraZeneca declined 0.1 percent after Fasenra, its first respiratory biologic medicine, flopped in a clinical trial.\nReporting by Kit Rees, Editing by Helen Reid and Richard Balmforth\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
