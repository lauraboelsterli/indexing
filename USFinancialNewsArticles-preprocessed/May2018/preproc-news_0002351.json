We are encouraged by the recovering sales volumes in Puerto Rico, the positive contribution of our PayGroup acquisition and our continued solid execution. Due to our strong first quarter results and our expectations of continued elevated spending driven by relief programs and insurance proceeds in Puerto Rico, we have increased our 2018 guidance. \"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenue. Total revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $110.3 million an increase of 9% compared with $101.3 million in the prior year. Revenue growth in the quarter reflected the impact of the acquisition of PayGroup as well as elevated sales volumes in Puerto Rico driven by post-hurricane recovery activity, federal relief and benefit programs and insurance proceeds.\nNet Income attributable to common shareholders. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, GAAP Net Income attributable to common shareholders was $23.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, flat as compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $54.0 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues) increased 40 basis points to 48.9% compared with 48.5% in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by revenue mix changes, the contribution of PayGroup as well as expense management actions.\nAdjusted Net Income. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted Net Income was $34.6 million, an increase of 5% compared with $33.0 million in the prior year and included the impact of increased interest expense and a higher tax rate in the current year. Adjusted earnings per common share was $0.47, an increase of 4% as compared to $0.45 in the prior year.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company did not repurchase stock and a total of approximately $72 million remains authorized and available for future repurchases under its share repurchase program.

For more information, visit www.evertecinc.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe non-GAAP measures referenced in this release material are supplemental measures of the Company’s performance and are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). They are not measurements of the Company’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to total revenue, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as indicators of operating performance or as measures of the Company’s liquidity. In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP measures to focus on the factors the Company believes are pertinent to the daily management of the Company’s operations and believes that they are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the industry. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the schedules to this release. These non-GAAP measures include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share and are defined below.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is substantially consistent with the equivalent measurements that are contained in the senior secured credit facilities in testing EVERTEC Group’s compliance with covenants therein such as the senior secured leverage ratio.\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as net income adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments\nAdjusted Earnings per common share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted shares outstanding\nWe use Adjusted Net Income to measure our overall profitability because we believe better reflects our comparable operating performance by excluding the impact of the non-cash amortization and depreciation that was created as a result of Apollo Global Management LLC’s acquisition of a 51% indirect ownership in EVERTEC Group. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses such as those excluded in calculating them. Further, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future operating results will not be affected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of, and subject to the protection of, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of EVERTEC to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” and “plans” and similar expressions of future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “should,” “would,” “may,” and “could” are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. Any statements that refer to expectations or other characterizations of future events, circumstances or results are forward-looking statements.\nVarious factors that could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those estimated by management include, but are not limited to: the Company’s reliance on its relationship with Popular for a significant portion of revenue; our ability to renew our client contracts on terms favorable to us; the effectiveness of our risk management procedures; our dependence on our processing systems, technology infrastructure, security systems and fraudulent-payment-detection systems, and the risk that our systems may experience breakdowns or fail to prevent security breaches or fraudulent transfers; our ability to develop, install and adopt new technology; a decreased client base due to consolidations in the banking and financial-services industry; the credit risk of our merchant clients, for which we may also be liable; the continuing market position of the ATH® network; reduction in consumer confidence leading to decreased consumer spending; the Company’s dependence on credit card associations; regulatory limitations on our activities, including the potential need to seek regulatory approval to consummate transactions, due to our relationship with Popular and our role as a service provider to financial institutions; changes in the regulatory environment and changes in international, legal, tax, political, administrative or economic conditions; the geographical concentration of the Company’s business in Puerto Rico; operating an international business in multiple regions with potential political and economic instability; increased compliance risks associated with operating an international business; operating in countries and counterparties that put us at risk of violating U.S. sanctions laws; our ability to execute our expansion and acquisition strategies; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel; our ability to comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements; evolving industry standards; the Company’s high level of indebtedness and restrictions contained in the Company’s debt agreements; and the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to service the Company’s indebtedness and to generate future profits.\nConsideration should be given to the areas of risk described above, as well as those risks set forth under the headings “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in the reports the Company files with the SEC from time to time, in connection with considering any forward-looking statements that may be made by the Company and its businesses generally. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events unless we are required to do so by law.\nEVERTEC, Inc.\nSchedule 1: Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollar amounts in thousands, except share data) Revenues $ 110,274 $ 101,280 Operating costs and expenses Cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below 47,420 44,173 Selling, general and administrative expenses 13,432 10,831 Depreciation and amortization 15,867 15,684 Total operating costs and expenses 76,719 70,688 Income from operations 33,555 30,592 Non-operating income (expenses) Interest income 157 185 Interest expense (7,679 ) (7,036 ) Earnings of equity method investment 199 143 Other income 817 1,274 Total non-operating expenses (6,506 ) (5,434 ) Income before income taxes 27,049 25,158 Income tax expense 3,935 2,020 Net income 23,114 23,138 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 92 109 Net income attributable to EVERTEC, Inc.’s common stockholders 23,022 23,029 Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax Foreign currency translation adjustments 2,407 (645 ) Gain on cash flow hedge 1,503 618 Total comprehensive income attributable to EVERTEC, Inc.’s common stockholders $ 26,932 $ 23,002 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.32 $ 0.32 Diluted $ 0.31 $ 0.31 Shares used in computing net income per common share: Basic 72,409,462 72,636,166 Diluted 73,372,835 73,154,693 EVERTEC, Inc.\nSchedule 2: Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 53,471 $ 50,423 Restricted cash 10,540 9,944 Accounts receivable, net 90,037 83,328 Prepaid expenses and other assets 30,318 25,011 Total current assets 184,366 168,706 Investment in equity investee 13,369 13,073 Property and equipment, net 38,515 37,924 Goodwill 399,861 398,575 Other intangible assets, net 273,536 279,961 Other long-term assets 7,182 4,549 Total assets $ 916,829 $ 902,788 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current Liabilities: Accrued liabilities $ 35,334 $ 38,451 Accounts payable 40,670 41,135 Unearned income 9,521 7,737 Income tax payable 4,121 1,406 Current portion of long-term debt 46,558 46,487 Short-term borrowings — 12,000 Total current liabilities 136,204 147,216 Long-term debt 553,140 557,251 Deferred tax liability 13,033 13,820 Unearned income - long term 23,695 23,486 Other long-term liabilities 11,472 13,039 Total liabilities 737,544 754,812 Stockholders’ equity Preferred stock, par value $0.01;
