Our clients are attracted by the Company’s off-the-shelf and custom embedded computing solutions which lead the industry in performance, function, and reliability, as well as our strong expertise in product development. To continue our momentum, we are investing in our engineering capabilities and new product development.”\nRees added, “We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Stream TV Networks on our strategic investment and additional purchase commitment of US$1,500,000 in services to be purchased directly by Stream or through referrals to connected third parties.”\nBusiness Highlights\nAnnounced two new production wins with the receipt of initial orders valued at US$287,000. The Company also signed product development services agreements and hardware orders from existing clients valued at US$342,000.\nAnnounced the attainment of a new production client for the Company’s Open-Q™ 820 computing module and receipt of orders, last week that are in aggregate valued in excess of US$500,000. The new client placed an initial order for the Company’s Open-Q™ computing modules that is valued at approximately US$205,000. The Company also signed a product development services agreement with an existing client that is valued at approximately US$311,000. Hardware shipments and services are expected to be provided during the first and second quarters of 2018.\nAnnounced the availability of two new platforms to support development of Smart Home Hub and other Voice-Controlled products.\nAnnounced the general availability of a new Hardware Development Kit (“HDK”) featuring the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 845 Mobile Platform, a product of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated.\nAnnounced the availability of the Open-X™ 8M System on Module (“SOM”) and Development Kit.\nEntered into a line of credit facility with a major Canadian chartered bank of CDN$4.4 million (the “LOC Facility”).\nEstablished a subsidiary and engineering center in Bangalore, India to add engineering resources for new product development and client projects.\nFinancial Highlights\nThree Month Comparative Results\nThe Company reported first quarter revenue of US$6.1 million (CDN$7.7 million), up 35% over the same period in the prior year of US$4.5 million (CDN$5.9 million) but down 11% over the prior period of US$6.8 million (CDN$8.7 million). The increase in revenue over the comparative period in the prior year was due primarily to increased revenue from the sale of hardware products.\nGross margin 2 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 32%, which was lower than the 35% gross margin in the comparative periods. Decrease in gross margin over the comparative periods was due to the change in revenue mix, which saw a significant increase in revenues from the Company’s Embedded Computing Hardware business which has a lower gross margin than the Company’s engineering services, and a decrease in engineering services revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was as follows:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nThree months ended\nDecember 31, 2017 (Restated) 3\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2017 (Restated) US$ CDN$\nUS$ CDN$\nUS$ CDN$ Operating income (loss) $ 148,980 $ 188,416 $ 407,315 $ 517,819 $ 14,651 $ 19,395 Add: revenue recognized as interest income as per IFRS - - - - 33,750 44,678 Add back: Other operating expenses 158,651 200,645 164,054 208,559 64,529 85,423 Adjusted EBITDA $ 307,631 $ 389,061 $ 571,369 $ 726,378 $ 112,930 $ 149,496\nThe Company had net income of US$124,150 (CDN$160,080) in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of US$96,966 (CDN$125,028) in the same period in the prior year and net income of US$453,547 (CDN$570,087) in the prior quarter.\nFinancial Position as at March 31, 2018\nWorking capital 4 as of March 31, 2018 was US$12.5 million (CDN$16.2 million) inclusive of cash and short-term investments of US$6.9 million (CDN$8.8 million).
