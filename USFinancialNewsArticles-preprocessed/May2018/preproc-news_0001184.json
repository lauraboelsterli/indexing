See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nOPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE\nIn the first quarter of 2018 Golden Star produced 57,616 ounces of gold. The Company became a primarily underground-focused gold producer in January 2018 following the cessation of production from the Wassa Main Pit. The Prestea Open Pits are also expected to complete production during the third quarter of 2018. Subsequently, Golden Star intends to focus on high margin, underground ore with the objective of strengthening its financial position and creating a robust platform to deliver shareholder value.\nGold production from the Wassa complex increased by 13% in the first quarter of 2018 to 35,506 ounces compared to the first quarter of 2017. 83% of Wassa's production was attributable to Wassa Underground, which delivered stronger than anticipated production as a result of higher grades and higher tonnages. Consequently, the Wassa complex delivered its lowest cash operating cost per ounce 1 in over two years of $683.\nGold production from the Prestea complex was 22,110 ounces in the first quarter of 2018, which represents a 16% decrease compared to the same period in 2017. This is as a result of the anticipated lower production from the Prestea Open Pits, as the operation approaches the end of its mine life, and the challenges experienced at Prestea Underground during the first quarter of 2018. Since mid-April 2018, when Golden Star began drawing down ore from the second stope at Prestea Underground, the mine's production rate has increased significantly (averaging 613 tpd between April 17 and April 29, 2018) and management expects the results of the second quarter of 2018 to reflect these improvements.\nGolden Star's consolidated cash operating cost per ounce 1 was $909 in the first quarter of 2018, a 14% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017. This was due primarily to the increase in mine operating expenses associated with Prestea Underground declaring commercial production on February 1, 2018 and the decrease in ounces sold in the first quarter of 2018 at the Prestea complex compared to the first quarter of 2017. This was partially offset by the 27% decrease in cash operating cost per ounce 1 at the Wassa complex.\nThe AISC per ounce 1 in the first quarter of 2018 was $1,171, an increase of 20% compared to the first quarter of 2017, as a result of an increase in capitalized development costs at Wassa Underground. Sustaining capital incurred at Wassa Underground in the first quarter of 2017 was very low as mining operations had not yet accessed the B Shoot zone. In the first quarter of 2017 underground development costs were attributed to development capital expenditures (and therefore not included in the AISC per ounce 1 ) until mining began in the B Shoot. The cost of sales per ounce 1 was $1,204. Golden Star expects its operating costs to decrease in the second half of 2018 as production at both underground operations continues to ramp up.\nAt the end of the first quarter, $12.6 million (68%) of severance expenses had been paid. The majority of the severance payments relating to the Wassa Main Pit workforce are now complete and Golden Star expects to pay the severance expenses relating to the Prestea Open Pits workforce during the remainder of 2018. The total severance expenses across both operations are expected to be $18.6 million.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2018, Golden Star is on track to achieve its consolidated FY 2018 guidance on all stated metrics. As stated in the press release dated January 11, 2018, Golden Star expects production to be weighted to the second half of 2018 and consequently, cash operating cost per ounce 1 and AISC per ounce 1 are anticipated to decrease in the second half of 2018.\nNotes\n1.

See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nWassa Operational Overview\nGold production from the Wassa complex increased by 13% in the first quarter of 2018 to 35,506 ounces compared to the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 represented the first quarter of primarily underground production, with 83% of Wassa's production attributable to Wassa Underground (29,514 ounces).\nThe grade of the underground ore in the first quarter of 2018 increased by 84% to 4.54 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") of gold (\"Au\") compared to the first quarter of 2017 and by 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Mining rates at Wassa Underground also continued to exceed expectations, at approximately 2,400 tpd on average in the first quarter of 2018. This represents a 40% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017 and a 26% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. During March 2018, the mining rate exceeded 2,600 tpd.\nThe targeted average mining rate for Wassa Underground in FY 2018 is 2,700-3,000 tpd, but the Company expected to achieve an average of 2,300 tpd during the first quarter of 2018 . The mining team is well-positioned to continue to increase the tonnage profile in 2018 and beyond, with the mining sequence working well and an increasing number of stopes prepared and developed.\nGold production ceased from the Wassa Main Pit in January 2018, as planned, however, stockpiled ore will continue to be fed to the processing plant until the third quarter of 2018.\nThe Wassa complex reported a 27% decrease in cash operating cost per ounce 1 of 2018 to $683 compared to the first quarter of 2017. This represents Wassa's lowest cash operating cost per ounce 1 since the fourth quarter of 2015. This strong performance was due primarily to the increase in higher grade ore from Wassa Underground being fed to the processing plant and the subsequent increase in gold sold. The cost of sales per ounce 1 for Wassa in the first quarter of 2018 was $1,000.\n$3.4 million of severance expenses were paid during the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the cessation of production from Wassa Main Pit in January 2018. The severance payments relating to the Wassa Main Pit workforce are now largely complete.\nNotes\n1.

See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nPrestea Operational Overview\nGold production from Prestea was 22,110 ounces in the first quarter of 2018. 66% of production was attributable to the Prestea Open Pits and 34% to Prestea Underground.\nThe Prestea Open Pits produced 14,629 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 26,446 ounces in the same period in 2017. This decrease in production was anticipated, as the Prestea Open Pits had been expected to complete gold production at the end of 2017. However additional ore was sourced during the first quarter of 2018 so mining is now expected to continue throughout the first half of 2017, with ore supply from the Prestea Open Pits being processed until the middle of the third quarter of 2018. The grade of the ore from the Prestea Open Pits decreased by 35% in the first quarter of 2018, as expected, to 1.50 g/t Au as a result of the higher grade pits being mined earlier in the operation's mine life.\nCommercial production was achieved at Prestea Underground on February 1, 2018 and the mine produced 7,481 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2018 compared to nil in the first quarter of 2017. The challenges experienced with the blasting of the first stope at Prestea Underground, which were described in the press release dated January 11, 2018 1 , continued during the period. As a result, the blasted ore from the first stope contained higher than anticipated levels of dilution and the grade processed from Prestea Underground was 8.22 g/t Au, compared to the average Mineral Reserve grade of 12.35 g/t Au. However the mining team learnt important lessons from the first stope and further changes have been made to drill design patterns, blasting practice, raise layouts and stope ventilation, in order to address these dilution issues.\nConsequently, the initial results from the second stope have been much stronger. The ore draw down of the second stope commenced in mid-April 2018 and during the 12 days from April 17 to April 29, 2018 the average production rate from Prestea Underground was 613 tpd, achieving a maximum of 851 tpd. This compares to the average production rate during the first quarter of 2018 of 361 tpd and demonstrates that the Company is making significant progress in moving towards the targeted production rate for Prestea Underground of 650 tpd. The initial grades from the second stope being fed to the processing plant are also in line with the block model.\nThe operational management team at Prestea Underground was strengthened during the first quarter of 2018, with the objective of delivering continuous improvement to the mine's performance. Golden Star's management team expects the mine's performance to improve significantly during the second quarter of 2018.\nPrestea reported a cash operating cost per ounce 2 of $1,306 in the first quarter of 2018, which represents a 108% increase compared to the same period in 2017. This was due primarily to the increase in mine operating expenses associated with Prestea Underground declaring commercial production and the decrease in ounces sold in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. In addition, there was a $3.8 million drawdown of ore stockpiles at Prestea during the first quarter of 2018 compared to a $0.1 million build up in the same period in 2017. The cost of sales per ounce 2 at Prestea in the first quarter of 2018 was $1,562.\nGolden Star expects to pay $4.4 million in severance expenses relating to the Prestea Open Pits workforce during the remainder of 2018 as the Company streamlines the operation to focus on high margin, underground production.\nNotes\n1. See press release entitled, 'Golden Star Achieves 2017 Production Guidance and Provides Guidance for 2018', dated January 11, 2018\n2. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nExploration\nUpdated Wassa Underground Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate\nOn April 12, 2018, the Company released an updated Inferred Mineral Resource estimate for Wassa Underground. The updated estimate delivered a 147% increase in Wassa Underground's Inferred Mineral Resources to 5.2 million ounces of gold, in the B Shoot South and F Shoot South areas. The grade of the Inferred Mineral Resources also increased by 9% to 3.6 g/t Au compared to 3.3 g/t Au in the December 31, 2017 estimate.\nGolden Star is conducting further drilling of the Wassa South extensions currently and the Company expects that Wassa Underground's Inferred Mineral Resources will continue to grow with further step out drilling.\nGolden Star is planning to undertake a Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") on the Inferred Mineral Resources of the Wassa Underground deposit. The objective of the PEA is to demonstrate the viability of the Inferred Mineral Resources, potentially including a new access shaft and new ventilation infrastructure. As Golden Star has significant under-utilized capacity in the Wassa processing plant, this additional material could be processed without the need for Golden Star to build any additional processing capacity. Golden Star expects to commence work on the PEA late in the second quarter of 2018 and the Company anticipates it will be completed in the third quarter of 2018.\nDrilling at Prestea\nGolden Star drilled on surface and from underground on the Prestea licence area during the first quarter of 2018.\nDrilling at Prestea Underground continued to test the Inferred Mineral Resources along the edges of the West Reef ore body with the objective of Mineral Resource expansion. The Company is planning to begin step out drilling to the north of the West Reef in the third quarter of 2018 to test the potential down plunge extension of the deposit, once drilling chambers have been established. Golden Star believes the West Reef is larger than the current estimate suggests.\nElsewhere on the Prestea licence area, one surface rig continued to test the South Gap target between the two historic underground shafts, Bondaye and Tuapim. The South Gap is one of the five new potential underground targets that Golden Star outlined in its 2018 exploration strategy. The drilling is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018 and once all results have been received, the Company will provide an update to the market. Pending the completion of the South Gap drilling, the drill rig will be mobilized to test several other targets along the Company's 85 kilometre strike length of the Ashanti Gold Trend.\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nCapital Expenditures\nHaving largely completed the development of both Wassa Underground and Prestea Underground, capital expenditures of 2018 totaled $11.6 million compared to $16.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing a 31% decrease. Development capital accounted for 50% of capital expenditures ($5.8 million), related primarily to Prestea Underground ($3.6 million) and exploration drilling ($1.9 million).\nFirst Quarter 2018 Capital Expenditures Breakdown (in millions)\nItem\nSustaining\nDevelopment\nTotal\nWassa Underground\n$3.5\n$0.1\n$3.6\nWassa Equipment Purchases\n$1.4\n-\n$1.4\nWassa Exploration\n-\n$1.3\n$1.3\nOther Development\n$0.2\n$0.1\n$0.3\nWassa Subtotal\n$5.1\n$1.5\n$6.6\nPrestea Open Pit Mines\n$0.5\n-\n$0.5\nPrestea Underground\n-\n$3.6\n$3.6\nPrestea Exploration\n-\n$0.6\n$0.6\nOther Development\n$0.2\n$0.1\n$0.3\nPrestea Subtotal\n$0.7\n$4.3\n$5.0\nConsolidated\n$5.8\n$5.8\n$11.6\nOther Financial Highlights\nGold revenues of 2018 totaled $70.8 million from gold sales of 58,360 ounces, at an average realized gold price of $1,258 per ounce. This represents a 3% increase in revenues compared to the first quarter of 2017, which was due primarily to a 22% increase in gold revenue at the Wassa complex. This increase was offset partially by a 19% decrease in gold revenue from the Prestea complex, resulting from the expected decrease in production from the Prestea Open Pits and higher levels of dilution impacting production at Prestea Underground.\nCost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization of 2018 totaled $59.6 million, an increase of 16% from the same period in 2017. This increase can be attributed primarily to a $5.7 million increase in operating costs from metals inventory related to a planned drawdown of ore stockpiles at Wassa and Prestea, offset partially by a 2% decrease in consolidated mine operating expenses. In addition, there was a $2.4 million increase in severance expenses related to the suspension of production at the Wassa Main Pit.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses of 2018 totaled $8.2 million, a 3% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2017 due mainly to lower gold production at Prestea.\nAs a result, Golden Star reported a mine operating margin of $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was due primarily to the higher cost of sales in the first quarter of 2018.\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses of 2018 totaled $1.1 million, compared to $8.0 million in the same period in 2017, an 86% decrease. The decrease in G&A costs of 2018 was due primarily to a $7.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to the same period in 2017, resulting from a decrease in the Company's share price during the quarter.\nGolden Star recorded a fair value gain of $5.4 million on financial instruments in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a $2.5 million gain in the same period in 2017. The $5.4 million fair value gain relates to a non-cash revaluation gain on the embedded derivative liability of the 7% Convertible Debentures.\nThe net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.0 million or $0.00 income per share, compared to a net income of $0.2 million or $0.00 income per share in the first quarter of 2017. The higher net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was due primarily to a higher mine operating margin at Wassa, a higher gain on fair value of financial instruments and lower G&A costs, offset partially by the mine operating loss at Prestea of 2018 compared to a higher mine operating margin in the same period in 2017.\nCash provided by operations before working capital changes in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.8 million compared to $17.7 million in the same period in 2017. This decrease was due primarily to the $5.7 million decline in the consolidated mine operating margin and the $10.0 million advance payment received during the first quarter of 2017 from RGLD Gold AG (\"RGLD\") pursuant to the gold purchase and sale agreement (the \"Streaming Agreement\"). The $10.0 million payment received in January 2017 was the final advance payment under the Streaming Agreement.\nThe Company's consolidated cash balance was $26.2 million at March 31, 2018. Working capital used $4.8 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.3 million in the same period in 2017. The working capital changes in the first quarter of 2018 included an $11.4 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, offset by a $5.0 million decrease in inventory, a $1.0 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $0.7 million decrease in prepaids and other.\nFor further information about Golden Star's operational and financial performance, please visit the Financial and Operational database at http://apps.indigotools.com/IR/IAC/?Ticker=GSC&Exchange=TSX . The data relating to the first quarter of 2018 will be available 24 hours after release at the latest.\nNotes\n1. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nOther Corporate Developments\nCommercial production achieved at Prestea Underground\nOn February 1, 2018, commercial production was achieved at Prestea Underground. Gold production is anticipated to ramp up during 2018 and exploration drilling is underway at the mine, with the objective of increasing the annual production rate and extending the mine life.\nOutlook\nGolden Star remains on track to achieve its guidance on all stated metrics for FY 2018. This includes consolidated full year production of 230,000 - 255,000 ounces of gold at a cash operating cost per ounce 1 of between $650 and $730, an AISC per ounce 1 of between $850 and $950 and capital expenditures of $36.5 million, which include $6.6 million for exploration.\nGolden Star expects gold production to be weighted towards the second half of the year, due to the continued ramp up of production at both Wassa Underground and Prestea Underground. Consequently, Golden Star anticipates that its cash operating cost per ounce 1 and AISC per ounce 1 will be higher during the first half of 2018.\nNotes\n1. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nAll monetary amounts refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nCompany Profile\nGolden Star is an established gold mining company that owns and operates the Wassa and Prestea mines in Ghana, West Africa.

release, we use the terms \"cash operating cost\", \"cash operating cost per ounce\", \"all-in sustaining costs\", \"all-in sustaining costs per ounce\", \"adjusted net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders\", \"adjusted income per share attributable to Golden Star shareholders\", \"cash provided by operations before working capital changes\", and \"cash provided by operations before working capital changes per share - basic\". These should be considered as non-GAAP financial measures as defined in applicable Canadian and United States securities laws and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\"Cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization\" as found in the statements of operations includes all mine-site operating costs, including the costs of mining, ore processing, maintenance, work-in-process inventory changes, mine-site overhead as well as production taxes, royalties, severance charges and by-product credits, but excludes exploration costs, property holding costs, corporate office general and administrative expenses, foreign currency gains and losses, gains and losses on asset sales, interest expense, gains and losses on derivatives, gains and losses on investments and income tax expense/benefit.\n\"Cash operating cost\" for a period is equal to \"cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization\" for the period less royalties, the cash component of metals inventory net realizable value adjustments and severance charges, and \"cash operating cost per ounce\" is that amount divided by the number of ounces of gold sold (excluding pre-commercial production ounces sold) during the period. We use cash operating cost per ounce as a key operating metric. We monitor this measure monthly, comparing each month's values to prior periods' values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies. We provide this measure to investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of the Company's mines. We calculate this measure for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis. Since cash operating costs do not incorporate revenues, changes in working capital and non-operating cash costs, they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Changes in numerous factors including, but not limited to, mining rates, milling rates, ore grade, gold recovery, costs of labor, consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease. We believe that these measures are similar to the measures of other gold mining companies, but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance.\n\"All-in sustaining costs\" commences with cash operating costs and then adds the cash component of metals net realizable value adjustment, royalties, sustaining capital expenditures, corporate general and administrative costs (excluding share-based compensation expenses), and accretion of rehabilitation provision. \"All-in sustaining costs per ounce\" is that amount divided by the number of ounces of gold sold (excluding pre-commercial production ounces sold) during the period. This measure seeks to represent the total costs of producing gold from current operations, and therefore it does not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions, exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects, income tax payments, interest costs or dividend payments. Consequently, this measure is not representative of all of the Company's cash expenditures. In addition, the calculation of all-in sustaining costs does not include depreciation expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods. Therefore, it is not indicative of the Company's overall profitability. Share-based compensation expenses are now also excluded from the calculation of all-in sustaining costs as the Company believes that such expenses may not be representative of the actual payout on equity and liability based awards. Share-based compensation expenses were previously included in the calculation of all-in sustaining costs. The Company has presented comparative figures to conform with the computation of all-in sustaining costs as currently calculated by the Company.\nThe Company believes that \"all-in sustaining costs\" will better meet the needs of analysts, investors and other stakeholders of the Company in understanding the costs associated with producing gold, understanding the economics of gold mining, assessing the operating performance and also the Company's ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall Company basis. Due to the capital intensive nature of the industry and the long useful lives over which these items are depreciated, there can be a disconnect between net earnings calculated in accordance with IFRS and the amount of free cash flow that is being generated by a mine.\n\"Cash provided by operations before working capital changes\" is calculated by subtracting the \"changes in working capital\" from \"net cash provided by operating activities\" as found in the statements of cash flows. \"Cash provided by operations before working capital changes per share - basic\" is \"Cash provided by operations before working capital changes\" divided by the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.\n\"Adjusted net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders\" is calculated by adjusting Net income/(loss) attributable to Golden Star shareholders for (gain)/loss on fair value of financial instruments, share-based compensation expenses, loss on conversion of 7% Convertible Debentures, severance charges and income tax recovery on previously unrecognized deferred tax assets. \"Adjusted income per share attributable to Golden Star shareholders\" for the period is \"Adjusted net income attributable to Golden Star shareholders\" divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding using the basic method of earnings per share.\nChanges in numerous factors including, but not limited to, our share price, risk free interest rates, gold prices, mining rates, milling rates, ore grade, gold recovery, costs of labor, consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease. The Company believes that these measures are similar to the measures of other gold mining companies, but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance.\nIn the current market environment for gold mining equities, many investors and analysts are more focused on the ability of gold mining companies to generate free cash flow from current operations, and consequently the Company believes these measures are useful non-IFRS operating metrics (\"non-GAAP measures\") and supplement the IFRS disclosures made by the Company. These measures are not representative of all of Golden Star's cash expenditures as they do not include income tax payments or interest costs. Non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have standardized definitions under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS.\nFor additional information regarding the Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company, please refer to the information under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the full year ended December 31, 2017, which is available at www.sedar.com .\nCautionary note regarding forward-looking information\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Golden Star.

Mitchel Wasel, BSc Geology, a \"Qualified Person\" pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\"). Mr. Wasel is Vice President Exploration for Golden Star and an active member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.\nThe technical contents of this press release have been reviewed and approved by Dr. Martin Raffield, P. Eng., a Qualified Person pursuant to NI 43-101. Dr. Raffield is Senior Vice President of Project Development and Technical Services for Golden Star.\nAdditional scientific and technical information relating to the mineral properties referenced in this news release are contained in the following current technical reports for those properties available at www.sedar.com : (i) Wassa - \"NI 43-101 Technical Report on feasibility study of the Wassa open pit mine and underground project in Ghana\", effective date December 31, 2014; (ii) Bogoso/Prestea – \"NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources and Reserves, Golden Star Resources, Bogoso/Prestea Gold Mine, Ghana\", effective date December 31, 2017.\nCautionary Note to U.S. Investors\nThis news release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ materially from the requirements of United States securities laws applicable to U.S. companies. The terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\" and \"probable mineral reserve\" are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101. These definitions differ from the definitions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") set forth in Industry Guide 7 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.\nIn addition, the terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101, however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. \"Inferred mineral resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations, however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC Industry Guide 7 standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.\nFor the above reasons, information contained in this news release or in the documents referenced herein containing descriptions of our mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/golden-star-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300641476.html\nSOURCE Golden Star Resources Ltd.",
