    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. (“The ONE Group” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: STKS), today announced the filing of a $100 million universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The new shelf registration statement will replace a similar registration statement declared effective by the SEC in May 2015.\nThe new registration statement is intended to provide The ONE Group with financial flexibility to raise capital over the next three years from the offering of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, units, rights, and debt securities, or any combination of these securities, in one or more future offerings. The new registration statement related to these securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the new registration statement becomes effective. Any offering of these securities will be made only by means of a written prospectus and an accompanying prospectus supplement relating to that offering. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nEmanuel “Manny” Hilario, Chief Executive Officer, said, “While we have no near-term identified uses for additional capital, this registration statement is part of our long-term planning to enhance financial flexibility to support our growth strategies.”\nAbout The ONE Group\nThe ONE Group (Nasdaq: STKS) is a global hospitality company that develops and operates upscale, high-energy restaurants and lounges and provides hospitality management services for hotels, casinos and other high-end venues both nationally and internationally. The ONE Group’s primary restaurant brand is STK, a modern twist on the American steakhouse concept with locations in major metropolitan cities throughout the U.S. and Europe. The ONE Group’s food and beverage hospitality services business, ONE Hospitality, provides the development, management and operations for premier restaurants and turn-key food and beverage services within high-end hotels and casinos. Additional information about The ONE Group can be found at www.togrp.com .\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For example, the statements related to the exploration of strategic alternatives and the potential results therefrom and the statements related to our strategic review of our operations targeting sources for 2018 and beyond are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “plan”, “outlook”, and “project” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, (1) our ability to open new restaurants and food and beverage locations in current and additional markets, grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with suppliers and obtain adequate supply of products and retain our key employees; (2) factors beyond our control that affect the number and timing of new restaurant openings, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory and/or licensing authorities; (3) in the case of our strategic review of operations, our ability to successfully improve performance and cost, realize the benefits of our marketing efforts, and achieve improved results as we focus on developing new management and license deals; (4) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (5) the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (6) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInvestors are referred to the most recent reports filed with the SEC by The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180522005820/en/\nInvestors:\nICR\nMichelle Michalski, 646-277-1224\nMichelle.Michalski@icrinc.com\nSource: The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc.",
