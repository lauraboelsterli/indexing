The non-GAAP financial measures include: (i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) excluding other costs, (ii) net income (loss) excluding other costs and (iii) diluted earnings (loss) per share excluding other costs. Each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain other costs and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the schedules herein. (2) Other costs primarily includes the transaction costs associated with acquisition activity, including the cost of inventory that was stepped up to fair value during purchase accounting and severance expenses which are included in operating profit (loss). For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, other costs was less than $1 million in both periods. (3) EBITDA % excluding other costs is defined as EBITDA excluding other costs divided by Revenue. (4) Other costs, net of tax, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, included a benefit of $1 million and expense of $7 million, after tax, respectively, from changes in the valuation allowance recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets. The Company has excluded the impact of a $9 million tax charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $4 million tax charge related to the write-off of a previously recognized deferred tax asset on its valuation allowance in computing net income (loss) excluding other costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018. (5) Totals may not foot due to rounding.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502005384/en/\nNOW Inc.\nDavid Cherechinsky, (281) 823-4722\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSource: NOW Inc.",
