    "text": "LAS VEGAS, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Player’s Network, Inc. (OTCQB:PNTV), a cannabis holding company, announced on May 10, 2018 that it had entered into a binding Letter Of Intent to acquire the assets of a 56,000 sq. ft., fully operational greenhouse complex in Salinas Valley, California licensed for cannabis cultivation. The transaction has now closed and will immediately begin generating significant revenue for PNTV.\nPNTV paid an initial installment of $1,000,000 in cash to LCG Business Enterprises for the acquired assets, against the full purchase price of $5,000,000. Four additional cash installments are scheduled over the next several months.\nMark Bradley stated, “It’s official! PNTV is now operating cannabis business in two states: California, the world’s largest cannabis market, and Nevada, which is quickly becoming the world’s leading Adult Use cannabis destination. PNTV now has cultivation facilities capable of generating significant revenues in two states, providing a great reward for our loyal shareholders, as we execute our plans to expand operations in both states internally and through additional acquisitions.”\nMike Gregory, General Manager and Member of LCG Business Enterprises, who has been retained under a management agreement to continue overseeing operations along with his Master Grower and cultivation team, states, “I am thrilled to work with Mark and his team to help them become one of the most successful operators in California by executing our plan to optimize the facility with additional lighting, supplementing the greenhouse’s natural sunlight during winter months, resulting in an increased yield, and generating higher profits than ever before.”\nVisit www.PlayersNetwork.com/IR to Activate Your Shareholder Account now.\nAbout Player’s Network (PNTV)\nPlayer’s Network, Inc.
