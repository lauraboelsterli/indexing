    "text": "HOUSTON, Texas, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carriage Services, Inc. (NYSE:CSV) (“Carriage Services” or the “Company”) today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $325 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 (the “notes”) through a private offering to persons who are reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A and to certain persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S, each under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”).\nThe notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of the Company, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will initially be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that is a borrower, or guarantees indebtedness, under the Company’s new credit facility.\nIn connection with the offering, the Company expects to enter into a new $150 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The new facility is expected to be undrawn at the closing of the notes offering.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the proposed offering to repay its existing indebtedness under its existing secured credit facility, and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.\nNeither the notes nor the related guarantees have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nThis news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout Carriage Services\nCarriage Services is a leading provider of deathcare services and merchandise in the United States.
