    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Copart, Inc. (NASDAQ: CPRT) today reported financial results for the quarter ended April 30, 2018.\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2018, revenue, gross profit, and net income were $478.2 million, $219.1 million, and $127.3 million, respectively. These represent an increase in revenue of $104.3 million, or 27.9%; an increase in gross profit of $46.6 million, or 27.0%; and an increase in net income of $36.8 million, or 40.6%, respectively, from the same quarter last year. Fully diluted earnings per share for the three months were $0.52 compared to $0.38 last year, an increase of 36.8%.\nFor the nine months ended April 30, 2018, revenue, gross profit, and net income were $1.4 billion, $573.9 million, and $308.1 million, respectively. These represent an increase in revenue of $287.1 million, or 26.8%; an increase in gross profit of $109.4 million, or 23.5%; and a decrease in net income of $15.8 million, or 4.9%, respectively, from the same period last year. Fully diluted earnings per share for the nine months were $1.28 compared to $1.37 last year, a decrease of 6.6%.\nThe operating results for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 were adversely affected by abnormal costs of $7.4 million and $79.7 million, respectively, incurred as a result of Hurricane Harvey. These costs included temporary storage facilities; premiums for subhaulers; labor costs incurred from overtime; travel and lodging due to the reassignment of employees to the affected region; and equipment lease expenses to handle the increased volume, as well as cost of vehicle sales. These costs, net of the associated revenues of $3.5 million and $66.9 million, respectively, generated pre-tax loss for the three months ended April 30, 2018 of $3.9 million, and a pre-tax loss of $12.8 million for the nine month period. The operating results for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 were also adversely impacted by a charge of $11.0 million to income tax expense for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and profits under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, net of deferred tax changes, and was offset by the Act’s reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate. Because Copart’s fiscal year includes periods before and after the effective date of the Act, during which the U.S. federal corporate tax rate was 35% and 21%, respectively, our U.S. federal corporate tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be 26.9%. The operating results for the nine months ended April 30, 2018, include the benefit of this rate reduction.\nExcluding the impact of income taxes on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, net of deferred tax changes, disposals of non-operating assets, foreign currency-related losses and gains, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises, non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, were $0.52 and $0.37, respectively. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, were $1.31 and $0.94, respectively. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found in the tables attached to this press release.\nOn Thursday, May 24, 2018, at 11 a.m. Eastern time, Copart will conduct a conference call to discuss the results for the quarter. The call will be webcast live and can be accessed at http://stream.conferenceamerica.com/copart052418 . A replay of the call will be available through July 23, 2018 by calling (877) 919-4059.
