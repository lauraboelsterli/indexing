    "text": "NEW YORK, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- adMarketplace , the search advertising technology company, appointed Ariff Quli as its new Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). Quli brings extensive industry experience to adMarketplace’s sales and marketing teams and a proven track record of driving growth.\nJamie Hill, adMarketplace Chief Executive Officer says, “Ariff has a strong record of innovation and sales leadership. He is a tested sales leader who has proven his ability to expand operations on a global scale.”\nQuli comes to adMarketplace with a keen understanding of commercial leadership. He has deep roots in digital media, marketing, and emerging technology platforms, and over 10 years of executive leadership expertise. At Vibrant Media, where Mr. Quli ended his tenure as President, he was responsible for spearheading growth for the company’s native contextual advertising platform and securing key advertiser and publisher partners. Most recently, Quli served as Chief Commercial Officer Americas at Blippar, where he oversaw the augmented reality (AR) technology company’s product and platform sales.\nQuli said, “adMarketplace has a strong record of consistent growth and innovation in a competitive marketplace. The team is very dedicated, and I’ve observed a lot of drive and heart in my short time here. There is a massive opportunity for our technology platform, and I’m honored and thrilled to be a part of this talented team. I’m excited to help support demand side growth, develop product solutions, and scale the business domestically and globally.”\nAdam J. Epstein, adMarketplace President and Chief Operating Officer said, “Ariff has valuable insight into user behavior and native search and knows how to convey our message to brands. We’re very excited to have him onboard.”\nQuli’s hire comes on the heels of strong employee growth across the organization, led by recruiting veteran Lonnie Klein, who rejoined adMarketplace as Vice President of Talent Acquisition in February. After his previous stint at adMarketplace, Klein ran his own executive search consultancy and previously held senior positions at boutique executive search firms, overseeing VP to C-level searches within the digital media, tech, entertainment and sports industries.\nKlein said, “Returning to adMarketplace was a no-brainer. This place is a power house – the quality of the technology and the product is unrivaled. I’m back with some of the best minds in the industry and the fast-paced collaboration is refreshing. There is endless opportunity here as we continue to grow.”\nAbout adMarketplace:\nadMarketplace connects the largest advertisers to customers searching outside of legacy search engines.
