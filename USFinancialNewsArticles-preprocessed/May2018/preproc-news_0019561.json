    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trinidad Drilling Ltd. (TSX:TDG) (“Trinidad” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce the voting results from its Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 8, 2018 (the Annual Meeting).\n1. Shareholders elected the following directors :\nDirector Votes For Votes Withheld Michael Heier 59.16% 40.84% Jim Brown 90.48% 9.52% Brian Burden 90.48% 9.52% David Halford 90.72% 9.28% Nancy Laird 90.48% 9.52% Ken Stickland 90.46% 9.54% 2. Shareholders re-appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Trinidad's auditors.\n3. Shareholders confirmed the Amended and Restated By-Law No 1 .\nVotes For Votes Against By-Law No.1 96.05% 3.95% The Amended and Restated By-Law No. 1 was approved by the board of directors of Trinidad on April 3, 2018 and confirmed by shareholders at the Annual Meeting. A copy of the Amended and Restated By-Law No. 1 can be found on Trinidad's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com .\nTrinidad has not been provided with an explanation as to why there were a significant number of votes withheld against the election of Mr. Heier, Trinidad’s Chair. However, Trinidad is aware of shareholder concerns regarding its past share price performance and is continuing to proactively take steps to enhance shareholder value. Trinidad believes that the current trading price does not reflect the value of the Company, despite improving industry fundamentals and recent steps taken to improve shareholder value. As a result, earlier in 2018, Trinidad initiated a strategic review process in an effort to enhance shareholder value. Progress is being made in this strategic process, including the recent sale of three underutilized rigs held by the Company’s Saudi Arabian joint venture. The Board is continuing to evaluate additional opportunities and is undertaking a comprehensive review of a wide range of alternatives and their potential to enhance shareholder value.\nThis strategic review process is not a reflection of the Company’s financial or operating situation. Trinidad remains in a strong financial position, generating free cash flow from its core business to fund its capital program, and has additional liquidity through its existing credit facilities. The Company has not set a definite schedule to complete this strategic review and does not intend to disclose developments unless the Board has approved a specific transaction or action plan, or decides that disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nAbout Trinidad Drilling\nTrinidad is an industry-leading contract driller, providing safe, reliable, expertly-designed equipment operated by well-trained and experienced personnel. Trinidad's drilling fleet is one of the most adaptable, technologically advanced and competitive in the industry. Trinidad provides contract drilling and related services in the US, Canada, the Middle East and Mexico.\nFor further information, please contact:\nBrent Conway\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\n403.265.6525\nLesley Bolster\nChief Financial Officer\n403.265.6525\nAdrian Lachance\nChief Operating Officer\n403.265.6525 Lisa Ottmann\nVice President, Investor Relations\n403.294.4401\nemail: investors@trinidaddrilling.com\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis news release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to Trinidad’s plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions.
