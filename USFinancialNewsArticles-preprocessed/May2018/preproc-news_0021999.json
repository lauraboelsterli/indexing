    "text": "PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - A French government spokesman said on Wednesday that EU partners would confer on the economic and business fallout of a U.S. pullout from the Iran nuclear accord and could fight any potentially harmful steps under world trade rules.\nSpeaking about Iran, Benjamin Griveaux told a weekly news briefing: “The European Union is ready to challenge at the WTO any unilateral measure that would hurt the interests of European companies and respond in a proportionate manner, in accordance of course with the rules of that international organisation.” (Reporting By Brian Love; Editing by Richard Lough)\n ",
