    "text": "WICHITA, Kan., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. [NYSE: SPR] reported first quarter 2018 financial results, announced the acquisition of Asco Industries, highlighted plans to refinance its debt, outlined plan for ASR and announced a 20 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend.\nTable 1. Summary Financial Results (unaudited)\n1st Quarter\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n2018\n2017\nChange\nRevenues\n$1,736\n$1,694\n2%\nOperating Income\n$160\n$204\n(22%)\nOperating Income as a % of Revenues\n9.2%\n12.1%\n(290) BPS\nNet Income\n$125\n$142\n(12%)\nNet Income as a % of Revenues\n7.2%\n8.4%\n(120) BPS\nEarnings Per Share (Fully Diluted)\n$1.10\n$1.17\n(6%)\nFully Diluted Weighted Avg Share Count\n114.1\n120.7\nFirst Quarter Performance\n\"During the quarter, we worked very hard to enable our customers to meet their deliveries. We incurred additional costs due to supplier disruptions, expedited freight and surge resources. To offset these items, we have put recovery plans in place which our teams are executing effectively. We are successfully transitioning into higher rates of production. We expect to be back on schedule on the 737 program by the middle of this year, at which point we expect to see overtime decline and a reduction in surge resources,\" remarked Spirit President and CEO Tom Gentile.\nFirst Quarter Announcements\nSpirit announced that on May 1, 2018, it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire S.R.I.F. N.V., the parent company of Asco Industries N.V. (Asco) for $650 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, including foreign currency adjustments. Asco is a critical supplier to OEMs and Tier-1 manufacturers with an exceptional reputation for innovation, quality and delivery.\n\"We are very excited to announce the acquisition of Asco, a world-class aerospace supplier of wing structures, mechanical assemblies, and major functional components,\" Gentile said. \"Asco is a compelling fit for Spirit that aligns extremely well with the strategic priorities that we have been communicating. Specifically, it expands our Airbus content on A320 and A350 wings, adds new defense content on the F-35, and broadens the commercial capabilities to help grow our fabrication business.\"\nThe acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and customer consents, and is expected to close in the second half of 2018. \"We expect to realize attractive cost synergies from the acquisition; the expected return on investment exceeds our internal threshold and the post-synergy EBITDA multiple* is under 8x,\" said Gentile. Financial results will not include Asco results until the acquisition is closed.\nIn addition, Spirit plans to refinance some of its existing debt as part of the deal funding to take advantage of the current interest rate environment, to lower the average cost of debt, extend maturities and align leverage to industry averages. \"Given our strong cash flow and solid balance sheet, we are able to invest heavily in our future, both organically and through strategic and financially sound acquisitions, and still have excess capital to return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends,\" remarked Gentile.\nSpirit also announced plans to execute a $725 million ASR against the remaining $925 million share repurchase authorization. \"This ASR will encompass all of the planned share repurchases for this year plus an incremental amount to take advantage of our undervalued shares and demonstrate the confidence we have in our operational outlook,\" said Gentile. In addition, the Board of Directors authorized a 20% increase in the quarterly cash dividend.\n\"The acquisition of Asco, the refinancing of our debt, the accelerated share repurchase program of $725 million and the increase in cash dividend reinforces the confidence we have in our long-term growth and cash flow generation,\" Gentile said.\nFinancial Outlook\n\"We incurred substantially higher costs in the first quarter related to supplier disruption, overtime, expedited freight and surge resources, some of which will carry over into the second quarter, as we continue to recover to schedule. We are maintaining guidance as these operational challenges are largely offset by the ASR,\" Gentile commented.\nTable 2. Financial Outlook Reaffirmed May 2, 2018\n2018 Guidance\nRevenues\n$7.1 - $7.2 billion\nEarnings Per Share (Fully Diluted)\n$6.25 - $6.50\nEffective Tax Rate\n21% - 22%\nCash from Operations\n$850 - $950 million\nFree Cash Flow*\n$550 - $600 million\nRisks applicable to our financial guidance are described more fully in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this release.\nRevenue\nSpirit's first quarter 2018 revenue was $1.7 billion, up two percent from the same period of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by higher revenue recognized on the Boeing 737 program resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 in addition to increased recurring and non-recurring activity, higher production deliveries on the Airbus A320 program and increased defense-related activity, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 777 program and lower revenue recognized on the Boeing 787 program as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. (Table 1)\nSpirit's backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $47 billion, with work packages on all commercial platforms in the Boeing and Airbus backlog.\nEarnings\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $160 million, down 22 percent compared to $204 million in the same period of 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower margin recognized on the Boeing 737 program, lower production deliveries on the Boeing 777 program and net forward losses recognized on the Boeing 787 program, partially offset by higher non-recurring activity on the Boeing 737 program. First quarter EPS was $1.10, down compared to $1.17 in the same period of 2017. (Table 1)\nCash\nCash from operations in the first quarter of 2018 was $167 million, up compared to $112 million in the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower advance repayments and timing in working capital. Free cash flow* in the first quarter of 2018 was $118 million, up compared to free cash flow* of $71 million in the same quarter last year. (Table 3)\nCash balance at the end of the quarter was $438 million. The company's $650 million revolving credit facility remained undrawn at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, Spirit repurchased 0.9 million shares for $75 million.\nTable 3.

This increase was primarily due to higher revenue recognized on the Boeing 737 program as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, higher production deliveries on the Airbus A350 program as well as increased defense work and non-recurring activity on certain Boeing programs, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 777 program and lower revenue recognized on the Boeing 787 program as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to 12.4 percent, compared to 15.9 percent during the same period of 2017, primarily due to lower margins recognized on the Boeing 737 and 777 programs in addition to net forward loss charges recognized on the Boeing 787 program related to the pension accounting change. In the first quarter of 2018, the segment recorded pretax $(4.9) million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and net forward losses of $(11.6) million.\nPropulsion Systems\nPropulsion Systems segment revenue in the first quarter of 2018 decreased 2.9 percent from the same period last year to $394.5 million, primarily driven by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 777 program and lower revenue recognized on the Boeing 787 program as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, partially offset by higher propulsion deliveries on the Boeing 737 program. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to 13.4 percent, compared to 17.7 percent during the same period of 2017, primarily due to lower margins recognized on the Boeing 737 and 777 programs. In the first quarter of 2018, the segment recorded pretax $(0.6) million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and net forward losses of $(3.4) million.\nWing Systems\nWing Systems segment revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased by 2.2 percent from the same period last year to $377.0 million. This increase was primarily due to higher wing deliveries on the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 programs, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 777 program and lower revenue recognized on the Boeing 787 program as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to 13.5 percent, compared to 15.4 percent during the same period of 2017 primarily driven by favorable changes in estimates recorded during the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, the segment recorded pretax $1.4 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and net forward losses of $(3.5) million.\nTable 4.

The non-GAAP measures we use in this report are EBITDA multiple and free cash flow. The company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Other companies may define and calculate the measure differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparison with other companies.\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company has chosen to present an estimated post-synergy EBITDA multiple related to the purchase price of Asco in order to provide investors with additional useful information. The Company considers EBITDA to be an important measure used to evaluate operating performance, and the measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry, but this figure should not be considered in isolation.\nFree cash flow is defined as GAAP cash from operations, less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation between the GAAP (Cash from Operations) and non-GAAP (Free Cash Flow) measures.\nFree Cash Flow\n($ in millions)\n1st Quarter\nGuidance\n2018\n2017\n2018\nCash from Operations\n$167\n$112\n$850 - $950\nCapital Expenditures\n(48)\n(41)\n(300 - 350)\nFree Cash Flow\n$118\n$71\n$550 - $600\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spirit-aerosystems-reports-q1-2018-financial-results-announces-acquisition-of-asco-industries-plans-debt-refinancing-announces-725-million-accelerated-share-repurchase-plan-increased-dividend-by-20-300640722.html\nSOURCE Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc.",
