    "text": "Product Innovations in Mass Cytometry and Genomics\nTotal Revenue of $25.2 million, Genomics Revenue Growth of 18 Percent\nSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fluidigm Corporation (NASDAQ:FLDM) today announced the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nTotal revenue for the first quarter was $25.2 million, a decrease of 1% from $25.5 million in the first quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 9% from $27.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $13.2 million, compared with a GAAP net loss of $17.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.3 million, compared with a $9.6 million non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2017 (see accompanying table for reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures).\n“In the first quarter of 2018, Fluidigm posted strong growth in genomics as well as increased revenue in consumables and services,” said Chris Linthwaite, President and CEO. “Overall results were in line with our expectations and reflect operating leverage as well as improvements in gross margin. Although mass cytometry instrument sales fell short of expectations, we posted double-digit mass cytometry consumables growth and pull-through that exceeded our guidance. The robust opportunity pipeline for new mass cytometry system placements bodes well for growth in 2018. Equally, our increasing sales of genomics consumables and related systems is encouraging.\n“Continued investment in research and development, a key pillar of our growth thesis, resulted in two innovative product launches early in the second quarter,” added Linthwaite. “In addition, we strengthened our balance sheet via the exchange of $150 million of outstanding convertible notes for new convertible notes with a later initial ‘put’ date of February 2023, compared to February 2021 in the prior notes, and new conversion features.\n“We believe our instruments and systems will become indispensable tools for health care decision making, and we are excited about 2018 as we execute on our strategic roadmap for mass cytometry and high-throughput and single-cell genomics.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Performance\nRevenue of $25.2 million by category:\nInstrument revenue decreased 30% to $7.5 million from $10.7 million in the year ago period. Lower revenue from mass cytometry instruments was partially offset by increased revenue from genomics instruments. Notably, instrument revenue in the prior year period benefited from the fulfillment of a substantial portion of the initial orders for the Hyperion ™ Imaging System and Hyperion Tissue Imager by early-adopting customers.\nConsumables revenue increased 23% to $13.0 million from $10.6 million in the year ago period, with growth across both mass cytometry reagents and high-throughput genomics products, partially offset by decreased revenue from single-cell genomics products.\nService revenue of $4.8 million increased 15% over the year ago period, primarily due to growth in service for mass cytometry systems globally.\nRevenue of $25.2 million by market:\nGenomics revenue, comprising instruments, consumables, and service, increased 18% to $16.3 million from $13.8 million in the prior year period. Genomics product revenue increased 22% to $13.8 million from $11.3 million in the prior year period, mainly due to increased revenue from high-throughput genomics products, partially offset by a decrease in single-cell genomics products.\nMass cytometry revenue, comprising instruments, consumables, and service, decreased 23% to $9.0 million from $11.7 million in the prior year period. Mass cytometry product revenue decreased 33% to $6.6 million from $10.0 million in the prior year period due to decreased revenue from instruments, partially offset by increased revenue from consumables. As noted above, mass cytometry revenue in the prior year period benefited from instrument orders for the Hyperion Imaging System and Hyperion Tissue Imager by early-adopting customers.\nTotal revenue by geographic area:\nGeographic Area Revenue by Geography Year-over-Year Change % of Total Revenue United States $10.1 million (15 %) 40 % Europe $8.5 million 11 % 34 % Asia-Pacific $5.9 million 19 % 23 % Other $0.7 million (33 %) 3 % Product margin:\nGAAP product margin was 50.1% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to ­­­49.1% in the year ago period. Non-GAAP product margin was 67.2% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 66.4% in the year ago period. The year-over-year increase in product margins was primarily due to lower genomics unit product costs for both instruments and consumables from higher production volumes. The increase in GAAP product margin was partially offset by fixed amortization over lower revenue in the first quarter of 2018. (See accompanying table for the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP product margins.)\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments as of March 31, 2018:\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments as of March 31, 2018, were $47.3 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2017, were $63.1 million\nOperational and Business Highlights\n$ 150 Million Convertible Debt Exchange: Fluidigm exchanged $150 million of its outstanding convertible notes for new convertible notes with a later initial “put” date and new conversion features (including a reduced conversion price and an issuer conversion option, as described in more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K). The exchange improves Fluidigm’s capital structure, providing more secure footing for strategic growth. Maxpar ® Human Immune Monitoring Panel Kit : Early in the second quarter, Fluidigm launched the Maxpar Human Immune Monitoring Panel Kit for comprehensive immune cell profiling in cancer and immune-mediated diseases. Designed for use with the Helios™ mass cytometry system, the product is offered as a proven mass cytometry workflow and marks a significant step forward in high-parameter immune profiling.\nAdvanta™ CFTR NGS Library Prep Assay : In April, the company introduced a highly efficient and scalable next-generation sequencing library prep workflow for sequencing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The product was developed for research use with the Juno™ system, and will complement the CFTR sequencing assay currently in development with Baylor Genetics.\nBrad Kreger Named SVP, Global Operations: Life sciences industry veteran Brad Kreger now leads manufacturing, supply chain, and demand planning for Fluidigm on a global basis. Kreger is charged with driving long-term changes to deliver on a strategic imperative to improve the customer experience through operational efficiencies, product quality, infrastructure, and execution. He joined the company in April.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance\nTotal revenue of $ 25 million to $28 million. GAAP operating expenses of $27 million to $28 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $24.5 million to $25.5 million excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $1.5 million and $1 million, respectively. Total cash outflow of $6 million to $7 million including $2.8 million related to the convertible debt exchange.\nConference Call Information\nFluidigm will host a conference call today, May 3, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results and operational progress.

The conference call will also be archived on the Fluidigm Investors page at http://investors.fluidigm.com/ .\nStatement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nFluidigm has presented certain financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, as well as projected for the second quarter of 2018. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, taken in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain non-cash and other expenses that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare the company’s performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans and to benchmark the company’s performance externally against competitors. Our estimates of forward-looking non-GAAP operating expenses exclude estimates for stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization; loss on disposal of property and equipment; future changes relating to developed and acquired technologies; other intangible assets; and income taxes, among other items, certain of which are presented in the table accompanying our earnings release. The time and amount of certain material items needed to estimate non-GAAP financial measures are inherently unpredictable or outside of our control. Material changes to any of these items could have a significant effect on guidance and future GAAP results. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of the company’s operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Fluidigm encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP operating results are presented in the accompanying tables of this release.\nUse of Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, among others, statements regarding anticipated growth in sales pipeline and associated growth in revenues, strategic initiatives and their anticipated benefits, including the potential for growing demand for Fluidigm products in various markets, anticipated benefits of corporate and commercial transactions and product introductions, and projected revenues, expenses, and cash flows for the second quarter of 2018.
