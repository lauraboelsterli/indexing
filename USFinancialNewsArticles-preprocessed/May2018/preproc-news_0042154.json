    "text": "14 COMMENTS Inflation has been a puzzle in the U.S. economy for years, failing to move up much when the unemployment rate tumbled.\nTo resolve the discrepancy, it helps to look at the U.S. as two economies rather than one.\nOn one hand is the goods economy, where products like computers, gasoline and hair dryers are made and purchased, and where Americans spend roughly one-third of their money. On the other hand is the services economy, where cable guys, nurses and bus drivers jostle for the bulk of consumer spending.\nThe goods economy has been transformed by trade and technological innovation over several decades, giving consumers access to inexpensive products made in foreign countries or automated factories. The services economy has been more sheltered from international competition and technological change. You can’t hire cheap Chinese labor to serve you pizza or a robot to teach your ninth-grader English.\nBecause of those differences, inflation behaves differently in the two economies.\nTale of Two Economies Service price inflation is rising as unemployment falls...\n%\n10\nUnemployment\n8\n6\n4\nService price inflation\n2\n0\n-2\n’14\n’16\n2008\n’18\n’12\n’10\n... while goods price inflation appears disconnected from the job market.\n10\n%\nUnemployment\n8\n6\n4\n2\nGoods price inflation*\n0\n-2\n’10\n’12\n’14\n’16\n2008\n’18\n*excluding food and energy\nSource: Labor Department\n“You can have technological innovations that lower the price of TVs, but our technology for, you know, haircuts doesn’t change as much,” says Michael Feroli, the chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan.\nThe divergence between goods and services price inflation is especially important now because of the unusual behavior of consumer prices.\nEconomic theory holds that as unemployment falls and labor becomes scarcer, wages and inflation should rise. But the theory—known as the Phillips curve, after 20th century economist William Phillips—hasn’t held up very well in the past decade. Since 2009, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10% to an 18-year low of 3.9% in April, yet overall inflation has remained stubbornly low, running under the Fed’s 2% target for most of the expansion.\nA number of current and former Fed officials have wondered if the Phillips curve is dead. At a Federal Open Market Committee rate-setting meeting this year, “a couple” of participants “questioned the usefulness” of the model, “citing the limited ability of such frameworks to capture the relationship between economic activity and inflation,” according to the minutes .\nLook at the two economies separately, however, and a more complete picture emerges.\nThe conventional relationship appears to be holding up in the services economy but not in the goods economy. So far in this expansion, services inflation as measured in the consumer-price index has moved up from near 0.5% to near 3%, a trend that theory suggests should happen as unemployment falls. Something different is happening in the goods economy, where prices have been falling for much of the past five years as if disconnected from the overall unemployment rate.\n“You’re going to find that (labor market) slack matters a lot more for services because they tend to be domestically produced,” Mr. Feroli said. Other factors, including the value of the dollar or commodities prices matter more for goods, he said, “because they’re globally traded.”\nAt the same time, the services economy has been the source of most U.S. job creation in this expansion, growing payrolls by 14% since 2010 to 128 million workers. Employment in the goods economy has yet to return to its precrisis levels.\nSome economists say the revival of inflation in the services economy is one reason not to lose faith in the Phillips curve just yet, and may be why the Fed has been right to raise rates even though inflation has been low.\n“Services inflation is good evidence that the Phillips curve process still works, that the domestic economy is still generating some inflation pressure,” says Eric Winograd, a senior economist at AllianceBernstein L.P . “That, I think, guided [the Fed] to begin the process of raising rates even while the official headline index had been well below their target.”\nThe Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditure price index, is now right at its goal of 2%. The Fed seeks 2% inflation as a level consistent with a healthy, growing economy.\nFalling unemployment suggests that inflation in services will continue as slack gets wrung out of the domestic economy. One challenge for the Fed: Prices for services tend to be “sticky,” meaning they’re slow to respond to changes in monetary policy or the broader economy. That means turning them around, should inflation exceed the Fed’s target, could become a challenge. Fed officials see inflation rising above 2% in their own projections.\nIf goods prices remain weak, inflation may not advance much beyond the Fed’s target. But if goods prices pick up, the Fed might be staring at an inflation overshoot for the first time in years.\nA number of factors could rouse goods prices from their slump, economists say. President Donald Trump threatened last month to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion worth of goods imported from China, the U.S.’s largest trading partner, raising fears of a trade war. Mr. Trump’s decision this month to reinstate sanctions on Iran, a major oil producer, has helped send prices for crude to the highest levels since late 2014. A depreciation in the dollar due to large fiscal deficits or other concerns could make imports more expensive.\n“That would be messy,” said Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed official and the chief economist at Standish Mellon Asset Management. “They should actually now be concerned about too much inflation because the thing that is costly to adjust (services inflation)…is already above the goal.”\nWrite to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com",
