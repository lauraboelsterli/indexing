Tennis - ATP World Tour - The BMW Open Semifinals - MTTC Iphitos, Munich, Germany - May 5, 2018 South Korea's Chung Hyeon in action during his semi final match against Germany's Alexander Zverev REUTERS/Michael Dalder\nTipped as one of the few contenders capable of beating Rafa Nadal at Roland Garros this year, Chung said in a tweet that he had also withdrawn from this week’s Lyon Open.\n“Unfortunately I had to withdraw from Lyon yesterday and now Roland Garros,” the 21-year-old said.\n“I have been struggling with an ankle injury during the entire clay season. An MRI scan has revealed that I have build up of fluid in the ankle joint which might require a small procedure and then and extended period of rest.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Ian Ransom",
