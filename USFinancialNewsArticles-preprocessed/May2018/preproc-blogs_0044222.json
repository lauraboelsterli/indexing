    "text": "In pictures: A history of royal weddings Getty Images | Samir Hussein David Reid | @cnbcdavy 1 Hour Ago\nPrince Harry , Queen Elizabeth's grandson and the sixth in line to the British throne, is due to marry American actress Meghan Markle on Saturday at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.\nCNBC takes a look back at royal weddings through the years and how they have transformed into global events. A break from tradition\nKing George VI's marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was a public affair. Crowds lined the streets as the two were married at Westminster Abbey in April 1923. It took three proposals to persuade the mother of the current reigning monarch, Elizabeth II.

However, later that year Edward abdicated the throne so he could marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson.

An estimated 200 million people listened to the Westminster Abbey ceremony on radio. Elizabeth was 21 years old. Fox Photos | Hulton Royals Collection | Getty Images TV's first royal wedding\nElizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, married Antony Armstrong-Jones in the spring of 1960. It was the first royal wedding to be broadcast on television, and more than 20 million viewers tuned in to watch it. They divorced in 1978. Getty Images | Ullstein Bild A new generation\nThirteen years after Margaret's wedding, it was the turn of a new generation as Princess Anne married Captain Mark Phillips in Westminster Abbey. The marriage was unusual in that Phillips was deemed a commoner. The couple divorced in 1992. Charles & Diana\nThe 1981 wedding of Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer attracted an estimated global TV audience of 750 million. The couple separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996. Media attention and public grief were extensive after her death in a car crash in a Paris tunnel on Aug. 31, 1997. The Duke & Duchess of York\nIn 1986, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson married at Westminster Abbey. Watching from the comfort of your own home was now well understood, and the event attracted a reported 500 million watchers. They divorced in 1996.

In a break from tradition, the ceremony was restricted to family and friends and media coverage was curtailed. Getty Images | Simmonds | AFP Charles and Camilla go round again\nPrince Charles and longtime friend Camilla Parker Bowles got married in 2005 in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall. A Service of Prayer and Dedication, which took place afterward, was covered by the BBC network. Getty Images | Rob Jefferies Another big event\nBack to Westminster in 2011 for the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. This time, it was a full-on affair with many comparisons made with Prince Charles's wedding to Princess Diana. Enter the digital age with 72 million livestreams recorded on YouTube.
