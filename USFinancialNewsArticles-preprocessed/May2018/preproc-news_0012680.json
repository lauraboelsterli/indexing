    "text": "CLEVELAND, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aleris Corporation today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/597464/ALERIS_LOGO.jpg\nFirst Quarter Summary\nNet income of $5 million compared to net loss of $35 million in the first quarter of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $54 million; up from $52 million in the first quarter of 2017 North America benefited from strong demand, improved operating performance and a favorable metal environment Higher global automotive volumes from strong Europe demand and commercial shipments from new North America automotive assets Europe unfavorably impacted by continued aerospace destocking headwinds, price pressure and a weaker U.S. dollar Asia Pacific aerospace volume growth drove improvements Liquidity of approximately $243 million as of March 31, 2018; liquidity does not include the final $20 million installment of customer capacity reservation fees received early in the second quarter of 2018\nOutlook\nSecond quarter segment income and Adjusted EBITDA expected to be meaningfully higher than the second quarter of 2017 from anticipated increases in global automotive and North America building and construction and distribution volumes, as well as favorable metal spreads Continue to expect that full year 2018 segment income and Adjusted EBITDA will be substantially higher than prior year Commercial shipments from new North America automotive assets are expected to show significant ramp up in second half of 2018 based on committed volumes Global aerospace volumes expected to benefit from higher aircraft production rates and new global, multi-year customer contracts after inventory destocking subsides, anticipated in the second half of the year European automotive volume expected to benefit from new model launches Favorable year-over-year scrap spreads expected in North America, particularly through the second quarter of 2018 A weaker U.S. dollar will negatively impact results in 2018\n\"The execution of our strategy is beginning to deliver benefits, as the multiple investments we've made to service higher value industries from strategic locations are now working in concert to drive sustainable growth,\" Sean Stack, Aleris Chairman and CEO said. \"With solid demand expected to continue in automotive, aerospace and building and construction, and our continued focus on operational excellence, we expect to deliver strong results in the second quarter and beyond.\"\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\n(Dollars in millions, metric tons in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nMetric tons of finished product shipped\n209\n198\nRevenue\n$ 802\n$ 674\nCommercial margin (1)\n$ 325\n$ 294\nSegment income\n$ 72\n$ 64\nNet income (loss)\n$ 5\n$ (35)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$ 54\n$ 52\n(1) See the attached tables for a reconciliation to the applicable GAAP measure.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nNet income was $5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss of $35 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $54 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $52 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter net income and Adjusted EBITDA were impacted by the following:\nfavorable metal spreads, resulting from increased aluminum prices, improved scrap availability in North America and strategic metal purchasing, were partially offset by lower rolling margins associated with lower contractual prices and weaker European aerospace spot market prices. Metal spread and rolling margin changes increased Adjusted EBITDA approximately $7 million; a 6 percent increase in volumes partially offset by a weaker mix of products sold increased Adjusted EBITDA approximately $3 million. The volume increase resulted from higher global automotive and North America building and construction and distribution shipments. New multi-year supply agreements and customer model launches led to the increase in automotive shipments. North America distribution volume increased as sales in the first quarter of 2017 were impacted by a strategic build of inventory in advance of the extended planned outage at our Lewisport facility. The unfavorable mix resulted primarily from a decrease in Europe aerospace shipments due to continued destocking and weaker mix of aerospace products; better European operating performance led to lower finished good inventory levels and unfavorable cost absorption, which decreased Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $5 million; a weaker U.S. dollar decreased Adjusted EBITDA approximately $3 million; and productivity improvements offset labor cost inflation as well as significantly higher freight costs.\nIn addition, net income was also favorably impacted by the following:\na $42 million favorable change in unrealized derivative gains/losses ($34 million of unrealized gains in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8 million of unrealized losses in the first quarter of 2017); a $7 million favorable variation in metal price lag ($9 million favorable in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2 million favorable in the first quarter of 2017). Metal price lag represents the difference between the price of primary aluminum included in our revenues and the price of aluminum impacting our cost of sales net of hedge gains and losses; and a $5 million decrease in the tax provision.\nThese favorable changes to net income were partially offset by:\na $9 million increase in depreciation expense, as assets related to the North America autobody sheet (\"ABS\") project at our Lewisport, Kentucky facility (the \"North America ABS Project\") were placed into service; and a $7 million increase in interest expense resulting primarily from the additional 9½% Senior Secured Notes issued in 2017 and decreased capitalized interest.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, capital expenditures were $30 million as compared to $63 million in the first quarter of 2017. Expenditures related to the North America ABS Project have declined as that project nears completion. Commercial ABS shipments commenced in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Aleris had liquidity of approximately $243 million, which consisted of approximately $158 million of availability under our ABL Facility, $79 million of cash on hand and $6 million of cash restricted for the payment of the China Loan Facility. Liquidity does not include $20 million of benefits from the final installment of customer capacity reservation fees received early in the second quarter of 2018.\nNorth America\nNorth America segment income increased to $41 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $24 million in the first quarter of 2017. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased to $34 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $23 million in the first quarter of 2017. Performance drivers for segment income and segment Adjusted EBITDA included:\nimproved rolling margins and favorable scrap spreads increased segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $11 million; a 4 percent increase in volumes increased segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $3 million. Building and construction volumes increased 7 percent as a result of favorable demand and improved operating performance. Distribution volumes increased 8 percent as prior year sales were affected by a strategic build of inventory in advance of the extended planned outage at our Lewisport facility; and wage inflation and substantially higher freight costs, partially offset by productivity gains, decreased segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $3 million.\nIn addition to the factors above, segment income was impacted by a $6 million favorable variance in metal price lag.\nEurope\nEurope segment income was $28 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $38 million in the first quarter of 2017. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $27 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2017. Performance drivers for segment income and segment Adjusted EBITDA included:\nlower rolling margins reduced segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $4 million. Rolling margins were affected by pricing pressure in the aerospace spot market as well as the contractual prices in our multi-year automotive and aerospace supply agreements; better operating performance drove successful working capital initiatives, which continued to reduce finished good inventory levels, but this activity resulted in unfavorable cost absorption of $5 million; a 28 percent increase in automotive volumes was offset by a weaker mix of aerospace products as well as a 9 percent decrease in overall aerospace volumes, decreasing segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $2 million. Aerospace volumes were affected by continued supply chain destocking and a weaker product and customer mix; productivity gains from improved operational stability and cost optimization more than offset inflation, increasing segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $2 million; and the net impact of currency changes reduced segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $1 million.\nIn addition to the factors above, segment income was impacted by a $1 million favorable variance in metal price lag.\nAsia Pacific\nAsia Pacific segment income and segment Adjusted EBITDA were $2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Performance drivers for segment income and segment Adjusted EBITDA included:\nan increase in volumes, including a 21 percent increase in aerospace shipments, increased segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $2 million; and improved productivity increased segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $1 million.\nThese increases were partially offset by the net impact of currency changes that reduced segment Adjusted EBITDA approximately $2 million.\nOutlook\nAs discussed above, we estimate that segment income and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2018 will be meaningfully higher than the second quarter of 2017 and higher than the first quarter of 2018. In addition, we continue to estimate that 2018 full year segment income and Adjusted EBITDA will be substantially higher than the prior year.\nOther Recent Developments\nOn April 6, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was implementing sanctions on various Russian individuals and companies they own and control, including United Company Rusal Plc with whom we do business through its subsidiaries. On April 23, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department issued General License 14, which extends the wind-down period and permits operations to continue with Rusal until October 23, 2018. While we expect to be able to meet our aluminum consumption requirements, we continue to evaluate the risk of temporary supply disruptions as a result of the sanctions and are evaluating alternatives, where appropriate.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nAleris will hold a conference call and webcast on May 3, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Investors, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such . We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any , whether in response to new information, futures events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes information regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, segment Adjusted EBITDA and commercial margin (collectively, the \"Non-GAAP Measures\") as performance metrics and believes these measures provide additional information commonly used by the holders of the Senior Notes and parties to our ABL Facility with respect to the ongoing performance of our underlying business activities, as well as our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital needs. In addition, EBITDA with certain adjustments is a component of certain covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Notes. Adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of metal price lag, is a component of certain financial covenants under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility. Management also uses commercial margin as a performance metric and believes that it provides useful information regarding the performance of our segments because it measures the price at which we sell our aluminum products above the hedged cost of the metal and the effects of metal price lag, thereby reflecting the value-added components of our commercial activities independent of aluminum prices which we cannot control.\nOur EBITDA calculations represent net income and loss attributable to Aleris Corporation before interest income and expense, provision for and benefit from income taxes, depreciation and amortization and income and loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding metal price lag, unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, restructuring charges, currency exchange gains and losses on debt, stock-based compensation expense, start-up costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment of amounts held in escrow related to the sale of the recycling business and certain other gains and losses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA on a per segment basis. EBITDA as defined in the indentures governing the Senior Notes also limits the amount of adjustments for cost savings, operational improvement and synergies for the purpose of determining our compliance with such covenants. Adjusted EBITDA as defined under the ABL Facility also limits the amount of adjustments for restructuring charges and requires additional adjustments be made if certain annual pension funding levels are exceeded. Commercial margin represents revenues less the hedged cost of metal and the effects of metal price lag.\nThe Non-GAAP Measures, as we use them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We calculate the Non-GAAP Financial Measures by eliminating the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and certain other items. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis. However, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not financial measurements recognized under GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use the Non-GAAP Financial Measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income and loss attributable to Aleris Corporation, operating income and loss, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or in addition to, and not as an alternative for, cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, our measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWebsite Posting\nWe use our investor website ( investor.aleris.com ) as a channel of distribution of Company information. The information we post through this channel may be deemed material. Accordingly, investors should monitor this channel, in addition to following our press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filings, and public conference calls and webcasts.
