The index was last up 0.18 percent at 92.729.\n“The general view right now is that the dollar is probably going to continue to move a bit higher against the euro in particular, maybe against the yen as well,” said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Solutions.\nThe euro could slip to 117.50 or even 115 as a support level, Hatheway said, as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy and the European economy trends weaker, he said.\n“There’s a general appreciation the Fed is going to move at least twice again this year and the consensus is shifting toward three more moves this year.”\nThe euro slid 0.27 percent to $1.1926, while the Japanese yen was little changed at 109.09 per dollar.\nVenezuelan oil exports came under threat after U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips moved to take Caribbean assets of state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award, three sources told Reuters.\nThe move could further crimp PDVSA’s declining oil output and exports.\nWidespread expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will withdraw from the Iranian nuclear pact also weighed on crude prices.\nU.S. crude rose 73 cents to $70.45 a barrel, while Brent gained $1.22 to $76.09.\nNestle rose 1.6 percent after it gained the rights to market Starbucks products around the world outside of the U.S. company’s coffee shops.\nNestle was the biggest contributor to the 0.61 percent advance in the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares. Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and Total also were among the biggest contributors.\nOn Wall Street, the S&P energy index was the biggest gainer, rising more than 2 percent, among the 11 major sectors.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 163.91 points, or 0.68 percent, to 24,426.42, the S&P 500 gained 13.78 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,677.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.01 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,274.62.\nEuro zone government bond yields slid as the unexpected fall in German industrial output was seen as encouraging the European Central Bank to prolong an unwinding of stimulus.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year German bund fell to 0.531 percent, while yields on U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.9572 percent.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Dan Grebler\nOur ",
