    "text": "SAN CLEMENTE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Glaukos Corporation (NYSE: GKOS), an ophthalmic medical technology and pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel surgical devices and sustained pharmaceutical therapies designed to transform the treatment of glaucoma, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Key highlights include:\nAchieved 12% net sales growth to $40.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $35.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Reported gross margin of approximately 86% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to approximately 86% in the first quarter of 2017. Re-affirmed 2018 net sales guidance of $160 million to $165 million.\n“Our first quarter 2018 results reflect a strong start to the year as we continue to expand globally,” said Thomas Burns, Glaukos president and chief executive officer. “We remain focused on strengthening our beachhead position in the combination-cataract segment while advancing our comprehensive pipeline of next-generation surgical devices and sustained pharmaceutical therapies for standalone glaucoma procedures.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet sales rose 12% in the first quarter of 2018 to $40.1 million, compared to $35.9 million in the same period in 2017. The growth reflected unit volume increases worldwide, a modest increase in the average selling price of iStents® sold to U.S. ASCs, and growth of the company’s direct sales operations in international markets.\nGross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately 86%, compared to approximately 86% in the same period in 2017.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 rose 25% to $38.1 million, compared to $30.4 million in the same period in 2017. The year-over-year increase reflected primarily growth in domestic sales, marketing and administrative personnel and expenses, the company’s ongoing expansion of its global direct sales infrastructure, and increased spending associated with pharmaceutical research and clinical trials.\nLoss from operations in the first quarter of 2018 was $3.7 million compared to operating income of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $2.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\n2018 Revenue Guidance\nThe company re-affirmed its 2018 net sales guidance of $160 million to $165 million.\nWebcast & Conference Call\nThe company will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast today at 1:30 p.m. PDT (4:30 p.m. EDT) to discuss the results and provide additional information about the company’s financial outlook.

The company pioneered Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery, or MIGS, to revolutionize the traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigm. Glaukos launched the iStent, its first MIGS device, in the United States in July 2012 and is leveraging its platform technology to build a comprehensive and proprietary portfolio of micro-scale injectable therapies designed to address the complete range of glaucoma disease states and progression. The company believes the iStent, measuring 1.0 mm long and 0.33 mm wide, is the smallest medical device ever approved by the FDA.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAll statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are .
