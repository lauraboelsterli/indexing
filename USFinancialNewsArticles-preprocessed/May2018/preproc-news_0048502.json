U.S. President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One to travel to New York from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, U.S., May 23, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nHis statement followed Trump’s suggestion on Tuesday that the meeting could be delayed or scrapped entirely. North Korea also threw the summit in doubt earlier this month when it pushed back against what it called “unilateral nuclear abandonment.” Reporting by James Oliphant; Writing by Makini Brice",
