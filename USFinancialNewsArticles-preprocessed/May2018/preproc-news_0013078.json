    "text": "HERNDON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Continental Building Products, Inc. (NYSE:CBPX) (the \"Company\"), a leading manufacturer of gypsum wallboard and complementary finishing products, announced today results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights of First Quarter 2018 as Compared to First Quarter 2017\nNet income increased 11.6% to $13.6 million Earnings per share increased 16.1% to $0.36 Net sales decreased 3.2% to $116.8 million on wallboard volumes down 5.4% Gross margin increased to 25.8% compared to 25.7% EBITDA 1 decreased to $31.3 million down 4.9% compared to $33.0 million Deployed $6.4 million in capital investments Deployed $14.6 million to repurchase 530,600 shares of common stock Outlook for full year 2018 unchanged\n\"We delivered higher gross margins in the first quarter while facing a challenging operating environment, including lower volumes as expected given strong pre-buy activity in advance of our January 1, 2018 price increase and poor weather for our regions. Our ability to improve gross margins while overcoming a tightening freight and labor market reflects our sharp focus on operating discipline and our low cost highly efficient assets\" stated Jay Bachmann, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Bachmann continued, \"We delivered strong quarterly earnings of $0.36 per share. In addition to the benefits of tax reform and the accretive benefit of our stock repurchase plan, we believe this is a direct result of our Bison Way continuous improvement efforts and the payback we are already receiving from high-return capital projects. As we look forward to the balance of the year, we are encouraged by the pace of wallboard demand in our markets, which supports our unchanged outlook for full year 2018. At the same time, we remain focused on deploying our strong cash flow to improve our cost position through further investments in high-return capital projects while continuing to repurchase shares as a key avenue to return value to shareholders.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results vs. First Quarter 2017\nWallboard sales volumes decreased to 615 million square feet (MMSF) for the first quarter 2018, compared to 650 MMSF in the prior year quarter. Net sales were down 3.2% to $116.8 million, compared to $120.6 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to a 5.4% decrease in wallboard volumes attributable to strong customer pre-buy activity during the fourth quarter 2017 in anticipation of a previously announced January 1, 2018 price increase, partially offset by an increase in average mill net price compared to the prior year quarter.\nOperating income was $20.8 million, compared to $21.7 million in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower wallboard volumes. SG&A expense was $9.4 million compared to $9.3 million in the prior year quarter, or 8.1% of net sales compared to 7.7% in the prior year quarter.\nInterest expense decreased 6.7% to $2.7 million, compared to $2.9 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher investment income and capitalized interest partially offset by the rise in LIBOR.\nNet income for the first quarter 2018 increased 11.6% to $13.6 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to $12.2 million, or $0.31 per share, in the prior year quarter. The $1.4 million increase in net income is primarily a result of the decrease in provision for income taxes under the new tax rates effective for 2018.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash on hand of $63.8 million and total outstanding borrowing under the term loan agreement of $270.9 million. During the first quarter 2018, the Company generated cash flows from operations of $13.7 million and deployed $6.4 million in capital investments.\nIn February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an expansion of its stock repurchase program from up to $200 million to up to $300 million. The program's expiration date was also extended from the end of 2018 to the end of 2019. During the first quarter 2018, the Company repurchased 530,600 shares of its common stock under its repurchase program at an aggregate purchase price of $14.6 million, representing 1.4% of its outstanding shares as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, against the expanded program, the Company has repurchased $117.9 million of our common stock at an average price of $21.84 per share and had a remaining capacity of $182.1 million for future repurchases.\nForward-Looking Outlook For the Full Year 2018\nSG&A is expected to be in the range of $39 - $40 million Cost of goods sold inflation per unit is expected to be at 3% to 5% partly offset by approximately $5 million of savings from high return capital projects Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $30 - $35 million Maintenance capital spending is expected to be approximately $15 million High-return capital spending is expected to be in the range of $15 - $20 million Depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of $43 - $46 million Effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22% - 24%\nInvestor Conference Webcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to review first quarter 2018 financial results, discuss recent events and conduct a question-and-answer period.

This release presents EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share as supplemental performance measures because management believes that they facilitate a comparative assessment of the Company's operating performance relative to its performance based on results under GAAP while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance and eliminate certain charges that management believes do not reflect the Company's operations and underlying operational performance. Furthermore, the Company's Board of Directors' compensation committee uses EBITDA to evaluate management's compensation. Management also believes that EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are useful to investors because they allow investors to view the business through the eyes of management and the Board of Directors, facilitating comparison of results across historical periods.\nEBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share in the same manner. EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are not measurements of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income or earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP or any other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 (unaudited, in thousands) Net income $ 13,646 $ 12,227 Adjustments:\nOther expense, net 140 644 Interest expense, net 2,720 2,916 Losses from equity method investment 364 170 Provision for income taxes 3,892 5,730 Depreciation and amortization 10,581 11,286 EBITDA - Non-GAAP measure $ 31,343 $ 32,973 EBITDA Margin - EBITDA as a percentage of net sales - Non-GAAP measure 26.8 % 27.3 % Reconciliation of Net Income and Earnings Per Share to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 (unaudited, in thousands, except share data and per share amounts) Net income - GAAP measure $ 13,646 $ 12,227 Debt related expenses, net of tax (1) — 454 Adjusted net income - Non-GAAP measure $ 13,646 $ 12,681 Earnings per share - GAAP measure $ 0.36 $ 0.31 Debt related expenses, net of tax (1) — 0.01 Adjusted earnings per share - Non-GAAP measure $ 0.36 $ 0.32 (1) Expenses related to debt repricing activities are shown net of income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
