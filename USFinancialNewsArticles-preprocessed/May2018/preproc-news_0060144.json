    "text": "QUINCY, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- J.Jill, Inc. (NYSE:JILL) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018.\nLinda Heasley, CEO of J.Jill, Inc. stated, “I am excited to have joined J.Jill at an important time in our company’s history as we plan our next phase of growth. The first quarter underscores we have work to do and we have indicators of improvement. We experienced positive comps in our retail stores. We also saw improved results from our e-commerce channel. We remain focused on initiatives to improve our overall performance and get us on track to deliver at a consistent level that is expected.”\nFor the first quarter ended May 5, 2018:\nTotal net sales for the thirteen weeks ended May 5, 2018 were $181.5 million versus $166.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017. The 9.3% increase in total net sales versus the prior year was partially driven by the calendar shift created by the fifty-third week in fiscal 2017. Total company comparable sales, which includes comparable store and direct to consumer sales, increased by 2.3%. Direct to consumer net sales represented 40.5% of total net sales, compared to 42.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit increased to $120.3 million from $115.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin was 66.3% compared to first quarter gross margin of 69.6% in fiscal 2017. SG&A was $100.3 million compared to $97.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. First quarter 2018 SG&A included $1.3 million of non-recurring expenses and $0.2 million of accelerated stock compensation expense as a result of a CEO transition. First quarter 2017 SG&A included $3.6 million of non-recurring expenses related to the Company’s initial public offering. Excluding these one-time expenses from both this year’s and last year’s figures, SG&A as a percentage of total net sales was 54.4% compared to 56.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with the decrease versus the prior year on a percentage basis partially driven by the calendar shift created by the fifty-third week in fiscal 2017. Income from operations, inclusive of non-recurring SG&A expenses, increased to $20.0 million from $18.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA * for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 1.7% to $31.5 million from $31.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As a percentage of total net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 17.4% compared to 18.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Interest expense decreased to $4.8 million from $4.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Income tax expense was $4.0 million compared to $5.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and the effective tax rate was 26.1% compared to 41.1% in the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.26 including the impact of one-time expenses, compared to $0.18 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. First quarter fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share included approximately $0.03 benefit from the calendar shift created by the fifty-third week in fiscal 2017, and $0.05 benefit from the lower tax rate in fiscal 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share * for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which includes the benefit of the calendar shift described above and excludes non-recurring expenses and other one-time items, including CEO transition expenses, affecting diluted earnings per share, were $0.29 compared to $0.24 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share uses 26% and 40% tax rate assumptions in fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively. The lower tax rate assumption in 2018, resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, results in a benefit of $0.05 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe Company ended the first quarter fiscal 2018 with $28.7 million in cash. Inventory at the end of the first quarter fiscal 2018 increased to $77.5 million compared to $73.6 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company closed three stores in the first quarter and ended the quarter with 273 stores.\n* Non-GAAP financial measures. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income” for more information.\nOutlook\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects total comparable sales to be flat to positive low single digits. Total net sales are expected to be negative low single digits to flat as a result of the shifted 2018 calendar, following the fifty-three week fiscal year in 2017, that shifted sales from the second quarter to the first quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24, including a $0.04 benefit from a lower tax rate, and a $0.03 negative impact related to the calendar shift. This is compared to $0.28 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $0.29 which excludes the $0.01 negative impact from non-recurring expenses related to the transition to a public company as well as costs associated with the Company’s initial public offering.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss first quarter fiscal 2018 results is scheduled for today, May 31, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

The information included on our website is not incorporated by reference herein.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we use the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance:\nAdjusted EBITDA, which represents net income (loss) plus interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense, write-off of property and equipment, and other non-recurring expenses and one-time items. We present Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis because management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance of our business and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations. Further, we recognize Adjusted EBITDA as a commonly used measure in determining business value and as such, use it internally to report results. Adjusted Net Income, which represents net income (loss) plus other non-recurring expenses and one-time items. We present Adjusted Net Income on a consolidated basis because management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. Adjusted Earnings per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Adjusted EPS is presented as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period.\nWhile we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS are useful in evaluating our business, they are non-GAAP financial measures that have limitations as analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered alternatives to, or substitutes for, net income (loss) or EPS, which are calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of such non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. We recommend that you review the reconciliation and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS to net income (loss) and EPS, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, under “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income” and not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains, and oral statements made from time to time by our representatives may contain, “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements include statements under “Outlook” and other statements identified by words such as “could,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “continues,” “projects” and similar references to future periods, or by the inclusion of forecasts or projections.
