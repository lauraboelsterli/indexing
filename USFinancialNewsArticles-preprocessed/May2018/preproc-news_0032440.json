May 5, 2018; Cleveland, OH, USA; Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue during the second half against the Toronto Raptors in game three of the second round of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Quicken Loans Arena. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n“They’re playing tougher than we are,’ Lue said of the physicality in the series. “We see that. They’re being physical, they’re gooning the game up and we gotta do the same thing.”\nLue made the comments after Tuesday night’s Game 2, a 107-94 Celtics win.\nThe Celtics didn’t seem to mind Lue’s assessment.\nBoston forward Marcus Morris, who has frequently drawn the assignment of guarding LeBron James, somewhat agreed.\n“Gooning? That’s a good word,” Morris said. “(Expletive) we’re doing what it takes. Whatever it takes, every player, 1 to 15, whatever it takes, that’s what we’re doing. You call it what you want to call it. We’re just trying to get the win.”\n“I don’t even know what to say to that,” said Jaylen Brown of Lue’s comment. “I agree, I guess.”\nOddly enough, it’s Cleveland guard JR Smith who drew criticism for borderline dirty play. Marcus Morris (13) defends Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyle Korver (26) during the third quarter in Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY Sports\nTensions boiled over when Smith shoved Boston forward Al Horford on a drive to the basket. and\nSmith received a flagrant-1 for the play and admitted afterward it was justified, but maintained it wasn’t meant to hurt Horford.\n“It was a good call,” he said.\nBoston’s Marcus Smart saw it differently.\nGame 3 is Saturday night at 8:30 p.m. in Cleveland and Lue says the Cavaliers need to be ready to get physical.\n“We’ve got to come out swinging,” Lue said. “We’ve got to be aggressive. I think we’ve got to be physical, and we’ve got to have a physical mindset, you know, that they’re coming in, playing tough. They’re aggressive, and we’ve got to match that.”\n—Field Level Media",
