Since retiring from professional basketball in 2011 after a 19-year career, the all-star has taken on a number of business ventures. On Tuesday he participated in BTIG's 16th annual charity day in New York City. Published 2:39 PM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 Updated 7:03 AM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 CNBC.com\nShaquille O'Neal may be most famous for his prowess on the court, but the NBA hall-of-famer also knows a thing or two about money.\nAnd the basketball all-star's top piece of financial advice?\nSave 50% -- immediately. Isaiah Trickey | FilmMagic | Getty Images Shaquille O'Neal\nOn Tuesday's \"Halftime Report\" he said the most important financial rule for young people should be to save half of their paycheck right away.\nBut that's not all. He went on to say that the truly smart individuals -- the people who become billionaires -- will put away 75% of their income for retirement.\nThe remaining 25% can then be used to \"have fun.\"\nIn the words of Shaq -- \"to buy houses, planes, cars, you want to travel? [It's for] having fun.\" show chapters 1:11 PM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 | 07:42\nShaquille O'Neal has been as successful in the business world off the court as he was while on the court.\nSince retiring from his 19-year professional basketball career O'Neal has taken on a number of business ventures -- from owning restaurant and gym franchises, to opening nightclubs, to most recently becoming the face of JCPenney's \"Big & Tall\" business.\nShaquille O'Neal was one of the special guests at BTIG's annual charity day, where celebrities, business titans, and athletes buy \"honorary\" shares on BTIG's trading desk -- all in the name of charity.\nSince the event started 15 years ago, more than $45 million has been raised for a number of charities around the globe.
