Defense budgets in many of our target markets remain strong. We also continue to see good revenue diversification, based both on our geographic spread as well as by areas of operation. These factors support the potential for top line growth in both the short and the long term.\"\nContinued Mr. Machlis , \"Our continued organic growth, combined with our strategy of acquiring synergistic related businesses, support our position as an increasingly competitive global provider of technologically advanced defense and homeland security solutions.\"\nFirst quarter 2018 results :\nRevenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $818.5 million, as compared to $749.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The growth in revenues in the first quarter of 2018 was driven by sales from the increased backlog and by the adoption of the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard.\nNon-GAAP (*) gross profit amounted to $239.8 million (29.3% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $226.8 million (30.3% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.

GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2018 was $63.3 million (7.7% of revenues), as compared to $58.2 million (7.8% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancial expenses, net were $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nTaxes on income were $6.4 million (effective tax rate of 12.0%) in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $5.3 million (effective tax rate of 10.6%) in the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate is affected by the mix of the tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company's entities generate taxable income .\nEquity in net earnings of affiliated companies and partnerships was $3.1 million (0.4% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $1.6 million (0.2% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests was $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP (*) net income attributable to the Company's shareholders in the first quarter of 2018 was $54.9 million (6.7% of revenues), as compared to $51.7 million (6.9% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $49.6 million (6.1% of revenues), as compared to $45.6 million (6.1% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP (*) diluted net earnings per share attributable to the Company's shareholders were $1.28 for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $1.21 for the first quarter of 2017. GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 were $1.16, as compared to $1.07 for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company's backlog of orders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $8,046 million, as compared to $7,067 million as of March 31, 2017. Approximately 74% of the current backlog is attributable to orders from outside Israel. Approximately 60% of the current backlog is scheduled to be performed during 2018 and 2019.\nOperating cash flow used in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $147.9 million, as compared to $51.3 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nAccounting Policies Update :\nThe Company adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach. Financial results for reporting periods during 2018 are presented in compliance with ASC 606. Historical financial results for the reporting periods prior to 2018 are presented in conformity with amounts previously disclosed under the prior revenue recognition standard, ASC 605. The adoption of ASC 606 primarily impact the Company's contracts where revenue was recognized using the percentage of completion units of delivery method, which under ASC 606 can be recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to the customer over the performance period for contracts recognized over time. As a result, the adoption of ASC 606 influenced part of the revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe cumulative effects of the transition to ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, resulted in the following main adjustments: a $0.1 million increase in retained earnings, a decrease in inventories of approximately $81.9 million, an increase in contract assets (unbilled receivables) of approximately $78.8 million and a net decrease in customer advances and other contract liabilities and deferred tax assets in the aggregate amount of approximately $3.2 million.\nAccording to ASC 606, customer advances are no longer deducted from inventories. Accordingly, on January 1, 2018, the open balances of inventories net and customer advances were grossed up in the amount of approximately $87 million.\n* Non-GAAP financial data :\nThe following non-GAAP financial data is presented to enable investors to have additional information on the Company's business performance as well as a further basis for periodical comparisons and trends relating to the Company's financial results. The Company believes such data provides useful information to investors by facilitating more meaningful comparisons of the Company's financial results over time. Such non-GAAP information is used by the Company's management to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate the Company's current performance. However, investors are cautioned that, unlike financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP measures may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial data includes reconciliation adjustments regarding non-GAAP gross profit, operating income, net income and diluted EPS. In arriving at non-GAAP presentations, companies generally factor out items such as those that have a non-recurring impact on the income statements, various non-cash items, significant effects of retroactive tax legislation and changes in accounting guidance and other items, which in management's judgment, are items that are considered to be outside of the review of core operating results.\nIn the Company's non-GAAP presentation, the Company made certain adjustments, as indicated in the table below.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Company believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP (Unaudited) Supplemental Financial Data:\n(US Dollars in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n2017\nGAAP gross profit\n$\n235.4\n$\n221.2\n$\n997.9\nAdjustments:\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n4.4\n5.6\n22.2\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n$\n239.8\n$\n226.8\n$\n1,020.1\nPercent of revenues\n29.3\n%\n30.3\n%\n30.2\n%\nGAAP operating income\n$\n63.3\n$\n58.2\n$\n319.3\nAdjustments:\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n6.1\n7.3\n28.6\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n69.4\n$\n65.5\n$\n347.9\nPercent of revenues\n8.5\n%\n8.7\n%\n10.3\n%\nGAAP net income attributable to Elbit Systems' shareholders\n$\n49.6\n$\n45.6\n$\n239.1\nAdjustments:\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n6.1\n7.3\n28.6\nRelated tax benefits\n(0.8)\n(1.2)\n6.2\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Elbit Systems' shareholders\n$\n54.9\n$\n51.7\n$\n273.9\nPercent of revenues\n6.7\n%\n6.9\n%\n8.1\n%\nGAAP diluted net EPS\n$\n1.16\n$\n1.07\n$\n5.59\nAdjustments, net\n0.12\n0.14\n0.82\nNon-GAAP diluted net EPS\n$\n1.28\n$\n1.21\n$\n6.41\nRecent Events :\nOn April 11, 2018, the Company announced that it completed the acquisition of the assets and operations of the privately-owned U.S. company Universal Avionics Systems Corporation for a purchase price of approximately $120 million.\nDividend :\nThe Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.44 per share for the first quarter of 2018.
