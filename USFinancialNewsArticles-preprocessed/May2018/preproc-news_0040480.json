    "text": "As a group, Americans have shockingly little saved for retirement.\nNorthwestern Mutual's 2018 Planning & Progress Study , which surveyed 2,003 adults, found that 21 percent of Americans have nothing saved at all for their golden years, and a third of Americans have less than $5,000. To put that into perspective, it means that 31 percent of U.S. adults could last only a few months on their savings if they had to retire tomorrow.\nThat's probably why an increasing number of Americans say they'll rely on Social Security payouts,",
