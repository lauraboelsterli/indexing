    "text": "LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - * A first-of-its-kind liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant developed by Golar LNG off Cameroon has exported its inaugural cargo, according to trade sources and shipping data * Successful start-up is a crucial test for Golar, which aims to roll out similar plants in Equatorial Guinea with Ophir Energy and in Senegal-Mauritania with BP * The first shipment was exported by Gazprom Marketing and Trading (GMT) - which bought the entire output of the Cameroon project for eight years - using the Galicia Spirit tanker on Thursday, shipping data shows * First LNG was initially due in the second half of last year before being pushed back to late April this year * In early May the tanker docked and filled up with 38,000 cubic metres of LNG, before taking another 100,000 cubic metres on May 14, according to market intelligence firm Kpler * GMT said it had chartered two LNG vessels to haul supply from the plant * The Golar Maria tanker is converging on Cameroon to load the plantâ€™s second cargo, according to trade sources and shipping data.\nReporting by Oleg Vukmanovic; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ",
