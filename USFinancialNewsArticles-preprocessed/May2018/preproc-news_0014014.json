    "text": "9 COMMENTS My mother is about to turn 80, and I’m increasingly worried about her ability to manage her money. My family and I are trying to figure out when and how to take on this responsibility, or at least provide some help. Have you written about this? Any advice?\nThis is a tricky subject, to say the least, and one that many of us are, or will be, grappling with. A recent study by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave found that 92% of caregivers provide some type of “financial caregiving”: paying bills on behalf of a family member, handling insurance claims, filing taxes, etc.\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com\nAs for “when,” I would broach this topic as soon as possible. If anything, many families are too slow to act. Denial plays a big part in this. Older parents, hoping to stay independent, are quick to minimize difficulties; adult children, reluctant to meddle, may ignore red flags. (And few families, of course, enjoy talking about money.) As such…everyone waits. But the consequences of waiting can be dire: closed accounts, damaged credit, money lost to scam artists—even foreclosure.\nThe simplest approach is usually the best: pointing out to your mother that all of us, as we age, need help, whether it’s yard work or home repairs or transportation. And household finances are no exception. I began talking with my mother when she was in her early 70s (and still in good health) about the importance of having a family member on “standby”—someone who knew about her bills, credit cards, insurance, investments, etc.; someone who had access to her accounts in an emergency; and someone who could step in if she needed help. Fortunately, she agreed.\nWe already had her estate plans in order, and I had power of attorney. But we took two additional steps: We added my name to her checking account, and I filled out a separate set of power-of-attorney forms with the custodian of her individual retirement account, her biggest asset. (Many financial institutions have—and require that you complete—their own documents if you wish to give, say, your spouse or an adult child access to an account.) The latter proved to be invaluable when my mother suffered a stroke and I needed to tap her IRA quickly to help pay for long-term care.\nRelated The Difficult, Delicate Untangling of Our Parents’ Financial Lives For anyone acting as a financial caregiver, the following resources are invaluable:\nThe federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers four guides titled “Managing Someone Else’s Money.” Each guide is tailored to individuals in a specific role: people named agents under a power of attorney; court-appointed guardians; trustees; and government fiduciaries (appointed, for instance, to manage Social Security or veterans’ benefits). The four booklets walk caregivers through their duties, tell them how to watch for scams and financial exploitation, and suggest where to turn for additional help. Go to consumerfinance.gov .\nA Helping Hand Financial caregivers, asked to identify the primary reasons that care recipients needed help with financial management, said: Didn’t know enough about the subject\n39%\n21%\nStarted having trouble paying bills or\nhandling other financial matters\nPhysical limitations\n18%\nCognitive issues\n16%\n15%\nFrailty\nMajor medical conditions\n15%\nRecent surgery\n13%\nMental illness\n8%\nFraud\n4%\nSource: AARP Public Policy Institute, 'Family Financial Caregiving: Rewards, Stresses, and Responsibilities'\nThe National Caregivers Library has a half-dozen articles that cover almost every part of financial caregiving—including how best to approach a family member about this topic. Go to caregiverslibrary.org and, under Caregivers Resources, click on: Money Matters.\nAn AARP study—“Family Financial Caregiving: Rewards, Stresses, and Responsibilities”—looks at the challenges involved in helping someone manage her/his money. And there are challenges. (Example: navigating the health-insurance system.) Go to aarp.org and search for: family financial caregiving.\nIf the person who needs help is at some distance from you, you might want to hire a daily money manager. These professionals can sit with a person at home and help pay bills, balance checkbooks and file medical claims, among other tasks. Start with the American Association of Daily Money Managers ( aadmm.com ). Be sure the manager you choose is insured, bonded and willing to include other family members in his or her work.\n*** I understand I can delay required minimum distributions from a 401(k) if I am still working at the firm holding the 401(k). What does “still working” mean? If I have retired—but exercise nonqualified stock options and receive a W-2 for this exercise at the end of the calendar year—does that mean I don’t need to take the RMD?\nSorry, you will need to take the RMD.\nTo take a step back, you are correct: Employees who are older than 70½—the age when RMDs would otherwise begin—can delay those withdrawals from their company savings plan until April 1 of the year after they retire. (Note: This exception does not apply to IRAs or to savings plans of companies you are no longer working for.)\nActually, the words “still working” aren’t included in the tax code, notes Ed Slott, an IRA expert in Rockville Centre, N.Y. Rather, the code refers to, and focuses on, when an employee “retires.” In this case, you clearly state that you have “retired” from your firm—that you are no longer employed there—and that’s what the Internal Revenue Service cares about.\nPREVIOUSLY IN ASK ENCORE Don’t Stop Saving Just Because You’ve Retired (April 2018) Beyond the ‘70/80’ Rule: How Much Do You Really Need in Retirement? (March 2018) Questions to Ask When Picking a Financial Adviser (March 2018) How to Compare the Cost of Living in Different Cities (February 2018) The Biggest Estate-Plan Mistake: Losing It (February 2018) “It’s the employer-employee relationship, even if it is minimal or piecemeal, that is the key factor here, not simply receiving a W-2 form,” Mr. Slott says. “Yes, the stock option indicates there was an employment relationship at some point. But if that relationship clearly ended, and all the person is doing is exercising stock options, that is not ‘still working.’ ”\n*** I am 71½ and took Social Security at my full retirement age. My wife will be 61 in August, and we’re wondering what her options are for collecting benefits when she reaches age 62. Can she collect a percentage of my benefit at 62 and wait to collect her full benefit at age 66½ or 67?\nA simple approach is usually best when adult children need to do ‘that talk’ about taking over the finances of aging parents. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images No, she can’t do that.\nWe receive this question frequently, and it’s worth highlighting from time to time. If a wife (or a husband; the rules apply equally) applies for Social Security, she is “deemed,” in the eyes of the Social Security Administration, to have filed for both benefits: the one based on her earnings history and a spousal benefit. (Note: This assumes the husband is already collecting Social Security.) She will receive the larger of the two figures—and be locked into that benefit going forward.\nSo, your wife, whether she files for Social Security at 62 or any point thereafter, will not be able “switch” benefits in the future. Of course, in making this decision, you still need to consider the size of her payout. A retirement benefit or spousal benefit at age 62 will be significantly smaller than a benefit first claimed at full retirement age.\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal.
