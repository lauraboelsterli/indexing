    "text": "Washington, D.C., May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors has chosen the members of its new Local Chamber Ad Hoc Committee, who will be tasked with implementing the new process for selecting six (6) new seats on the USHCC Board of Directors. These new seats will represent the full breadth of the organizationâ€™s national reach, hailing from major regions of the United States. Following a successful 2018 USHCC Legislative Summit and a listening campaign from local chamber leaders around the country, the USHCC instituted organizational governance changes to ensure that its leadership adequately and accurately reflects its vast and diverse network. The members of the committee include:\nLea Marquez Peterson - President & CEO Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Gil Vazquez - Chairman Los Angeles Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Ramiro Cavazos - President & CEO San Antonio Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Mayra Pineda - President & CEO Louisiana Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Omar Duque - President & CEO Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Jennifer Rodriguez - President & CEO Philadelphia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce\nThese individuals are committed to transparency, fairness, and open debate as the selection process unfolds. The committee, in conjunction with current Board members, is expected to make its announcement on new members of the Board of Directors no later than September 2018. This latest move by the USHCC is part of a larger structural change which saw it add a Co-Chair to the Board of Directors, Carmen Castillo, who will join Co-Chair Peter Villegas in bringing the organization into a new era of advocating for Hispanic-business owners nationwide.\nAbout the USHCC\nThe USHCC actively promotes the economic growth, development and interests of more than 4.37 million Hispanic-owned businesses, that combined, contribute over $700 billion to the American economy every year. It also advocates on behalf of 260 major American corporations and serves as the umbrella organization for more than 200 local chambers and business associations nationwide.
