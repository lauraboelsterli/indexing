    "text": "The St. Louis Cardinals cobbled together three runs in the eighth inning on Sunday for a 6-4 win over the host Pittsburgh Pirates.\nSt. Louis won two of three to take the series against the Pirates, who blew a three-run lead and have lost seven of their past nine.\nPittsburgh led 4-3 entering the eighth. Against Michael Feliz (0-2), Jose Martinez singled, and Tommy Pham and Marcell Ozuna walked to load the bases. Tyler O’Neill struck out, and Feliz gave way to closer Felipe Vazquez.\nMartinez scored on pinch-hitter Harrison Bader’s single to short left to tie it, and Yairo Munoz drew a four-pitch walk to give the Cardinals a 5-4 lead. Ozuna scored on Tyler Kelly’s fielder’s choice.\nSt. Louis starter Miles Mikolas gave up four runs and five hits in six innings, with five strikeouts and no walks. The comeback kept him from picking up his first loss.\nSam Tuivailala (1-0) pitched a 1-2-3 seventh. Bud Norris pitched a perfect ninth for his 11th save.\nPittsburgh starter Jameson Taillon allowed three runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings, with six strikeouts and one walk. He has not gotten a win since April 8.\nCarpenter doubled and later scored on Ozuna’s infield single for a 1-0 Cardinals lead in the first.\nPittsburgh tied it in the fourth. Austin Meadows led off with a base hit, stole second, moved to third on Josh Bell’s fly out, and scored on Colin Moran’s single.\nIn the fifth, the Pirates took a 4-1 lead on Adam Frazier’s two-run triple to left-center and Meadows’ sacrifice fly RBI.\nSt. Louis pulled within a run and chased Taillon in the seventh. Kolten Wong got an infield hit off Taillon’s glove and moved to second on Munoz’s single.\nEdgar Santana relieved Taillon, and his first delivery was a wild pitch that allowed the runners to move to second and third. An out later, pinch hitter Jedd Gyorko dropped a two-run single into left to make it 4-3.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
