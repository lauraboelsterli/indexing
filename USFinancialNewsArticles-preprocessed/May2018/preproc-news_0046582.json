    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) today announced that its board of directors declared a 2018 second quarter dividend of eighteen cents ($0.18) a share on the company’s common stock payable June 27, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 6, 2018.\nHalliburton stockholders elected all twelve nominees to the board of directors and ratified the selection of KPMG LLP as principal independent public accountants for 2018 at its annual meeting of stockholders held in Houston, Texas, on May 16, 2018. The advisory resolution on executive compensation was not approved by the stockholders.\nStockholders elected board members Abdulaziz F. Al Khayyal, William E. Albrecht, Alan M. Bennett, James R. Boyd, Milton Carroll, Nance K. Dicciani, Murry S. Gerber, José C. Grubisich, David J. Lesar, Robert A. Malone, Jeffrey A. Miller, and Debra L. Reed.\nWe are disappointed that our advisory resolution on executive compensation did not pass this year, but look forward to continuing our active engagement with our stockholders concerning our compensation program and other matters. Our Board of Directors has structured our program to align executive compensation with the creation of shareholder returns, which have exceeded our peers over the last one, three and five year periods and to attract, motivate, and retain executives which is especially important during a CEO transition period. This is the first time our annual executive compensation proposal has not passed.\nFounded in 1919, Halliburton is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. With over 55,000 employees, representing 140 nationalities and operations in approximately 80 countries, the company serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production through the life of the field.
