    "text": "Fiscal Second Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nRevenues of $7.9 million, an increase of 37% compared to the fiscal second quarter of 2017 Gross profit of $4.0 million, a 38% improvement over the fiscal second quarter of 2017 Operating income of $0.6 million, an increase of 39% compared to the fiscal second quarter of 2017\nSAN DIEGO, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LRAD Corporation (NASDAQ:LRAD), a global leader in acoustic hailing devices (“AHDs”), advanced mass notification (“MN”) systems and distributed recipient solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal second quarter\nFiscal Second Quarter 2018 Financial Summary\nRevenues : Fiscal second quarter 2018 revenues totaled $7.9 million, representing a 37% increase over the $5.7 million reported in the fiscal second quarter of 2017.\n• The revenue increase was driven primarily by a near 100% increase in AHD sales.\n• The Company's Americas sales region accounted for 64% of the total quarterly revenues.\nNet Income : The Company reported net income of $461,000, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share during the quarter, compared with net income of $298,000, or $0.01 per share, during the fiscal second quarter of 2017.\n• The increase in net income during the second fiscal quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the higher gross profits realized from increased sales, and a lower effective tax rate.\n• Non-cash income tax expense of $158,000 and $169,000 was recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nSix Months Ended March 31, 2018 Financial Summary\nRevenues : Revenues increased 79% for the six months ended March 31, 2018 to $15.5 million from $8.7 million reported during the same period in fiscal 2017. The increase was driven primarily by stronger domestic AHD sales.\nNet Loss : For the six months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of $1.2 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $514,000, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, reported during the same period in fiscal 2017.\n• The net loss was higher in the first half of fiscal 2018 as a result of a non-cash $2.5 million remeasurement of the Company’s Federal net deferred tax assets at the new lower statutory rate taken in the fiscal first quarter.\n• Excluding the non-cash adjustment to the Company’s Federal net deferred tax asset, the Company would have reported net income for the six months ended March 31, 2018 equal to $1.3 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share.\nOperating Income : Income from operations totaled $1.6 million in the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a loss from operations of $894,000 in the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nBalance Sheet : Cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.7 million at March 31, 2018, a slight decline from $12.8 million reported at September 30, 2017.\n• The cash position declined primarily due to the $2.6 million of net cash utilized to fund the acquisition of Genasys Holdings, S.L. (“Genasys”), which was offset by positive cash generated from operations of $2.8 million.\n• Working capital totaled $23.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $25.4 million at September 30, 2017. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to the purchase price paid and debt assumed in the acquisition of Genasys.\n• Total debt increased to $1.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $0 at September 30, 2017.\n“The Company's first acquisition highlighted our fiscal second quarter,” remarked Richard S. Danforth, Chief Executive Officer of LRAD Corporation. “The January 2018 purchase of Genasys puts LRAD in a stronger position to compete for large mass notification opportunities by offering fully integrated, customizable, one-stop, turnkey solutions for both hardware and software systems. Additionally, in the first six months of fiscal 2018, AHD revenues more than doubled, driven by orders from the U.S. Government and Military.”\nSelect Operating and Business Highlights\nAcquired Genasys Holding S.L., a leading software provider of advanced location-based mass messaging solutions for emergency warning systems and workforce management. Received $895,000 in follow-on AHD orders for public safety in the Asia Pacific region. Announced over $1.0 million in AHD orders for defense, public safety, and off-shore security from Southeast Asia. Received a $1.0 million AHD order from an international defense department. Announced $1.0 million in orders for AHDs, accessories, and spare parts from the U.S. Military and U.S. State Department.\n“Compared to the first half of fiscal 2017, AHD revenues more than doubled in the first six months of fiscal 2018 and MN revenues grew by 10%,” continued Danforth. “With bookings up 24% over the same period last year, a robust pipeline and strong backlog, the Company is well-positioned for significant fiscal year-over-year revenue growth.”\nWe include in this press release Non-GAAP operational metrics of bookings and backlog, which we believe provide helpful information to investors with respect to evaluating the Company’s performance. We consider bookings and backlog leading indicators of future revenues and use these metrics to support production planning. Bookings is an internal, operational metric that measures the total dollar value of customer purchase orders executed in a period, regardless of the timing of the related revenue recognition. Backlog is a measure of purchase orders received that have not been shipped but are planned to ship within the next 12 months.\nWebcast and Conference Call Details\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss fiscal second quarter 2018 financial results this afternoon at 4:30 p.m. E.T.
