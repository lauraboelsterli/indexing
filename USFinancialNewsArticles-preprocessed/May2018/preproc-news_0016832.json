According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of 2017 pay for S&P 500 leaders, median pay reached $12.1 million.\nThat's \"a new post-recession high,\" the WSJ reports, and \"most S&P 500 CEOs received raises of 9.7 percent or better last year.\"\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan topped the list of highest-paid leaders with a total compensation package of $103.2 million. The next CEO on the list, Les Moonves of CBS , took home $69.3 million in 2017.\nHere how much the five highest-paid CEOs of 2017 earned last year and the year before.\n5. Stephen Kaufer, TripAdvisor 2016 salary: $1.2 million\n2017 salary: $47.9 million\nPay change: +3787 percent\n4. Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner 2016 salary: $32.6 million\n2017 salary: $49.0 million\nPay change: +50.2 percent\n3. W. Nicholas Howley, TransDigm 2016 salary: $18.9 million\n2017 salary: $61.0 million\nPay change: +223 percent\n2. Leslie Moonves, CBS 2016 salary: $69.6 million\n2017 salary: $69.3 million\nPay change: -0.3 percent\n1. Hock Tan, Broadcom 2016 salary: $24.7 million\n2017 salary: $103.2 million\nPay change: +318 percent\nOf the S&P 500 leaders in 2017, only 25 were women, down from 26 in 2016. Female CEOs on the list \"tended to make more than men, with half earning at least $14 million,\" the WSJ reports.\nStill, when comparing the top paid women with the top paid men, the difference is significant: The highest-paid female CEO of 2017, Margaret Georgiadis, who ran Mattel from February 2017 to April 2018, earned $31.3 million. That's one-third of what Tan made in 2017. Next in line was Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, who earned $31.1 million, which is less than half of what Moonves made.\nshow chapters Explaining the gender wage gap 12:42 PM ET Thu, 3 Sept 2015 | 01:47 Among companies in general, not just those in the S&P 500, the CEO wage gap actually favors men . The Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR) found that, for full-time chief executives, women's earnings were 79.5 percent of men's. Women CEOs' median weekly earnings were $1,920, compared to men's median weekly earnings of $2,415.\nAs for the lowest-paid leaders, 26 CEOs in the S&P 500 made $5 million or less in 2017, including Warren Buffett, who earned a modest salary of $100,000 in 2017 and Larry Page, who accepts only $1 a year in official compensation .\nLike this story?
