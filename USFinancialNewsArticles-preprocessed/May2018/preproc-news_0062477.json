    "text": "SEOUL, May 28 (Reuters) - South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in said on Monday there could be more impromptu talks with North Korea including summits between pre-arranged dialogue.\nMoon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a surprise meeting on Saturday at the border village of Panmunjom, during which they agreed that a North Korea-U.S. summit must be held.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last week pulled out of a meeting with Kim, planned for June 12 in Singapore, before floating its reinstatement.\n“What’s more important than anything from the latest inter-Korean summit was that the leaders easily got in contact, easily made an appointment and easily met to discuss urgent matters, without complicated procedures and formalities, just like a casual meeting,” Moon told a meeting with senior secretaries.\n“If we could hold working-level, back-to-back talks on both sides of Panmunjom if urgently necessary in addition to formal summits, it would expedite faster advancement of inter-Korean relations.” (Reporting by Hyonhee Shin Editing by Lincoln Feast)\n ",
