Net loss attributable to Wheeler's common stock, $0.01 par value per share (\"Common Stock\") shareholders of $5.0 million, or $(0.57) per share. Total revenue from continuing operations increased by 13.9% or $2.0 million. Net Operating Income (\"NOI\") from continuing operations increased by 19.6% to approximately $11.6 million. Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\") of $0.21 per share of the Company's Common Stock and common unit (\"Common Unit\") in our operating partnership, Wheeler REIT, L.P. Sold the Chipotle ground lease at Conyers Crossing for a contract price of $1.3 million, resulting in a $1.1 million gain and net proceeds of $1.2 million.\nBALANCE SHEET\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $5.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $3.7 million at December 31, 2017. Total debt was $379.1 million at March 31, 2018 (including debt associated with assets held for sale), compared to $313.8 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in debt is primarily a result of $65.4 million in debt associated with the JANAF acquisition. Wheeler's weighted-average interest rate and term of its debt was 4.7% and 4.72 years, respectively, at March 31, 2018 (including debt associated with assets held for sale), compared to 4.6% and 4.81 years, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Net investment properties as of March 31, 2018 totaled at $457.7 million (including assets held for sale), compared to $384.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Extended the $3.0 million bank line of credit to June 15, 2018 with interest only payments due monthly at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.00% with a floor of 4.25%. In conjunction with the JANAF acquisition, executed three promissory notes: 1) $53.7 million at a rate of 4.49%, maturing in July 2023 with monthly principal and interest payments of $333,159; 2) $5.2 million at a rate of 4.95%, maturing January 2026 with monthly principal and interest payments of $29,964; and 3) $6.5 million at a rate of 4.65%, maturing in January 2021 with interest due monthly. Renewed the Eagle Harbor promissory note for $3.3 million for five years, which matures on March 2023 with monthly principal and interest payments of $26,528. The loan bears interest at 5.10%. Extended Revere Loan to May 15, 2018. In conjunction with the JANAF acquisition, the Company issued and sold 1,363,636 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, in a public offering. Each share of Series D Preferred Stock was sold to investors at an offering price of $16.50 per share. Net proceeds from the public offering totaled $21.2 million, which includes the impact of the underwriters' selling commissions and legal, accounting and other professional fees.\nDIVIDENDS\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company declared dividends of approximately $3.0 million to our holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock.\nOPERATIONS AND LEASING\nThe Company's real estate portfolio is 91.9% leased at March 31, 2018, which includes leases executed through April 4, 2018. The Company executed 26 lease renewals totaling 154,440 square feet at a weighted-average decrease of $0.29 per square foot, representing a decrease of 3.42% over prior rates. The Company signed 15 new leases totaling approximately 72,076 square feet with a weighted-average rate of $8.08 per square foot. Approximately 8.44% of the Company's gross leasable area (\"GLA\") is subject to leases that expire over the next nine months, with 43.6% of this expiring GLA subject to renewal options. The Company modified thirteen leases with Southeastern Grocers anchor tenants and recaptured four locations. These modifications primarily include a combination of increases and decreases to lease term and rental rates, as well as deferred landlord contributions for remodels. The Company has elected to recapture Ladson Crossing, St. Matthews, South Park, and Tampa Festival in the second quarter of 2018. The Cypress Shopping Center lease expired on March 31, 2018. As part of the negotiated recaptures the Company received $246 thousand in termination fees during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The remaining lease modifications remain subject to Southeastern Grocers' bankruptcy court approval. The initial annualized base rent impact of these modifications and recaptures is approximately $2.50 million.\nSAME-STORE RESULTS\nSame-store NOI year-over-year growth for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 2.5% and 1.6% on a cash basis. The same-store pool comprises the 4.9 million square feet that the Company owned as of January 1, 2017. Same-store results were driven, in part, by lease termination fees on Southeastern Grocers' recaptures, as well as a decrease of 61.1% in tenant provision for credit losses primarily resulting from increased collections on accounts receivable while property revenues and expenses remained relatively flat.\nACQUISITIONS\nAs previously disclosed, the Company acquired JANAF, a retail shopping center located in Norfolk, Virginia, for a purchase price of $85.65 million in January 2018.\nDISPOSITIONS\nThe Company completed the sale of the Chipotle ground lease at Conyers Crossing for a contract price of $1.3 million, resulting in a gain of $1.1 million with net proceeds of $1.2 million.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nFurther details regarding Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.’s operations and financials for the period ended March 31, 2018, including a supplemental presentation, are available at https://ir.whlr.us/ .\nCONFERENCE CALL DIAL-IN AND WEBCAST INFORMATION:\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 10:00 am Eastern Time to review its financial performance and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast:\nU.S. & Canada Toll Free: (877) 407-3101 / International: (201) 493-6789\nWebcast: https://78449.themediaframe.com/dataconf/productusers/whlr/mediaframe/24450/indexl.html\nReplay:\nU.S. & Canada Toll Free: (877) 660-6853 / International: (201) 612-7415\nConference ID#: 13679474\nAvailable May 9, 2018 (one hour after the end of the conference call) to June 9, 2018 at 11:00 am Eastern Time.\nABOUT WHEELER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST, INC.\nHeadquartered in Virginia Beach, VA, Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a fully-integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment company focused on owning and operating income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers. Wheeler’s portfolio contains well-located, potentially dominant retail properties in secondary and tertiary markets that generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns, with a particular emphasis on grocery-anchored retail centers. For additional information about the Company, please visit: www.whlr.us .\nA copy of Wheeler’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which includes the Company’s consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion & analysis of financial condition and results of operations, will be available upon filing via the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website ( www.sec.gov ) or through Wheeler’s website at www.whlr.us .\nDEFINITIONS\nFFO, AFFO, Pro Forma AFFO, Property NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wheeler considers FFO, AFFO, Pro Forma AFFO, Property NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important supplemental measures of its operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate and gains and losses from property dispositions, the Company believes that it provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from the closest GAAP measurement, net income.\nManagement believes that the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company’s real estate assets. These items include, but are not limited to, nonrecurring expenses, legal settlements, legal and professional fees, and acquisition costs. Management uses AFFO, which is a non- GAAP financial measure, to exclude such items. Management believes that reporting AFFO and Pro Forma AFFO in addition to FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investment community to use when evaluating the operating performance of the Company on a comparative basis. Management also believes that Property NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA represent important supplemental measures for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, as they are often used in calculating net asset value, leverage and other financial metrics used by these parties in the evaluation of REITs.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release may contain “forward-looking” statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When the Company uses words such as “may,” “will,” “intend,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate” or similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters, it is making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations discussed in the forward-looking statements. The Company’s expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Specifically, the Company’s statements regarding: (i) the future generation of financial returns from the acquisition of retail focused properties in secondary and tertiary markets; (ii) the recapture of Ladson Crossing, St. Matthews, South Park and Tampa Festival in the second quarter of 2018; and (iii) the thirteen lease modifications with Southeastern Grocers and the bankruptcy court’s approval of the lease modifications are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. For these reasons, among others, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements in this press release.\nAdditional factors are discussed in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available for review at www.sec.gov . The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof.\nMary Jensen\nInvestor Relations\n(757) 627-9088 / investorrelations@whlr.us\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(in data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 REVENUE: Rental revenues $ 12,697 $ 11,129 Asset management fees 48 162 Commissions 14 115 Tenant reimbursements 3,222 2,680 Development and other revenues 333 236 Total Revenue 16,314 14,322 OPERATING EXPENSES: Property operations 4,599 3,994 Non-REIT management and leasing services 36 271 Depreciation and amortization 7,476 6,400 Provision for credit losses 21 252 Corporate general & administrative 2,508 2,232 Total Operating Expenses 14,640 13,149 Gain on disposal of properties 1,055 — Operating Income 2,729 1,173 Interest income 1 356 Interest expense (4,577 ) (4,177 ) Net Loss from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes (1,847 ) (2,648 ) Income tax expense (25 ) (41 ) Net Loss from Continuing Operations (1,872 ) (2,689 ) Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations — 16 Gain on disposal of properties — 1,513 Net Income from Discontinued Operations — 1,529 Net Loss (1,872 ) (1,160 ) Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (47 ) (41 ) Net Loss Attributable to Wheeler REIT (1,825 ) (1,119 ) Preferred stock dividends (3,207 ) (2,483 ) Net Loss Attributable to Wheeler REIT Common\nShareholders $ (5,032 ) $ (3,602 ) Loss per share from continuing operations (basic and diluted) $ (0.57 ) $ (0.59 ) Income per share from discontinued operations — 0.17 $ (0.57 ) $ (0.42 ) Weighted-average number of shares: Basic and Diluted 8,900,416 8,554,304 Dividends declared per common share $ — $ 0.42\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except par value and share data)\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (unaudited) ASSETS: Investment properties, net $ 448,555 $ 384,334 Cash and cash equivalents 5,148 3,677 Restricted cash 12,198 8,609 Rents and other tenant receivables, net 4,621 5,619 Notes receivable, net 6,739 6,739 Goodwill 5,486 5,486 Assets held for sale 9,134 — Above market lease intangible, net 9,862 8,778 Deferred costs and other assets, net 41,010 34,432 Total Assets $ 542,753 $ 457,674 LIABILITIES: Loans payable, net $ 373,047 $ 308,122 Liabilities associated with assets held for sale 708 — Related party payables, net 5 — Below market lease intangible, net 13,382 9,616 Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities 11,033 10,624 Dividends payable 3,037 5,480 Total Liabilities 401,212 333,842 Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (no par value, 4,000,000 shares\nauthorized, 3,600,636 and 2,237,000 shares issued and outstanding;
