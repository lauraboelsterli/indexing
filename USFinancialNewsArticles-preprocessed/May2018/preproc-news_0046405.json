Dwight Smith Jr. led off the inning and was hit by a pitch before Urshela connected. Josh Donaldson walked with one out, Justin Smoak singled and Yangervis Solarte hit an RBI double. Kevin Pillar’s sacrifice fly completed the scoring in the inning and gave Toronto a 4-0 lead.\nGaviglio was replaced by Seunghwan Oh in the sixth after he gave up a one-out double by Khris Davis and a walk to Matt Olson. Oh gave up a two-out walk to load the bases before finishing the inning on a groundout.\nPagan replaced Manaea for the sixth inning and allowed a double and a walk in two innings.\nOh allowed a walk and had a strikeout in 1 2/3 innings before John Axford replaced him for the eighth inning.\nAxford allowed a leadoff walk to Matt Chapman and a single by Davis to put runners at the corners. Stephen Piscotty hit an RBI single to right and went to second on right fielder Teoscar Hernandez’s throwing error as Davis took third.\nClippard replaced Axford. Dustin Fowler flied out to shallow center and Olson held third. Pinch hitter Jed Lowrie walked to load the bases, and Pinder hit his fourth homer of the season to give Oakland the lead.\nLou Trivino pitched around a walk in the bottom of the eighth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
