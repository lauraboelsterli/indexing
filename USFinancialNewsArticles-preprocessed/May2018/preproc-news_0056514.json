    "text": "Published: May 26, 2018 1:12 p.m. ET Share Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, June 22, 2017.\nBy Juan Forero\nA former missionary from Utah who spent two years in a Venezuelan prison in what human rights lawyers called a trumped up case is to be released later Saturday by President Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian government, U.S. officials said in morning announcements.\n“Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela,” President Donald Trump said via Twitter. “Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 7:00 P.M.” Reuters/Courtesy Facebook Joshua Holt Joshua Holt, a U.S. citizen and Mormon missionary, is pictured in this still image taken from a selfie video which he posted on Facebook during a riot at the Helicoide detention center in Caracas, Venezuela, obtained by Reuters May 16, 2018.\nUtah Sen.Orrin Hatch said the release of Joshua Holt would come after two years of diplomatic negotiations that began under the Obama administration. “I could not be more honored to be able to reunite Josh with his sweet, long-suffering family,” he said in a statement.\nVenezuelan officials didn’t comment. Carlos Trujillo, a lawyer in Utah representing the Holt family, and Gonzalo Himiob, director of Caracas human rights organization Foro Penal, said he would be released later Saturday, though a time had not been announced.\nAlso popular on WSJ.com: ",
