    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlockchainK2 Corp. (formerly Africa Hydrocarbons Inc.) (TSX.V:BITK) (the “ Company ”) is pleased to announce that it has completed its previously announced “Change of Business” transaction (“ COB Transaction ”). As part of the COB Transaction, the Company changed its name from Africa Hydrocarbons Inc. to BlockchainK2 Corp. The Company intends to meet the listing requirements for a “Tier 2” technology issuer on the TSX Venture Exchange and will be a blockchain technology company, with its initial business being cryptocurrency mining (described in further detail below).\nChange of Name and Stock Symbol, Resumption of Trading\nIn connection with the closing of the COB Transaction, the Company changed its name from “Africa Hydrocarbons Inc.” to “BlockchainK2 Corp.” and changed its stock symbol to “BITK”.\nTrading in the common shares of the Company is expected to begin on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “ Exchange ”) under the Company’s new stock symbol “BITK” on May 30, 2018.\nChange of Business Transaction\nThe Company is completing the Change of Business by acquiring cryptocurrency mining rigs and other equipment necessary to commence cryptocurrency mining operations. The Company is in the process of making an initial order for Bitcoin mining rigs. The remaining cryptocurrency mining rigs will be ordered as soon as possible thereafter, subject to the Company sourcing the most up to date equipment and at the most favorable prices. Delivery of such equipment is expected to occur within two months of payment therefor.\nThe Company also intends to negotiate and execute the agreements necessary to commence cryptocurrency mining operations, such operations to be hosted and managed at a third-party data center located in Edmonton, Alberta.\nThe commencement of cryptocurrency mining operations will be the Company’s first step towards its goal of building a blockchain company, first through the development and ownership of cryptocurrency infrastructure and thereafter through investments in other blockchain businesses or technologies.\nConversion of Subscription Receipts\nFollowing closing of the COB Transaction, the Company’s outstanding subscription receipts (the “ Subscription Receipts ”) issued upon closing of the Company’s concurrent non-brokered and brokered private placement financings, as described in the Company’s news releases dated January 19, 2018 and April 4, 2018, automatically converted into an aggregate of 3,335,334 common shares in the capital of the Company and 1,667,667 common share purchase warrants (the “ Warrants ”).\nEach Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one (1) common share of the Company at an exercise price of CAD$2.00 per common share for 12 months from the date of issuance (the “ Time of Expiry ”). The Warrants will contain an acceleration right in favor of the Company that will allow the Company to accelerate the Time of Expiry to a date that is a minimum of thirty (30) days following the delivery of the applicable acceleration notice to the holders of the Warrants, if at any time following the issuance of the Warrants, the VWAP is equal to or greater than CAD$2.50 for a period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days on the Exchange.\nAggregate proceeds of CAD$4,169,167.50, which had been held in escrow in accordance with the terms of the Subscription Receipts, have been released to the Company.\nFollowing the completion of the COB Transaction, the Company has an aggregate of 15,901,625 common shares outstanding.\nBoard, Management and Corporate Matters\nThe Board of Directors of the Company remains as follows: Douglas Wu, Sergei Stetsenko and Andri Stytsenko.
