    "text": "4 COMMENTS Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -0.43% wants to understand one of the more intimate things about you: body size.\nThe online retailer is inviting people to an office in New York to measure small changes in size and shape over the course of 20 weeks. Those chosen via a survey to participate in the 10, bimonthly visits will receive Amazon gift cards worth up to $250, according to an invitation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n“We are interested in understanding how bodies change shape over time,” according to the survey. The invite comes from Amazon’s new 3-D body scanning unit, an outgrowth of its acquisition last year of computer vision startup Body Labs.\nAccurately predicting how a pair of jeans or a suit will fit is a Holy Grail for retail. Technology to model a human body and how clothing will look on it has a wide range of applications, from being able to prevent returns of ill-fitting garments to on-demand printing and production.\nStartups and research teams have sprung up around the world to tackle the problem. Amazon acquired Body Labs last year, but it has been an important issue for company executives for years, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAccording to job postings for the division, the Amazon team is currently creating statistical 3-D models of human bodies, which it will then match to images and videos of people via deep-learning algorithms and other tactics. That will have a “wide range of commercial applications” for Amazon customers, the company says in the job ad.\nA solution could have big impact: Amazon is expected to overtake Walmart Inc. to become the largest apparel retailer in the U.S. this year, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.\nIn the online survey, Amazon asks if participants’ weight and fitness level had changed dramatically over the past year, as well as if they are pursuing any specific weight loss or fitness goals. The survey asks if participants would be able to travel to Union Square in New York City for the 3-D photo scan study every two weeks for 30-minute sessions that will track their body shape changes over time.\nAn Amazon spokeswoman said she couldn’t comment on rumor or speculation.\nRelated Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box. Returns are one of the highest costs for online retailers since it requires paying for shipping both ways, along with processing the item when it gets back to a warehouse. Apparel typically tops the list when it comes to online return rates, with supply chain experts putting the rates for some retailers north of 40%.\nAnd most retailers, including Amazon, offer many apparel returns for free. That prompts some customers to use their homes like changing rooms, ordering several sizes and styles and returning what they don’t want.\n“The returns rates are really high. And it’s absolutely not free for the retailer,” says John Haber, chief executive of supply chain consultancy Spend Management Experts.\nAmazon has made a bigger push into clothing in recent years, launching a number of private labels. The company last year introduced “Prime Wardrobe,” a free service that allows members to fill up a box with eligible items and return what they don’t want for free.\nThe company also introduced its Echo Look device last year, which allows consumers to take photos and compare their looks side by side for a critique.\nWhile technology to measure bodies has made strides in recent years, it’s still an incredibly complicated field, says Susan Ashdown, a professor at Cornell University who has studied clothing sizing and fit for 35 years and body scanning technology since 2000.\n“It’s much more complicated than anyone imagines,” she says, citing the different types of material, plus the huge variety of body shapes and sizes combined with different postures. “How you hold your shoulders, the angle of your hips—everything feeds into how well your clothes fit you.”\nTechnology to help show how clothing might fit over a scanned body is further along than that allowing custom clothing manufacturing, she said.\n“Getting from that to a well-fitting piece of clothing is a huge leap,” she adds.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com",
