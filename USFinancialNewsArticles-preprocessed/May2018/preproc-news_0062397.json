(“ Mission Ready ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX VENTURE:MRS) is pleased to announce the addition of Anthony J. Walton to the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”), effective June 1, 2018, and the completion of the previously announced name change, effective June 5, 2018.\nBoard Changes\nAnthony Walton is Vice Chairman, Americas, for Standard Chartered Bank, where he maintains the Bank’s relationships with its key corporate and financial clients and guides strategic direction for the Americas. He also plays a critical role in developing businesses between the Americas and Asia, in particular China, for the Bank and its clients.\nMr. Walton has over 40 years of commercial and investment banking experience. He started with Chase Manhattan Bank in New York in 1966 where he assumed multiple worldwide assignments over his 16-year tenure.

From 1983 to 1993, Mr. Walton was Chief General Manager, Americas and Europe, of Westpac Banking Corporation and served on the main Board of Directors of Westpac in Sydney, Australia.
