    "text": "First Quarter Revenue and Operating Income Impacted by DoD Delays; EPS of $0.65 Compared to $0.67 Year-Over-Year\nALEXANDRIA, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VSE Corporation (Nasdaq: VSEC) reported the following unaudited consolidated financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nCEO Commentary\n“Budget uncertainties at the beginning of the government fiscal year and delays in the issuance of work orders have delayed the funding on contracts in our Federal Services Group,\" said Maurice “Mo” Gauthier, VSE CEO. \"These funding delays contributed to a decrease in revenues from our Department of Defense work in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior year. Year-over-year revenues for our Aviation and Supply Chain Management groups were substantially unchanged. Our Aviation Group has expanded product lines and distribution services to new clients and international geographic markets. Our Supply Chain Management Group's continuing revenue growth from commercial and government parts sales has offset a decrease in sales to the U.S. Postal Service.”\nMr. Gauthier continued, “We also amended our bank loan agreement to extend the maturity date on our bank debt and increase our borrowing capacity. This strengthens our balance sheet, enhances our liquidity, and positions us to better support our current business and strategic efforts.”\nFirst Quarter Results (unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share data) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Revenues $ 176,897 $ 197,294 (10.3 )% Operating income $ 11,593 $ 14,196 (18.3 )% Net income $ 7,052 $ 7,293 (3.3 )% EPS (Diluted) $ 0.65 $ 0.67 (3.0 )% Operational Highlights\nOur Supply Chain Management Group increased commercial and government revenue by 21% year-over-year. Our Federal Services Group was awarded a task order under the United States Air Force Contract Field Teams (CFT) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract, supporting the 314th Air Wing at Little Rock Air Force Base in Little Rock, Arkansas. This task order consists of a one year base period of performance with one one-year option period and an additional six-month option period, and total potential value of $28.5 million. Our Federal Services Group in conjunction with our Aviation Group completed an overhaul of an LM2500 Marine Gas Turbine engine under our NAVSEA FMS contract for the Taiwanese Navy. Our Aviation Group signed three new distribution agreements, including agreements for commercial airline cockpit display units and Business and General Aviation (B&GA) navigation equipment in support of customers in Europe and Asia-Pacific. These agreements increase our international footprint and they will be executed from our locations in Germany and Singapore. Our Aviation Group agreed in principle to extend its worldwide exclusive agreement with one of our key suppliers for small turbine engine fuel accessories through 2024.\nFinancial Information\nRevenues were $176.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $197.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to a reduction in work in our Federal Services Group.\nOperating income was $11.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $14.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating income decrease was primarily attributable to revenue decreases in our Federal Services Group and lower U.S. Postal Service revenues in our Supply Chain Management Group. Net income was $7.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared to $7.3 million, or $0.67 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in net income was not as significant as our decrease in operating income primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nBookings in our Federal Services Group were $33 million for the first three months of 2018 compared to revenue for this group of $88 million. Funded contract backlog at March 31, 2018 was $261 million, compared to $324 million at December 31, 2017 and $359 million at March 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe non-GAAP Financial Information (unaudited) listed below is not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") under SEC Regulation G. We consider EBITDA a non-GAAP financial measure and an important indicator of performance and useful metric for management and investors to evaluate our business' ongoing operating performance on a consistent basis across reporting periods. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation and other amortization.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information (unaudited)\n(in thousands) Three Month Results ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Net Income $ 7,052 $ 7,293 (3 )% Interest Expense 2,175 2,435 (11 )% Income Taxes 2,366 4,468 (47 )% Amortization of Intangible Assets 4,004 4,004 0 % Depreciation and Other Amortization 2,480 2,707 (8 )% EBITDA $ 18,077 $ 20,907 (14 )% Capital Expenditures\nPurchases of property and equipment were $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $414 thousand for the first quarter of 2017.\nAbout VSE\nEstablished in 1959, VSE is a diversified products and services company providing logistics solutions with integrity, agility, and value.
