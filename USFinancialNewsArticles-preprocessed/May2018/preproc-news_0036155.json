Edward Pearson, President & COO. “I am excited and energized to help lead HealthStream with continued excellence and further success in my new position. It’s gratifying to be a part of—and lead—such an exceptional organization of great employees who are committed to improving healthcare.”\nPrior to joining HealthStream in June of 2006, Mr. Pearson served as President and CEO of DigiScript, Inc., Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Executive Vice President of Inforum, Inc., CFO of HIE, Inc., CEO of empactHealth.com , and CEO of Medibuy.
