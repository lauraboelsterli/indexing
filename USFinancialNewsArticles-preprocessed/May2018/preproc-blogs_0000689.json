    "text": "0 COMMENTS The T-Mobile logo stands outside the Deutsche Telekom headquarters in Bonn, Germany, Feb. 22, 2018. Photo: Bloomberg News\nGermany’s Deutsche Telekom AG plans to rein in its borrowing as it expects substantial repayments from its subsidiary T-Mobile US Inc., should it complete the Sprint Corp. takeover.\nThe Bonn-based company has provided its U.S. unit with billions of dollars of intercompany financing, a practice that will end with the acquisition.\nT-Mobile US over the weekend struck a $26 billion deal to buy competitor Sprint. Under the takeover plan, Deutsche Telekom will reduce its stake in the combined entity to 42%. T-Mobile US will no longer be a group company for financing purposes and therefore won’t receive any more funds, a spokesman of Deutsche Telekom said.\nThe U.S. unit also has to repay a total of $17.1 billion it received from its parent since February 2016, Deutsche Telekom said. This includes a revolving credit facility, bonds and loans.\n“The capital provided by Deutsche Telekom enabled T-Mobile US to be more flexible and to act faster,” the Deutsche Telekom spokesman said.\nT-Mobile US will pay down $10.5 billion upon closure of the deal, forecast for the first half of 2019. The remaining $6.6 billion will be paid back over “a defined period of time,” Deutsche Telekom said in a presentation to bond investors earlier this week. T-Mobile US had $26.7 billion in net debt at the end of 2017, according to Factset.\nThe new T-Mobile is expected to issue a mix of secured and unsecured debt to pay down some of the obligations of the merging companies, according to a Moody’s Corp. report.\nThe required repayment to Deutsche Telekom won’t delay the proposed merger, said Janet Duncan, treasurer at Sprint, to CFO Journal. “I think Sprint has gotten comfortable that the market capacity will be there to allow the new T-Mobile to refinance some of the debt from its parent,” Ms. Duncan said.\nT-Mobile did not respond to calls seeking comment.\nDeutsche Telekom said its capital market activity “should be limited” in 2019 because of the expected repayments. From 2020 onwards, its funding needs “will also be slightly reduced,” the company said.\nDeutsche Telekom has upcoming debt maturities of €900 million ($1.09 billion) this year, followed by €4.7 billion in 2019 and €4.5 billion in 2020.\nIntegration costs of roughly $15 billion for the T-Mobile-Sprint deal mean that Deutsche Telekom’s debt levels will increase slightly — despite the repayments from T-Mobile US — said Stephane Beyazian, an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. “They [Deutsche Telekom] might have to focus on bringing [its debt levels] down over the next 12 months,” Mr. Beyazian said.\nThe company said that the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization will be higher than 2.5 times as a consequence of the transaction. It was 2.3 times at the end of 2017, and net debt was €50.8 billion.\nDeutsche Telekom expects its rating to go down by up to one notch once the deal has closed, it said in its presentation.\nThough T-Mobile and Sprint trade in junk territory, they both have a lot of room to raise new debt and make investments, said Scott Josefsberg, an analyst at Covenant Review LLC.\nMoody’s on Sunday affirmed T-Mobile’s Ba2 corporate family rating which indicates a neutral impact based on the potential merger, said Neil Mack, a senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.
