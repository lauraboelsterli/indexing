    "text": "WINCHESTER, Va., May 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- American Woodmark Corporation (NASDAQ: AMWD) (the \"Company\") today announced results for its fourth fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2018.\nFiscal Fourth Quarter 2018\nNet sales for the fourth fiscal quarter increased 57% to $405.9 million compared with the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The current fourth fiscal quarter results include three months of results from the Company's acquisition of RSI Home Products, Inc. (\"RSI\"), which closed December 29, 2017. Excluding the impact of the RSI acquisition, net sales for the fourth fiscal quarter increased 3% to $266.7 million compared with the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the RSI acquisition, the Company experienced growth in both the new construction and dealer channels during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nNet income was $19.1 million ($1.08 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year compared with $17.3 million ($1.06 per diluted share) in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Net income was positively impacted by additional sales volumes and lower incentive costs which were partially offset by acquisition related costs of $2.7 million, intangible amortization of $12.3 million and gross margin declines in the core business mainly due to raw material inflation. Adjusted EPS per diluted share was $1.64 for the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year compared with $1.13 in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Beginning with this earnings release, the Company has revised its definition of Adjusted EPS per diluted share to exclude intangibles amortization charges. Further details are contained below.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $65.3 million or 16.1% of net sales compared to $34.5 million or 13.3% of net sales for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to sales growth in the quarter and the inclusion of three months of results for RSI.\n\"With an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.1%, we were very pleased with our performance over the past quarter,\" said Cary Dunston, Chairman and CEO. \"We had solid growth in our dealer and new construction channels while home center channel sales continued to be challenging. Our integration work is proceeding on plan as we remain focused on strategically leveraging our combined businesses to gain share in the market.\"\nFiscal Year 2018\nNet sales for the 2018 fiscal year increased 21% to $1,250.3 million from the prior fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the RSI acquisition, net sales for the 2018 fiscal year increased 4% to $1,072.6 million from the prior fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the RSI acquisition, the Company experienced growth in both the new construction and dealer channels during the entire fiscal year.\nNet income for the 2018 fiscal year was $63.1 million ($3.77 per diluted share) compared with $71.2 million ($4.34 per diluted share) for the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EPS per diluted share was $5.24 for the 2018 fiscal year compared with $4.45 for the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $175.8 million or 14.1% of net sales compared to $133.7 million or 13.0% of net sales for the prior fiscal year. The year over year increase is primarily due to additional sales growth and the inclusion of four months of results for RSI.\nCash provided by operating activities for the 2018 fiscal year was $86.8 million. Free cash flow totaled $36.9 million for the entire fiscal year. Additionally, the Company paid down $40.0 million of its term loan facility during the fourth fiscal quarter.\nAbout American Woodmark\nAmerican Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen, bath and home organization products for the remodeling and new home construction markets. Its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers, builders and distributors and through a network of independent dealers.

In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below.\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth below.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as being more important than the comparable GAAP measures.\nAdjusted EPS per diluted share\nWe use Adjusted EPS per diluted share in evaluating the performance of our business and profitability. Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing the Company's results by providing an indication of performance and profitability excluding the impact of unusual and/or non-cash items. We define Adjusted EPS per diluted share as diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impact of (1) expenses related to the RSI acquisition, (2) inventory step-up amortization due to the increase in the fair value of inventory acquired through the RSI acquisition (that was fully expensed in the quarter ended January 31, 2018), (3) the amortization of intangible assets, and (4) the tax benefit of RSI acquisition expenses and the inventory step-up and intangible amortization. The amortization of intangible assets is driven by the RSI acquisition and will recur in future periods. We began excluding amortization of intangible assets from our definition of Adjusted EPS per diluted share beginning with this earnings release as management determined that such an exclusion would better help it evaluate the performance of our business and profitability and we also received feedback from some of our investors regarding the same.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in evaluating the performance of our business, and we use each in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and as indicators of business performance and profitability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin allow us to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude (1) income tax expense, (2) interest (income) expense, net, (3) depreciation and amortization expense, (4) amortization of customer lists and trademarks, (5) expenses related to the RSI acquisition, (6) inventory step-up amortization, (7) stock-based compensation expense, and (8) gain/loss on asset disposal. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, is useful for investors because management uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the performance of our business.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.\nFree cash flow\nTo better understand trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to subtract amounts for capital expenditures consisting of cash payments for property, plant and equipment and cash payments for investments in displays from cash flows from continuing operations which is how we define free cash flow. Management believes this measure gives investors an additional perspective on cash flow from operating activities in excess of amounts required for reinvestment. It also provides a measure of our ability to repay our debt obligations.\nNet sales excluding RSI sales\nTo better understand and compare the performance of our core American Woodmark business by our management and our investors, we believe it is helpful to subtract the amount of sales from our recently acquired and now wholly-owned subsidiary, RSI Home Products, Inc., from our net sales and report this amount with our quarterly earnings announcements. We may discontinue using this non-GAAP financial measure at a later juncture once RSI has become fully integrated into our Company and the quarter to quarter comparisons of our core business are no longer as helpful to compare performance.\nSummary\nManagement believes all of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period's results against the corresponding prior period's results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth on the following tables:\nReconciliation of Net Sales and Percentage of Net Sales Excluding RSI\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nApril 30,\nApril 30,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nPercent Change\n2018\n2017\nPercent Change\nNet sales excluding RSI\n$\n266,734\n$\n258,737\n3\n%\n$\n1,072,550\n$\n1,030,248\n4\n%\nRSI sales\n139,153\n窶能n窶能n177,724\n窶能n窶能nNet Sales\n$\n405,887\n$\n258,737\n57\n%\n1,250,274\n1,030,248\n21\n%\nReconciliation of Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the GAAP Equivalents\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nApril 30,\nApril 30,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet income (GAAP)\n$\n19,109\n$\n17,348\n$\n63,141\n$\n71,199\nAdd back:\nIncome tax expense\n9,052\n9,414\n31,619\n37,726\nInterest (income) expense, net\n10,167\n(294)\n13,054\n(521)\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n11,092\n4,963\n28,671\n18,682\nAmortization of customer lists and trademarks\n12,250\n窶能n16,333\n窶能nEBITDA (Non-GAAP)\n$\n61,670\n$\n31,431\n$\n152,818\n$\n127,086\nAdd back:\nAcquisition related expenses\n2,739\n1,958\n12,902\n2,686\nInventory step-up amortization (1)\n窶能n窶能n6,334\n窶能nStock compensation expense\n591\n992\n3,097\n3,469\nLoss on asset disposal\n335\n158\n615\n444\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\n$\n65,335\n$\n34,539\n$\n175,766\n$\n133,685\nNet Sales\n$\n405,887\n$\n258,737\n$\n1,250,274\n$\n1,030,248\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (Non-GAAP)\n16.1\n%\n13.3\n%\n14.1\n%\n13.0\n%\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income\n(in thousands, except share data)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nApril 30,\nApril 30,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet income (GAAP)\n$\n19,109\n$\n17,348\n$\n63,141\n$\n71,199\nAdd back:\nAcquisition related expenses\n2,739\n1,958\n12,902\n2,686\nAmortization of intangibles\n12,250\n窶能n16,333\n窶能nInventory step-up amortization (1)\n窶能n窶能n6,334\n窶能nTax benefit of add backs\n(5,134)\n(708)\n(10,970)\n(969)\nAdjusted net income (Non-GAAP)\n$\n28,964\n$\n18,598\n$\n87,740\n$\n72,916\nWeighted average diluted shares\n17,618,977\n16,389,578\n16,744,705\n16,398,240\nAdjusted EPS per diluted share (Non-GAAP)\n$\n1.64\n$\n1.13\n$\n5.24\n$\n4.45\n(1)\nThe inventory step-amortization is the increase in the fair value of inventory acquired through the RSI acquisition that was fully expensed in the quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nRevised Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income for Q3 FY2018\n(in thousands, except share data)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nJanuary 31,\nJanuary 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet income (GAAP)\n$\n1,996\n$\n14,553\n$\n44,032\n$\n53,851\nAdd back:\nAcquisition related expenses\n10,163\n728\n10,163\n728\nAmortization of intangibles\n4,083\n窶能n4,083\n窶能nInventory step-up amortization (1)\n6,334\n窶能n6,334\n窶能nTax benefit of add backs\n(5,836)\n(261)\n(5,836)\n(261)\nAdjusted net income (Non-GAAP)\n$\n16,740\n$\n15,020\n$\n58,776\n$\n54,318\nWeighted average diluted shares\n16,690,760\n16,381,223\n16,461,509\n16,400,842\nAdjusted EPS per diluted share (Non-GAAP) (2)\n$\n1.00\n$\n0.92\n$\n3.57\n$\n3.31\n(2)\nBeginning with this earnings release, the Company has excluded the impact of intangible asset amortization (and the related tax benefit) from the calculation of Adjusted EPS per diluted share.
