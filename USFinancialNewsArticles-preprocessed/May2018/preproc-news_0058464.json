    "text": "Baha Mar, the largest casino and retail complex in the Caribbean, is finally complete.\nThe final of the three hotels planned for the development will welcome its first guests on June 1.\nRosewood Baha Mar had its ribbon cutting last week.\nBaha Mar now has three hotel brands on-site: Grand Hyatt , SLS and Rosewood Baha Mar.\nThe complex now offers 2,300 rooms, suites and villas.\nThe completion of Baha Mar has been years in the making. Its previous owners declared bankruptcy and the project was stalled.\nThe complex has more than 40 restaurants, bars and lounges. There is beachfront property, spas, art and culture, a state-of-the-art Performing Arts and Convention Center, the Burwash International Baha Mar Racquet Club and the 18-hole Jack Nicklaus-designed Signature Royal Blue golf course.\n\"This spring marks a momentous occasion as the resort destination of Baha Mar marks its full completion,\" says Graeme Davis, president of Baha Mar.\nThe $4.2 billion project is now operated by Hong Kong-based conglomerate Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Limited.\nMore from USA Today:\nCaribbean casinos: Best places to gamble in the islands\nAmerica's beloved burger restaurants\n2018 summer food and wine festivals",
