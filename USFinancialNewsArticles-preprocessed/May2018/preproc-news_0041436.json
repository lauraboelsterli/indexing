    "text": "With high school and college graduations underway, it's a great time to start working.\nAverage pay for new entrants age 24 and under rose 5.2% in March compared with their predecessors a year earlier, according to the latest figures from payroll processor ADP. Wage growth for new entrants was just 2.5% in March of 2016 and 2017.\nOverall, new entrants to the labor force are seeing the biggest wage increases in high-skill fields, with a 7.6% jump in information — which includes computer workers — 6.8% in construction and 6.5% in manufacturing. Starting wages ranged from $9.41 in leisure and hospitality — which includes restaurants, bars and hotels — to $16.79 in information, according to ADP.\nThe typical gain for new workers is also bigger than that of existing ones. Pay was up 4.9% in March for workers who held the same job for at least a year and 4.4% for workers who had recently switched jobs.\n\"This is the time to jump into the workforce,\" says Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president of the ADP Research Institute.\nADP's data is based on the 20% of the labor force the firm can track because it provides payroll services to the workers' employers.\nRead more from USA Today:",
