    "text": "Q1 2018: Total revenue was $86.8M, up 20% over Q1 2017; Media revenue increased 51% over same period\nCrossed major milestone delivering over 1.0 billion transactions in Q1, 29% growth over Q1 2017\nCompany signed exclusive media partnership with another Retailer iQ partner\nCompany authorized $100M stock buyback program\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quotient Technology Inc. (NYSE: QUOT), the leading data-driven digital promotions and media company, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We had a great start to the year, with media and Retailer iQ posting strong revenue growth. Our platform generated strong shopper demand, and we crossed an exciting milestone, delivering more than one billion transactions in the quarter,” said Mir Aamir, President & CEO of Quotient. “Our solutions help drive the shift to digital and, with shopper data as the foundation, give brands and retailers the digital platform they need to compete in today’s environment.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue was $86.8 million in Q1 2018, an increase of 20% over Q1 2017. Revenues from promotions and media were $63.8 million and $23.0 million, respectively, compared to Q1 2017 revenues of $57.4 million and $15.2 million, respectively. GAAP net loss for Q1 2018 was $11.4 million, compared to net loss of $2.7 million in Q1 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 million in Q1 2018, an increase of 55% over Q1 2017. Transactions totaled 1.0 billion in Q1 2018, up 29% over Q1 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure at the end of this release.\nCompany Signed Exclusive Media Partnership With Another Retailer iQ Partner\nIn the first quarter, the Company signed another Retailer iQ partner to its media platform, whereby Quotient is now their exclusive digital media partner for shopper marketing. Quotient’s end-to-end solution helps brands reach millions of shoppers by targeting them using retailers’ purchasing data and creating relevant ads with integrated call-to-action items (such as a digital coupon) to drive sales online or in-store. Included is closed-loop measurement and analytics that links digital ad views to a shopper’s verified purchase.\nCompany Authorized New Stock Buyback Program\nThe Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock buyback program of up to $100.0 million of the Company's common stock, effective May 5, 2018, through a combination of a new 10B5-1 plan and an open window 10B-18 plan.\nBusiness Highlights\nMore Dollars Shift to Quotient, Leveraging Shopper Data to Drive Profitable Sales\nRetailer iQ and Media continue to lead growth in the business, together growing 36% over Q1 2017 as CPGs take advantage of the growing shopper demand on the platform. These two parts of the business made up 73% of total revenue in Q1 2018.\nQ1 2018 revenue from Retailer iQ, our digital paperless coupon platform, grew 29% over Q1 2017. Q1 2018 promotion revenue from CPGs, which excludes specialty retail, grew 19% over Q1 2017. Media revenue in Q1 2018 grew 51% over Q1 2017.\nCPG Brands And Retailers Broaden Use of Quotient Capabilities\nAnother major retailer launches our Digital Circular solution , which uses shopper data to deliver targeted media, as well as relevant and personalized store discounts to each shopper. Grocery retailers spend more than $5.3 billion annually on paper circulars, and as the shift to digital expands further, we believe this is another way for retailers and brands to reach and engage shoppers. Brands are spending more on targeted offers . Momentum is picking up with 3 times as many brands and 5 times as many targeted campaigns on our platform in the first quarter 2018, compared to a year ago. This demonstrates brands are achieving strong sales increases with our targeted offers, which is leading to recurring purchases.\nLaunched Breakthrough Analytics Solution\nWe recently launched Quotient Analytics, adding to our already rich suite of data analytics and insights capabilities. Quotient Analytics is a self-service solution that lets our clients monitor their promotion campaigns in near real time, giving them the ability to evaluate and measure performance so they can make changes in flight. Brands can quickly get insights and make faster, smarter, marketing decisions to drive more sales with greater efficiency.\nBusiness Outlook\nAs of today, Quotient is providing the following business outlook.\nFor the second quarter 2018, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $87.0 million to $90.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter 2018 is expected to be in the range of $12.0 million to $14.0 million.\nFor the full year 2018, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $379.0 million to $394.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2018 is expected to be in the range of $65.0 million to $73.0 million.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP guidance measure, to a corresponding GAAP measure is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and low visibility of certain income and expenses items that are excluded in calculating Adjusted EBITDA.\nConference Call Information\nManagement will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss the Company's financial results and business outlook today at 4:30 p.m. EDT/ 1:30 p.m. PDT. Questions that investors would like to see asked during the call should be sent to ir@quotient.com .\nTo access the call, please dial (866) 393-4306, or outside the U.S. (734) 385-2616, with Conference ID# 2279947 at least five minutes prior to the 1:30 p.m. PDT start time. The live webcast and accompanying presentation can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of the Company website at: http://investors.quotient.com/ . A replay of the webcast will be available on the website following the conference call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nQuotient has presented Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, in this press release, because it is a key measure used by Quotient’s management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve its annual budget, to develop short and long-term operational plans, and to determine bonus payouts. In particular, Quotient believes that the exclusion of certain income and expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of its core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial metric used by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors in connection with the determination of compensation for our executive officers. Accordingly, Quotient believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Quotient’s operating results in the same manner as Quotient’s management and Board of Directors.\nQuotient defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income (expense) net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net, charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning Software implementation costs, certain acquisition related costs, and restructuring charges.\nQuotient's use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Quotient’s financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (i) changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; (iii) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Quotient; (iv) the effects of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income (expense) net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs, certain acquisition related costs, and restructuring charges; and (v) other companies, including companies in its industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss), and Quotient’s other GAAP financial results.\nFor a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, see \"Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\" included in this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements concerning the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends affecting its business. Forward looking statements in this press release include the Company’s current expectations with respect to revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter and fiscal year 2018; the Company’s expectations for the continued scaling and growth of the Retailer iQ digital platform, including expectations on its ability to grow, perform, and meet the expectations of consumers, retailers and CPGs; the Company’s expectations regarding the future demand and behavior of consumers, retailers and CPGs, including the shift to digital; the Company’s expectations for Quotient Media Exchange, including expectations regarding the potential audience reach of our platforms; the Company’s expectations regarding its targeted promotions and targeted media offerings, the Company’s expectations regarding Quotient Analytics, the Company’s expectations regarding use of shopper data for its solutions; the Company’s expectations regarding our new pricing strategies, and shopper marketing; the Company’s expectations for the Coupons.com mobile app; and the Company’s expectations with respect to its future investments and growth and ability to leverage its investments and operating expenses.

Forward-looking statements are based on information available to the Company’s management at the date of this press release and its management's good faith belief as of such date with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.
