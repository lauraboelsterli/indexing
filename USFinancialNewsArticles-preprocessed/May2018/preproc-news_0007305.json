    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Perforce Software (\"Perforce\"), a global provider of solutions to enterprise teams requiring productivity, visibility and scale during all phases of the technology development lifecycle, backed by Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. (together with its affiliates, \"Clearlake\"), today announced the acquisition of UK-based Programming Research Ltd. (\"PRQA\"), a leading provider of sophisticated, enterprise-grade static code analysis. The acquisition expands the Perforce portfolio of solutions by adding PRQA's family of Static Code Analyzers that assess software reliability, security and compliance while reducing development time.\nGrowth through acquisition is an integral part of Perforce's business strategy to develop a comprehensive portfolio of leading enterprise scale software solutions for technology developers and development operations (\"DevOps\") teams. The acquisition of PRQA represents Perforce's fourth successful acquisition in the past two years, and its first under Clearlake's new ownership, which was announced in early January 2018.\n\"With this latest acquisition we continue delivering on our strategy to offer more solutions and capabilities that improve DevOps pipeline performance for enterprise development teams,\" said Janet Dryer, Perforce CEO. \"PRQA is a great match with Perforce as we both serve large global teams striving to deliver their solutions faster and with higher quality.\"\nPRQA solutions are widely adopted by organizations whose products need to perform securely and reliably in mission critical and safety critical environments, such as automotive, aerospace, medical and other demanding industries. Customers realize faster time-to-market due to the technology's scale and accuracy in automated inspection of source code for high risk code and non-conformance to standards.\n\"We are excited to support the Perforce management team as they continue to execute on its buy-and-build strategy,\" added Prashant Mehrotra, Partner of Clearlake. \"With this strategic acquisition of PRQA, Perforce now offers solutions for enterprise customers to address security and quality early in the software development lifecycle, enabling better continuous integration and continuous delivery.\"\n\"PRQA have been at the forefront of code quality management for over 30 years. We have some of the world's top experts in code analysis at PRQA, and our products help our customers develop high-quality code more reliably and at a faster pace. By joining forces with Perforce we will be able to expand the reach of this great technology and deliver business value to a much bigger audience worldwide,\" said Paul Blundell, PRQA CEO.\nAbout Perforce\nPerforce is a leading provider of enterprise scale software solutions to technology developers and development operations (\"DevOps\") teams requiring productivity, visibility and scale during all phases of the development lifecycle.
