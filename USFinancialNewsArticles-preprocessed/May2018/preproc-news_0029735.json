Shari Redstone has been advocating such a combination over the past two years.\nCBS and the five independent directors on its special committee say they filed the suit to prevent National Amusements, media mogul Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari “from breaching their fiduciary duties and harming the Company and its public stockholders.” ",
