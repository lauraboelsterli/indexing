He joins the Elanco Leadership Team at the company's Greenfield, Indiana-based headquarters on May 21.\nHicks will have responsibility for all of Elanco's legal functions. He joins the company with almost 20 years of corporate legal experience, advising companies on a range of domestic and international transactions, first as a mergers and acquisitions attorney in the energy sector, followed by in-house counsel positions of increasing responsibility within healthcare.\n\"I am so pleased to add Hicks to Elanco, as we'll greatly benefit from his far reaching legal experiences and expertise,\" said Jeff Simmons, president of Elanco. \"I am confident he will also bring a fresh perspective to our company and our leadership team with the right lens as we look to the future of our company.\"\nMost recently, Hicks was general counsel at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, where he had executive responsibility for all legal functions, including litigation, intellectual property, environmental, regulatory, mergers and acquisitions, and other general legal activities. Previously, he served as senior vice president, general counsel, chief compliance officer and corporate secretary of Providence Service Corporation, a global provider of a range of healthcare services. Prior to that, he served as assistant general counsel at DaVita Healthcare Partners, Inc., a leading provider of dialysis services. Additionally, Hicks spent five years at Beckman Coulter, Inc., a provider of biomedical diagnostics instruments, where he was associate general counsel and head of legal support for the company's Asia and Latin America operations.\n\"It was easy for me to see that Elanco is a company with a strong vision at an exciting time in its history,\" said Hicks. \"I'm looking forward to adding to Elanco's strong leadership team in a vibrant industry that's growing and full of opportunity.\"\nHicks also worked in the corporate law practices of two international law firms â€” Vinson & Elkins LLP and Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw LLP. He began his career as a law clerk for the Honorable James A. Beaty, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.
