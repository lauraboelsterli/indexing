It’s his knee,” Mourinho told reporters.

He had treatment in the morning at the training ground and he stayed away.\n“I’m waiting for the doctor but when it’s impossible to play today, I have my doubts (for the Cup final). Let’s wait and see, also for Romelu. I know he will be back on Tuesday.”\nUnited, who finished second behind champions Manchester City, face Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday.
