    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said on Tuesday that the U.S. Senate expects to finish a bipartisan farm bill sometime in June.\nSen. Amy Klobuchar speaks at a news conference to unveil congressional Democrat's \"A Better Deal\" economic agenda on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 1, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein The U.S. House of Representatives is slated to vote this week on a bill supported only by Republicans due to last-minute changes to nutrition assistance programs. The bill prepared by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, of which Klobuchar is a member, is expected to have support from both parties, she said. Both chambers are controlled by Republicans.\n“I know that the House Farm Bill has become very partisan, we don’t see a sign of that in the Senate,” Klobuchar told reporters.\nReporting by Amanda Becker; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ",
