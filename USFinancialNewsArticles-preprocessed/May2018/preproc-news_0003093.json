(NYSE: TPVG) (the “Company,” \"TPVG,\" “we,” “us,” or “our”), the leading financing provider to venture growth stage companies backed by a select group of venture capital firms in the technology, life sciences and other high growth industries, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and declared a second quarter 2018 distribution of $0.36 per share.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nSigned $146.0 million of new term sheets and closed $115.0 million of new debt commitments; Funded $37.9 million in debt investments with a 13.8% weighted average annualized portfolio yield at origination; Grew investment portfolio to a record level of $401.3 million as of March 31, 2018; Achieved 14.0% weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments; Ended the quarter with 0.73x leverage ratio; Earned net investment income of $5.9 million, or $0.34 per share; Net increase in net assets of $7.9 million, or $0.45 per share; Net asset value of $236.5 million, or $13.34 per share, at March 31, 2018; Achieved 13.6% of return on average equity in the first quarter of 2018; Amended and renewed our revolving credit facility increasing funding capacity to $210 million and reducing undrawn rates and applicable margin; On March 28, 2018, we received an exemptive order from the SEC to permit co-investment with TriplePoint Capital LLC (“TPC”) and/or investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by TPC; and Declared a second quarter distribution of $0.36 per share, payable on June 15, 2018; bringing total distributions to $6.26 per share since IPO.\n“The first quarter marked the fourth anniversary of our initial public offering. Our brand, reputation, venture growth stage focus and track record continue to differentiate us in the market,” said Jim Labe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TPVG. “We have grown our investment portfolio to an unprecedented level while prudently increasing our use of leverage and delivering attractive returns to our stakeholders.”\n“We continue to see strong demand for venture growth stage lending from high quality venture capital-backed companies,” said Sajal Srivastava, president and chief investment officer of the Company. “We plan to capitalize on these opportunities and to continue to grow our franchise and investment portfolio in 2018.”\nPortfolio and Investment Activity:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company entered into $115.0 million of new debt commitments, funded 8 debt investments totaling $37.9 million of principal, funded one equity investment totaling $0.3 million and acquired warrant investments valued at $0.6 million. Debt investments funded during the quarter had a 13.8% of weighted average annualized portfolio yield at origination. During the quarter, the Company experienced $3.3 million of early principal prepayments and $5.0 million of scheduled repayments. The weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments for the first quarter was 14.0%. The Company calculates weighted average portfolio yield as the annualized rate of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio at the beginning of each month in the period. 1\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company held 66 debt investments with 21 companies and 50 warrant and equity investments with 41 companies. The total cost and fair value of these investments were $400.8 million and $401.3 million, respectively. Total portfolio investment activity for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Beginning portfolio at fair value $ 372,103 $ 374,311 New debt investments 36,968 11,762 Scheduled principal payments from debt investments (5,876 ) (1,926 ) Early principal payments, repayments and recoveries (8,348 ) (53,274 ) Accretion of debt investment fees 2,948 (1,197 ) Payment-in-kind coupon 605 317 New warrant investments 615 157 New equity investments 250 2,400 Net realized gains (losses) on investments — (1,681 ) Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments 1,993 (2,461 ) Ending portfolio at fair value $ 401,258 $ 328,408 Signed Term Sheets:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, TPC entered into $146.0 million of non-binding term sheets to venture growth stage companies. These opportunities are subject to underwriting conditions including, but not limited to, the completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with TPC’s allocation policy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any or all of these transactions will be completed or assigned to the Company, even though the Company is the primary vehicle through which TPC focuses its venture growth stage business.\nUnfunded Commitments:\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s unfunded commitments totaled $124.4 million, of which $33.0 million is dependent upon portfolio companies reaching certain milestones. Of the $124.4 million of unfunded commitments, $71.4 million will expire during 2018, $18.0 million will expire during 2019 and $35.0 million will expire during 2020, if not drawn prior to expiration. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company.\nResults of Operations:\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total investment and other income was $12.6 million, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield of 14.0%, as compared to $14.3 million and 16.8%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in investment income and yield reflected lower prepayment related income as compared to a year ago.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $6.7 million as compared to $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 consisted of $2.5 million of interest expense and amortization of deferred credit facility costs, $1.5 million of base management fees, $1.5 million of income incentive fees, $0.4 million of administration agreement expenses and $0.8 million of general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 consisted of $2.4 million of interest expense and amortization of deferred credit facility costs, $1.6 million of base management fees, $1.5 million of income incentive fees, $0.4 million of administration agreement expenses and $0.5 million of general and administrative expenses.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded net investment income of $5.9 million, or $0.34 per share, as compared to $7.9 million, or $0.50 per share for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease largely reflects lower income from prepayment activity in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded $8 thousand of net realized gains, or $0.00 per share, compared to net realized losses of $1.7 million, or $(0.11) per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Net unrealized gains for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.0 million, or $0.11 per share. This compares to net unrealized losses of $2.5 million, or $(0.15) per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company’s net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $7.9 million, or $0.45 per share, as compared to approximately $3.8 million, or $0.24 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nCredit Quality:\nThe Company maintains a credit watch list with borrowers placed into one of five categories, with Clear, or 1, being the highest rating and Red, or 5, being the lowest. All new loans are initially assigned a rating of White, or 2. As of March 31, 2018, the weighted average investment ranking of the Company’s debt investment portfolio was 2.03, as compared to 2.02 at the end of the prior quarter. Additional information regarding our credit rating methodology is detailed in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe following table shows the credit rankings for the Company’s debt investments at fair value as of March 31, 2018 and as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018 As of December 31, 2017 Category (dollars in thousands) Fair Value % of Debt Investment Portfolio\n# of Portfolio Companies Fair Value % of Debt Investment Portfolio\n# of Portfolio Companies Clear (1) $ 50,901 13.4 % 3 $ 54,071 15.4 % 3 White (2) 274,901 72.3 14 243,915 69.3 12 Yellow (3) 46,368 12.2 3 46,187 13.1 3 Orange (4) 8,136 2.1 1 7,879 2.2 1 Red (5) — — — — — — $ 380,306 100.0 % 21 $ 352,052 100.0 % 19 Net Asset Value:\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s net assets were $236.5 million, or $13.34 per share, as compared to $234.9 million, or $13.25 per share, as of December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had total cash of $18.3 million, with available capacity of $113.0 million under its revolving credit facility.\nDistribution:\nThe Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.36 per share for the second quarter of 2018 payable on June 15, 2018, to stockholders of record as of May 31, 2018.\nSubsequent Events:\nSince March 31, 2018:\nThe Company closed $70.3 million of additional debt commitments; The Company funded $16.0 million in new investments; TPC’s direct originations platform entered into $80.5 million of additional non-binding signed term sheets with venture growth stage companies; Ring, Inc., closed its sale to Amazon and paid off its $50.0 million of outstanding debt; and On April 24, 2018, the Company’s board of directors unanimously approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCA”). As a result, the Company’s asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective April 24, 2019. On May 2, 2018, the Company’s board of directors also recommended the submission of a proposal for stockholders to vote in favor of the Company to immediately become subject to a minimum asset coverage ratio of at least 150%, permitting the Company to double its amount of debt incurrence earlier than the current effective date of April 24, 2019, pursuant to the SBCA. If this proposal is approved by stockholders at a special stockholder meeting, the Company would become subject to an asset coverage ratio of at least 150% the day after such meeting instead of on April 24, 2019.\nConference Call:\nThe Company will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time today, May 2, 2018, to discuss its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.
