May 11, 2018; Ponte Vedra Beach, FL, USA; Rory McIlroy plays his shot from the ninth tee during the second round of The Players Championship golf tournament at TPC Sawgrass - Stadium Course. Mandatory Credit: Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\nMcIlroy’s earnings have been boosted by his return to form in recent weeks, which saw him emerge as one of the contenders at the U.S. Masters before finishing tied for fifth.\nLast year, the 29-year-old signed two 10-year endorsement deals worth $100 million each, with sportswear brand Nike and club manufacturer TaylorMade.\nTennis player Andy Murray is second in the rankings, with the Scot’s wealth estimated at 83 million pounds.\nA relatively modest 6 million pounds increase on the three-times grand slam winner’s valuation from 2017 reflects his absence from the court after suffering a hip injury at last year’s Wimbledon.\nReal Madrid winger Gareth Bale and Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero are in the third and fourth spots respectively.
