    "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - The office of Brazilian President Michel Temer said in a written statement on Wednesday that it was committed to the financial health of Petroleo Brasileiro SA and it would continue to preserve the state-led oil firm’s fuel pricing policies.\nA government source told Reuters that Temer may scrap a market-based pricing mechanism that Petrobras has used for the past year and revert to selling all fuel below costs after a trucking strike largely paralyzed the nation the past 10 days. Temer acknowledged in a television interview late Tuesday that he was open to reviewing the pricing policy.\nReporting by Lisandra Paraguassu; Writing by Brad Brooks; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
