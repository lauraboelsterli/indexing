Our goal is to help Gay Travel members have a more meaningful travel experience - no matter where their destination may be.\"\n\"Kevin Mossier was not only our boss, he was our mentor. He started three successful travel companies including RSVP Vacations and Sea Spirit Cruise Lines. We very much want to bring so much of the LGBT travel history we experienced to life,\" added Don Ofstedal.
