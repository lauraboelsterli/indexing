    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 8:09 AM / Updated 33 minutes ago India and Nepal PMs launch construction of 900 MW power plant Gopal Sharma 4 Min Read\nKATHMANDU (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday visited Nepal to launch building work with his counterpart K.P.Sharma Oli on the country’s biggest hydroelectric project, as New Delhi seeks to rebuild trust in the Himalayan republic, where China has made deep inroads. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks with the media as Nepal's Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, also known as K.P. Oli, stands next to him during his visit at Janaki Mandir, a Hindu temple dedicated to goddess Sita, in Janakpur, Nepal May 11, 2018. REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar\nAt a ceremony in Kathmandu, Modi and Oli pushed a button that opened the curtain on a plaque at the site of the 900 MW hydro-power project, formally marking the start of construction work there.\nThe project, which is expected to cost $1.04 billion and is being built by state-run Indian firm Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN) Limited, will be the single biggest foreign investment project in cash-strapped Nepal.\nIndia has an open border with Nepal and tens of thousands of Nepalis work in India. The two countries share close religious and cultural bonds.\nBut India has been slow to implement projects despite ambitious plans, and it has also often been a target of Nepali politicians critical of what they see as meddling by their much bigger neighbor.\nChina, on the other hand, is pouring aid and investment into Nepali hospitals, roads and hydroelectric plants. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is offered a 121 Kg garland during the civic felicitation in Janakpur, Nepal May 11, 2018. REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar\n“As Nepal enters a new era of consolidating the gains of a democracy and achieving economic growth, India remains a steadfast partner,” Modi said on Twitter before his visit.\nProject officials say they are in the final stages of agreement with the State Bank of India for investment of about 36 billion rupees ($535 million) for the Arun 3 project, with the rest coming from SJVN.\nThe project is moving forwards just as a Chinese proposal to build a 750 MW power plant in west Nepal has run into a roadblock. China’s Three Gorges International Corp is haggling for better terms, Nepali officials said.\n“The power plant will provide employment, economic and business opportunities to Nepal,” Modi told reporters. Slideshow (9 Images)\nLast year Nepal canceled the award of a 1,200 MW power project called Budhi Gandaki to a Chinese company.\nAhead of Modi’s visit, Nepal’s Energy Minister Barsha Man Pun on Tuesday announced that the government would invite global bids for building the Budhi Gandaki project.\nModi is visiting for the first time since protests for a greater say in government by ethnic Madhesis, in Nepal’s lowland south, led to the closure of the border for months in 2015 and 2016.\nThe blockade choked off Nepal’s imports of fuel, medicine and construction material just as it was struggling to recover from the worst earthquake on record in which 9,000 people were killed. Many in Nepal saw India’s hand in the protests although India denied that.\nGuna Raj Luintel, editor of the Nagarik daily, said there was lingering anger toward India over the blockade.\n“Modi is under pressure to bring the Nepal ties back to normal and win the confidence of the Nepali people,” Luintel told Reuters.\nAfter arriving in Nepal, Modi offered prayers at a Hindu temple in the border town of Janakpur, which was a hub of the Madhesi protests in which more than 50 people were killed. He pledged 1 billion rupees for the development of Janakpur.\n“Nepal is ahead of all in our (policy of) neighborhood first,” Modi said.\n($1 = 67.2750 Indian rupees)",
