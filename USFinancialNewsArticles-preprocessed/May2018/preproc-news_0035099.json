Soccer Football - Premier League - Chelsea v Huddersfield Town - Stamford Bridge, London, Britain - May 9, 2018 Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas, Cesar Azpilicueta, Pedro and team mates remonstrate with referee Lee Mason REUTERS/Hannah McKay\nThe London club had been angered when referee Lee Mason awarded them a corner but then blew for half-time before it was taken. The official had adjudged the required stoppage time had elapsed.\n“Chelsea have been fined £20,000 after accepting a charge of failing to ensure their players and/or officials conducted themselves in an orderly fashion,” the FA said in a statement.\nThe draw at Stamford Bridge played a part in Antonio Conte’s Chelsea missing out on Champions League qualification.\nThey finished fifth in the Premier League standings, five points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.
