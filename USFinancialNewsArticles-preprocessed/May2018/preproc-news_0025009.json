    "text": "By David Meyer 5:15 AM EDT\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has launched its fourth active investigation into a crash involving a Tesla, this time looking into a fatal incident on Tuesday where a Model S left the road and crashed into a concrete wall.\nThe agency’s investigation is centered on the battery fire that resulted from the crash. Of the other three investigations, one is also about a battery fire and the other two involve Tesla’s autopilot system.\nThe latest crash, which occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. killed two teenagers, driver Barrett Riley and front seat passenger Edgar Martinez. A second passenger was taken to hospital.\nAccording to Tesla (tsla) , this was a “very high-speed collision and… Autopilot was not engaged.”\nThe NTSB already has two active investigations involving Tesla crashes where autopilot was engaged: a crash in Culver City, Calif. in January, where a Model S plowed into the back of a fire engine ; and the March crash in Mountain View, Calif. where an Apple engineer was killed when his Model X crashed into a highway barrier.\nThe latter incident has led to a hugely fractious relationship between the NTSB and the car-maker, which released details of its own investigations—blaming the dead driver—against the agency’s wishes.\nThis time round, the NTSB is examining the emergency response to the crashed Tesla’s lithium-ion battery fire. The probe is part of the agency’s attempt to “understand the impact of these emerging transportation technologies when they are part of a transportation accident,” it said in a Wednesday statement .\nSimilarly, the NTSB is also still investigating a battery fire that took place when a Tesla Model X crashed into someone’s garage in Lake Forest, Calif. last August.
