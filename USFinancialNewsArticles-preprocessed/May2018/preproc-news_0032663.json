    "text": "(Reuters) - The Malaysian ringgit fell to a four-month low on its first day of trade following Mahathir Mohamad’s stunning win in the country’s general election last week. The ringgit weakened as much as 0.9 percent to 3.985 versus the dollar on Monday, as traders came to grips with the election defeat of the coalition that had ruled the country for six decades.
