    "text": "WUHAN, China, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- China Automotive Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAAS) (\"CAAS\" or the \"Company\"), a leading power steering components and systems supplier in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet sales increased 12.3% to $134.0 million from $119.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 Net income attributable to parent company's common shareholders was $4.3 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.14, compared to $5.7 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in the first quarter of 2017 Total cash and cash equivalents, pledged cash and short-term investments were $124.5 million\nMr. Qizhou Wu, chief executive officer of CAAS, commented, \"Our sales continue to benefit from increased demand for our advanced products and exports. We are pleased to report that our sales to North America grew by 84.5% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same quarter last year. As we continue to invest in our electric power steering and other advanced steering technologies to position the Company for the future, our broad portfolio of steering products provides solutions to meet our customers' needs across all automotive segments.\"\nMr. Jie Li, chief financial officer of CAAS, commented, \"We continue to focus on building our financial strength to support our growing sales volume.\"\nFirst Quarter of 2018\nIn the first quarter of 2018, net sales were $134.0 million compared to $119.3 million in the same quarter of 2017, reflecting a 12.3% year-over-year growth. The increase in net sales was mainly due to increased sales volume, especially for legacy products for the North American and heavy-duty vehicle markets, and the effect of foreign currency exchange. The Company adopted ASC Topic 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customer\" as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC Topic 605 \"Revenue Recognition\". No significant impact to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nGross profit was $21.6 million in the first quarter of each 2018 and 2017. The gross margin was 16.1% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 18.1% in the first quarter of 2017 due to changes in the product mix.\nGain on other sales was $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting higher scrap volume.\nSelling expenses were $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher logistics fees reflecting higher sales volume and increased marketing expenses. Selling expenses represented 4.3% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.4% in the first quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses (\"G&A expenses\") were $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $4.4 million in the same quarter of 2017. G&A expenses represented 3.3% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 and 3.7% in the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses (\"R&D expenses\") were $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. R&D expenses represented 6.2% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 5.7% in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in R&D expenses was due to increased investment in EPS product research and development such as brushless motor and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) related projects.\nIncome from operations was $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.2 million in the same quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross margin and higher selling and research and development expenses.\nInterest expense was $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.2 million, in the same quarter of 2017. The increase was due to new bank borrowings at higher interest rates.\nNet financial expense was $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net financial income of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase of net financial expense was primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange rates related to higher export sales in the first quarter of 2018.\nIncome before income tax expenses and equity in earnings of affiliated companies was $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in income before income tax expenses and equity in earnings of affiliated companies was mainly due to lower income from operations.\nNet income attributable to parent company's common shareholders was $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.18 in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding was 31,644,004 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 31,649,908 in the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, total cash and cash equivalents, pledged cash and short-term investments were $124.5 million, total accounts receivable including notes receivable were $304.7 million, accounts payable were $237.6 million and short-term bank and government loans were $63.2 million.
