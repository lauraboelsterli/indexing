    "text": "By Bruno Federowski BRASILIA, May 18 (Reuters) - The Brazilian real on Friday once again underperformed its Latin American peers as a global emerging market selloff drove many investors to unwind bets on a stronger currency despite increased central bank intervention. The real weakened as much as 2 percent to 3.78 to the dollar, the weakest since March 2016, before paring back some of those gains to trade 1 percent lower. It fell for a sixth straight day, capping an 11.3 percent decline since the beginning of the year that made it the second-worst performing currency in Latin America, behind only the Argentine peso. Bets that a wider U.S. fiscal deficit and accelerating inflation could drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than expected, have bumped up U.S. bond yields, luring capital away from higher-yielding, emerging-market assets. The selloff has extended for weeks, surprising many who were certain that the rout would fade quickly. A Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists earlier this month suggested Latin American currencies would likely recoup much of their losses in coming months, though many warned of vulnerabilities in Argentina and Brazil. The currency weakness came even after Brazil's central bank increased market intervention and unexpectedly refrained from cutting interest rates this week. \"The central bank did the right thing by signaling concern with the foreign exchange weakness, but there's only so much you can do when you're dealing with a global repricing of the dollar,\" said a Rio de Janeiro-based portfolio manager. \"To some degree, you're also going to see increased daily volatility as traders test the central bank's willingness to intervene even more.\" Brazil's central bank has increased daily sales of currency swaps, which function like sales of dollars for future delivery. It holds $25 billion worth of currency swaps in its books. The move highlights how emerging-market central banks have struggled to support their currencies. The Argentine peso weakened around 1 percent on Thursday even as the country's central bank offered to sell additional dollars.
