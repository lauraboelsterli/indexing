    "text": "Former Docker CEO brings executive leadership and machine identity protection expertise to cybersecurity market leader\nSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Venafi ® the leading provider of machine identity protection, today announced that Ben Golub has been named to its board of directors.\nGolub is currently the executive chairman and interim CEO at Storj Labs, a decentralized storage company leveraging blockchain. Previously, he was the CEO of Docker, the world’s leading software company for building, securing and managing applications on a global container platform. He also served as the CEO of both Gluster and Plaxo and held senior leadership positions at Verisign and Avid Technology.\n\"Ben brings a unique perspective to the challenges of machine identity protection and will offer valuable insights about this rapidly growing marketplace,” said Jeff Hudson, CEO of Venafi. \"He is a highly sought-after and respected leader in the world of enterprise and DevOps, and his decision to join our organization will power the extension of our leadership in the cybersecurity market.”\nGolub is also a venture advisor at the Mayfield Fund and serves as a board member and advisor to a number of companies, including Minio, Quilt and Streamlio. He received a bachelor’s degree in public policy from Princeton University, an MBA from Harvard Business School and an MPA from Harvard Kennedy School.\n“Given the rapid growth in distributed and decentralized environments, as well as the proliferation of physical servers, VMs, devices, containers and more, the need for robust solutions around machine identity protection is becoming critical for security,” said Golub. “I am thrilled to be working with Venafi, the industry leader in this field.\"\nIn DevOps environments, constant flows of compact machines are created, deployed, and destroyed in moments at machine speed and scale. Fast IT developers use containers to run applications that consist of microservices, ushering in an entirely new definition of machines— each of which requires a unique identity.\nVenafi is committed to protecting the machine identities utilized in DevOps environments and more. The Venafi machine identity protection platform protects the top five U.S. health insurers; the top five U.S. airlines; four of the top five banks in the U.S., U.K. and South Africa; and four of the top five U.S. retailers. Golub’s expertise will help Venafi secure the explosion of machine identities driven by the market trends of DevOps and Fast IT.\nFor more information, please visit: www.venafi.com .\nAbout Venafi\nVenafi is the cybersecurity market leader in machine identity protection, securing all connections and communications between machines.
