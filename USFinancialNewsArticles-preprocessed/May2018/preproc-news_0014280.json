    "text": "DENVER, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SRC Energy Inc. (NYSE American:SRCI) (“SRC”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), a U.S. oil and gas exploration and production company with operations focused on the Wattenberg Field in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, reports its financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and announces an amended and restated credit agreement with an increase to its borrowing base.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRevenues were $147.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 Net income was $65.8 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $115.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (see further discussion regarding the presentation of adjusted EBITDA in \"About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below) Drilling and completion capital expenditures of $111.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were funded from EBITDA\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThe following tables present certain per unit metrics that compare results of the corresponding reporting periods:\nThree Months Ended Net Volumes 3/31/2018 3/31/2017 % Chg. Crude Oil (MBbls) 2,041 680 200 % Natural Gas Liquids (MBbls) 758 343 121 % Natural Gas (MMcf) 7,719 3,446 124 % Sales Volumes: (MBOE) 4,086 1,597 156 % Average Daily Volumes Daily Production (BOE/day) 45,397 17,743 156 % Product Price Received Crude Oil ($/Bbl) $ 56.01 $ 42.50 32 % Natural Gas Liquids ($/Bbl) $ 19.15 15.94 20 % Natural Gas ($/Mcf) $ 2.14 $ 2.66 (20 )% Average Realized Price ($/BOE) $ 35.58 $ 27.27 30 % Per Unit Cost Information ($/BOE) Lease Operating Exp. $ 1.93 $ 2.33 (17 )% Production Tax $ 3.29 $ 0.92 258 % DD&A Expense $ 9.08 $ 8.28 10 % Total G&A Expense $ 2.35 $ 5.14 (54 )% Oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 236% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. This was due to a 156% increase in sales volumes combined with a 30% improvement in average realized sales price per BOE.\nUnit operating costs generally continue to benefit from larger volumes of production from horizontal wells turned to sales during the last twelve months. Production taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were favorably impacted by an adjustment to the Company's assumed ad valorem tax rate.\nThe Company's 2018 first quarter net income totaled $65.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $19.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 was $115.7 million as compared to $32.5 million in the year ago quarter.\nThe Company accrued deferred tax expense of $5.8 million during 2018 as compared to no expense in the same period of 2017. This is primarily a result of expectations for positive three-year cumulative taxable income through 2018. The Company expects an effective tax rate of approximately 8% through the remainder of the year.\nCredit Agreement\nOn April 2, 2018 the Company entered into a new amended and restated credit agreement for its revolving credit facility. Among other provisions, the borrowing base under the credit agreement was increased to $550 million with aggregate elected commitments of $450 million. The Company currently has no amounts drawn on the facility.\nOperational Status\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Activity Lateral Length # of wells on Pad WI % # of Wells Drilled # of Wells Completed # of Wells Turned to Sales Leffler Pad LL 12 90 % 12 Ag Pad LL 12 89 % 12 Goetzel Pad LL 12 92 % 1 6 Falken Pad 6 SL, 12 LL 18 95 % 4 Donn Pad LL 13 88 % 8 Boomerang Pad 12 ML, 4 LL 16 83 % 15 Total wells 28 18 12 SL ~4,500' ML ~7,500' LL ~10,000' Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time (9:00 a.m. Mountain time) to discuss the results.

We exclude those items because they can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, and the method by which the assets were acquired. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is widely used in our industry as a measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt covenant requirements.
