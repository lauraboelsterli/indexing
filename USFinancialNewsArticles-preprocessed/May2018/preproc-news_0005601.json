    "text": "ALLENTOWN, Pa., PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) on Thursday (5/3) announced first-quarter 2018 reported earnings (GAAP) of $452 million or $0.65 per share, an increase from first-quarter 2017 reported earnings of $403 million, or $0.59 per share.\nAdjusting for special items, first-quarter 2018 earnings from ongoing operations (non-GAAP) were $517 million, or $0.74 per share, a per-share increase of 19 percent from $425 million, or $0.62 per share, a year ago. The increase in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by higher earnings at PPL's U.S. segments, partially offset by lower earnings at its U.K. segment.\n\"Based on our first-quarter results, we are on track to deliver on our 2018 earnings forecast,\" said William H. Spence, PPL's chairman, president and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our customers and shareowners continue to realize the benefits of our infrastructure investments and our constructive regulatory jurisdictions.\"\nWith the effect of special items recorded through the first quarter, the company's forecast range for 2018 reported earnings is $2.11 to $2.31 per share.\nPPL's forecast range for earnings from ongoing operations, reaffirmed today, is $2.20 to $2.40 per share, with a midpoint of $2.30 per share.\nIn addition, PPL reaffirmed its expectation of 5 to 6 percent compound annual earnings growth per share from 2018 through 2020 off of the 2018 forecast midpoint as the company pursues its strategy for long-term growth and success. That strategy is focused on delivering best-in-sector operational performance, investing responsibly in a sustainable energy future, maintaining a strong financial foundation and engaging and developing its people.\nSpence noted that PPL continues to assess and revise its expectations for the impact of tax reform. As a result of these revisions, the company is now targeting the lower end of its previously stated equity financing needs of $2 billion to $3 billion through 2020.\nIn addition to announcing first-quarter earnings, Spence said the company supports U.K. regulator Ofgem's decision to forgo any mid-period review during the RIIO-ED1 price-control period.\nWe believe Ofgem, through its consultation process, arrived at the best outcome for all stakeholders,\" Spence said. \"We believe this is an important signal of support for the regulation that has made the U.K. a premier jurisdiction in which to operate. We look forward to continuing to deliver positive outcomes for customers and fair returns for our shareowners moving forward.\"\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Earnings Details\nPPL's reported earnings for the first quarter of 2018 included net special-item after-tax charges of $65 million, or $0.09 per share, from foreign currency economic hedges. Reported earnings for the first quarter of 2017 included net special-item after-tax charges of $22 million, or $0.03 per share, primarily from foreign currency economic hedges.\nAs discussed in this news release, reported earnings are calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). \"Earnings from ongoing operations\" is a non-GAAP financial measure that is adjusted for special items. See the tables at the end of this news release for a reconciliation of reported earnings to earnings from ongoing operations, including an itemization of special items.\n(Dollars in millions, except for per-share amounts)\n1st Quarter\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nReported earnings\n$\n452\n$\n403\n12\n%\nReported earnings per share\n$\n0.65\n$\n0.59\n10\n%\n1st Quarter\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nEarnings from ongoing operations\n$\n517\n$\n425\n22\n%\nEarnings from ongoing operations per share\n$\n0.74\n$\n0.62\n19\n%\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Earnings by Segment\n1st Quarter\nPer share\n2018\n2017\nReported earnings\nU.K. Regulated\n$\n0.28\n$\n0.42\nKentucky Regulated\n0.19\n0.14\nPennsylvania Regulated\n0.21\n0.12\nCorporate and Other\n(0.03)\n(0.09)\nTotal\n$\n0.65\n$\n0.59\n1st Quarter\n2018\n2017\nSpecial items (expense) benefit\nU.K. Regulated\n$\n(0.09)\n$\n(0.03)\nKentucky Regulated\n—\n—\nPennsylvania Regulated\n—\n—\nCorporate and Other\n—\n—\nTotal\n$\n(0.09)\n$\n(0.03)\n1st Quarter\n2018\n2017\nEarnings from ongoing operations\nU.K. Regulated\n$\n0.37\n$\n0.45\nKentucky Regulated\n0.19\n0.14\nPennsylvania Regulated\n0.21\n0.12\nCorporate and Other\n(0.03)\n(0.09)\nTotal\n$\n0.74\n$\n0.62\nKey Factors Impacting Earnings\nU.K. Regulated Segment\nPPL's U.K. Regulated segment primarily consists of the regulated electricity delivery operations of Western Power Distribution (WPD) plc, which serves Southwest and Central England and South Wales.\nReported earnings in the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $0.14 per share compared to a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations in the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $0.08 per share. Excluding special items, factors driving earnings results included higher income taxes primarily due to a 2017 U.S. tax benefit from accelerated pension contributions that did not recur in 2018; lower prices from an April 1, 2017 price decrease, driven by true-up mechanisms partially offset by higher base demand revenue; lower volumes and the effect of share dilution. These factors were partially offset by higher pension income and higher foreign currency exchange rates.\nKentucky Regulated Segment\nPPL's Kentucky Regulated segment primarily consists of the regulated electricity and natural gas operations of Louisville Gas and Electric Company and the regulated electricity operations of Kentucky Utilities Company.\nReported earnings and earnings from ongoing operations in the first quarter of 2018 both increased by $0.05 per share compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather.\nPennsylvania Regulated Segment\nPPL's Pennsylvania Regulated segment consists of the regulated electricity delivery operations of PPL Electric Utilities.\nReported earnings and earnings from ongoing operations in the first quarter of 2018 both increased by $0.09 compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher revenues and lower operation and maintenance expense. The higher revenues were driven by returns on additional capital investments in transmission and higher sales volumes in distribution due to favorable weather.\nCorporate and Other\nPPL's Corporate and Other category primarily includes unallocated corporate-level financing and other costs.\nThe loss in first-quarter reported earnings and earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.06 per share compared to a year ago, driven primarily by the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes in 2017.\n2018 Earnings Forecast\nReported Earnings\nEarnings from Ongoing\nOperations\n2018 forecast\nmidpoint\n2017 actual\n2018 forecast\nmidpoint\n2017 actual\nPer share\nU.K. Regulated\n$\n1.23\n$\n0.95\n$\n1.32\n$\n1.28\nKentucky Regulated\n0.52\n0.42\n0.52\n0.57\nPennsylvania Regulated\n0.57\n0.52\n0.57\n0.51\nCorporate and Other\n(0.11)\n(0.25)\n(0.11)\n(0.11)\nTotal\n$\n2.21\n$\n1.64\n$\n2.30\n$\n2.25\n(See the tables at the end of this news release for a reconciliation of reported earnings to earnings from ongoing operations.)\nU.K. Regulated Segment\nPPL projects higher segment earnings in 2018 compared with 2017. The increase in reported earnings reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of U.S. tax reform and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges. Excluding these 2017 special items, the increase is expected to be driven primarily by higher foreign currency exchange rates and higher pension income, partially offset by higher taxes and the effect of share dilution.\nThe remaining 2018 foreign currency exposure for this segment is 100 percent hedged at an average rate of $1.32 per pound.\nKentucky Regulated Segment\nPPL projects higher reported segment earnings in 2018 compared with 2017, which reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding this 2017 special item, earnings in 2018 compared with 2017 are projected to be lower, driven primarily by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense, a lower tax shield on holding company interest and expenses, and the effect of share dilution, partially offset by an assumed return to normal weather and higher base electricity and gas rates effective July 1, 2017.\nPennsylvania Regulated Segment\nPPL projects higher segment earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by higher transmission earnings and lower operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense and the effect of share dilution.\nCorporate and Other\nPPL projects lower reported costs in 2018 compared with 2017, which reflects the 2017 unfavorable impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding this 2017 special item, PPL projects costs to be flat in this category in 2018 compared to 2017 with a lower tax shield on holding company interest expense offset by lower financing costs.\nHeadquartered in Allentown, Pa., PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) is one of the largest companies in the U.S. utility sector. PPL's seven high-performing, award-winning utilities serve 10 million customers in the U.S. and United Kingdom. With more than 12,000 employees, the company is dedicated to providing exceptional customer service and reliability and delivering superior value for shareowners.

Callers can access the webcast link at www.pplweb.com/investors under \"Events.\"\nManagement utilizes \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to reported earnings, or net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the effective tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items include:\nUnrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges (as discussed below). Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business. Impairment charges. Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects. Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments. Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.\nUnrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges include the changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts used to hedge British-pound-sterling-denominated anticipated earnings. The changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately within GAAP earnings. Management believes that excluding these amounts from Earnings from Ongoing Operations until settlement of the contracts provides a better matching of the financial impacts of those contracts with the economic value of PPL's underlying hedged earnings.\nStatements contained in this news release, including statements with respect to future earnings, cash flows, dividends, financing, regulation and corporate strategy, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although PPL Corporation believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the statements. The following are among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements: market demand for energy in our U.S. service territories; weather conditions affecting customer energy usage and operating costs; the effect of any business or industry restructuring; the profitability and liquidity of PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries; new accounting requirements or new interpretations or applications of existing requirements; operating performance of our facilities; the length of scheduled and unscheduled outages at our generating plants; environmental conditions and requirements and the related costs of compliance; system conditions and operating costs; development of new projects, markets and technologies; performance of new ventures; asset or business acquisitions and dispositions; any impact of severe weather on our business; receipt of necessary government permits, approvals, rate relief and regulatory cost recovery; capital market conditions and decisions regarding capital structure; the impact of state, federal or foreign investigations applicable to PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries; the outcome of litigation against PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries; stock price performance; the market prices of equity securities and the impact on pension income and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans; the securities and credit ratings of PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries; political, regulatory or economic conditions in states, regions or countries where PPL Corporation or its subsidiaries conduct business, including any potential effects of threatened or actual cyberattack, terrorism, or war or other hostilities; British pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rates; new state, federal or foreign legislation, including new tax legislation; and the commitments and liabilities of PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries. Any such forward-looking statements should be considered in light of such important factors and in conjunction with factors and other matters discussed in PPL Corporation's Form 10-K and other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNote to Editors: Visit our media website at www.pplnewsroom.com for additional news and background about PPL Corporation.\nPPL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (1)\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)\n(Millions of Dollars)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n629\n$\n485\nAccounts receivable\n849\n781\nUnbilled revenues\n489\n543\nFuel, materials and supplies\n279\n320\nCurrent price risk management assets\n56\n49\nOther current assets\n188\n116\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nRegulated utility plant\n38,891\n38,228\nLess: Accumulated depreciation - regulated utility plant\n7,003\n6,785\nRegulated utility plant, net\n31,888\n31,443\nNon-regulated property, plant and equipment\n387\n384\nLess: Accumulated depreciation - non-regulated property, plant and equipment\n114\n110\nNon-regulated property, plant and equipment, net\n273\n274\nConstruction work in progress\n1,575\n1,375\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\n33,736\n33,092\nNoncurrent regulatory assets\n1,519\n1,504\nGoodwill and other intangibles\n4,005\n3,955\nPension benefit asset\n378\n284\nNoncurrent price risk management assets\n120\n215\nOther noncurrent assets\n140\n135\nTotal Assets\n$\n42,388\n$\n41,479\nLiabilities and Equity\nShort-term debt\n$\n1,457\n$\n1,080\nLong-term debt due within one year\n250\n348\nAccounts payable\n836\n924\nOther current liabilities\n1,695\n1,671\nLong-term debt\n20,214\n19,847\nDeferred income taxes and investment tax credits\n2,685\n2,591\nAccrued pension obligations\n653\n800\nAsset retirement obligations\n292\n312\nNoncurrent regulatory liabilities\n2,689\n2,704\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n441\n441\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital\n10,418\n10,312\nEarnings reinvested\n4,037\n3,871\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(3,279)\n(3,422)\nTotal Liabilities and Equity\n$\n42,388\n$\n41,479\n(1)\nThe Financial Statements in this news release have been condensed and summarized for purposes of this presentation.
