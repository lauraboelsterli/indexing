    "text": "Enfission Takes Charge of Fuel Roadmap Project\nStrengthens Balance Sheet for Enfission R&D Work\nRESTON, Va., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lightbridge Corporation (NASDAQ:LTBR), a U.S. nuclear fuel technology company, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSeth Grae, President & Chief Executive Officer of Lightbridge Corporation, commented, “This has been a productive first quarter. Most notably, we announced the launch of Enfission, our 50/50 joint venture with Framatome. Since the formation of Enfission in January 2018, we have been making rapid progress. Specifically, we are working on developing a regulatory licensing plan for lead test assemblies and Enfission expects to present this plan to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) later this year. We appreciate the ongoing support and guidance we receive from the Nuclear Utility Fuel Advisory Board members, comprised of four leading U.S. nuclear utilities. We are also making rapid progress developing analytical models for our metallic fuel technology that can be used for reactor analysis and regulatory licensing. As a result, we remain on track for Enfission to enter into a lead test rod and/or lead test assembly agreement with one of the major U.S. nuclear utilities in the 2019-2020 timeframe.”\n“While other nuclear fuels in development may bring safety advantages to reactors, none can match both the significant safety advantages and the dramatic improvement to a power plant’s economics offered by the Lightbridge Fuel™ that the reactors need to compete and win against other sources of baseload power. Some of these other fuel concepts can be combined with the Lightbridge Fuel™, further enhancing the safety benefits of each technology. Lightbridge Fuel™ can also uniquely bring significant benefits on the back-end of the fuel cycle by reducing the amount of spent fuel/waste per kilowatt-hour of electricity, with the spent fuel/waste having the major positive attribute of being useless for any nuclear explosives purposes. Finally, Lightbridge Fuel™ also has advantages for extending the licensed life of reactors.”\nENFISSION R&D ADVANCEMENTS THIS QUARTER\n1. Corporate governance and project management:\nEstablished corporate governance and project management structure to ensure effective project control and oversight\n2. Fabrication:\nCompleted and issued preliminary specifications and requests for quotation for scope on several fabrication-related tasks Completed technical and commercial assessment for two suppliers Identified options to be evaluated for commercial-scale fabrication process optimization\n3. Fuel Design:\nLaunched Critical Heat Flux test program Completed procedures for first test rig qualification and interim inspection equipment at IFE/Halden\n4. Regulatory licensing:\nInitiated preparation of NRC regulatory licensing plan and identification of criteria for Standard Review Plan\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n“We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, and I’m pleased to report we ended the quarter with approximately $22 million of cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018. This strong cash position provides us significant flexibility and the ability to fund both operations as well as activities necessary to advance the commercial designs and manufacturing of lead test rods and assemblies. As these activities progress over the next couple years, we expect Enfission to begin receiving fuel-related cash contributions from nuclear utility customers. At the same time, we are actively pursuing a variety of non-dilutive funding options, which could include meaningful grants that would help to further accelerate our commercialization timeline.”\nBalance Sheet Overview\nAt March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $22 million, as compared to approximately $4.5 million at December 31, 2017. The $17.5 million increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from the sale of approximately $20.7 million of common stock and $4 million of preferred stock during the three months ended March 31, 2018. This amount of cash inflow was partially offset by net cash used in operating activities of approximately $1.9 million and cash used in investing activities of approximately $5.3 million, which consisted of cash contributions into Enfission of approximately $5.2 million which are not included in our above mentioned $22 million cash and cash equivalents balance at March 31, 2018. We used cash during the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily to fund our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. We had a working capital surplus of approximately $21.3 million in Lightbridge and approximately $4.5 million of working capital surplus in Enfission to be used for future research and development activities. Stockholders' equity at March 31, 2018 was approximately $27 million compared to stockholders’ equity of approximately $5.8 million at December 31, 2017.\nOperating Results – First Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Compared to First Quarter of Fiscal 2017\nNet losses incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately $4.7 million, $1.7 million respectively. Excluding the impact of non-cash charges for financing costs (write off of the deferred financing costs asset) of approximately $1 million and the immediate vesting of the performance-based long-term stock option grants of approximately $1.1 million, net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 would have been $2.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. (See \"About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" near the end of this release). For the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, total general and administrative expenses increased by $1.0 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due to an increase in professional fees of approximately $0.3 million, due to the increased legal work in forming the Enfission joint venture and an increase in stock-based compensation of approximately $0.7 million, due to the immediate vesting of the long-term incentive stock options granted in 2017. Total stock-based compensation included in general and administrative expenses was approximately $0.8 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total research and development expenses increased by $0.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due to cost of employees and consultants providing services to Enfission of approximately $0.2 million and an increase in stock-based compensation of approximately $0.2 million. Total research and development expenses, totaled approximately $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\n2018 First Quarter Conference Call\nLightbridge will host a conference call on Thursday, May 10 th at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the company's financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018, as well as the Company's corporate progress, Enfission’s progress and other meaningful developments.\nInterested parties can access the conference call by calling 877-407-0778 for U.S. callers, or +1-201-689-8565 for international callers.

The Company develops proprietary next generation nuclear fuel technologies for current and future reactors, which significantly enhances the economics and safety of nuclear power, operating about 1000° C cooler than standard fuel. In January 2018, Lightbridge and Framatome, Inc. formed a 50-50 joint venture, Enfission, LLC, to develop, license, manufacture, and sell nuclear fuel assemblies based on Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel technology and other advanced nuclear fuel intellectual property. Enfission has the exclusive rights to this technology and is responsible for the development of manufacturing processes and fuel assembly designs for pressurized water reactors (PWRs), boiling water reactors (BWRs), water-cooled small modular reactors, and water-cooled research reactors developed around this intellectual property. PWRs and BWRs constitute the most widely used reactor types in the world. Four large electric utilities that generate about half the nuclear power in the US already advise Lightbridge on fuel development and deployment. In addition to distributions from Enfission based on the parties’ ownership interest in the joint venture, Lightbridge anticipates receiving future licensing revenues in connection with sales by Enfission of nuclear fuel incorporating its intellectual property. Lightbridge also provides comprehensive advisory services for established and emerging nuclear programs based on a philosophy of transparency, non-proliferation, safety and operational excellence.
