Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment.\nCanaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world's bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China's push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nEbang delisted from China's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nWhile many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly.\nIn Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software.\nAnother miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern.\nIn Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalisation of $333 million.\nCanaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, IFR added.\nCredit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBitcoin mining equipment makers make computers with special chips that mine the coins more efficiently than more mainstream chips made by companies such as Intel.\n($1 = 6.3449 Chinese yuan) ($1 = 1.3314 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Fiona Lau at IFR and Jennifer Hughes; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang, Alun John and Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Edwina Gibbs)",
