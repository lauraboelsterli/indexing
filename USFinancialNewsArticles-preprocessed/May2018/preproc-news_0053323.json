Retired security tsar Zhou Yongkang became the most senior official toppled for corruption since 1949.\nChina’s top leaders have pledged to intensify a crackdown on financial risks this year. A number of senior financial officials and executives, such as Anbang Insurance Group Co’s ex-chairman Wu Xiaohui, have been jailed under that campaign.\nWang was placed under investigation by the Chinese Communist Party’s anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), in February 2017.\nThe CCDI expelled Wang from the Communist Party in July after investigations found serious violations of party discipline - a euphemism for corruption.\nThe commission said Wang tried to bribe CCDI officials during the investigation.\nIt said Wang “pursued extravagant pleasures”, took advantage of PICC facilities for private use, used company funds to pay for personal travels, and changed overseas business schedules in order to play golf. $1 = 6.3909 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Shu Zhang and Beijing Monitoring Desk Editing by Paul Tait",
