    "text": "AURORA, Ill., Westell Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:WSTL), a leading provider of high-performance wireless infrastructure solutions, today announced results for its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018 (4Q18) and its fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 (FY18). Management will host a conference call to discuss financial and business results tomorrow, Thursday, May 24, 2018 at 9:30 AM Eastern Time (details below).\n“Fiscal 2018 was a significant turn-around year for Westell. Gross margin expanded to 43.0% from 37.7%, net income improved by $15.9 million, and we generated positive operating cash flow of $6.9 million,” said Kirk Brannock, Westell’s Chairman of the Board of Directors. “While 4Q18 revenue was impacted by in-building wireless carrier spending shifts, on a FY18 year-over-year basis, sales of new public safety products grew significantly, revenue from our remote units for intelligent site management increased by a double-digit percentage, and we grew sales of integrated cabinets and power distribution products.”\n4Q18\n3 months\nended\n03/31/18 3Q18\n3 months\nended\n12/31/17 + increase /\n- decrease FY18\n12 months\nended\n03/31/18 FY17\n12 months\nended\n03/31/17 + increase /\n- decrease Revenue $11.1M $13.7M -$2.6M $58.6M $63.0M -$4.4M Gross Margin 45.5% 44.4% +1.1% 43.0% 37.7% +5.3% Operating Margin -8.5%\n0.3% -8.8% -2.5% -25.5% +23.0% Net Income -$0.9M $0.8M -$1.7M $—M -$15.9M +$15.9M Earnings Per Share -$0.06 $0.05 -$0.11 $0.00 -$1.04 +$1.04 Non-GAAP Operating Margin (1) +3.5% +10.2% -6.7% +7.1% -5.6% +12.7% Non-GAAP Net Income (1) $0.4M $1.5M -$1.1M $4.4M -$3.4M +$7.8M Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share (1) $0.03 $0.09 -$0.06 $0.28 -$0.22 +$0.50 Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (1) $0.6M $1.6M -$1.0M $4.9M -$2.1M +$7.0M Ending Cash & ST Investments $27.7M $26.0M +$1.7M $27.7M $21.8M +$5.9M (1) Please refer to the schedule at the end of this press release for a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other information related to non-GAAP financial measures. “Westell began FY19 strong with its largest beginning-of-year backlog in three years,” said Stephen John, Westell’s newly appointed President and CEO. “We are approaching the testing phase of an expanded suite of new products for the growing public safety market that we expect to introduce soon, and we continue to refresh the existing product portfolio to address the needs of the emerging network densification architecture and eventual 5G roll-outs. Also, as previously announced, we’ve added a new VP of Global Business Development and M&A to focus on expanding our product offering and customer relationships across existing and adjacent markets.”\nIn-Building Wireless (IBW) Segment\nOn a full year-over-year basis, IBW’s revenue decrease was primarily due to lower sales of commercial repeaters and DAS conditioners, partly offset by increased sales of public safety repeaters and passive system components. On a sequential quarter basis, IBW’s revenue decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our Universal DAS Interface Tray (UDIT) active DAS conditioner. For both comparative periods, IBW’s gross margin increase was primarily due to lower costs.\n4Q18\n3 months\nended\n03/31/18 3Q18\n3 months\nended\n12/31/17 + increase /\n- decrease FY18\n12 months\nended\n03/31/18 FY17\n12 months\nended\n03/31/17 + increase /\n- decrease IBW Segment Revenue $3.2M $5.2M -$2.0M $23.3M $25.9M -$2.6M IBW Segment Gross Margin 48.0% 47.3% +0.7% 45.8% 33.4% +12.4% IBW Segment R&D Expense $0.5M $0.8M -$0.3M $4.1M $6.7M -$2.6M IBW Segment Profit $1.0M $1.7M -$0.7M $6.5M $1.9M $4.6M Intelligent Site Management & Services (ISMS) Segment\nOn a full year-over-year basis, ISMS’s revenue was essentially flat, primarily as a result of increased sales of remote units offset by lower services revenue; while on a sequential quarter basis, the decrease was primarily due to lower services revenue. For both comparative periods, ISMS’s gross margin changes were driven primarily by changes in the revenue mix among remotes, software, deployment services, and support services.\n4Q18\n3 months\nended\n03/31/18 3Q18\n3 months\nended\n12/31/17 + increase /\n- decrease FY18\n12 months\nended\n03/31/18 FY17\n12 months\nended\n03/31/17 + increase /\n- decrease ISMS Segment Revenue $4.7M $5.8M -$1.1M $19.4M $19.3M $0.1M ISMS Segment Gross Margin 52.3% 54.5% -2.2% 51.5% 50.6% +0.9% ISMS Segment R&D Expense $0.6M $0.5M $0.1M $2.3M $4.0M -$1.7M ISMS Segment Profit $1.8M $2.6M -$0.8M $7.7M $5.8M $1.9M Communication Network Solutions (CNS) Segment\nOn a full year-over-year basis, CNS’s revenue decrease was primarily due to declining sales of tower mounted amplifiers and T1 network interface units, partly offset by higher integrated cabinet revenue. On a sequential quarter basis, CNS’s revenue increase was primarily driven by higher sales of integrated cabinets and power distribution products. On a full year-over-year basis, CNS’s gross margin decrease was primarily due to a less favorable mix; while on a sequential quarter basis, the increase was driven primarily by lower costs associated with excess and obsolete inventory.\n4Q18\n3 months\nended\n03/31/18 3Q18\n3 months\nended\n12/31/17 + increase /\n- decrease FY18\n12 months\nended\n03/31/18 FY17\n12 months\nended\n03/31/17 + increase /\n- decrease CNS Segment Revenue $3.2M $2.7M $0.5M $16.0M $17.7M -$1.7M CNS Segment Gross Margin 33.2% 16.9% +16.3% 28.5% 29.9% -1.4% CNS Segment R&D Expense $0.2M $0.2M $—M $1.0M $1.7M -$0.7M CNS Segment Profit $0.8M $0.2M $0.6M $3.6M $3.6M $—M Conference Call Information\nManagement will discuss financial and business results during the quarterly conference call on Thursday, May 24, 2018, at 9:30 AM Eastern Time.

The schedules above reconcile the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The adjustments share one or more of the following characteristics: they are unusual and the Company does not expect them to recur in the ordinary course of its business; they do not involve the expenditure of cash; they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course; or their magnitude and timing is largely outside of the Company's control. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial information provides meaningful supplemental information to investors. Management also believes the non-GAAP financial information reflects the Company's core ongoing operating performance and facilitates comparisons across reporting periods. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company's GAAP results.\nFootnotes:\n(1) On April 1, 2013, the Company purchased Kentrox. The acquisition required the step-down on acquired deferred revenue, which resulted in lower revenue that will not recur once those liabilities have fully settled. The adjustment removes the step-down on acquired deferred revenue that was recognized.\n(2) Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense incurred in accordance with share-based compensation accounting standards.\n(3) Non-recurring excess and obsolete inventory charges on inventory and firm purchase commitments associated with the previously announced strategic decision related to the discontinuation of ClearLink DAS.\n(4) Non-cash impairment related to tangible long-lived assets associated with the previously announced strategic decision related to the discontinuation of ClearLink DAS.\n(5) Amortization of intangibles is a non-cash expense arising from previously acquired intangible assets.\n(6) Restructuring expenses are not directly related to the ongoing performance of our fundamental business operations, including costs relating to abandonment of excess office space at our headquarters and in New Hampshire, and severance costs for terminated employees. This adjustment also includes severance benefits related to the departure of certain former executives.\n(7) EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA.\n(8) Non-recurring foreign currency translation gain related to the wind-up of the NoranTel legal entity during the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\n(9) Adjustment removes one-time tax effect of changes in valuation allowance reserves associated with previously generated alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nFor additional information, contact:\nTom Minichiello\nChief Financial Officer\nWestell Technologies, Inc.\n+1 (630) 375-4740\ntminichiello@westell.com\nSource:Westell Technologies, Inc.",
