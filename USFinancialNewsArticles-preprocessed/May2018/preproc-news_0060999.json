    "text": "KITCHENER, Ontario, May 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nFirst Quarter Highlights :\nUnseasonably cold and wet spring drove industry volume down by 6%\nNet revenue, excluding one-time adjustments of $3.59 million was $10.6 million, from $11.5 million in the prior year\nThe Beer Store (“TBS”), the Company’s largest customer, mandated a move from a buy/sell to a consignment-based system resulting in a one-time gross profit decrease of $2.2 million.\nSelling, Marketing and Administration (“SM&A”) expenses were $2.1 million consistent with $2.1 million in the prior year.\nEBITDA* of $1.13 million excluding one-time adjustments, compared to $2.4 million prior year.\nBrick Brewing Co. Limited (“Brick” or the “Company”) (TSX: BRB), Ontario’s largest Canadian-owned brewery, today released financial results for the first quarter which ended April 29, 2018. Brick reported EBITDA of $1.13 million on net revenue of $10.6 million, excluding the impact of one-time adjustments. EBITDA was negatively impacted by $0.11 million in one-time warehousing and shunting costs to build inventory related to the can line upgrade and net revenue and EBITDA were negatively impacted by $3.59 million and $2.2 million, respectively, due to the mandated transition by TBS to consignment-based inventory.\nGeorge Croft, Brick’s President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “Our EBITDA results in the first quarter fell short of our expectations. The overall beer category experienced softness driven by an unseasonably cold and wet spring which drove the industry volume lower by 6%. The beer category also experienced headwinds from increased government taxes and TBS distribution rates, driving a 2% decrease in net revenue during the quarter. Brick’s lead brands performed better than the norm, Waterloo family grew 6%, Laker family declined 3%, while our summer-themed brands LandShark and Margaritaville were especially vulnerable to the prolonged winter and decreased by 17%.”\n“April 2018 saw the completion of the installation of our can line upgrade project – both on time and on budget.” commented Russell Tabata, Brick’s Chief Operating Officer. “The ramp up of the new can equipment has exceeded our early expectations and, as of the end of the quarter, the new equipment is operating consistently at or above our targeted rates which has effectively doubled the line’s capacity. We expect our new can line capability to be the cornerstone of our future success and business growth.”\nCroft added, “We do not see these results as indicative of our full year performance. We are now entering our peak summer selling period and we are working hard to regain our momentum. With the launch of our new Laker packaging design, our Landshark promotions, our Waterloo seasonal offerings and the exciting Chudleigh’s cider launch, we are positioned well for success. The positive start up of the can line will offer new opportunities for both our owner brands as well as for our co-packing customers. We are now well positioned to compete in the competitive Canadian beer market and to serve our customers for the long term.”\nBrick’s board of directors has also approved a quarterly dividend of $0.02/share. The dividend is payable July 24, 2018 to shareholders of record as of July 10, 2018.\nReconciliation of Net Earnings to Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization, and Share Based Payments (EBITDA)*\nQuarter ended\n(in thousands of dollars) April 29, 2018 April 30, 2017 Net income $ (1,851 ) $ 787 Add (deduct): Income tax expense (737\n) 306 Depreciation and amortization 1,010 817 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 251 - Share-based payments 83 43 Finance costs 77 100 Subtotal 684 1,266 EBITDA* (1,167\n) 2,053\nSTATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nQuarters ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017\nQuarter ended\nApril 29, 2018 April 30, 2017 Revenue $ 7,011,987 $ 11,480,470 Cost of sales 6,911,118 7,995,399 Gross profit 100,869 3,485,071\nSelling, marketing and administration expenses 2,117,937 2,118,307 Other expenses 242,587 173,577 Finance costs 76,587 100,469 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 251,405 - Income (loss) before tax (2,587,647 ) 1,092,718\nIncome tax expense (recovery) (736,500 ) 305,961 Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the quarter $ (1,851,147 ) $ 786,757 Basic earnings (loss) per share $ (0.05 ) $ 0.02 Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.05 ) $ 0.02\nSTATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at April 29, 2018 and January 31, 2018\nApril 29, 2018 January 31, 2018 ASSETS Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment $ 27,469,295 $ 27,119,488 Intangible assets 15,337,639 15,381,578 Construction deposits 1,785,794 323,255 44,592,728 42,824,321 Current assets Accounts receivable 7,879,032 6,999,212 Inventories 11,534,589 7,891,364 Prepaid expenses 563,568 613,710 19,977,189 15,504,286 TOTAL ASSETS $ 64,569,917 $ 58,328,607 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Equity Share capital $ 39,795,322 $ 39,747,525 Share-based payments reserves 1,043,027 1,026,667 Deficit (4,398,893 ) (2,547,746 ) TOTAL EQUITY 36,439,456 38,226,446 Non-current liabilities Provisions 546,439 538,376 Obligation under finance lease 2,814,794 3,011,893 Long-term debt 5,700,507 6,019,245 Deferred income tax liability 389,964 1,126,464 9,451,704 10,695,978 Current liabilities Bank indebtedness 2,086,280 787,843 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 14,495,567 6,516,382 Current portion of obligation under finance lease 777,300 769,962 Current portion of long-term debt 1,319,610 1,331,996 18,678,757 9,406,183 TOTAL LIABILITIES 28,130,461 20,102,161 COMMITMENTS TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY $ 64,569,917 $ 58,328,607\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nQuarters ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017\nQuarter ended April 29, 2018 April 30, 2017 Operating activities Net income (loss) $ (1,851,147 ) $ 786,757 Adjustments for: Income tax expense (recovery) (736,500 ) 305,961 Finance costs 76,587 100,469 Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangibles 1,010,085 816,600 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 251,405 - Share-based payments 82,667 43,104 Change in non-cash working capital related to operations 3,556,941 (2,715,305 ) Less: Interest paid (116,429 ) (107,751 ) Cash provided by (used in) operating activities 2,273,609 (770,165 ) Investing activities Purchase of property, plant and equipment (1,842,879 ) (2,995,895 ) Construction deposit paid (1,462,539 ) - Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 280,000 - Purchase of intangible assets (4,479 ) (190,150 ) Cash used in investing activities (3,029,897 ) (3,186,045 ) Financing activities Increase in bank indebtedness 1,298,438 - Issuance of long-term debt - 2,000,000 Repayment of long-term debt (333,879 ) (183,761 ) Repayment of obligation under finance lease (189,761 ) (182,695 ) Issuance of shares, net of fees - 5,173 Shares repurchased and cancelled, including fees - (322,629 ) Stock option costs (18,510 ) - Proceeds from stock option exercise - 64,774 Cash provided by financing activities 756,288 1,380,862 Net increase/(decrease) in cash - (2,575,348 ) Cash, beginning of the period - 2,831,959 Cash, end of the period $ - $ 256,611\nAbout Brick Brewing\nBrick is Ontario's largest Canadian-owned brewery.

Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"anticipate\", \"seek\", \"plan\", \"believe\" or \"continue\" or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Although the Corporation believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which are not guarantees and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which may cause actual performance and financial results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only at the date of this press release and, except as required by applicable securities laws, the Corporation does not undertake to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, future events or otherwise.\n* EBITDA is a non-IFRS earnings measure, therefore it does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards and may not be similar to measures presented by other companies. EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, loss on disposal of property, plant, and equipment, and share based payments. Management uses this measurement to evaluate the operating results of the Company. This measure is also important to management since it is used by the Company’s lenders to evaluate the ongoing cash generating capability of the Company and therefore the amounts those lenders are willing to lend to the Company. Investors find EBITDA to be useful information because it provides a measure of the Company’s operating performance.\nContact Information\nFor further information:\nDavid Birch, Chief Financial Officer\n(519) 742-2732 Ext. 106\nE-mail: info@brickbeer.com\nSource:Brick Brewing Co.
