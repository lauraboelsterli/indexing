    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 2:08 PM / in 18 minutes UPDATE 1-Equatorial Guinea LNG project stumbles again as Schlumberger quits Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\n(Combines with Ophir, adds project details, background)\nLONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - A pioneering liquefied natural gas project in Equatorial Guinea, bogged down by delayed financing, ran into further trouble after U.S. oil services company Schlumberger pulled out of the venture, two other operators said on Thursday.\nOphir Energy, the London-based company heading the Fortuna development, and Golar LNG, which operates floating LNG facilities, said Schlumberger had decided to withdraw due to problems with the project’s financing.\nSchlumberger was not immediately available for comment.\nThe Fortuna development would be west Africa’s first deepwater LNG project and includes a pioneering design for the infrastructure in the form of a floating terminal that liquefies gas offshore, not onshore as usual.\nReuters reported earlier this month the growing frustration of Equatorial Guinea’s government at the delays and its ultimatum to take the project off Ophir or scrap it altogether.\nGolar LNG participated in Fortuna as part of the OneLNG joint venture it had established with Schlumberger.\n“Despite an agreed development plan and extensive efforts over the last 12 months by OneLNG and Ophir management, it has not been possible to finalise an attractive debt financing package,” Golar said in a statement.\n“This, together with other capital and resource priorities, has resulted in a decision from Schlumberger to end their participation in the project,” it said.\nOphir said it and Golar were both actively engaged in talks on financing the project. Ophir also suggested it was close to finding a new partner to replace Schlumberger.\n“Ophir has already held informal discussions with other, well-capitalised, potential partners for our Fortuna project,” it said. “Following (Golar’s) announcement ... we have now formalised discussions and are actively moving forward with them.”\nOphir replaced its chief executive, Nicholas Cooper, this month in a bid to get its strategy back on track. Its shares were down almost 10 percent at 56.9 pounds each at 1345 GMT while Golar’s shares fell 18 percent to $28.35.
