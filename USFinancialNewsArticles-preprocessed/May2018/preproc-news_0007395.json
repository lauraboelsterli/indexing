Disclaimers\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Definitions\nThe Company has used non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G in this press release. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in this release.\nFunds from operations (“FFO”): The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in in-substance real estate investments and sales of depreciable operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), less distributions to noncontrolling interests and gains/losses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nCore FFO and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”): Core FFO and AFFO are Company defined measures. CORE FFO is presented excluding transaction costs, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, other-than-temporary impairments on retained bonds, mark-to-market on interest rate swaps, and one-time charges. AFFO of the Company also excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of market lease intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs and non-cash interest, amortization of free rent received at property acquisition, straight-line rent, and other adjustments including non-real estate depreciation and amortization and straight line rent related to corporate office leases. The Company believes that Core FFO and AFFO are useful supplemental measures regarding the Company's operating performances as they provide a meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company's operating performance and allow investors to more easily compare the Company's operating results.\nFFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as indications of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity, nor are they entirely indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Our calculations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\nNet Debt / Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Net Debt / Adjusted EBITDA\"): The Company calculates Net Debt / Adjusted EBITDA as total debt outstanding less cash and cash equivalents divided by Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as the net income or loss attributable to Gramercy Property Trust determined in accordance with GAAP (before preferred share dividends) for such period plus (i) income (loss) attributed to noncontrolling interest, (ii) interest expense, (iii) provision for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes payable, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) non-cash share-based compensation, (vi) gains and losses attributable to the early extinguishment of indebtedness, (vii) other-than-temporary impairments on retained CDO bonds, (viii) amortization of lease inducement costs, (ix) transaction costs, (x) impairment of real estate investments, (xi) loss (income) from discontinued operations, and (xii) amortization of free rent received at property acquisitions, less net gains on disposals. Adjusted EBITDA is then adjusted as if all acquisitions and dispositions occurred on the first day of the quarter and to include the Company’s ownership share of the net income or loss of all unconsolidated equity investments, determined and adjusted in the same manner as provided above in this definition.\nForward-looking Information\nThis press release contains forward-looking information based upon the Company's current best judgment and expectations.
