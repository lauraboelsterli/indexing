View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006452/en/\nHilton Grand Vacations Inc. today reports its first-quarter 2018 results. (Graphic: Business Wire)\nFirst-quarter results reflect the adoption of ASC 606 and may not be directly comparable to prior periods. Adoption of ASC 606 reduced first-quarter reported revenues and operating expenses by $63 million and $30 million, respectively. Diluted EPS was $0.30 and net income was $30 million . Adjusted EBITDA was $62 million . Contract sales increased 14.6 percent from the same period in 2017. Net Owner Growth (NOG) for the 12 months ending March 31, 2018, was 7.1 percent. HNA HLT Holdco I LLC, an affiliate of HNA Tourism Group Co., Ltd., completed the sale of its entire 24.75 million holdings of HGV shares, including 2.5 million shares that were repurchased by the Company. HGV formed a joint venture with Strand Capital Group, LLC, to develop its first resort in Charleston, South Carolina. Overview\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, diluted EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.51 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income was $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $50 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and adjusted EBITDA was $62 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and $94 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAdoption of ASC 606 reduced net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, by $24 million, or EPS of $0.24 per diluted share, compared to the previous accounting guidance. The comparable impact on adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $33 million.\nTotal revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $367 million, compared to $399 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adoption of ASC 606 reduced first-quarter reported revenues by $63 million.\n“2018 is off to a strong start as we saw solid first-quarter operating performance across all of our businesses, including mid-teens growth in both contract sales and resort and club segment adjusted EBITDA,” says Mark Wang, president and CEO of Hilton Grand Vacations. “Given this momentum and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are raising our full-year contract sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance. We just announced our new project in Charleston and feel great about our development momentum and the record number of projects we expect to launch this year.”\nSegment Highlights – First Quarter\nReal Estate Sales and Financing\nReal estate sales and financing segment revenue was $241 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 14.8 percent compared to the same period in 2017. Real estate sales and financing segment adjusted EBITDA was $44 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $83 million in the same period in 2017. Real estate sales and financing segment adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of real estate sales and financing segment revenues was 18.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 29.3 percent for the same period in 2017.\nContract sales were $329 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 14.6 percent compared to the same period in 2017. Fee-for-service contract sales represented 51.7 percent of total contract sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 60.3 percent in the same period in 2017. Tours increased 7.3 percent to 77,700 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. Volume Per Guest (VPG) of 2018 was $3,997, an increase of 7.0 percent compared to the same period in 2017.\nFirst-quarter results reflect the adoption of ASC 606, which has a significant impact on how the Company recognizes revenues. Under ASC 606, HGV defers the recognition of revenue and all related direct expenses for sales of Vacation Ownership Intervals (VOIs) under construction until construction is complete. Previously, the Company had recognized these revenues and expenses using the percentage of completion method. In the first quarter of 2018, HGV deferred recognition of $59 million of sales of VOIs, net, and $26 million of related direct expenses.\nFinancing revenues were $38 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 8.6 percent compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe weighted average FICO score of new loans made to U.S. and Canadian borrowers at the time of origination was 750 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 743 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, 63.6 percent of HGV’s sales were to customers who financed part of their purchase.\nAs of March 31, 2018, gross timeshare financing receivables were $1.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 12.2 percent and a weighted average remaining term of 7.7 years. As of March 31, 2018, 2.4 percent of HGV’s financing receivables were more than 30 days past due and not in default.\nResort Operations and Club Management\nResort operations and club management segment revenue was $98 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11.4 percent compared to the same period in 2017. Resort operations and club management segment adjusted EBITDA was $59 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $51 million in the same period in 2017. Resort operations and club management segment adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of resort operations and club management segment revenues was 60.2 percent in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 58.0 percent for the same period in 2017.\nInventory\nAs of March 31, 2018, the estimated contract sales value of HGV’s pipeline of available inventory was approximately $6.5 billion at current pricing or approximately 4.9 years of sales at the current trailing 12-month sales pace. As of March 31, 2018, the estimated contract sales value of HGV’s pipeline of available owned inventory was approximately $3.6 billion or approximately 2.7 years of sales. As of March 31, 2018, the estimated contract sales value of HGV’s pipeline of available fee-for-service inventory was approximately $2.9 billion or approximately 2.2 years of sales.\nOf the current pipeline of available inventory, 45 percent is considered just-in-time and 44 percent is considered fee-for-service. As such, the Company considers 89 percent of the pipeline of available inventory as of March 31, 2018, to be from capital-efficient sources.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, HGV had $479 million of corporate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4 percent and $544 million of non-recourse debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5 percent.\nTotal cash was $154 million as of March 31, 2018, including $69 million of restricted cash.\nFree cash flow, which the Company defines as cash from operating activities, less non-inventory capital spending, was $7 million for the three months ending March 31, 2018, compared to $125 million for the three months ending March 31, 2017. Adjusted free cash flow, which the Company defines as free cash flow less non-recourse debt activity, net was ($32) million for the three months ending March 31, 2018, compared to $131 million for the three months ending March 31, 2017.\nNew Accounting Standards and Adjusted Results\nHGV adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) on Jan. 1, 2018, under the modified retrospective method of adoption. The following are some of the significant changes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue and direct expense related to sales of VOIs under construction will be recognized when construction is completed, as opposed to recognizing revenue and related expenses under a percentage of completion method; Revenue on prepaid discounted vacation packages will be recognized proportionately as packages are redeemed, as opposed to when the likelihood of redemption is considered remote; and Revenue and expense related to certain sales incentives where HGV acts as the agent will be recognized on a net basis, as opposed to recognized on a gross basis.\nThe following tables show the estimated impacts that the ASC 606 adjustments would have had to HGV’s quarterly and annual 2017 operating results, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, if HGV had adopted ASC 606 utilizing the full retrospective method of adoption.\n2017 Results Prior to ASC 606 First Second Third Fourth Full ($ in millions, except per share data)\nQuarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year Total revenues $ 399 $ 439 $ 426 $ 447 $ 1,711 Total operating expenses 316 348 350 360 1,374 Net income 50 51 43 183 327 Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.51 $ 0.51 $ 0.43 $ 1.85 $ 3.30 Diluted $ 0.51 $ 0.51 $ 0.43 $ 1.83 $ 3.28 Net income $ 50 $ 51 $ 43 $ 183 $ 327 Interest expense 7 7 7 6 27 Income tax expense (benefit) 26 33 28 (103 ) (16 ) Depreciation and amortization 7 7 7 8 29 Interest expense, depreciation and amortization included in equity in earnings from\nunconsolidated entities\n— — 2 1 3 EBITDA 90 98 87 95 370 Other (gain) loss, net — — (1 ) 1 — Share-based compensation expense 3 5 5 2 15 Other adjustment items (1) 1 3 3 3 10 Adjusted EBITDA $ 94 $ 106 $ 94 $ 101 $ 395 (1)\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, amount includes $8 million of costs associated with the spin-off transaction. 2017 Results Adjusted for ASC 606 Adoption First Second Third Fourth Full (in millions, except per share data)\nQuarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year Total revenues $ 387 $ 414 $ 411 $ 424 $ 1,636 Total operating expenses 307 340 342 344 1,333 Net income 47 41 39 166 293 Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.48 $ 0.41 $ 0.39 $ 1.67 $ 2.95 Diluted $ 0.48 $ 0.41 $ 0.39 $ 1.66 $ 2.94 Net income $ 47 $ 41 $ 39 $ 166 $ 293 Interest expense 7 7 7 6 27 Income tax expense (benefit) 26 26 25 (92 ) (15 ) Depreciation and amortization 7 7 7 6 27 Interest expense, depreciation and amortization included in equity in earnings from\nunconsolidated affiliates\n— — 2 1 3 EBITDA 87 81 80 87 335 Other (gain) loss, net — — (1 ) 1 — Share-based compensation expense 3 5 5 2 15 Other adjustment items (1) 1 3 3 5 12 Adjusted EBITDA $ 91 $ 89 $ 87 $ 95 $ 362 (1)\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, amount includes $8 million of costs associated with the spin-off transaction.

Net income is projected to be between $290 million and $306 million. EPS is projected to be between $2.93 and $3.09. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $485 million and $505 million, which includes $68 million of net deferral impact related to a project under construction in 2017 due to the adoption of ASC 606. Full-year contract sales are expected to increase between 8 percent and 10 percent. Fee-for-service contract sales are expected to be between 50 percent and 55 percent of full-year contract sales. Free cash flow is projected to be between ($235) million and ($275) million. Adjusted free cash flow is projected to be between ($75) million and ($125) million. (1) Inventory spending, which is included in cash flow from operating activities, is projected to be between $510 million and $530 million. In addition to ongoing and previously announced projects and initiatives, this amount includes approximately $390 million of anticipated spending on new projects during 2018 that have not yet been announced.\n(1)\nAdjusted free cash flow represents free cash flow less non-recourse debt activity, net Transactions and Other Events\nDuring the first quarter, HGV formed a joint venture with Strand Capital Group, LLC, to own and develop a 100-unit timeshare resort in Charleston, South Carolina. HGV will invest a total of $10 million for a 50 percent interest in the joint venture, but because HGV is not the primary beneficiary, it will not consolidate the entity. Liberty Place Charleston by Hilton Club will be the fifth property developed in collaboration with Strand in South Carolina as well as HGV and Strand’s first joint venture as development partners. Construction is expected to begin in the fourth quarter 2018, with completion in the second quarter of 2020. Sales are expected to commence in early 2019. In addition to its ownership stake, HGV will market, sell and manage the property under a fee-for-service agreement with the joint venture.\nOn March 13, 2018, HNA HLT Holdco I LLC, an affiliate of HNA Tourism Group Co., Ltd., amended the existing Stockholders Agreement dated Oct. 24, 2016, to permit the sale of up to all 24,750,000 shares of HGV common stock prior to the expiration of an existing two-year restricted period, granted HGV the right to repurchase up to 4,340,000 shares of common stock from the seller, and eliminated HNA’s right to designate a certain number of directors to HGV’s board of directors. On March 14, 2018, HGV announced that HNA had priced an underwritten secondary offer of 22,250,000 shares at $46.25 per share. HGV did not offer any shares of common stock in the offering nor receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in the offering. Concurrent with the offering, HGV repurchased 2,500,000 shares of its common stock for a negotiated price of $44.75 per share, which is the same price at which the underwriters purchased shares from the selling stockholder. These shares were retired. Subsequent to the offering, both members of the board of directors appointed by HNA resigned. At present, HGV does not intend to nominate new directors to fill those positions and intends to maintain an eight-member board.\nConference Call\nHilton Grand Vacations will host a conference call on May 3, 2018, at 11 a.m. (EDT) to discuss first-quarter results.

Adjusted EBITDA, presented herein, is calculated as EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including, but not limited to, gains, losses and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings/retirements; (iv) non-cash impairment losses; (v) reorganization costs, including severance and relocation costs; (vi) share-based and certain other compensation expenses; (vii) costs related to the spin-off; and (viii) other items.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our definitions of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nHGV believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense (excluding interest expense on non-recourse debt), or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for future replacements of assets that are being depreciated and amortized; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may be calculated differently from other companies in our industry limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.\nReal Estate Metrics\nContract sales represents the total amount of VOI products under purchase agreements signed during the period where HGV has received a down payment of at least 10 percent of the contract price. Contract sales is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to Sales of VOIs, net or any other comparable operating measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Contract sales differ from revenues from the Sales of VOIs, net that HGV reports in its consolidated statements of operations due to the requirements for revenue recognition as described in Note 2: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements, as well as adjustments for incentives and other administrative fee revenues. HGV considers contract sales to be an important operating measure because it reflects the pace of sales in HGV’s business.\nDeveloped Inventory refers to VOI inventory source from projects the Company develops.\nFee-for-Service Inventory refers to VOI inventory HGV sells and manages on behalf of first-party developers.\nJust-in-Time Inventory refers to VOI inventory primarily sourced in transactions that are designed to closely correlate the timing of the acquisition with HGV’s sale of that inventory to purchasers.\nNOG or Net Owner Growth represents the year-over-year change in membership.\nReal estate margin represents sales revenue less the cost of VOI sales and sales and marketing costs, net of marketing revenue. Real estate margin percentage is calculated by dividing real estate margin by sales revenue. HGV considers this to be an important operating measure because it measures the efficiency of the Company’s sales and marketing spending and management of inventory costs.\nSales revenue represents sale of VOIs, net and commissions and brand fees earned from the sale of fee-for-service intervals.\nTour flow represents the number of sales presentations given at HGV’s sales centers during the period.\nVolume per guest (“VPG”) represents the sales attributable to tours at HGV’s sales locations and is calculated by dividing Contract sales, excluding telesales, by tour flow. The Company considers VPG to be an important operating measure because it measures the effectiveness of HGV’s sales process, combining the average transaction price with closing rate.\nFree cash flow represents cash from operating activities adjusted for share based compensation, less non-inventory capital spending.\nAdjusted free cash flow represents free cash flow less non-recourse debt activities, net.\nResort and Club Management and Rental Metrics\nTransient rate represents the total rental room revenue for transient guests divided by total number of transient room nights sold in a given period and excludes room rentals associated with marketing programs, owner usage and the redemption of Club Bonus Points.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REAL ESTATE MARGIN (in millions) 2017 First\nQuarter\nSecond\nQuarter\nThird\nQuarter\nFourth\nQuarter\nFull Year\nSales of VOIs, net $ 118 $ 143 $ 145 $ 142 $ 548 Sales, marketing, brand and other fees 130 144 127 143 544 Less: Marketing revenue and other fees 32 43 34 36 145 Sales revenue 216 244 238 249 947 Less: Cost of VOI sales 33 34 40 41 148 Sales and marketing expense, net (1) 112 120 132 128 492 Real estate margin $ 71 $ 90 $ 66 $ 80 $ 307 Real estate margin percentage 32.9 % 36.9 % 27.7 % 32.1 % 32.4 % (1) Includes revenue recognized through our marketing programs for existing owners and prospective first-time buyers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, HGV revised its definition of Sales and marketing expense, net to include revenues associated with sales incentives, title service and document compliance revenue to better align with how the Company evaluates the results of its real estate operations. This adjustment was retrospectively applied to prior period(s) to conform with the current presentation.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006452/en/\nHilton Grand Vacations Inc.\nInvestor Contact:\nRobert LaFleur, 407-613-3327\nRobert.Lafleur@hgv.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nErin Pagán, 407-613-3771\nErin.Pagan@hgv.com\nSource: Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.",
