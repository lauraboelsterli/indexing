    "text": "Reblog : A U.S. transportation-safety agency said it would begin examining the fiery crash of a Tesla Model S car that killed two teenagers in Florida Tuesday evening, marking the fourth active federal probe involving the company’s vehicles. : Ford reiterated its bleak full-year profit outlook after suspending F-150 production at two assembly plants following a fire last week at one of its supplier’s facilities that created a parts shortage. : The media company posted lower revenue, as higher distributor fees failed to offset a fall in advertising revenue compared with a Super Bowl-boosted quarter a year ago.",
