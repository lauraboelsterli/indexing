Revenue also came in above forecasts. Comparable-store sales fell more than expected, but Dick's also raised its full-year outlook largely above Street's forecast.\nTarget – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch added the retailer's stock to its US 1 List, noting a number of initiatives that it feels will drive comparable-store sales higher.\nSalesforce.com – Salesforce reported adjusted quarterly profit of 35 cents per share , beating estimates by 2 cents a share.

Separately, the company named Steve Fieler as its new chief financial officer, replacing Cathie Lesjak who will become interim chief operating officer.\nNovo Nordisk – The European drugmaker said its oral diabetes drug did better in a study at lower blood sugar levels than competitor Jardiance , a treatment made by Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly .\nMichael Kors – The luxury goods retailer earned an adjusted 63 cents per share for its latest quarter , 3 cents a share above estimates. Revenue topping forecasts, as comparable-store sales rose 2.3 percent, versus an expected drop. The company's earnings forecast of $4.65 to $4.75 per share fell largely below the consensus estimate of $4.74 a share.\nDSW – The shoe retailer reported adjusted quarterly profit of 39 cents per share, 2 cents a share above estimates. Revenue and comparable-store sales also exceeded forecasts. However, DSW left its full-year forecast unchanged at $1.52 to $1.67 per share, compared to the consensus estimate of $1.63 a share.\nMovado Group – The watchmaker and distributor reported quarterly profit of 37 cents per share, well above the 11 cents a share consensus estimate.

Meridian operates in Illinois and Michigan, and is the leading Medicaid provider in Michigan.\nAbbVie – The drugmaker was downgraded to \"underperform\" from \"neutral\" at Credit Suisse, amid concerns about AbbVie's best-selling Humira drug. The firm notes the upcoming entry of multiple biosimilars coming on the market that will erode Humira's sales.\nExxon Mobil – Exxon Mobil was upgraded to \"outperform\" from \"sector perform\" at RBC Capital , which points to potential dividend growth as well as superior returns.\nKKR – The private-equity firm will reportedly pay $8.3 billion to buy privately held BMC Software, according to the New York Post. The deal was announced Tuesday morning , but terms were not disclosed.\nG-III Apparel – The apparel maker was upgraded to \"outperform\" from \"market perform\" at Cowen, which thinks that current Street earnings forecasts are too conservative given expanding profitability at Donna Karan among other factors.\nPolaris Industries – The recreational vehicle maker is buying privately held Boat Holdings – the leading U.S. manufacturer of pontoon boats – in an all-cash transaction valued at $805 million. Polaris will pay $705 million and will accrue about $100 million in net tax benefits. Peter Schacknow Senior Producer, CNBC Related Securities ",
