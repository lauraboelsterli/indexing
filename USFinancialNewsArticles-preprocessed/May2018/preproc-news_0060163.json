    "text": "DUEREN, Germany, May 30 (Reuters) - Deutsche Post DHL is on the way to doubling production of its Streetscooter electric van to 20,000 per year after opening a new production site in Germany, it said on Wednesday.\nDeutsche Post developed the Streetscooter for internal use to keep emissions low as online shopping results in more demand for parcel deliveries, but demand from other companies for the van has pushed it to boost production.\nThe new production site in Dueren, north western Germany, will be able to produce around 10,000 per year and joins another factory in Aachen.\nDeutsche Post currently uses over 6,000 Streetscooter vans itself.\nOn Monday, it won a contract to deliver 200 electric trucks to a British company that delivers bottles of milk to homes.\nReporting by Matthias Inverardi Writing by Victoria Bryan Editing by Ludwig Burger\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
