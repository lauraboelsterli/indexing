REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\nThe European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was 1.2 percent year-on-year in April.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected the rate to be unchanged from March’s 1.3 percent.\nEven if inflation remains short of the ECB’s target of near 2 percent, its policymakers have been debating whether to end the central bank’s 2.55 trillion euro ($3.06 trillion) asset purchase scheme.\nA decision on future moves is likely to be communicated in June or July, with September an outside possibility.\nPrices of food, alcohol and tobacco, of energy and of non-energy industrial goods all rose at a faster year-on-year pace than in March.\nHowever, prices of services were only 1.0 percent higher, compared with a 1.5 percent increase in March\nCore inflation measures of inflation, which the ECB also looks to as a guide, were also below expectations.\nThe measure that strips out the volatile prices of energy and unprocessed food, was 1.1 percent year-on-year in April from 1.3 percent in March and against an expected 1.2 percent rate.\nThe core inflation measure that many market economists look at, which also excludes the prices of alcohol and tobacco, also slipped to 0.7 percent from 1.0 percent in March. Economists had forecast it would be 0.9 percent.\nEurostat’s flash estimate for the month does not include a monthly calculation.\nSeparately on Wednesday, Eurostat reported that prices at factory gates in the euro zone rose 0.1 percent in March from February and by 2.1 percent year-on-year. Compared with a year earlier, energy prices were up the most.\nFor details of Eurostat data click on:",
