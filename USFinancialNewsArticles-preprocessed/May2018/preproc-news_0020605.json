    "text": "LAS VEGAS, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PNK) (\"Pinnacle\" or the \"Company\") today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The results reflect the Company’s adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (\"ASC 606\"), effective January 1, 2018. The Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method, therefore, prior period amounts have not been adjusted.\n2018 First Quarter Highlights:\nNet revenues decreased by $11.6 million or 1.8% year over year to $628.4 million. Net income increased by $4.6 million to $21.8 million from $17.2 million in the prior year period, while the related margin increased to 3.5% from 2.7% in the prior year period. GAAP diluted net income per share was $0.35 versus $0.28 in the prior year period. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR increased by $2.8 million or 1.6% year over year to $177.7 million from $174.9 million in the prior year period. The prior year period included an out of period adjustment related to Ameristar Kansas City that decreased net revenues and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR by $3.2 million. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR margin increased by 100 basis points year over year to 28.3%. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR and margin expansion were led by strong performance of L'Auberge Lake Charles, Ameristar Black Hawk, and Horseshu and Cactus Petes in Jackpot, Nevada. 2018 first quarter financial results were negatively impacted by adverse winter weather conditions, principally across the businesses in the Company's Midwest segment, as well as closures and clean-up costs related to the flooding of the Ohio River at Belterra Park and Belterra Resort in February. The number of operating days affected by adverse winter weather conditions in the 2018 first quarter increased by 120% year over year. Management estimates that these events reduced 2018 first quarter Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR by approximately $9.8 million. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, net of Lease Payments, was $76.8 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 1.7% year over year.\nAdditional Highlights:\nAt a special meeting held on March 29, 2018, Pinnacle stockholders approved the acquisition of the Company by Penn National Gaming, Inc. (\"Penn National\") by voting affirmatively to adopt the merger agreement for the transaction. Additionally, on that same day, the stockholders of Penn National approved the acquisition of Pinnacle by voting affirmatively for the issuance of Penn National’s common stock to Pinnacle stockholders as consideration in the proposed transaction. The proposed transaction has been approved by gaming regulators in Illinois, Mississippi, Pennsylvania (Gaming Control Board and Racing Commission) and West Virginia. The transaction is subject to remaining regulatory approvals and expected to close in the second half of 2018. The Company repaid $17.7 million of Conventional Debt in the 2018 first quarter, reducing the Company's Conventional Debt balance to $804.1 million as of March 31, 2018.\nSummary of First Quarter Results\nThree months ended March 31, (amounts in thousands, except per share data, unaudited) 2018 2017 Net revenues $628,395 $639,974 Net income (1) $21,794 $17,208 Net income margin (1) 3.5% 2.7% Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR (2) $177,663 $174,855 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR margin (2) 28.3% 27.3% Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, net of Lease Payments (2) $76,834 $75,538 Operating income (1) $115,337 $111,011 Net income attributable to Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. $21,943 $17,217 Diluted net income per share $0.35 $0.28 Net income and operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include $1.8 million in pre-opening, development and other costs and $2.4 million of write-downs, reserves and recoveries, net, versus $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in the prior year period. For a further description of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR margin and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, net of Lease Payments, see the Glossary of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the reconciliations to the GAAP equivalent financial measures below.\nAnthony Sanfilippo, Chief Executive Officer of Pinnacle Entertainment, commented, \"We are pleased with our 2018 first quarter performance. The results delivered by our team members were noteworthy, particularly in light of the challenges we faced in the first quarter.\n\"Our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR increased by $2.8 million or 1.6% year over year to $177.7 million, despite an $11.6 million or 1.8% decline in net revenues. Harsher winter weather conditions and flooding across our portfolio of businesses, particularly in February, were the factors that drove the decline of our revenues, with the number of operating days affected by adverse weather events more than doubling in the 2018 first quarter relative to the prior year period. Flooding of the Ohio River caused the closure of both Belterra Park and Belterra Resort in February, for 11 days and 7 days, respectively. In aggregate, we estimate these factors had an unfavorable impact of $9.8 million on Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR. We successfully managed our business to match the revenue environment we experienced. Our management of variable expenses offset the revenue decline and we achieved Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR growth and margin expansion in the quarter. The rebound in our business we began to see as winter weather conditions abated in March has continued into the 2018 second quarter.\n“While the execution on our cost structure in the 2018 first quarter was widespread throughout our portfolio, there were some exceptional individual business performances at L'Auberge Lake Charles, Ameristar Black Hawk, and Cactus Petes. L'Auberge Lake Charles grew its net revenues by 7.5%, Adjusted EBITDAR by 31.1% and expanded its margins by 610 basis points. While a portion of this growth is attributable to low table games hold percentage in the prior year period, we continue to profitably grow revenues. Ameristar Black Hawk produced another terrific quarter with net revenue growth of 5.7%, Adjusted EBITDAR growth of 9.3%, and Adjusted EBITDAR margin expansion of 140 basis points. Ameristar Black Hawk continues to benefit from our multi-year effort to reposition it as the premier gaming entertainment destination resort in the broader Denver market. In December 2017, we extended this strategy with the opening of an immersive central entertainment venue called Bar 8042, which has been very well received by our guests. Our properties in Jackpot, Nevada, which includes Horseshu and Cactus Petes, generated net revenue growth of 9.5%, Adjusted EBITDAR growth of 31.8% and margin expansion of 540 basis points as this business grows its profitable revenue streams while maintaining discipline on its cost structure.\n“In the 2018 first quarter, we made significant progress on the approximate $20 million renovation of the Ameristar East Chicago casino floors and expansion of this business, which includes a land based high limit gaming experience. The land based high limit space will contain 95 slot machines and 14 table games, as well as dedicated amenities for the VIP guests that utilize this space. Construction of the high limit gaming space is currently underway, and is expected to be completed by the end of May. The renovation of the existing casino floors will improve the overall quality of the gaming entertainment experience at Ameristar East Chicago, while allowing us to optimize its capacity, layout and game mix. We anticipate the casino renovation will be completed in phases through the fall.\n“Significant progress has been made toward completing our transaction with Penn National, including the approval of the transaction by the shareholders of both companies in March, and the receipt of regulatory approvals in Illinois, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We continue to work closely with the Penn National team to obtain the remaining regulatory approvals and in coordinating a smooth transition and seamless integration upon the closing of the transaction. We remain on track to complete the transaction in the second half of 2018,” concluded Mr. Sanfilippo.\nAdoption of ASC 606\nThe Company's 2018 first quarter financial results reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (\"ASC 606\"), effective January 1, 2018. The Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method, therefore, year over year comparability is reduced since prior period amounts have not been adjusted. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in an approximate $2.8 million or 0.4% reduction in net revenues in the 2018 first quarter, with no material impact on operating income, net income or Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR.\nASC 606 changed the accounting for our my choice program reward credits earned by our customers. The Company is now required to defer revenue at the estimated standalone selling price of my choice credits as they are earned by our customers and recognize revenue when the credits are redeemed. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, the estimated liability for unredeemed credits was accrued based on the estimated cost of the goods or services to be provided. ASC 606 changed the classification of charges associated with our my choice tier accrual for third-party annual gifts. These charges were previously recorded to gaming expenses and now are recognized as a reduction to gaming revenue. ASC 606 changed the accounting for complimentaries. The Company previously did not present revenue for goods and services provided to customers for free as an inducement to gamble (discretionary and non-discretionary complimentaries). Complimentaries related to an inducement to gamble (i.e., gaming contracts) are now recognized at standalone selling prices with an offsetting reduction to gaming revenues.\nThe amount by which each line item in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was affected by ASC 606 as compared with the accounting guidance that was in effect before the change was as follows:\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 As Reported -\nWith Adoption\nof ASC 606 As Adjusted -\nWithout\nAdoption of\nASC 606 Effect of\nAccounting\nChange\nIncrease/(Decrease) (amounts in thousands) Revenues (1): Gaming $ 499,263 $ 568,509 $ (69,246) Food and beverage 69,667 31,625 38,042 Lodging 37,819 11,433 26,386 Retail, entertainment and other 21,646 19,627 2,019 Total revenues 628,395 631,194 (2,799) Expenses and other costs (2): Gaming 258,763 306,308 (47,545) Food and beverage 62,724 29,572 33,152 Lodging 14,346 5,840 8,506 Retail, entertainment and other 10,431 7,337 3,094 Other expenses and other costs 166,794 166,794 — Total expenses and other costs 513,058 515,851 (2,793) Operating income $ 115,337 $ 115,343 $ (6) Net income $ 21,794 $ 21,800 $ (6) Net income attributable to Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. $ 21,943 $ 21,949 $ (6) Of the decrease in gaming revenues, $66.9 million is attributable to the allocation of a portion of the price in gaming transactions to complimentary hospitality and other revenues, which increased food and beverage; lodging; and retail, entertainment and other revenues. In addition, gaming revenues is reduced by $2.4 million, which represents the allocated portion of the price in gaming transactions to certain tier benefits, such as the annual gift, which was previously included in gaming expenses. Of the decrease in gaming expenses, $39.8 million is attributable to the cessation of the Company’s prior accounting practice of including the estimated costs of providing complimentaries in gaming expenses rather than in food and beverage; lodging; and retail, entertainment and other; expenses, which increased food and beverage; lodging; and retail, entertainment and other; expenses. In addition, gaming expenses is reduced by $2.4 million, which represents the allocated portion of the transaction price in gaming contracts to certain tier benefits, such as the annual gift, which was previously included in gaming expenses.\n2018 First Quarter Operational Review\nMidwest Segment\nIn the Midwest segment, net revenues decreased by $12.8 million or 3.3% year over year to $377.5 million in the 2018 first quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR decreased by $3.0 million or 2.7% year over year to $109.9 million and Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 29.1%, an increase of 20 basis points year over year.\n2018 first quarter financial results for the Midwest segment were negatively impacted by adverse winter weather conditions, as well as closures and clean-up costs related to the flooding of the Ohio River at Belterra Park and Belterra Resort in February. Results for the prior year period included a $3.2 million out of period adjustment that reduced the net revenues and Adjusted EBITDAR of Ameristar Kansas City.\nThe Meadows generated mid-single digit Adjusted EBITDAR growth despite a mid-single digit decline in net revenues. Adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded approximately 180 basis points. These results were achieved by continuing to drive profitable table gaming revenues and through strategic marketing efficiencies. In the 2018 first quarter, the Company's my choice guest loyalty program was implemented at The Meadows, replacing the property's legacy rewards program. The transition of the guest loyalty program required a conversion of the casino software systems of the property, which added expense and caused casino floor disruption in the 2018 first quarter.\nBelterra Resort and Belterra Park both experienced low double-digit net revenue declines and Adjusted EBITDAR declines in excess of 25% and 50%, respectively, as a direct result of the closures and clean-up costs related to the flooding of the Ohio River and severe winter weather during the quarter. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDAR margin decreased in excess of 500 basis points year over year at each of these businesses.\nSouth Segment\nIn the South segment, net revenues decreased by $2.4 million or 1.2% year over year to $190.1 million in the 2018 first quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR increased by $1.9 million or 3.1% to $63.6 million. Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 33.5%, an increase of 140 basis points year over year.\nL'Auberge Lake Charles generated high single digit growth in net revenues and Adjusted EBITDAR growth in excess of 30% as the table games hold percentage of the business normalized from the lower levels of the prior year period. Strong gaming revenue growth and additional marketing efficiencies contributed to L'Auberge Lake Charles expanding Adjusted EBITDAR margin by approximately 600 basis points year over year in the 2018 first quarter.\nL'Auberge Baton Rouge experienced low double digit net revenue and Adjusted EBITDAR declines on a year over year basis. Adjusted EBITDAR margin contracted approximately 300 basis points year over year. Implemented efficiencies in the cost structure of the business and streamlined marketing were not enough to offset lower gaming and non-gaming revenues in comparison to the prior year period, but this business continues to gain market share given its quality operations.\nWest Segment\nWest segment net revenues were $59.7 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of $3.7 million or 6.6% year over year. Adjusted EBITDAR was $23.2 million, an increase of $2.7 million or 13.2% year over year. Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 38.9%, an increase of 230 basis points year over year.\nAmeristar Black Hawk produced mid-single digit growth in net revenues coupled with high single digit Adjusted EBITDAR growth. Adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded approximately 140 basis points year over year. The operating results at Ameristar Black Hawk were driven by a high single digit increase in gaming revenues and continued marketing and advertising efficiencies.\nCorporate Expenses and Other\nCorporate expenses and other, which is principally comprised of corporate overhead expenses, as well as the Retama Park Racetrack management operations, decreased by $1.2 million in the 2018 first quarter to $19.0 million.\nLease Payments\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (amounts in thousands, unaudited) Reduction of Financing Obligation $ 13,087 $ 11,797 Interest expense attributable to Financing Obligation (1) 81,296 81,162 Total payments to GLPI related to Master Lease (1) $ 94,383 $ 92,959 Long-term prepaid rent $ 2,275 $ 2,275 Rent expense attributable to Meadows Lease (2) 4,171 4,083 Total payments to GLPI related to Meadows Lease (2) $ 6,446 $ 6,358 In May 2017, the rent due under the Master Lease was increased by the building base rent escalator, which was for an annual amount of $5.8 million. The building base rent escalator is recorded as interest expense as incurred. In October 2017, the annual rent due under the Meadows Lease was increased by the base rent escalator. The base rent escalator is recorded as rent expense as incurred.\nInterest Expense\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (amounts in thousands, unaudited) Interest expense from Financing Obligation $ 81,296 $ 81,162 Interest expense from Conventional Debt 11,235 13,105 Interest income (173) (154) Capitalized interest (5) (5) Interest expense, net $ 92,353 $ 94,108 Liquidity and Capital Expenditures\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $152.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.

Additionally, on that same day, the stockholders of Penn National approved the acquisition of Pinnacle by voting affirmatively for the issuance of Penn National’s common stock to Pinnacle stockholders as consideration in the proposed transaction. The transaction has also been approved by gaming regulatory agencies in Illinois, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The proposed merger is subject to customary closing conditions and additional required regulatory approvals. The proposed merger is expected to close in the second half of 2018. No assurance can be given that the proposed merger will be completed.\nInvestor Call\nPinnacle will not host an investor conference call or webcast related to the announcement of its 2018 first quarter financial results due to its pending acquisition by Penn National.

Management eliminates the results from discontinued operations at the time they are deemed discontinued.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA, net of Lease Payments: is defined as Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR (which is defined above) minus Lease Payments (which is defined below).\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDAR Margin: The Company defines Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR margin as Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR divided by revenues on a consolidated basis.\nConventional Debt: is defined as debt from borrowed money, which substantially consists of the outstanding principal amount from the Company's senior secured credit facilities, which consists of a $400 million revolving credit facility, a term loan A facility, and the Company's 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024.\nFinancing Obligation: is defined as the liability recorded on the Company's balance sheet in connection with the Master Lease. As a result of the transaction with GLPI, the Company's Master Lease with GLPI is accounted for as a financing obligation in accordance with GAAP. The financing obligation is calculated based upon the present value of the future minimum lease payments made to GLPI under the Master Lease over the remaining lease term, which includes all renewal options. The derivation of the present value of the future minimum lease payments is made using an imputed borrowing rate of 10.5%.\nLease Payments: is defined as cash rent payments made to GLPI for the Master Lease and the Meadows Lease. The Company’s annual rent payment is currently $382.8 million under the Master Lease. The Company began making rent payments to GLPI under the Master Lease on April 28, 2016. The Company’s annual rent payment is currently $25.8 million under the Meadows Lease. The Company began making rent payments to GLPI under the Meadows Lease on September 9, 2016.\nMaster Lease or GLPI Master Lease: is defined as the lease the Company entered into on April 28, 2016 through which it leases real property for the operation of 14 gaming entertainment businesses from GLPI. The lease has a 35-year term, with an initial term of 10-years and five, five year renewal periods (at the Company's option). The Master Lease is subject to annual escalation, contingent upon meeting a minimum rent coverage ratio of 1.8x, and periodic percentage rent resets equal to 4% of the increase/decrease of average trailing revenue above/below benchmark year revenues in each reset year (resets occur every two years, beginning in lease year three).\nMeadows Lease: is defined as the lease the Company entered into on September 9, 2016 through which it leases real property for the operation of The Meadows Racetrack and Casino (The Meadows) gaming entertainment business.

The presentation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of its business and is especially relevant in evaluating large, long-lived casino-hotel projects because it provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial, non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects. Management also reviews pre-opening, development and other costs separately, as such expenses are also included in total project costs when assessing budgets and project returns, and because such costs relate to anticipated future revenues and income. Management believes that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR margin are useful measures for investors because they are indicators of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare operating performance and value of companies within our industry. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR also approximates the measures used in the debt covenants within the Company’s debt agreements. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company compensates for these limitations by using other comparative measures to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.\nIn addition, the Company uses Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, net of Lease Payments as a relevant and useful measure to compare operating results between accounting periods. Management believes that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, net of Lease Payments is useful to investors because it is an indicator of the performance of ongoing business operations after incorporating the cash flow impact of Lease Payments.\nNot all of the aforementioned benefits and costs occur in each reporting period, but have been included in the definitions based on historical activity.\nEach of these measures is not calculated in the same manner by all companies and, accordingly, may not be an appropriate measure of comparing performance among different companies. See the attached “supplemental information” tables for reconciliations of these measures to the GAAP equivalent financial measures.\nAbout Pinnacle Entertainment\nPinnacle Entertainment, Inc. owns and operates 16 gaming entertainment businesses, located in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Pinnacle holds a majority interest in the racing license owner, as well as a management contract, for Retama Park Racetrack outside of San Antonio, Texas.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis communication may contain certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements regarding Pinnacle’s business generally, expected results of operations and future operating performance and future growth, about the benefits of the proposed merger, adequacy of resources to fund development and expansion projects, liquidity, financing options, Pinnacle’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the expected timing of the completion of the proposed merger, and other statements that are not historical facts.
