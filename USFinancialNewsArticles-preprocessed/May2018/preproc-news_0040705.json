    "text": "Published: May 16, 2018 4:46 p.m. ET Share\nBut measure faces long odds of passage in the House\nBy John D. McKinnon Getty Images The seal of the Federal Communications Commission hangs inside the hearing room at the FCC headquarters in Washington.\nThe Senate voted Wednesday to reinstate Obama-era open-internet rules, handing a symbolic defeat to the Trump administration over its efforts to roll back those regulations.\nThe measure, adopted by 52 to 47, still faces long odds of passage in the House. The White House also says it supports the current rules, adopted by the GOP-run Federal Communications Commission late last year, and many Republicans believe President Donald Trump would veto the reinstatement measure if it ever reached his desk.\nThe Obama-era FCCâ€™s net neutrality rules, adopted in 2015, required internet service providers such as cable and wireless firms to treat all online traffic equally. The rules barred them from blocking and throttling websites, or creating fast and slow lanes. ",
