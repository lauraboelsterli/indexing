Aurora Cannabis’ 4.6 percent drop made it the second-biggest decliner.\n* Home Capital Group was up 0.9 percent after the mortgage lender said its unit got a two-year C$500 million funding commitment to replace a C$2 billion credit facility offered by Berkshire Hathaway.\n* The most heavily traded shares by volume were Aurora Cannabis and Neovasc (down 11.1 percent). Aphria fell 1.9 percent on news that it entered a deal with Colombia-based Colcanna SAS to supply medical cannabis.\n* The TSX posted five new 52-week highs and one new low.\n* Across all Canadian issues there were 10 new 52-week highs and 25 new lows, with total volume of 38.66 million shares.
