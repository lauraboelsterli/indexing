    "text": "BILLERICA, Mass., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ: BRKR) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nBruker's revenues of 2018 were $431.7 million, an increase of 12.2% compared to 2017. In 2018, Bruker's year-over-year organic revenue growth was 4.0%, while the favorable effect from changes in foreign currency rates was 7.7%, and growth from acquisitions was 0.5%.\nFirst quarter 2018 GAAP operating income was $38.1 million, compared to $37.6 million in 2017. Non-GAAP operating income was $52.9 million, compared to $49.2 million in 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, Bruker's first quarter 2018 operating margin was 12.3%, compared to 12.8% in 2017. The year-over-year decline in non-GAAP operating margin was primarily attributable to a strong unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency rates, which more than offset healthy operational margin improvement in the first quarter.\nFirst quarter 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.17, compared to $0.13 in 2017. First quarter 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.24, a 26.3% increase over non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.19 in 2017. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures is provided in the tables accompanying this press release.\nFrank Laukien, President and CEO of Bruker, commented: \"Bruker is off to a solid start in 2018 with 4% organic revenue growth and strong EPS improvement. We remain focused on our key priorities of portfolio transformation and operational excellence. With healthy end markets, organic growth improvements in our Scientific Instruments segment, and continued good operational execution in the quarter, we believe that Bruker is on track to deliver on our 2018 financial commitments.\"\nBruker's guidance for fiscal year 2018 revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin expansion and non-GAAP EPS is unchanged.\nQuarterly Earnings Call\nBruker will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its financial results, business outlook, and related corporate and financial matters today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. To listen to the webcast, investors can go to https://ir.bruker.com and click on the \"Events & Presentations\" hyperlink.

Investors can also listen to the earnings webcast via telephone by dialing 1-888-437-2685 (US toll free) or +1-412-317-6702 (international), and referencing \"Bruker's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call\". A telephone replay of the conference call will be available by dialing 1-877-344-7529 (US toll free) or +1-412-317-0088 (international) and entering conference number: 10119735.

Bruker's high-performance scientific instruments and high-value analytical and diagnostic solutions enable scientists to explore life and materials at molecular, cellular and microscopic levels.

For more information, please visit: www.bruker.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and in the earnings webcast: non-GAAP gross profit; non-GAAP gross profit margin; non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP operating margin; non-GAAP profit before tax; non-GAAP tax rate; non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures exclude costs related to restructuring actions, acquisition and related integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other non-operational costs.\nWe also refer to organic revenue growth and free cash flow in this press release and in the earnings webcast, which are also non-GAAP financial measures. We define the term organic revenue as GAAP revenue excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates and the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and believe it is a useful measure to evaluate our continuing business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business because it indicates the amount of cash generated after additions to property, plant, and equipment that is available for, among other things, acquisitions, investments in our business, repayment of debt and return of capital to shareholders.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable among companies. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Specifically, management believes that the non-GAAP measures mentioned above provide relevant and useful information which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry, as well as by our management, in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because our management believes this provides a more comparable measure of our continuing business by adjusting for certain items that are not reflective of the underlying performance of our business. These measures may also be useful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business and forecasting future results. We regularly use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business results and make operating decisions. We also measure our employees and compensate them, in part, based on such non-GAAP measures and use this information for our planning and forecasting activities.\nAdditional information relating to these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the tables accompanying this press release following our GAAP financial statements and in our slide presentation, which is available through the \"Bruker Earnings Release\" hyperlink on Bruker's Investor Relations web site ir.bruker.com .\nWith respect to the Company's outlook for 2018 non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS and non-GAAP tax rate, we are not providing the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or corresponding reconciliations to such GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis, because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty certain items that may affect such measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP without unreasonable effort. Our expected non-GAAP operating margin, tax rate and EPS ranges exclude primarily the future impact of restructuring actions, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses and purchase accounting fair value adjustments. These reconciling items are uncertain, depend on various factors outside our management's control and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, our future period operating margins, EPS and tax rate calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nForward Looking Statements\nAny statements contained in this press release which do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations, but are subject to that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated, including, but not limited to, relating to adverse changes in conditions in the global economy and volatility in the capital markets, the integration of businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to successfully implement our restructuring initiatives, changing technologies, product development and market acceptance of our products, the cost and pricing of our products, manufacturing, competition, dependence on collaborative partners, key suppliers and contract manufacturers, capital spending and government funding policies, changes in governmental regulations, the use and protection of intellectual property rights, litigation, and other risk factors discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. These and other factors are identified and described in more detail in our filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We expressly disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements other than as required by law.\n-tables follow-\nContacts :\nMiroslava Minkova\nHead of Investor
