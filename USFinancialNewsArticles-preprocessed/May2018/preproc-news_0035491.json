    "text": "PARIS, May 15 (Reuters) - Credit Agricole’s quarterly profit fell short of expectations on Tuesday as lower revenue from French retail and capital markets trading ate into gains from asset management at the banking group.\nFirst-quarter net income rose 1.2 percent to 856 million euros ($1.03 billion), slightly lower than analysts’ estimates of 878 million euros, according to a Reuters poll of 6 analysts.\nRevenues rose 4.4 percent to 4.91 billion euros, compared to 4.98 billion expected by analysts.\nCredit Agricole said the “disposal of non-strategic entities, exchange rate variations and regulatory contributions weighed on the results”.\n$1 = 0.8351 euros Reporting by Maya Nikolaeva; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
