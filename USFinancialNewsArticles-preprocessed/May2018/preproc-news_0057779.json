    "text": "CAIRO, May 30 (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility on Wednesday for a knife and shooting attack in the Belgian city of Liege, but provided no evidence for its claim.\nIt said in an online statement a “soldier of the caliphate” had carried out the attack on Tuesday which killed two policewomen and a bystander.\nIslamic State regularly claims attacks that are thought to be Islamist-inspired, often without providing any proof the group was involved.
