    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canadian Natural Resources Limited (\"Canadian Natural\") announced today that Toronto Stock Exchange has accepted notice filed by Canadian Natural of its intention to make a Normal Course Issuer Bid through the facilities of Toronto Stock Exchange or other alternative Canadian trading systems. Purchases may also be made through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe notice provides that Canadian Natural may, during the 12 month period commencing May 23, 2018 and ending May 22, 2019, purchase for cancellation up to 61,424,856 shares, being 5% of the 1,228,497,131 outstanding common shares as at May 11, 2018. Canadian Natural will not acquire more than 25% of the average daily trading volume of its common shares during a trading day, being 639,751 common shares subject to certain prescribed exceptions. The price which Canadian Natural will pay for any such shares will be the market price at the time of acquisition. The actual number of common shares that may be purchased and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Canadian Natural. As of May 11, 2018, Canadian Natural has acquired 702,700 common shares for cancellation at an average price of $41.96 under its current Normal Course Issuer Bid, which authorized the purchase for cancellation of up to 27,931,135 common shares.\nIn addition to further strengthening its balance sheet, investing in exploration and development of its diverse asset base, and participating in acquisition opportunities, returns to shareholders remain a priority to create value for Canadian Natural’s shareholders. Funds flow in 2018 is targeted to be allocated to these four pillars and may also be used by Canadian Natural, depending upon future trading prices and other factors, to purchase its common shares, as it is believed to be a worthwhile investment, and in the best interests of Canadian Natural and its shareholders.\nCanadian Natural is a senior oil and natural gas production company, with continuing operations in its core areas located in Western Canada, the U.K. portion of the North Sea and Offshore Africa.\nCertain information regarding the Company contained herein may constitute forward-looking statements under applicable securities laws.
