    "text": "Generates Continued Revenue Growth During Quarter\nCompany Reaffirms 2018 Guidance\nATLANTA, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crawford & Company ( www.crawfordandcompany.com ) (NYSE:CRD‐A) (NYSE:CRD‐B), the world’s largest publicly listed independent provider of claims management solutions to insurance companies and self-insured entities, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company’s two classes of stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting rights and the Company’s ability to pay greater cash dividends on the non-voting Class A Common Stock (CRD-A) than on the voting Class B Common Stock (CRD-B), subject to certain limitations. In addition, with respect to mergers or similar transactions, holders of CRD-A must receive the same type and amount of consideration as holders of CRD-B, unless different consideration is approved by the holders of 75% of CRD-A, voting as a class.\nConsolidated Results\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary\nRevenues before reimbursements of $273.1 million, compared with $267.3 million for the 2017 first quarter Net income attributable to shareholders of $8.6 million, compared to $7.7 million in the same period last year Diluted earnings per share of $0.16 for CRD-A and $0.14 for CRD-B, compared with $0.14 for CRD-A and $0.12 for CRD-B in the prior year first quarter Diluted earnings per share of $0.16 for CRD-A and $0.14 for CRD-B in the 2018 first quarter, compared to non-GAAP earnings per share before restructuring and special charges, of $0.15 for CRD-A and $0.13 for CRD-B in the prior year first quarter Consolidated operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, were $18.2 million or 6.7% of revenues in the 2018 first quarter, compared with $18.3 million or 6.8% of revenues in the 2017 first quarter Consolidated adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $28.1 million or 10.3% of revenues in the 2018 first quarter, compared with $26.6 million or 10.0% of revenues in the 2017 period\nMr. Harsha V. Agadi, president and chief executive officer of Crawford & Company, stated, “This is an exciting time at Crawford as the comprehensive strategy that we implemented through 2017 is beginning to show signs of success as can be seen in our first quarter results where sales grew 2.2%, year over year, and earnings per share improved. The review of our core values, which led to the realignment of our organization around a refreshed corporate mission and vision, was central to our strategy which is designed to return Crawford to sustained revenue growth. This now drives everything we do including how we go to market, how we service our clients and who we hire.\n“The second step to our growth strategy was the recruitment of experienced, solution based sales people to improve our sales capabilities as we focus on selling the One Crawford Solution. We have also re-evaluated our entire sales process including our sales materials, how we respond to RFPs, how we measure and track sales leads, as well as exploring opportunities to improve our technology and training to support our global sales team. Improving top line revenue growth is core to our strategy and early signs of success are clear as the momentum in our new business pipelines is building. The effectiveness of our sales teams is critical to our success as we deliver innovative solutions designed to solve the industry’s most complex challenges.\n“The most recent step in our strategy was the realignment of our organization such that Crawford faces the market in the same manner as our clients. What we had found through our extensive review this past year was that our 2017 business structure was not meeting our clients’ needs, not to mention limiting the growth potential of the Company. As a result, we have successfully reorganized the Company into Global Service Lines during the first quarter, which will sharpen our method of delivery to our clients and better enable our sales teams to increase market share and grow the Company.\n“Another benefit of our move to Global Service Lines is our ability to harness the expertise and product knowledge from across the Company in order to develop innovative solutions designed to solve the challenges of Carriers, Corporations, and Intermediaries. This will position Crawford to be a stronger partner to our clients as technology continues to drive the evolution of our industry. Our goal is to drive innovation in the claims settlement process, in order to deliver value to our clients in the form of improved customer satisfaction and service and reduced claim leakage which will result in improved market share and profitability for Crawford.”\nMr. Agadi concluded, “The momentum in our business is clearly accelerating as our move to Global Service Lines is unleashing the vast potential that exists within Crawford. We will continue to strive to be on the forefront of innovation within the claims settlement process and see opportunities to enhance and expand our solutions internationally. Taken together, we are excited with the progress that we have achieved executing our strategic plan in the first quarter as we have made real progress towards the achievement of our longer term goal of delivering 5% revenue growth and 15% earnings growth, annually.”\nSegment Results for the First Quarter\nCrawford TPA Solutions: Broadspire\nCrawford TPA Solutions: Broadspire segment revenues before reimbursements were $100.2 million in the 2018 first quarter, increasing 4% from $96.3 million in the 2017 first quarter. On a constant dollar basis, a non-GAAP measure, first quarter 2018 revenues were $98.8 million. Crawford TPA Solutions: Broadspire recorded operating earnings of $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing an operating margin of 8%, compared with $8.0 million, or 8% of revenues, in the 2017 first quarter.\nCrawford Claims Solutions\nCrawford Claims Solutions revenues before reimbursements were $90.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, increasing 9% from $83.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a constant dollar basis, first quarter 2018 revenues were $87.2 million. Operating earnings were $0.7 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared with $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing operating margins of 1% in the 2018 period and 3% in the 2017 period.\nCrawford Specialty Solutions\nCrawford Specialty Solutions revenues before reimbursements were $82.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, down 6% from $87.8 million in the same period of 2017. On a constant dollar basis, first quarter 2018 revenues were $80.0 million. Operating earnings were $10.5 million in the 2018 first quarter compared with $8.4 million in the 2017 period. The segment’s operating margin for the 2018 quarter was 13%, as compared to 10% in the 2017 quarter.\nUnallocated Corporate and Shared Costs and Credits, Net\nUnallocated corporate costs, net were $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $0.5 million in the same period of 2017.\nRestructuring and Special Charges\nThe Company recorded no restructuring and special charges in the 2018 first quarter and $0.6 million in the 2017 first quarter. Restructuring costs for the 2017 first quarter were comprised of costs related to the establishment and phase in of the Company's global business and technology service centers and other restructuring charges for asset impairments and lease termination costs.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe Company’s consolidated cash and cash equivalents position as of March 31, 2018 totaled $64.0 million, compared with $54.0 million at December 31, 2017. The Company’s total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2018 totaled $267.3 million, compared with $225.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 1,011,958 shares of CRD-A and 53,888 shares of CRD-B at an average cost of $8.28 and $8.96, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company did not repurchase any shares of CRD-A or CRD-B.\nThe Company’s operations used $13.6 million of cash during the 2018 period, compared with $20.5 million used in the 2017 period.\n2018 Guidance\nCrawford & Company is reaffirming its guidance for 2018 as follows:\nConsolidated revenues before reimbursements between $1.12 and $1.14 billion; Net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company between $43.0 and $48.0 million, or $0.78 to $0.88 diluted earnings per CRD-A share, and $0.71 to $0.81 diluted earnings per CRD-B share; Consolidated operating earnings between $85.0 and $95.0 million; Consolidated adjusted EBITDA between $127.0 and $137.0 million.\nTo a significant extent, Crawford’s business depends on case volumes. The Company cannot predict the future trend of case volumes for a number of reasons, including the fact that the frequency and severity of weather-related claims and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of claims and revenue for the Company, are generally not subject to accurate forecasting.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Crawford & Company will host a conference call on May 11, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its first quarter 2018 results. The conference call can be accessed live by dialing 1-800-374-2518 and using Conference ID 4496059. A presentation for tomorrow’s call can also be found on the investor relations portion of the Company’s website, http://www.crawfordandcompany.com . The call will be recorded and available for replay through June 11, 2018. You may dial 1-855-859-2056 to listen to the replay.\nNon-GAAP Presentation\nIn the normal course of business, our operating segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by our clients. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are required to be included when reporting expenses and revenues, respectively, in our consolidated results of operations. In the foregoing discussion and analysis of segment results of operations, we do not include a gross up of segment expenses and revenues for these pass-through reimbursed expenses. The amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in our results of operations with no impact to our net income or operating earnings. A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to consolidated revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is self-evident from the face of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nOperating earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by our senior management and chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to evaluate the financial performance of our Company and operating segments, and make resource allocation and certain compensation decisions. Unlike net income, segment operating earnings is not a standard performance measure found in GAAP. We believe this measure is useful to others in that it allows them to evaluate segment and consolidated operating performance using the same criteria used by our senior management and CODM. Consolidated operating earnings represent segment earnings including certain unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, but before net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets, goodwill impairment charges, restructuring and special charges, income taxes, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests. The reconciliation of operating earnings to net income attributable to shareholders of the Company on a GAAP basis is presented below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a term defined by GAAP and as a result our measure of adjusted EBITDA might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. However, adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate, assess and benchmark our operational results. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to shareholders of the Company with adjustments for depreciation and amortization, net corporate interest expense, income taxes, restructuring and special charges, and stock-based compensation expense.\nUnallocated corporate and shared costs and credits include expenses and credits related to our chief executive officer and Board of Directors, certain provisions for bad debt allowances or subsequent recoveries such as those related to bankrupt clients, defined benefit pension costs or credits for our frozen U.S. pension plan, certain unallocated professional fees, and certain self-insurance costs and recoveries that are not allocated to our individual operating segments. Restructuring and special charges are non-core items not directly related to our normal business operations, or our future performance.\nIncome taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, and amortization of customer-relationship intangible assets are recurring components of our net income, but they are not considered part of our segment operating earnings because they are managed on a corporate-wide basis. Income taxes are calculated for the Company on a consolidated basis based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which we provide services, and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Net corporate interest expense results from capital structure decisions made by senior management and the Board of Directors, affecting the Company as a whole. Stock option expense represents the non-cash costs generally related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan expenses which are not allocated to our operating segments. Amortization expense is a non-cash expense for finite-lived customer-relationship and trade name intangible assets acquired in business combinations. None of these costs relate directly to the performance of our services or operating activities and, therefore, are excluded from segment operating earnings in order to better assess the results of each segment's operating activities on a consistent basis.\nIncome taxes are calculated for the non-GAAP presentation of net income before restructuring and special charges based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which charges exist, and vary by jurisdiction. Following is a reconciliation of segment and consolidated operating earnings to net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company on a GAAP basis. The reconciliation of 2018 guidance is to the midpoint of the guidance range.\nThree months ended Full Year (in thousands) March 31,\n2018 March 31,\n2017 Guidance\n2018 Operating earnings: Crawford TPA Solutions: Broadspire $ 7,824 $ 7,968 Crawford Claims Solutions 715 2,434 Crawford Specialty Solutions 10,451 8,352 Unallocated corporate and shared costs, net (815 ) (461 ) Consolidated operating earnings 18,175 18,293 $ 90,000 (Deduct) Add: Net corporate interest expense (2,564 ) (2,036 ) (10,000 ) Stock option expense (450 ) (417 ) (1,800 ) Amortization expense (2,765 ) (2,777 ) (11,000 ) Goodwill impairment charges — — — Restructuring and special charges — (605 ) — Income taxes (3,966 ) (4,835 ) (21,000 ) Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 139 41 (700 ) Net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company $ 8,569 $ 7,664 $ 45,500 Following is a reconciliation of net income attributable to shareholders of Crawford & Company on a GAAP basis to adjusted EBITDA.
