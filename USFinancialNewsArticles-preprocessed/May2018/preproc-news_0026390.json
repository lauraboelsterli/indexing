    "text": "NEW YORK, May 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of those who purchased or acquired the securities of InnerWorkings, Inc. (\"InnerWorkings\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: INWK) between August 11, 2015 and May 7, 2018, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for InnerWorkings investors under the federal securities laws.\nTo join the InnerWorkings class action, and/or if you have information relating to this matter, please visit our INNERWORKINGS SHAREHOLDER PAGE or contact Daniel Sadeh toll free at (877) 779-1414 or dsadeh@bernlieb.com .\nAccording to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) InnerWorkings' financial statements for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 as well as all interim periods contained errors that required restating; and (2) InnerWorkings' financial statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn May 7, 2018, during aftermarket hours, InnerWorkings revealed that \"[t]he Company will be restating its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and all interim periods within those years. Accordingly, investors should no longer rely upon the Company's previously issued financial statements for these periods, any earnings releases or other communications relating to these periods, or projections or estimates for any future periods.\"\nOn this news, InnerWorkings' stock fell $0.62 per share, or over 6%, from its previous closing price to close at $9.06 per share on May 8, 2018, damaging investors.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 9, 2018. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as lead plaintiff. If you choose to take no action, you may remain an absent class member.\nSince 1993, Bernstein Liebhard LLP has recovered over $3.5 billion for its clients. In addition to representing individual investors, the Firm has been retained by some of the largest public and private pension funds in the country to monitor their assets and pursue litigation on their behalf. As a result of its success litigating hundreds of lawsuits and class actions, the Firm has been named to The National Law Journal's \"Plaintiffs' Hot List\" thirteen times and listed in The Legal 500 for ten consecutive years.\nPlease follow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bernstein-liebhard-llp/ and Twitter: https://twitter.com/bernlieb .\nATTORNEY ADVERTISING.
