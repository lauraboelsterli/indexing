TMI is one of Canada's prominent Preventative Diabetic Foot Care, Advanced Wound Care and Diabetes Education clinics. Dr. Mayer and his team are strongly committed to advancing technologies and prevention practices at TMI, a center of excellence in the treatment of the diabetic foot.

He formed The Mayer Institute in early 2006, which at present has over 16,000 patient visits per year, with over 9,000 of those visits related to diabetic wound care.\n“Engaging global resources for expert guidance and collaboration as SANUWAVE commercializes therapies through the dermaPACE® System is an important business development initiative for us,” stated Kevin A.
