FILE PHOTO: A Ryanair Boeing 737-800 plane taxis at Lisbon's airport, Portugal April 24, 2018. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo\nRyanair last year approached Norwegian Air with a proposal to take a stake of around 20 percent in the Oslo-listed carrier, a source with close knowledge of the discussion told Reuters on Thursday.\nNorwegian Air Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos confirmed there had been contact between the companies and he brought it up with the board, but declined to discuss any details.\n“There is no truth to these claims. We have not made an approach to Norwegian and we have no interest,” Ryanair said in an emailed statement. Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Alexandra Hudson",
