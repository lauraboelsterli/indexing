The contract hit its highest since late 2014 at $80.50 last week. Brent was on track to fall about 3.1 percent this week, which would be its largest weekly percentage loss since early April.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $3.04 to $67.67 a barrel, a 4.3 percent loss. Following six weeks of gains, WTI was set to lose about 5.1 percent for the week, which would be its biggest loss since early February.\nThe discount of WTI to Brent <WTCLc1-LCOc1> hit $8.53 per barrel, its widest since May 17, and not far off levels last seen three years ago.\nThe energy ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabia a months, ahead of a key OPEC meeting in Vienna next month.\nRussia's energy minister said oil ministers from OPEC states and non-OPEC countries participating in a deal to cut output would likely decide to gradually ease curbs at their meeting in Vienna next month.\n\"Different options will be put forward. But, it is likely that this will be a gradual easing,\" Alexander Novak said in comments published on the Russian energy ministry website on Friday.\nGlobal crude inventories have fallen\nThis comes even as U.S. crude production has risen. The United States in February produced 10.3 million bpd, a record.\nThe U.S. oil rig count rose by 15 to 859 in the week to May 25, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said.\nSpeaking in St. Petersburg, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said any easing\nThe prospect of renewed sanctions on Iran after Trump has further boosted prices in recent weeks.\nHowever, market participants should not read too much into Friday's sell-off due to thin volume ahead of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend, said Derek Rollingson, portfolio manager of the ICON Energy Fund.\n\"It's the last Friday before a long weekend and the volume has a tendency to go down and with lower volume there's always a chance of higher volatility,\" Rollingson said.\n(Additional reporting by Ron Bousso in London, and Henning Gloystein and Roslan Khasawneh in Singapore Editing by Marguerita Choy and Chris Reese)",
