    "text": "RUTHERFORD, N.J., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cancer Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CGIX), a leader in enabling precision medicine for oncology through molecular markers and diagnostics, today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 as well as an update on its strategic direction and key organizational initiatives.\nJohn A. Roberts, Chief Executive Officer of Cancer Genetics said, “Our progress during the first quarter aligned with our transformation strategy for 2018, which focuses on leveraging our core competencies and market-leading portfolio of diagnostics to accelerate the path to profitability and improve our competitive position.\n“We are particularly pleased with the expansion of our Biopharma and Discovery Services businesses, where we are continuing to capitalize on the significant synergies that exist to add new clients and expand revenue among existing clients. Our oncology-focused testing, genomic services and biomarker insight capabilities are among the strongest in the industry, and add substantive value to our partners’ development efforts. We are currently supporting over 300 clinical trial and discovery projects, including 101 clinical trials that are focused on the growing trends associated with immuno-oncology product development, and are continuing to add more as we expand our capabilities and further establish ourselves as a major player in this space.\nMr. Roberts added, “In addition to expanding Biopharma and Discovery Services activities, there are two other keys to executing this strategy, which we believe will drive revenue growth and operating cost reductions. These were the divestiture of certain non-strategic assets and the reduction of our geographic footprint. We advanced both of these initiatives since the beginning of 2018.”\n“In an effort to further optimize efficiency across the organization, we recently completed the sale of our India operation to REPROCELL Incorporated and made the strategic decision to consolidate our Los Angeles laboratory operations, relocating our comprehensive solid tumor test portfolio and capabilities to our New Jersey and North Carolina facilities during the second and third quarters of 2018. These actions represent an important step in focusing our business, simplifying our operating structure and generating monetary value for the Company, and are consistent with the execution of the transformation strategy.”\nMr. Roberts concluded, “Overall, we are pleased with the advancements we have made since the beginning of 2018. We are continuing to leverage synergies and implement strategies aimed at accelerating growth, while reducing expenses associated with non-core activities. We remain committed to optimizing our proprietary and unique test and service offerings to drive a leadership position in precision oncology.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 AND RECENT OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nReceived special 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the Tissue of Origin (TOO®) test to identify tumor origin and differentiate between metastatic, poorly differentiated, or undifferentiated cancers. Completed sale of wholly-owned subsidiary BioServe Biotechnologies (India) Private Limited to REPROCELL for $1.9 million in April 2018. As part of 2018 transformation strategy, began the consolidation of the west coast molecular profiling laboratory and relocation of most of these activities to New Jersey and North Carolina laboratories. The consolidation of this facility is expected to reduce operating expenses by over $4 million annually once completed, with completion planned for September 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOn January 1, 2018 the Company adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). The Company also adopted several FASB Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”). Financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2017 has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period. Additional information on the recently adopted accounting standards is included in the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company reported total revenue of $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to revenue of $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 10% or $0.7 million.\nBiopharma services revenue totaled $3.7 million in the first quarter, flat compared to $3.7 million during the first quarter 2017. Biopharma projects are dependent on the timing, size and duration of our contracts with pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinical research organizations, and can fluctuate in comparable periods. The Company increased the number of clinical studies and trials it is supporting to 241, up from 140 in Q1 2017. The Company’s book-to-bill ratio moved from 1.2 in Q1 2017 to 1.3 in Q1 2018.\n​Clinical Services revenue decreased by approximately $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, from $3.0 million to $2.3 million. The decrease in revenue was primarily related to the adoption of ASC 606, and a 16% decline in test volume in the NJ lab.\nThe Company’s Discovery Services contributed $1.7 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of approximately $1.4 million compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was driven by a full quarter of vivoPharm revenue following its acquisition in August 2017, as well as growing demand for the Company’s early-stage discovery and bioinformatics analysis capabilities.\nGross profit margin was 33.7% or $2.6 million in Q1 2018, compared to 40% or $2.8 million in the first quarter 2017. Gross profit and gross margin percentage were impacted by a reduction in the number of non-revenue generating test validations, an increased focus among clinical and medical staff on customer-driven initiatives, and the continued rationalization of the Company’s cost structure from prior acquisitions and efforts to introduce greater efficiency in its laboratory operations.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were approximately $7.5 million, an increase of 35.5% compared to $5.6 million during the first quarter of 2017. The increase in total operating expenses is primarily related to the addition of SG&A expenses from the vivoPharm acquisition of $0.9 million, increases in sales and marketing costs of $0.4 million in the comparable periods as the Company ramped up clinical sales during the second half of 2017, non-cash charges associated with severance related payroll and benefit costs of $0.5 million in Q1 2018 and an increase in bad debt reserve of $0.5 million related to its Clinical Services business.\nNet loss was $(4.5) million or $(0.16) per share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $(9.6) million or $(0.51) per share for the first quarter of 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash of $0.4 million as of March 31, 2018 totaled $4.0 million, compared to $9.9 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAs announced on April 2, 2018, the Company engaged Raymond James & Associates, Inc. as a financial advisor to assist with evaluating options for the Company’s strategic direction. These options may include raising additional capital, the acquisition of another company and / or complementary assets, the sale of the Company, or another type of strategic partnership.\nCONFERENCE CALL & WEBCAST Tuesday, May 15, 2018, 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Domestic: 800-289-0438 International: 323-794-2423 Conference ID: 4878415 Webcast: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129776 Replay – Available through May 29, 2018 Domestic: 844-512-2921 International: 412-317-6671 Conference ID: 4878415 ABOUT CANCER GENETICS\nCancer Genetics, Inc. is a leader in enabling precision medicine in oncology by partnering with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing novel treatments to fight cancer and supporting physicians providing direct patient care through the use of oncology biomarkers and molecular testing.
