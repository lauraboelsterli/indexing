China’s MSCI entry has been largely priced in since the announcement was made last June. ** The smaller Shenzhen index was down 0.12 percent and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index was unchanged. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.75 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei index was down 0.05 percent. ** The yuan was Quote: d at 6.3468 per U.S. dollar, 0.16 percent weaker than the previous close of 6.3369. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Jiangsu Rutong Petro-Machinery Co Ltd up 10.03 percent, followed by Zhejiang Dehong Automotive Electronic & Electrical Co Ltd, which gained 10.02 percent and Shanghai Baolong Automotive Corp up by 10 percent. ** The largest percentage losses in the Shanghai index were Aurora Optoelectronics Co Ltd down 9.98 percent, followed by Shanghai Diesel Engine Co Ltd losing 7.68 percent and Daqian Ecology Environment Group Co Ltd , which slipped 7.33 percent. ** The top gainers among H-shares were CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Ltd up 4.77 percent, followed by Huaneng Power International Inc gaining 3.41 percent and Great Wall Motor Co Ltd up by 1.11 percent. ** The three biggest H-shares percentage decliners were New China Life Insurance Co Ltd, which fell 2.82 percent, Tencent Holdings Ltd, which lost 2.4 percent and PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd, that lost 2.3 percent. ** About 6.55 billion shares have traded so far on the Shanghai exchange, roughly 44.8 percent of the market’s 30-day moving average of 14.61 billion shares a day. The volume traded was 12.93 billion shares, as of the last full trading day. ** As of 0429 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 21.01 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving average.\nReporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ",
