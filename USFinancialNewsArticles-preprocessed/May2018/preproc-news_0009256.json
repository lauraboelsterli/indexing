REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader\nShares in the world’s biggest publicly traded company have slid along with many others in the technology sector this year. Apple’s 2.4 percent drop year-to-date in 2018 is its steepest since 2016, although in that year the company had already reported by the end of April.\nThe latest hit to the stock came in mid-April after a warning on global demand from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd ( 2330.TW ), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, reminiscent of one from Cirrus Logic Inc ( CRUS.O ) five years ago.\nGraphic: Apple YTD gains in the last 5 years - reut.rs/2jjYJE7\nApple is estimated to have sold 53 million iPhones from January through March, a 4.4 percent increase year over year, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.\nTotal revenue is expected to have risen 15 percent to $60.84 billion, with net profit jumping 24 percent to $13.68 billion, or $2.68 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nHowever, the iPhone sales estimate is down 9.4 percent from three months back, amid reports of waning demand. The revenue estimate has fallen 7.4 percent and profit estimate by 3.8 percent.\nGraphic: Apple iPhone sales - reut.rs/2rbKV2M\nAlong with the estimates, its stock price has also slid this year, weakening the chances of Apple becoming the first company to top $1 trillion in value by market capitalisation.\nThe stock has topped the $900-billion mark four times in 2018, including as recently as last week, before each time falling back.\nGraphic - Apple: Race to trillion - reut.rs/2ra3LHM\nApple, hard to characterise as an out and out manufacturer or pure technology play, currently trades at 13.5 times its estimated earnings for the next twelve months, higher than its five-year average of close to 13. That is almost double the equivalent number for its main phone industry competitor, Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ), but below U.S. tech peers Alphabet ( GOOGL.O ) or Microsoft ( MSFT.O ).\nGraphic: Apple PE ratio - reut.rs/2radBcu Reporting by Savio D'Souza and graphics by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham",
