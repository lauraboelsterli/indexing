REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo\nSullivan and Videgaray discussed “continued cooperation on managing a shared border and the importance of working together to disrupt transnational criminal organizations,” State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement.\n“The Deputy also emphasized the importance of concluding a NAFTA deal,” said Nauert.\nCanada, the United States and Mexico are renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nTalks to reach a deal on reworking the 24-year-old accord have intensified in recent weeks, pressed by U.S. congressional deadlines and a common will to reach an agreement before Mexico’s July 1 presidential election.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday that President Donald Trump is focused on getting a good NAFTA deal, whether it is passed by the current or future U.S. Congress. He said Trump is not focused on specific deadlines. Reporting by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Sandra Maler",
