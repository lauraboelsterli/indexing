    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â€” Facebook has enlisted two outside advisers to examine how it treats underrepresented communities and whether it has a liberal bias.\nCivil rights leader Laura Murphy will examine civil rights issues, along with law firm Relman, Dane & Colfax. Former Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, will examine concerns about a liberal bias on Facebook.\nThe moves come as Facebook deals with a privacy scandal related to access of tens of millions of users' data by a consulting firm affiliated with President Donald Trump. CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on the issue last month. Facebook also has faced criticisms over a deluge of fake news and Russian election interference.\nThe audits were reported earlier by Axios. Facebook says the feedback will help Facebook improve and serve users more effectively.",
