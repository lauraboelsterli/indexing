    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 12:18 PM / Updated 34 minutes ago Kenya's president signs cybercrimes law opposed by media rights groups Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta signed a new law on Wednesday that outlaws the abuse of people on social media but which critics say could be exploited to repress civil liberties. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta arrives to attend The Queen's Dinner during The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), at Buckingham Palace in London on April 19, 2018. Daniel Leal-Olivas/Pool via Reuters\nProponents of the law, including the legislators who pushed it through parliament, say the proliferation of social media has given rise to new crimes including online scams, which were not covered by previous laws.\nNew York-based media rights watchdog the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) warned last week however that the bill could criminalise free speech, “with journalists and bloggers likely to be among the first victims if it is signed into law”.\nThe law lays the ground for investigation and prosecution of computer and cybercrimes including cyber-harassment and “publication of false information”, a statement from the presidency said.\nViolations to be penalised under the law include cyber-espionage, false publications, child pornography, computer-borne forgery, cyber-stalking and cyber-bullying among others, the statement said, without spelling out the penalties.\nOffenders convicted for sharing “false” or “fictitious” information and propagating hate speech will be liable to a fine of 5 million shillings ($49,776.01) or sentenced to two years in jail, or both.\nLawmakers passed the bill last month despite protests from media practitioners and rights activists that its provisions could be used to stifle press freedoms.\nKenya joins other countries in the region that have passed laws that activists say will curtail free expression.\nEarlier this month, Tanzanian bloggers and rights activists won a temporary court injunction against a government order to register online platforms that raised concerns about a crackdown on free speech.
