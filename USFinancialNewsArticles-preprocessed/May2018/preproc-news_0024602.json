    "text": "Jenny Ming launched and ran the all-American brand Old Navy and now leads Charlotte Russe . She has been named one of the most powerful women in American business by Fortune and one of the nation's top managers by Businessweek.\nBut she didn't start out as the prototypical CEO. She grew up as the shy Chinese girl in San Francisco's Chinatown, named \"Most Bashful\" in high school. Once a manager told her she would \"never make it in this business because you are such a pushover.\"\nHow did she make the leap from overlooked to high-powered retail executive? Ming tells CNBC Make It that the key to her success, and other women's, comes down to a fundamental rule: \"Never underestimate yourself.\"\nSource: Jenny Ming Jenny Ming, 1985 Ming immigrated to the U.S. from Canton, China, with her parents at age 9, and graduated from San Jose State University with a bachelor's degree in clothing merchandising and marketing in 1978.\nHer first job after college was as a management trainee at Mervyn's store in Daly City, California. Ming says she wasn't a savvy manager in the beginning. The part-time sales associates were mostly middle-aged housewives, she says, who would frequently chit-chat and take long breaks. They treated Ming like a daughter, but not like a boss.\nWhen Ming's supervisor told her she would never make it, she said to herself, \"I can't give up. It's only my first month on the job.\"\nMing went to have a heart-to-heart with the sales associates. \"I'm probably going to get fired,\" she told them. \"And then you are going to get a new boss, and they are probably going to be much, much harder on you than I am.\"",
