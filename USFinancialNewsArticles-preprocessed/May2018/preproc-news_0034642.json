    "text": "(Reuters) - Xerox Corp’s ( XRX.N ) board has scrapped the planned $6.1 billion deal with Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp ( 4901.T ) in a settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.\nXerox had been battling activist shareholder Carl Icahn and investor Darwin Deason over the company’s plan to sell itself to Fujifilm in a deal the two say dramatically undervalues the photocopying firm.\nThe termination of the deal puts the Japanese company further on the back foot in any new negotiations with Xerox, although it is by no means out of contention as Xerox is now expected to go up for sale in an auction at a higher price.\nFollowing is a timeline of events when the two investors took a stake in the company and how their relationship slowly developed into one of the most contentious proxy fights currently on record, ultimately leading to the termination of the deal.\nFeb. 8, 2010\nDarwin Deason, son of an Arkansas chicken farmer, becomes a Xerox shareholder after the copier and printer maker buys his company ACS.\nNov. 23, 2015\nCarl Icahn discloses stake in Xerox and calls shares undervalued\nJan. 29, 2016\n* Xerox to split into two companies - one holding its legacy printer operations and the other its business process outsourcing unit\n* Icahn gets three board seats on the outsourcing company\n* Icahn says separation will greatly enhance shareholder value for Xerox shareholders\nJune 23, 2016\nBusiness process outsourcing company to be named “Conduent Inc” and document technology company Xerox Corp.
