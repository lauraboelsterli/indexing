Bill Cosby reacts while being notified a verdict is in at the Montgomery County Courthouse in his sexual assault retrial, in Norristown, Pennsylvania, April 26, 2018. Mark Makela/Pool via Reuters\nCosby and Polanski are the first known members expelled for violating a code of conduct that the Academy adopted in December following accusations of sexual harassment or assault within the entertainment industry.\nCosby, 80, who was known as “America’s Dad” for his fatherly role on the popular 1980s TV comedy “The Cosby Show,” was convicted last week of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. He faces up to 30 years in prison.\nPolanski, 84, who won the best director Oscar in 2003 for World War Two drama “The Pianist,” in 1977 admitted to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles.\nThe French-Polish director lives in France and fled the United States following his guilty plea for fear his deal with prosecutors would be overruled and he would get a lengthy prison term. Polanski’s case is still ongoing.\nRepresentatives of Cosby and Polanski did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.\nFour academy members are now known to have been expelled by the academy. Once powerful producer Harvey Weinstein was expelled in October after several women accused him of decades-long sexual misconduct, sparking the #MeToo social movement.\nWeinstein, 66, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.\nActor Carmine Caridi was expelled in 2004 for distributing copies of films that are sent to academy members.
