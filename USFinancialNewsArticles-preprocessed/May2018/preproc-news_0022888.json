    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (“Sabra,” the “Company” or “we”) (Nasdaq:SBRA) (Nasdaq:SBRAP) today announced results of operations for the first quarter of 2018.\nRECENT HIGHLIGHTS\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net income attributable to common stockholders, FFO, Normalized FFO, AFFO and Normalized AFFO per diluted common share were $0.34, $0.64, $0.63, $0.59 and $0.58, respectively, compared to $0.25, $0.54, $0.55, $0.55 and $0.53, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Normalized AFFO per diluted common share increased 9.4% over the same quarter in 2017 primarily as a result of the completion of the Care Capital Properties, Inc. (CCP) merger in the third quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we received $13.0 million in payments from Senior Care Centers for the repayment in full of one loan receivable and partial payment of a second loan receivable leaving a balance of $5.0 million.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2018, we completed the sale of six facilities leased to Genesis for gross sales proceeds of $20.5 million. Of the remaining 40 facilities leased to Genesis that we plan to sell, 25 are currently under contract for sale with expected total sales proceeds of $254.0 million, and 15 are under letter of intent with expected total sales proceeds of $79.8 million. All sales are expected to be completed by the end of 2018, with the majority closing by the early part of the third quarter. Annual cash rents expected to be eliminated from the sales of the 46 facilities total $30.5 million, triggering residual rents to be paid to Sabra of $10.2 million per year for the following 4.28 years as provided for in our agreement with Genesis. We expect to retain eight facilities leased to Genesis, which generate annual cash rents of $10.4 million.\nOn May 2, 2018, we announced that we will redeem all 5,750,000 outstanding shares of our 7.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) on June 1, 2018 (the “Redemption Date”). The shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be redeemed at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the Redemption Date, without interest, in the amount of $0.4453125 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, for a total redemption price per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to $25.4453125 and an aggregate payment of $146.3 million.\nWe have updated our 2018 earnings guidance ranges as follows (per diluted common share):\nNet income attributable to common stockholders $1.98 - $2.06 (from $2.16 - $2.24) FFO attributable to common stockholders $2.48 - $2.56 (from $2.31 - $2.39) Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders $2.47 - $2.55 (from $2.48 - $2.56) AFFO attributable to common stockholders $2.28 - $2.36 (from $2.15 - $2.23) Normalized AFFO attributable to common stockholders $2.27 - $2.35 (from $2.28 - $2.36) These updates reflect revised timing for completing the Series A Preferred Stock redemption and the elimination of the previously anticipated refinancing of our $500 million of 5.5% senior unsecured notes due 2021 and $200 million of 5.375% senior unsecured notes due 2023 during the second half of 2018. Our current expectations for pricing of a 2018 unsecured bond offering to complete the refinancing is not compelling. Accordingly, we will be patient and pursue any such refinancing opportunistically prior to the relevant maturity dates. These changes impact our guidance range through higher interest expense and preferred stock dividends as well as the elimination of the loss on extinguishment of debt impacting net income, FFO and AFFO amounts only.\nOn May 9, 2018, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on May 31, 2018 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 21, 2018.\nCommenting on the first quarter results, Rick Matros, CEO and Chairman, said, “Sabra’s execution of its stated strategic initiatives is approaching conclusion. The CCP merger integration is complete, the Signature Healthcare restructuring is complete, and Genesis Exodus remains on schedule. Any additional initiatives related to portfolio improvement will be opportunistic at this point. We expect our Skilled Nursing concentration to be at 61% by year end, absent any additional disposition opportunities. That will put us at four percentage points higher than where our Skilled Nursing concentration was prior to the close of the CCP merger and a reduction of 13 percentage points in just 16 months. Our operational metrics are stable across the board.”\n“The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announcement of the 2.4% market basket increase was the largest in quite some time. We expect the impact of Value Based Payments (VBP) to be generally neutral. We also expect the announced Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) to be net positive for Sabra’s operators. There are material improvements over what was to be RCS-I. The system has been simplified, regulatory requirements have been reduced, and CMS expects costs savings of $2 billion for the industry. We expect that the shift in emphasis to complex nursing patients will result in behavioral changes that will be beneficial to the Skilled Nursing industry and that the return of concurrent and group therapy for rehab patients will benefit margins and accentuate efficiency. The existing reimbursement system’s sole financial incentive on rehab patients has resulted in decreasing length of stay with subsequent decreases in occupancy. We believe that PDPM will allow operators to better balance clinical services and expand the range of patients currently cared for. We appreciate the collaborative approach that CMS has taken to improve the existing reimbursement system and its focus on improved clinical outcomes.”\nOPERATING STATISTICS TRIPLE-NET PORTFOLIO (1) Coverage EBITDAR EBITDARM Occupancy Percentage Skilled Mix Property Type 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care 1.33x 1.37x 1.80x 1.85x 80.9% 80.8% 37.6% 37.2% Senior Housing - Leased 1.09x 1.09x 1.26x 1.26x 86.8% 87.3% NA NA Specialty Hospitals and Other 3.45x 3.56x 3.75x 3.87x 83.4% 79.3% NA NA (1) EBITDAR Coverage, EBITDARM Coverage, Occupancy Percentage and Skilled Mix (collectively, “Operating Statistics”) for each period presented include only Stabilized Facilities owned by the Company as of the end of the respective period.

operating expenses. The three months ended March 31, 2018 also includes a contingency fee of $2.0 million earned during the period related to a CCP investment.\n(2) Merger and acquisition costs primarily relate to the CCP merger.\nREPORTING DEFINITIONS\nAdjusted EBITDA*\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) excluding the impact of merger-related costs, stock-based compensation expense under the Company's long-term equity award program, and loan loss reserves. Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating performance.\nAncillary Supported Tenant\nA tenant, or one of its affiliates, that owns an ancillary business that depends on providing services to the residents of the properties leased by the affiliated operating company (Sabra's tenant) for a meaningful part of the ancillary business's profitability and has below market EBITDAR coverage.\nCash Net Operating Income (“Cash NOI”)*\nThe Company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company considers Cash NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate the operating performance of its investments. The Company defines Cash NOI as total revenues less operating expenses and non-cash rental income. Cash NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income.\nConsolidated Debt\nThe principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, and secured indebtedness as reported in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Enterprise Value\nThe Company believes Consolidated Enterprise Value is an important measurement as it is a measure of a company’s value. The Company calculates Consolidated Enterprise Value as market equity capitalization plus Consolidated Debt. Market equity capitalization is calculated as (i) the number of shares of common stock multiplied by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last day of the period presented plus (ii) the number of shares of preferred stock multiplied by the closing price of the Company's preferred stock on the last day of the period presented. Consolidated Enterprise Value includes the Company's market equity capitalization and Consolidated Debt, less cash and cash equivalents.\nEBITDAR\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (“EBITDAR”) for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company) for the period presented. EBITDAR includes an imputed management fee of 5.0% of revenues for Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities and Senior Housing - Leased communities and an imputed management fee of 2.5% of revenues for Specialty Hospitals and Other facilities. The Company uses EBITDAR in determining EBITDAR Coverage. EBITDAR has limitations as an analytical tool. EBITDAR does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, EBITDAR does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. The Company utilizes EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of the Company's operators/tenants and relevant guarantors to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.\nEBITDAR Coverage\nRepresents the ratio of EBITDAR to contractual rent for owned facilities (excluding Senior Housing - Managed). EBITDAR Coverage is a supplemental measure of an operator/tenant's ability to meet their cash rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR. EBITDAR Coverage includes only Stabilized Facilities and excludes significant tenants with meaningful credit enhancement through guarantees (which include Genesis, Holiday and three legacy CCP tenants), two Ancillary Supported Tenants and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\nEBITDARM\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees (“EBITDARM”) for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company), for the period presented. The Company uses EBITDARM in determining EBITDARM Coverage. The usefulness of EBITDARM is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR. Together with EBITDAR, the Company utilizes EBITDARM to evaluate the core operations of the properties by eliminating management fees, which vary based on operator/tenant and its operating structure.\nEBITDARM Coverage\nRepresents the ratio of EBITDARM to contractual rent for owned facilities (excluding Senior Housing - Managed properties). EBITDARM coverage is a supplemental measure of a property's ability to generate cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator's/tenant's related cash rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDARM. EBITDARM Coverage includes only Stabilized Facilities and excludes significant tenants with meaningful credit enhancement through guarantees (which include Genesis, Holiday and three legacy CCP tenants), two Ancillary Supported Tenants and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\nFixed Charge Coverage Ratio\nEBITDAR (including adjustments for one-time and pro forma items) for the period indicated (one quarter in arrears) for all operations of any entities that guarantee the tenants' lease obligations to the Company divided by the same period cash rent expense, interest expense and mandatory principal payments for operations of any entity that guarantees the tenants' lease obligation to the Company. Fixed Charge Coverage is a supplemental measure of a guarantor's ability to meet the operator/tenant's cash rent and other obligations to the Company should the operator/tenant be unable to do so itself. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR. Fixed Charge Coverage is calculated by the Company as described above based on information provided by guarantors without independent verification by the Company and may differ from similar metrics calculated by the guarantors.\nFunds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“FFO”) and Adjusted Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“AFFO”)*\nThe Company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined in accordance with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), and Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO (and related per share amounts) are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of the Company's operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income attributable to common stockholders, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, net of amounts related to noncontrolling interests, the Company's share of depreciation and amortization related to our unconsolidated joint venture, and real estate impairment charges. AFFO is defined as FFO excluding merger and acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expense, straight-line rental income adjustments, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, non-cash interest income adjustments, non-cash interest expense and our share of other non-cash adjustments related to our unconsolidated joint venture, as well as other non-cash revenue and expense items (including non-cash portion of loss on extinguishment of debt, change in fair value of contingent consideration, provision for doubtful straight-line rental income, loan losses and other reserves, ineffectiveness gain/loss on derivative instruments, and non-cash revenue and expense amounts related to noncontrolling interests). The Company believes that the use of FFO and AFFO (and the related per share amounts), combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of the Company's operating results among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among real estate investment trusts more meaningful. The Company considers FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding the applicable items listed above, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund the Company’s future cash requirements. Further, the Company’s computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define AFFO differently than the Company does.\nInvestment\nRepresents the carrying amount of real estate assets after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization and excludes net intangible assets and liabilities. Investment also includes the Company's pro rata share of the real estate assets held in the Company's unconsolidated joint venture.\nMarket Capitalization\nTotal common shares of Sabra outstanding multiplied by the closing price per common share as of a given period.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”)*\nThe Company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company considers NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate the operating performance of its investments. The Company defines NOI as total revenues less operating expenses. NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income.\nNormalized FFO and Normalized AFFO*\nNormalized FFO and Normalized AFFO represent FFO and AFFO, respectively, adjusted for certain income and expense items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its ongoing operating results. The Company considers Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO to be useful measures to evaluate the Company’s operating results excluding these income and expense items to help investors compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies. Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund the Company’s future cash requirements. Further, the Company’s computation of Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO may not be comparable to Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define FFO and AFFO or Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO differently than the Company does.\nOccupancy Percentage\nOccupancy Percentage represents the facilities’ average operating occupancy for the period indicated. The percentages are calculated by dividing the actual census from the period presented by the available beds/units for the same period. Occupancy includes only Stabilized Facilities and excludes facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. Occupancy Percentage for the Company's unconsolidated joint venture is weighted to reflect the Company's pro rata share.\nREVPOR\nREVPOR represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month at Senior Housing - Managed communities for the period indicated. It is calculated as resident fees and services revenues divided by average monthly occupied room days. REVPOR includes only Stabilized Facilities. REVPOR for the Company's unconsolidated joint venture is weighted to reflect the Company's pro rata share.\nSenior Housing\nSenior Housing communities include independent living, assisted living, continuing care retirement and memory care communities.\nSkilled Nursing/Transitional Care\nSkilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities include skilled nursing, transitional care, multi-license designation and mental health facilities.\nSpecialty Hospitals and Other\nIncludes acute care, long-term acute care, rehabilitation and behavioral hospitals, facilities that provide residential services, which may include assistance with activities of daily living, and other facilities not classified as Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care or Senior Housing.\nStabilized Facility\nAt the time of acquisition, the Company classifies each facility as either stabilized or pre-stabilized. In addition, the Company may classify a facility as pre-stabilized after acquisition. Circumstances that could result in a facility being classified as pre-stabilized include newly completed developments, facilities undergoing major renovations or additions, facilities being repositioned or transitioned to new operators, and significant transitions within the tenants’ business model. Such facilities will be reclassified to stabilized upon maintaining consistent occupancy (85% for Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities and 90% for Senior Housing communities) but in no event beyond 24 months after the date of classification as pre-stabilized. Stabilized Facilities exclude (i) Senior Housing - Managed communities, (ii) facilities held for sale, (iii) facilities being sold pursuant to the Company's CCP portfolio repositioning, (iv) facilities being transitioned from leased by the Company to being operated by the Company, and (v) facilities acquired during the three months preceding the period presented.\nTotal Debt\nConsolidated Debt plus the Company's pro rata share of the principal balances of the debt of the Company’s unconsolidated joint venture.\nTotal Enterprise Value\nConsolidated Enterprise Value plus the Company's pro rata share of the principal balances of the debt of the Company's unconsolidated joint venture.\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliations, definitions and important discussions regarding the usefulness and limitations of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures used in this release can be found at http://www.sabrahealth.com/investors/financials/reports-presentations/non-gaap .\nSource:Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc.",
