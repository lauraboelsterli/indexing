(NASDAQ: SGMO) today reported first quarter 2018 financial results and recent accomplishments.\n\"This is an exciting time for Sangamo; we expect potential clinical data readouts from 7 studies in 2018 and 2019, beginning in late summer of this year with anticipated data from our hemophilia A gene therapy and MPS II genome editing programs,\" said Sandy Macrae, CEO of Sangamo. \"In order to realize the potential of our platform technologies, we recently raised additional capital to strengthen our balance sheet. This funding will allow us to retain and invest in valuable programs for development and potential commercialization, particularly in select therapeutic areas including inherited metabolic diseases, rare CNS disorders, and immunology.\"\nRecent Highlights\nCorporate\nStrengthened balance sheet with public offering of common stock raising net proceeds of approximately $216 million Established global collaboration and license agreement with Kite, a Gilead Company, for the development of next-generation cell therapies for oncology\nClinical\nTreated the fourth patient in the SB-525 Phase 1/2 Alta Study for hemophilia A Treated the fourth patient in the SB-913 Phase 1/2 CHAMPIONS Study for MPS II Received Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) from the MHRA of the U.K. for enrollment of subjects in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of SB-FIX for hemophilia B.

ST-400 is being developed in collaboration with Bioverativ, a Sanofi Company After demonstrating safety at the first dose cohort in the SB-913 MPS II clinical trial, amended Phase 1/2 study protocol for SB-318 MPS I trial to begin enrolling patients directly into the second dose cohort\nResearch\nPublication of preclinical murine study data from MPS II in vivo genome editing program in the April 2018 issue of Molecular Therapy Sangamo scientists or collaborators will deliver three oral and four poster presentations during the 21 st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) being held in Chicago, IL from May 16-19, 2018\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, Sangamo reported a consolidated net loss of $20.2 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $16.6 million, or $0.23 per share, for the same period in 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and interest receivable of $234.9 million. This balance does not include the $150 million upfront payment from the collaboration agreement with Kite, effective April 5 th , or the approximately $216 million in net proceeds from the recent public offering of Sangamo's common stock, which closed on April 30 th .\nRevenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $12.6 million, compared to $3.4 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in revenues was primarily related to the hemophilia A collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer. First quarter 2018 revenues were primarily generated from Sangamo's collaboration agreements with Pfizer and Bioverativ.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $33.6 million, compared to $20.2 million for the same period in 2017. Research and development expenses were $23.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $12.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to clinical and manufacturing expenses in support of current clinical studies and investment in dedicated manufacturing capacity. General and administrative expenses were $10.1 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $7.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to salaries and related costs and other professional fees in support of overall Company growth.\nFinancial Guidance for 2018\nThe Company updates guidance as follows:\nOperating Expenses: Sangamo expects that operating expenses will be in the range of $140 million to $150 million for year-end 2018, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Cash and Investments: Sangamo expects a year-end 2018 balance of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and interest receivable of at least $485 million. This anticipated cash balance is inclusive of research funding from existing collaborators and recent financings, but exclusive of funds arising from any additional new collaborations or partnerships or other sources of capital.\nConference Call\nSangamo will host a conference call today, May 8, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. ET, which will be open to the public.

These forward looking statements include, without limitation, the expectation for potential clinical data readouts from 7 studies in 2018 and 2019, beginning in late summer of this year with anticipated data from our hemophilia A gene therapy and MPS II genome editing programs, that the recently received funding will allow us to retain and invest in valuable programs for development and potential commercialization, particularly in select therapeutic areas including inherited metabolic diseases, rare CNS disorders, and immunology, the expectation that we will begin to enroll patients directly into the second dose cohort in the Phase 1/2 study protocol for SB-318 MPS I trial, the expectation that Sangamo scientists or collaborators will deliver three oral and four poster presentations during the 21 st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) being held in Chicago, IL from May 16-19, 2018, and the year-end financial guidance provided related to operating expense and cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and interest receivable. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the dependence on the success of clinical trials of lead programs, the lengthy and uncertain regulatory approval process, uncertainties related to the initiation and completion of clinical trials, whether clinical trial results will validate and support the safety and efficacy of Sangamo's therapeutics, the reliance on partners and other third-parties to meet their clinical and manufacturing obligations, and the ability to maintain strategic partnerships. Further, there can be no assurance that the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained or that Sangamo and its partners will be able to develop commercially viable product candidates. Actual results may differ from those projected in forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties that exist in Sangamo's operations and business environments. These risks and uncertainties are described more fully in Sangamo's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are made as of this date, and Sangamo undertakes no duty to update such information except as required under applicable law.\nSELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA\n(unaudited; in thousands, except per share data)\nStatement of Operations Data:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenues:\nCollaboration agreements\n$ 12,551\n$ 3,306\nResearch grants\n86\n119\nTotal revenues\n12,637\n3,425\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development\n23,547\n12,942\nGeneral and administrative\n10,087\n7,275\nTotal operating expenses\n33,634\n20,217\nLoss from operations\n(20,997)\n(16,792)\nInterest and other income, net\n810\n160\nNet loss\n$ (20,187)\n$ (16,632)\nBasic and diluted net loss per common share\n$ (0.23)\n$ (0.23)\nShares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per common share\n86,334\n71,025\nSELECTED BALANCE SHEET DATA\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nCash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and interest receivable\n$ 234,885\n$ 244,560\nTotal assets\n281,168\n286,741\nTotal stockholders' equity\n182,365\n187,900\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sangamo-therapeutics-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300644148.html\nSOURCE Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.",
