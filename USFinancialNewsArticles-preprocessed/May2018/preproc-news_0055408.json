    "text": "FORT COLLINS, Colo., Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:AEIS), a global leader in innovative power and control technologies, today announced it has acquired the electrostatic business of privately-held Monroe Electronics , Inc. located in Lyndonville, New York. For more than 50 years, Monroe’s electrostatic detection and measurement instrumentation has led in technology and quality, serving specific areas of testing and ongoing monitoring of ionization systems across a variety of applications. In addition, the non-contact electrostatic voltmeters and field meters complement those of Trek, AE’s most recent acquisition. Production of these electrostatic products will be integrated into the recently acquired Trek manufacturing facility in nearby Lockport, New York.\n\"Today's announcement comes on the heels of our acquisition of Trek and increases our technology and IP portfolio in the Specialty Power offerings, especially in the electrostatic applications space, capitalizes on our existing manufacturing capabilities at Trek and expands our total addressable market,” said Yuval Wasserman, president and CEO at Advanced Energy.\n“We are very excited to bring this technical talent to the AE family. Monroe’s legacy experience in electrostatics metrology and mitigation allows us not only to enter adjacent markets, but offer customers a wider array of solutions,” said Mike McDonald, SVP of Specialty Power Products at Advanced Energy.\nAbout Advanced Energy\nAdvanced Energy (Nasdaq:AEIS) is a global leader in innovative power and control technologies for high-growth, precision power solutions for thin films processes and industrial applications. Advanced Energy is headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado, with dedicated support and service locations around the world. For more information, visit: www.advanced-energy.com .\nAbout Monroe Electronics, Inc.\nIncorporated in 1954 in Rochester, NY (Monroe County), Monroe Electronics started out as a custom engineering house, designing and manufacturing specialized instrumentation & systems for local industries. In the late 1950’s, Robert E. Vosteen, the Company’s founder invented a reliable, precise, drift-free method for non-contacting measurement of static electricity. This feedback electrostatic measurement technique became the international standard for measurements utilized in photocopier R&D, industrial monitoring, sensitive electronic assembly, bio-electric research, lightning warning, among many other areas. They currently offer a complete line of electrostatic measuring instruments including electrostatic voltmeters, electrostatic fieldmeters, coulomb meters and resistivity meters through a worldwide group of distributors and representatives.
