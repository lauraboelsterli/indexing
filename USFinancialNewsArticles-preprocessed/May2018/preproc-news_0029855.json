    "text": "Stephen Hawking Time Travelers Are Invited to Stephen Hawking's Memorial Service Stephen Hawking, CH, CBE, FRS, Dennis Stanton Avery and Sally Tsui Wong-Avery Director of Research, University of Cambridge as he and Yuri Milner host press conference to announce Breakthrough Starshot, a new space exploration initiative, at One World Observatory on April 12, 2016 in New York City. Bryan Bedder 2016 Getty Images By Mahita Gajanan Updated: May 12, 2018 2:20 PM ET\nMembers of the public are invited to apply to attend Stephen Hawking’s memorial service — and the ballot is open to time travelers hoping to stop by to pay their respects.\nThe family of the late theoretical physicist has offered 1,000 free tickets in a ballot system run by the Stephen Hawking Foundation. People applying to attend Hawking’s remembrance at Westminster Abbey on June 15 are required to state their date of birth on the form, with the eligible year including any time up until 2038.\nThe option of selecting any day up to Dec. 31, 2018, was spotted by London travel blogger IanVisits , according to Reuters.\n“Professor Hawking once threw a party for time travelers, to see if any would turn up if he posted the invite after the party,” he wrote. “None did, but it seems perfect that the memorial website allows people born in the future to attend the service.”\nHawking, who died on March 14, had a longtime curiosity with the potential for time travel .\nHawking’s ashes will be scattered near the graves of Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. You can apply to attend the service here .",
