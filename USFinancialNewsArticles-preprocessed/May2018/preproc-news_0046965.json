    "text": "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla., May 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: DY) announced today its results for the first quarter ended April 28, 2018. The Company reported:\nContract revenues of $731.4 million for the quarter ended April 28, 2018, compared to $786.3 million for the quarter ended April 29, 2017. Contract revenues for the quarter ended April 28, 2018 decreased 10.0% on an organic basis. Organic revenue excludes $14.8 million of contract revenues from storm restoration services in the current period and contract revenues from acquired businesses that were not owned for the entire period in both the current and prior year quarter. Total contract revenues from acquired businesses were $15.4 million for the quarter ended April 28, 2018, compared to $7.1 million for the quarter ended April 29, 2017. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $73.7 million, or 10.1% of contract revenues, for the quarter ended April 28, 2018, compared to $108.2 million, or 13.8% of contract revenues, for the quarter ended April 29, 2017. On a GAAP basis, net income was $17.2 million, or $0.53 per common share diluted, for the quarter ended April 28, 2018, compared to net income of $38.8 million, or $1.22 per common share diluted, for the quarter ended April 29, 2017. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income was $20.6 million, or $0.65 per Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Share, for the quarter ended April 28, 2018, compared to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income of $41.6 million, or $1.30 per common share diluted, for the quarter ended April 29, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income for the quarters ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017 excludes $4.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of pre-tax interest expense for the non-cash amortization of the debt discount associated with the Company's 0.75% convertible senior notes due September 2021 (the \"Notes\"). Shares used in computing Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share for the quarter ended April 28, 2018 exclude the GAAP dilutive effect of approximately 0.6 million weighted shares from the Notes, as the Company has a note hedge in effect to offset the economic dilution of additional shares up to an average quarterly share price of $130.43 per share.\nOutlook\nThe Company is revising its financial guidance for the 2019 fiscal year ending January 26, 2019 to reflect the actual results for the quarter ended April 28, 2018 and the anticipated timing of activity on large customer programs and the related impacts on revenues and margins.

The addback for fiscal 2019 also includes approximately $0.01 for the Q1-19 Non-GAAP impact of the dilutive share effect of the Notes.\n(c) Actual GAAP diluted shares will include any dilutive effect of the Notes based on the average share price during the respective period. The Company has a note hedge in effect to offset the economic dilution of additional shares from the Notes up to an average quarterly price of $130.43 per share. Accordingly, for Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share calculations, the Company expects to present results per share that exclude the dilutive effect of the Notes, if any, based on the expected effect of the note hedge.\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA BASED ON THE MIDPOINT OF EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (\"EPS\") REVISED GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2019 AND QUARTER ENDING JULY 28, 2018\nQuarter Ending\nFiscal 2019\nJuly 28, 2018\n(at midpoint of EPS guidance)\nNet income\n$\n136\n$\n35.0\nInterest expense, net\n42\n10.5\nProvision for income taxes\n52\n13.3\nDepreciation and amortization\n180\n45.2\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization (\"EBITDA\")\n410\n103.9\nGain on sale of fixed assets\n(16)\n(4.1)\nStock-based compensation expense\n26\n6.6\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n420\n$\n106.4\nContract revenues (at midpoint of guidance)\n$\n3,330\n$\n845\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA % of Contract Revenues (at midpoint of guidance)\n12.6%\n12.6%\nAmounts in tables above may not add due to rounding.\nDYCOM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In the Company's quarterly results releases, trend schedules, conference calls, slide presentations, and webcasts, it may use or discuss Non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company believes that the presentation of certain Non-GAAP financial measures in these materials provides information that is useful to investors because it allows for a more direct comparison of the Company's performance for the period reported with the Company's performance in prior periods. The Company cautions that Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the Company's reported GAAP results. Management defines the Non-GAAP financial measures used in this release as follows:\nNon-GAAP Organic Contract Revenues - contract revenues from businesses that are included for the entire period in both the current and prior year periods, excluding contract revenues from storm restoration services. Non-GAAP Organic Contract Revenue growth (decline) is calculated as the percentage change in Non-GAAP Organic Contract Revenues over those of the comparable prior year period. Management believes organic growth (decline) is a helpful measure for comparing the Company's revenue performance with prior periods. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA - net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale of fixed assets, stock-based compensation expense, and certain non-recurring items. Management believes Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is a helpful measure for comparing the Company's operating performance with prior periods as well as with the performance of other companies with different capital structures or tax rates. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income - GAAP net income before non-cash amortization of the debt discount and the related tax impact and certain non-recurring items. Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share and Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Shares - Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income divided by Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Shares outstanding. The Company has a note hedge in effect to offset the economic dilution of additional shares from the Notes up to an average quarterly share price of $130.43. The measure of Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted shares used in computing Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share excludes dilution from the Notes. Management believes that the calculation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted shares to reflect the note hedge will be useful to investors because it provides insight into the offsetting economic effect of the hedge against potential conversion of the Notes.\nManagement excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share:\nNon-cash amortization of the debt discount - The Company's Notes were allocated between debt and equity components. The difference between the principal amount and the carrying amount of the liability component of the Notes represents a debt discount. The debt discount is being amortized over the term of the Notes but does not result in periodic cash interest payments. The Company has excluded the non-cash amortization of the debt discount from its Non-GAAP financial measures because it believes it is useful to analyze the component of interest expense for the Notes that will be paid in cash. The exclusion of the non-cash amortization from the Company's Non-GAAP financial measures provides management with a consistent measure for assessing financial results. Tax impact of adjusted results - The tax impact of adjusted results reflects the Company's effective tax rate used for financial planning for the applicable period.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dycom-industries-inc-announces-fiscal-2019-first-quarter-results-provides-guidance-for-the-next-fiscal-quarter-and-lowers-expectations-for-the-full-fiscal-year-300652549.html\nSOURCE Dycom Industries, Inc.",
