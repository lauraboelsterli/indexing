Mr. Lumpkins will continue as a director to ensure a smooth transition.\nMr. Ebel has served on the Board since 2012.

We wish Jim all the best in his retirement.”\nMr. Bernardes currently serves as Managing Partner, Yguaporã Consultoria e Empreendimentos Ltd., a consulting and investment firm in São Paulo, Brazil.
