    "text": "Tesla may be on the verge of a pretty big leap in Model 3 production this week, reported electric car blog Electrek , citing a leaked email from CEO Elon Musk to employees.\nThe email said it is \"quite likely\" Tesla will make more than 500 Model 3 cars per day this week. If Tesla is still running production nonstop, as it said it would , then Tesla would be able to hit a weekly production rate of 3500 cars per week. For comparison, it hit a production rate of 2,270 cars in the last week of April.\nTesla was not immediately available for comment.\nMusk also asked employees to identify any production bottlenecks.\nTesla has struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3, which is supposed to be the car that transforms Tesla into a mainstream auto manufacturer, rather than a niche maker of high-end vehicles.\nThe company is trying to reach a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the quarter. The company had initially hoped to hit that target by the end of last year.\nRead the full story at Electrek\nWATCH: Elon Musk's big ambitions may be killing Tesla show chapters Tesla's earnings were better than expected, but Elon Musk still has a lot on his plate 8:48 PM ET Wed, 2 May 2018 | 05:31",
