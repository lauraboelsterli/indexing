    "text": "CORAL GABLES, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (NYSE: FDP) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2018. The Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.85 for the first quarter 2018, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.90 in the first quarter of 2017. Comparable earnings per diluted share were $0.88 in the first quarter of 2018, compared with comparable earnings per diluted share of $0.84 in the first quarter of 2017.\n“Our growth during the first quarter is a testament to our initiatives to strengthen the foundation of our Company through diversification to become the world’s leading supplier of healthful, wholesome and convenient fresh and value-added food and beverages,” said Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The acquisition of Mann Packing already contributed robust one-month sales growth and profitability in the value-added product line without the implementation of any synergies. Our avocado product line also showed strong results. These are two good examples of our continued commitment to executing our diversification strategy. However, we did face a series of external headwinds brought on by unfavorable weather and logistical challenges that hindered our progress. We remain resolute and enthusiastic about future opportunities, especially in our value-added products, with several exciting new direct to consumer ventures and innovative products to emerge during the coming months to further drive diversification.\"\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $1,106.1 million, compared with $1,032.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net sales was the result of higher net sales in the Company's other fresh produce and banana business segments, partially offset by lower net sales in the Company's prepared food business segment.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $106.5 million, compared with $99.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher gross profit in the Company's banana business segment, principally the result of higher selling prices in all of the Company's regions, along with favorable exchange rates in Europe and Asia. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher fruit procurement and distribution costs.\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $56.5 million, compared with operating income of $53.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Comparable operating income was $57.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with comparable operating income of $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses, and lower gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment.\nNet income attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. for the first quarter of 2018 was $41.5 million, compared with net income attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. of $46.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Comparable net income was $42.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with comparable net income of $43.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense, net and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by higher operating income and lower provision for income taxes.\nFresh Del Monte Produce Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (U.S. dollars in millions) - (Unaudited) Quarter ended Income Statement: March 30,\n2018 March 31,\n2017 Net sales $ 1,106.1 $ 1,032.4 Cost of products sold 999.6 933.3 Gross profit 106.5 99.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 48.6 47.9 Gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, net (2) 0.2 0.8 Asset impairment and other charges (credits), net (1) 1.6 (1.9 ) Operating income 56.5 53.9 Interest expense, net 3.6 1.3 Other expense, net 3.4 0.1 Income before income taxes 49.5 52.5 Provision for income taxes 6.3 6.9 Net income $ 43.2 $ 45.6 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests 1.7 (0.8 ) Net income attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. $ 41.5 $ 46.4 Net income per ordinary share attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. - Basic $ 0.85 $ 0.91 Net income per ordinary share attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. - Diluted $ 0.85 $ 0.90 Dividends declared per ordinary share $ 0.150 $ 0.150 Weighted average number of ordinary shares: Basic 48,781,596 51,218,502 Diluted 49,032,952 51,668,110 Selected Income Statement Data: Depreciation and amortization $ 21.1 $ 20.0 Non-GAAP Measures (per share): Reported net income - Diluted $ 0.85 $ 0.90 Asset impairment and other charges (credits), net (1) 0.03 (0.04 ) Gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, net (2) — (0.02 ) Comparable net income - Diluted $ 0.88 $ 0.84 (1)\nAsset impairment and other charges (credits), net for the quarter ended March 30, 2018 included acquisition costs related to Mann Packing net of insurance recoveries in North America.

Some of the information presented in this press release reflects adjustments to GAAP measures such as amounts related to restructuring, asset impairment charges, loss (gain) on sales of assets and certain other special items, if any. Management believes these adjustments provide a more comparable analysis of the ongoing operating performance of the business. These adjustments result in non-GAAP financial measures and are referred to in this press release as comparable operating income, comparable net income and comparable net income per share. Because all companies do not use identical calculations, our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nComparable operating income (loss) and comparable net income (loss) provide us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business. We use comparable operating income (loss) and comparable net income (loss) to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because management believes they provide more comparable measures of our continuing business as they adjust for special items that are not reflective of the normal earnings of our business. These measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business because these measures:\nAre used by investors to measure a company's comparable operating performance; Are financial measurements that are used by lenders and other parties to evaluate creditworthiness; and Are used by our management for various purposes, including as measures of performance of our operating entities and as a basis of strategic planning and forecasting.\nConference Call and Web Cast Data\nFresh Del Monte will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today to discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results and to review the Company’s progress and outlook. The webcast can be accessed on the Company’s Investor Relations home page at http://ir.freshdelmonte.com . The call will be available for re-broadcast on the Company’s web site approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call.\nAbout Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.\nFresh Del Monte is one of the world’s leading vertically integrated producers, marketers and distributors of high-quality fresh and fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, as well as a leading producer and distributor of prepared food in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
