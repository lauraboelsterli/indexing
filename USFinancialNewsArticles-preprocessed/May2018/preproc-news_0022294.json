    "text": "NEW YORK, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fortress Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ:FBIO) (“Fortress”), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring, developing and commercializing novel pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the first 2018.\nLindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D., Fortress’ Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We have made significant advancements in the four years since we created and implemented our unique and efficient business model to benefit all stakeholders. The centralization of a number of critical corporate and R&D functions at Fortress allows our subsidiaries, or “Fortress Companies,” to leverage internal synergies and minimize costs, so they can focus on getting drugs into the hands of people who need them. Our focus on continuing to build value through our strong business development engine and R&D team has led to the launch of nine development-stage subsidiaries, one specialty dermatology subsidiary and the in-licensing of more than 25 development-stage therapies since January 2014. The long-term success of our subsidiaries benefits Fortress through modest royalties on sales and annual and event-driven equity grants.”\nDr. Rosenwald added, “By offering investment opportunities to finance specific Fortress Companies, we enable investors to select more concentrated exposure in innovative therapeutic areas, like CAR-T therapy and checkpoint inhibitors. We have done just that in the 18 months since we completed a successful tender offer for the majority of shares in National Holdings Corporation. This unique relationship enables us to offer National Holdings’ clients the opportunity to invest in drug candidates across a range of developmental stages and therapeutic areas. We are pleased with our synergistic collaboration with National Holdings and the significant progress National Holdings has made in the past 18 months to transform its firm culture.”\nAccomplishments since launch of Fortress business model in January 2014:\nResearch and development\nEstablished 9 development-stage Fortress Companies in areas including CAR-T therapy, checkpoint inhibitors, gene therapy, rare diseases and pain management Established Journey Medical Corporation, a specialty dermatology company with four marketed products (Targadox®, Ceracade®, Triderm™ and Luxamend®) and a contract sales and marketing operation of more than 30 professionals In-licensed more than 25 development-stage programs across multiple therapeutic areas, which are currently in development at Fortress and the Fortress Companies Established a 27,000 sq. foot CAR-T processing facility at UMass Medicine Science Park in Worcester, Massachusetts, to manufacture Mustang Bio’s CAR-T therapies\nCorporate\nEstablished a business development / search and evaluate team, and expanded headcount to approximately 20 employees Built a corporate operations team (finance, accounting, legal, investor relations and human resources) of 15 employees and expanded manufacturing, quality, regulatory, clinical and R&D staff to 34 employees\nFinancial Results:\nAs of March 31, 2018, Fortress’ consolidated cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments (certificates of deposit), cash deposits with clearing organizations and restricted cash totaled $179.4 million, compared to $168.3 million as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $11.1 million for the quarter.

Issuance of these patents is expected in the second quarter of 2018. In April 2018, Avenue completed enrollment in its Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, three-arm clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of IV tramadol 50 mg and 25 mg versus placebo for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients following bunionectomy surgery. Avenue expects to report topline data in the second quarter of 2018.\nCaelum Biosciences, Inc.\nIn March 2018, a new analysis of data from the Phase 1b trial of Caelum’s CAEL-101 (mAb 11-1F4) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory amyloid light chain (“AL”) amyloidosis was presented at the 16th International Symposium on Amyloidosis. The data demonstrated a correlation between a sustained decrease in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and an improvement in global longitudinal strain (“GLS”) following CAEL-101 treatment in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis.\nCheckpoint Therapeutics, Inc.\nIn March 2018, Checkpoint completed an underwritten public offering that raised net proceeds of $20.8 million. Also in March 2018, Checkpoint completed the dose escalation portion of the ongoing Phase 1 trial of CK-301, a fully human anti-PD-L1 antibody, in selected recurrent or metastatic cancers, and initiated the first dose expansion cohort, which is evaluating an 800 mg dose of CK-301 administered every two weeks. In April 2018, Checkpoint presented preclinical data on BET inhibitor CK-103 at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting. CK-103 demonstrated combinatorial effects in an in vivo model with anti-PD-1 antibodies, which may support the development of CK-103 as an anti-cancer agent alone and in combination with Checkpoint’s anti-PD-L1 antibody CK-301.\nMustang Bio, Inc.\nIn March 2018, Mustang announced that Sadik Kassim, Ph.D., was appointed Chief Scientific Officer, and Knut Niss, Ph.D., was named Chief Technology Officer.\nNational Holdings Corporation:\nFortress acquired approximately 57% of National Holdings Corporation (“National Holdings”) in September 2016.
