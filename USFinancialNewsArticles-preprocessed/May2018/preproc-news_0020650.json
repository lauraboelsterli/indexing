    "text": "Company Announces Record Backlog at $1.1 billion and Provides Full Year Guidance\nMerger Summary\nOn March 26, 2018, the Company announced the completion of its merger with M III Acquisition Corp. The Company entered into a new credit facility which provides for aggregate revolving borrowings of up to $50.0 million and a $50.0 million (plus, subject to certain conditions, an additional $25.0 million accordion capacity) delayed-draw term loan facility, each maturing in March 2021. Shares of Common Stock outstanding as of March 31, 2018 were 21.6 million, of which 48.3% is held by funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management L.P. and certain members of IEA’s management team.\nINDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc. (NASDAQ:IEA) (“IEA” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nJP Roehm, IEA's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Our recently completed merger has transformed us into a public company, building upon our over seventy years in the construction industry, and represents a significant step forward in the advancement of our long-term business strategy. With this transaction, we believe our financial structure will enable us to capitalize on the substantial opportunities in our core renewable energy business, as well as diversify our platform into adjacent specialty engineering and construction markets. We remain highly enthusiastic about IEA’s outlook for 2018 and beyond as we execute upon our sizeable backlog, leverage our capabilities and experience to take full advantage of the growth in our industry, and provide additional services for clients and greater opportunities for our employees, while building shareholder value for our investors.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results Summary\nIEA’s revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $50.1 million, which represents a decrease of 4.1% (or $2.1 million) when compared to the same period in 2017, and an increase of $2.6 million if the impact of the customer settlement described below is excluded. This result, which was generally in line with management’s expectations, primarily reflects the seasonality which has traditionally caused the first quarter of each year to be IEA’s lowest revenue quarter.\nIEA also reported a gross loss of $3.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to gross profit of $8.1 million in the same period of 2017. This change in gross profit reflects:\nFavorable margins on certain projects during the first quarter of 2017, which produced an additional $6.0 million of gross margin when compared to normalized levels experienced by IEA during the first quarter of 2018. A charge of $4.7 million relating to settlement by IEA of a dispute with a key customer over certain change order billings. While IEA is confident that its billings were payable in full under the contract terms, management determined that it was in the best interests of IEA to settle the dispute, maintain an important customer relationship, avoid ongoing legal costs, and secure the award of an additional wind energy project which will be constructed primarily in 2018. A higher level of unabsorbed equipment costs relative to the first quarter of 2017 as a result of the establishment of IEA’s capital leasing program in late-2017. Although this program is expected to produce significant cost savings for IEA over the full year when compared to its prior practice of leasing equipment on a project-by-project basis, IEA expects to experience a negative cost absorption during the first quarter of each year (when equipment utilization is relatively low).\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.9 million to $17.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily driven by merger expenses of $7.6 million related to the transaction with M III Acquisition Corp. and an increase of $3.0 million related to incremental personnel and other costs to support revenue opportunities that are expected during the remainder of 2018 and thereafter.\nTaken together, IEA reported a net loss of $0.81 per share for the first quarter, versus a gain of $0.06 per share for the same period in the prior year. These results were generally consistent with management’s expectation that full year revenue will be $775 million to $835 million for 2018 and full year Adjusted EBITDA will be $75 million to $85 million for 2018.\nMr. Roehm stated, \"Our first quarter revenue was essentially in-line with our expectations headed into the period, given our typical seasonality, coupled with the timing headwinds created by the new Federal tax bill in late 2017 and solar tariff legislation that was enacted in early 2018 which delayed the start of previously awarded projects and the competitive bid process of certain other projects. The second and third quarters typically are considerably stronger periods for IEA and we expect to more than make up for the first quarter project commencement delays during the remainder of 2018. Our backlog stands at a record $1.1 billion and we have an active pipeline that we foresee contributing to future sustained success.\"\nBacklog & New Award Highlights\nAs of March 31, 2018, IEA had a record backlog of $1.1 billion (defined as contracted projects, awarded projects in the process of being documented, and anticipated change orders), which has remained relatively steady despite the slowdown of new contract awards during the first quarter as a result of uncertainty created by tax reform and solar tariffs at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018. With more than $670 million of this backlog relating to projects scheduled for 2018, this constitutes approximately 80-85% of IEA’s projected revenue for the year and is the largest percentage of annual revenue that IEA has ever held in backlog at this point in the year.\nFinancial Position at March 31, 2018\nCash and cash equivalents was $19.6 million. Net working capital, excluding cash, was $(38.4) million. Total debt was $60.2 million, excluding capital leases. Total remaining capacity on the Company’s credit facilities was $34.1 million (excluding the $25.0 million accordion feature of the credit facilities).\nConference Call\nIEA will hold a conference call to discuss these results and recent corporate developments on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. ET/10:00 a.m. CT. Interested parties may participate in the call by dialing (201) 493-6739 ten minutes before the conference call is scheduled to begin and asking for the IEA call.\nTo listen to a simultaneous webcast of the call, please go to the Company's website at www.iea.net at least 15 minutes early to download and install any necessary audio software. If you are unable to listen live, the conference call webcast will be archived on the Company's website for 30 days.\nCorporate Information\nIEA is a leading U.S. provider of infrastructure solutions for the renewable energy, traditional power and civil infrastructure industries.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, restructuring expenses, acquisition or disposition related expenses, non-cash stock compensation expense, and certain other non-cash charges, unusual, non-operating or non-recurring items and other items that we believe are not representative of our core business or future operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure and, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain drivers of the business, such as revenue growth and operating costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be useful in providing an understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. While Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under GAAP, management uses this financial measure to evaluate and forecast business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table outlines the reconciliation from net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(in thousands) 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (17,392 ) $ 1,390 Interest expense, net 851 362 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (3,515 ) 757 Depreciation and amortization 1,972 957 EBITDA (18,084 ) 3,466 Transaction costs (1) 7,620 — Diversification SG&A (2) 1,187 179 Credit support fees (3) 231 425 Consulting fees & expenses (4) 159 — Non-cash stock compensation expense (5) — 14 Adjusted EBITDA $ (8,887 ) $ 4,084 (1) Transaction costs—include legal, consulting, filing and other costs associated with the acquisition of IEA Energy Services by MIII Acquisition Corporation and the subsequent public listing of IEA securities on the NASDAQ stock exchange. (2) Diversification selling, general and administrative—reflects the costs, including recruiting, compensation and benefits for additional personnel, associated with IEA beginning to expand into electrical transmission work and corresponding services, which were historically subcontracted to third parties, U.S. utility scale solar, and heavy civil infrastructure.
