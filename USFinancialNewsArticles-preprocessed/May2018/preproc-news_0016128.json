    "text": "NORTHLAKE, Texas, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farmer Bros. Co. (NASDAQ:FARM) (the \"Company\") today reported financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights:\nVolume of green coffee processed and sold increased by 3.3 million pounds, reaching 27.7 million pounds, a 13.7% increase over the prior year period; Gross profit increased $5.0 million to $58.8 million and gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 37.2% over the prior year period; Net loss was $(3.9) million compared to net income of $1.6 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA was $10.5 million compared to $12.2 million in the prior year period.* SQF certification of new Northlake, Texas facility was completed during the quarter, with annual run-rate production levels of six million pounds expected by end of the fiscal year; Continued executing integration plan related to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Boyd Coffee Company (\"Boyd\"); and Completed deployment of Smart Touch selling platform to all of our DSD routes in April 2018.\n(*Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is reconciled to its corresponding GAAP measure at the end of this press release.)\n“We continue to make meaningful progress in executing our strategy and working to leverage our solid platform for growth,” said Mike Keown, President and CEO. “While we did not achieve year-to-date results at the level we had initially projected to reach our Adjusted EBITDA objective for the fiscal year, we expect that our recently achieved SQF certification and the continued ramp-up of our state of the art Northlake, Texas facility will position us well to secure more national accounts. Further, we are pleased with the continued integration of the Boyd’s business, which remains on-track. Looking ahead, we continue to be focused on leveraging the investments we have made in our roasting facilities, expanding our distribution network, adding new customers, and increasing business with existing customers. Our pipeline remains robust and we believe that Farmer Brothers has the right foundation and strategy in place for long-term growth.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results:\nSelected Financial Data\nThe selected financial data presented below under the captions “Income statement data,” “Operating data” and “Balance sheet and other data” summarizes certain performance measures for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (unaudited).\nThree Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In data) Income statement data: Net sales $ 157,927 $ 138,187 $ 457,006 $ 407,700 Gross margin 37.2 % 38.9 % 37.9 % 39.3 % (Loss) income from operations $ (2,864 ) $ 2,058 $ (1,680 ) $ 40,473 Net (loss) income $ (3,908 ) $ 1,594 $ (23,655 ) $ 23,288 Net (loss) income per common share available to common stockholders-diluted $ (0.24 ) $ 0.10 $ (1.43 ) $ 1.39 Operating data: Coffee pounds 27,732 24,393 80,031 72,211 Non-GAAP net (loss) income $ (3,362 ) $ 3,049 $ (21,035 ) $ 8,447 Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share $ (0.20 ) $ 0.17 $ (1.26 ) $ 0.50 EBITDA $ 4,688 $ 10,049 $ 21,855 $ 57,241 EBITDA Margin 3.0 % 7.3 % 4.8 % 14.0 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,547 $ 12,180 $ 32,779 $ 34,345 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 6.7 % 8.8 % 7.2 % 8.4 % Balance sheet and other data: Capital expenditures related to maintenance $ 8,316 $ 6,421 $ 17,373 $ 19,780 Total capital expenditures $ 11,217 $ 13,503 $ 27,466 $ 62,150 Depreciation and amortization expense $ 7,397 $ 6,527 $ 22,727 $ 16,613 Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures; a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of this press release.\nVolume of green coffee processed and sold increased 13.7% for the quarter to 27.7 million pounds, with volume associated with the Boyd business acquired in October 2017 contributing approximately 15.4% of this total volume.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, green coffee pounds processed and sold through our DSD network were 9.6 million, or 34.8% of total green coffee pounds processed and sold, while Direct Ship customers represented 17.8 million, or 64.2%, of total green coffee pounds processed and sold. Distributor customers represented 0.3 million pounds, or 1.0%, of total green coffee pounds processed and sold.\nNet sales were $157.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 14.3%, or $19.7 million, over the prior year period. This increase compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by a $11.5 million increase in net sales of roast and ground coffee products, a $4.4 million increase in net sales of other beverages, a $3.0 million increase in net sales of culinary products, and a $0.4 million increase in net sales of frozen liquid coffee. The addition of the Boyd business contributed $22.8 million to net sales, offset by a $3.2 million decline in our base business primarily due to price decreases to our cost plus customers, a shortfall in sales from our DSD organization and softness in a few large direct ship accounts.\nGross profit in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $5.0 million, or 9.3%, to $58.8 million from $53.8 million, and gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 37.2% from 38.9% in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the addition of the Boyd business. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs associated with the production operations in the our new Northlake, Texas facility, the addition of the Boyd business which carries a lower gross margin rate compared to our base business and the absence of the beneficial effect of the liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the $0.8 million benefit recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nOperating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $9.9 million, or 19.1%, to $61.7 million, or 39.1% of net sales, from $51.8 million, or 37.5% of net sales, in the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses during the period was primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses, a $4.4 million increase in selling expenses and $3.8 million in impairment losses on intangible assets. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease in restructuring and other transition expenses associated with the corporate relocation plan and the DSD restructuring plan compared to the prior year period as well as an increase in net gains from sales of other assets of $0.5 million primarily from the sale of real estate. The increases in selling expenses and general and administrative expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were primarily driven by the addition of the Boyd business which added $6.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, to operating expenses exclusive of their related depreciation and amortization expense, acquisition and integration costs of $1.6 million, and an increase of $1.1 million in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $1.3 million reduction in payroll and benefits excluding the Boyd business and the absence of $0.2 million in non-recurring 2016 proxy contest expenses incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nDuring the quarter we completed our annual test of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and determined that the book value of certain intangible assets acquired in connection with the China Mist acquisition was higher than the estimated fair value resulting in an impairment charge of $3.8 million to earnings in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, loss from operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $(2.9) million, as compared to income from operations of $2.1 million in the prior year period.\nTotal other expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $(0.7) million, as compared to total other income of $0.9 million in the prior year period, an increase of $1.6 million, primarily due to the liquidation of substantially all of our preferred stock portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to fund expenditures associated with our new facility, higher mark-to-market losses on coffee-related derivative instruments and higher interest expense due to an increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by the change in estimated fair value of the China Mist contingent earnout consideration. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, net losses on coffee-related derivative instruments were $(0.4) million compared to net gains of $0.2 million in the prior year period.\nIncome tax expense was $0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to income tax expense of $1.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily a result of the change in net (loss) income.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net loss was $(3.9) million, or $(0.24) per common share available to common stockholders, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.10 per common share available to common stockholders-diluted, in the prior year period.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nNon-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures; a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of this press release.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the calculation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to exclude acquisition and integration costs. Acquisition and integration costs include legal expenses, consulting expenses and internal costs associated with acquisitions and integration of those acquisitions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 acquisition and integration costs were significant and, we believe, excluding them will help investors to better understand our operating results and more accurately compare them across periods. We have not adjusted the historical presentation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because acquisition and integration costs in prior periods were not material to the Company’s results of operations.\nNon-GAAP net loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $(3.4) million, as compared to Non-GAAP net income of $3.0 million in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP net loss per diluted common share was $(0.20) in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to Non-GAAP net income per diluted common share of $0.17 in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $10.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to $12.2 million in the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 6.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to 8.8% in the prior year period.\nAbout Farmer Bros.

net gains and losses from sales of assets; non-cash income tax expense (benefit), including the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; non-recurring 2016 proxy contest-related expenses; non-cash interest expense accrued on the Torrance facility sale-leaseback financing obligation; acquisition and integration costs;\nand including the impact of:\nincome taxes on non-GAAP adjustments.\n“Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share” is defined as Non-GAAP net (loss) income divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, inclusive of the dilutive effect of common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.\n“EBITDA” is defined as net (loss) income excluding the impact of:\nincome taxes; interest expense; and depreciation and amortization expense.\n“EBITDA Margin” is defined as EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales.\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net (loss) income excluding the impact of:\nincome taxes; interest expense; (loss) income from short-term investments; depreciation and amortization expense; ESOP and share-based compensation expense; non-cash impairment losses; non-cash pension withdrawal expense; other similar non-cash expenses; restructuring and other transition expenses; net gains and losses from sales of assets; non-recurring 2016 proxy contest-related expenses; and acquisition and integration costs.\n“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales.\nRestructuring and other transition expenses are expenses that are directly attributable to (i) the corporate relocation plan, consisting primarily of employee retention and separation benefits, facility-related costs and other related costs such as travel, legal, consulting and other professional services; and (ii) beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the DSD restructuring plan, consisting primarily of severance, prorated bonuses for bonus eligible employees, contractual termination payments and outplacement services, and other related costs, including legal, recruiting, consulting, other professional services, and travel.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the calculation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income and Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share (i) to exclude non-recurring expenses for legal and other professional services incurred in connection with the 2016 proxy contest that were in excess of the level of expenses normally incurred for an annual meeting of stockholders (\"2016 proxy contest-related expenses\") and non-cash interest expense accrued on the Torrance facility sale-leaseback financing obligation which has been included in the computation of the gain on sale upon conclusion of the leaseback arrangement, and (ii) to include income tax expense (benefit) on the non-GAAP adjustments based on the Company’s applicable marginal tax rate. We also modified Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to exclude 2016 proxy contest-related expenses. These modifications to our non-GAAP financial measures were made because such expenses are not reflective of our ongoing operating results and adjusting for them will help investors with comparability of our results.\nBeginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and for all periods presented, we include EBITDA in our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because (i) we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use these measures internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nBeginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to exclude (loss) income from our short-term investments because we believe excluding (loss) income generated from our investment portfolio is a measure more reflective of our operating results. The historical presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was recast to be comparable to the current period presentation.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the calculation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to exclude acquisition and integration costs. Acquisition and integration costs include legal expenses, consulting expenses and internal costs associated with acquisitions and integration of those acquisitions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 acquisition and integration costs were significant and, we believe, excluding them will help investors to better understand our operating results and more accurately compare them across periods. We have not adjusted the historical presentation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because acquisition and integration costs in prior periods were not material to the Company’s results of operations.\nBeginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we modified the calculation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income and Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share to begin with net (loss) income available to common stockholders to reflect undeclared and unpaid cumulative preferred dividends on the preferred stock issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in connection with the Boyd acquisition.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company's ongoing operating performance. Further, management utilizes these measures, in addition to GAAP measures, when evaluating and comparing the Company's operating performance against internal financial forecasts and budgets.\nNon-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We do not intend for non-GAAP financial measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of reported net (loss) income available to common stockholders to Non-GAAP net (loss) income and reported net (loss) income per common share available to common stockholders—diluted to Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, (in $ data) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net (loss) income available to common stockholders, as reported $ (4,036 ) $ 1,594 $ (23,912 ) $ 23,288 Restructuring and other transition expenses 52 2,547 311 9,542 Net gain from sale of Torrance facility — — — (37,449 ) Net gains from sale of spice assets (110 ) (272 ) (655 ) (764 ) Net gains from sales of other assets (590 ) (86 ) (446 ) (1,525 ) Non-recurring 2016 proxy contest-related expenses — 196 — 5,186 Interest expense on sale-leaseback financing obligation — — — 681 Acquisition and integration costs 1,639 — 5,021 — Income tax (benefit) expense on non-GAAP adjustments (317 ) (930 ) (1,354 ) 9,488 Non-GAAP net (loss) income $ (3,362 ) $ 3,049 $ (21,035 ) $ 8,447 Net (loss) income per common share available to common stockholders—diluted, as reported $ (0.24 ) $ 0.10 $ (1.43 ) $ 1.39 Impact of restructuring and other transition expenses $ — $ 0.15 $ 0.02 $ 0.57 Impact of net gain from sale of Torrance facility $ — $ — $ — $ (2.24 ) Impact of net gains from sale of spice assets $ — $ (0.02 ) $ (0.04 ) $ (0.05 ) Impact of net gains from sales of other assets $ (0.04 ) $ (0.01 ) $ (0.03 ) $ (0.09 ) Impact of non-recurring 2016 proxy contest-related expenses $ — $ 0.01 $ — $ 0.31 Impact of interest expense on sale-leaseback financing obligation $ — $ — $ — $ 0.04 Impact of acquisition and integration costs $ 0.10 $ — $ 0.30 $ — Impact of income tax (benefit) expense on non-GAAP adjustments $ (0.02 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.08 ) $ 0.57 Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share $ (0.20 ) $ 0.17 $ (1.26 ) $ 0.50 Set forth below is a reconciliation of reported net (loss) income to EBITDA (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net (loss) income, as reported $ (3,908 ) $ 1,594 $ (23,655 ) $ 23,288 Income tax (benefit) expense 297 1,411 20,497 15,910 Interest expense 902 517 2,286 1,430 Depreciation and amortization expense 7,397 6,527 22,727 16,613 EBITDA $ 4,688 $ 10,049 $ 21,855 $ 57,241 EBITDA Margin 3.0 % 7.3 % 4.8 % 14.0 % Set forth below is a reconciliation of reported net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net (loss) income, as reported $ (3,908 ) $ 1,594 $ (23,655 ) $ 23,288 Income tax expense 297 1,411 20,497 15,910 Interest expense 902 517 2,286 1,430 Income from short-term investments — (1,156 ) (19 ) (882 ) Depreciation and amortization expense 7,397 6,527 22,727 16,613 ESOP and share-based compensation expense 1,048 902 2,892 2,996 Restructuring and other transition expenses 52 2,547 311 9,542 Net gain from sale of Torrance facility — — — (37,449 ) Net gains from sale of spice assets (110 ) (272 ) (655 ) (764 ) Net gains from sales of other assets (590 ) (86 ) (446 ) (1,525 ) Impairment losses on intangible assets 3,820 — 3,820 — Non-recurring 2016 proxy contest-related expenses — 196 — 5,186 Acquisition and integration costs 1,639 — 5,021 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,547 $ 12,180 $ 32,779 $ 34,345 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 6.7 % 8.8 % 7.2 % 8.4 % Contact:\nJoele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher\nLeigh Parrish / Amy Feng\n212-355-4449\nSource:Farmer Bros.
