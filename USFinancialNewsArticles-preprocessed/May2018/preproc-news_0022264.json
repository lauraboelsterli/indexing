    "text": "BETHESDA, Md., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nHIGHLIGHTS\nFirst quarter reported diluted EPS totaled $1.09, a 15 percent increase from prior year results. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS totaled $1.34, a 40 percent increase over first quarter 2017 adjusted results. Adjusted results exclude merger-related adjustments, cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses. Adjusted results for the first quarter of 2018 also exclude adjustments to the provision for income taxes and the Avendra gain; First quarter 2018 comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR rose 3.6 percent worldwide, 7.5 percent outside North America and 2.0 percent in North America; The company added nearly 15,000 rooms during the first quarter, including roughly 1,600 rooms converted from competitor brands and approximately 5,800 rooms in international markets; At quarter-end, Marriott's worldwide development pipeline increased to more than 2,700 hotels and nearly 465,000 rooms, including roughly 34,000 rooms approved, but not yet subject to signed contracts; First quarter reported net income totaled $398 million, a 7 percent increase from prior year results. First quarter adjusted net income totaled $487 million, a 30 percent increase over prior year adjusted results; Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) totaled $770 million in the quarter, an 8 percent increase over first quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA; Marriott repurchased 5.6 million shares of the company's common stock for $782 million during the first quarter. Year-to-date through May 8, the company has repurchased 7.9 million shares for $1.1 billion.\nMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) today reported first quarter 2018 results.\nArne M. Sorenson, president and chief executive officer of Marriott International, said, \"Worldwide constant dollar RevPAR increased 3.6 percent, exceeding the high end of our expectations for the first quarter and reflecting solid economic growth around the world. Given improving demand fundamentals, we have increased our expectations for full year 2018 worldwide constant dollar RevPAR growth to 3 to 4 percent, a 1.5 percentage point increase over the mid-point of our prior guidance.\n\"Our development pipeline reached a new record of nearly 465,000 rooms and we remain on track to achieve worldwide room additions of 5.5 to 6 percent, net of deletions, for full year 2018. In the first quarter, we signed contracts for nearly 20,000 rooms, with nearly half of those rooms in the luxury and upper upscale tiers. In fact, according to STR, the number of luxury and upper-upscale rooms in our pipeline at the end of the first quarter exceeded that of our next three global competitors combined.\n\"The integration of Starwood is going well. Last month, we announced that our loyalty programs will be unified in August 2018, with all of our properties appearing on both Marriott and Starwood websites and apps at that time. Our members are excited about the enhanced benefits that will be offered under the unified loyalty programs.\n\"We remain focused on delivering outstanding profit growth, while maximizing shareholder returns. Year-to-date through May 8, we have already returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and believe we could return at least $3.0 billion in 2018.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nIn the 2018 first quarter, the company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09. Please see the \"Accounting Standards Update\" section of this release for more information.\nMarriott reported net income totaled $398 million in the 2018 first quarter, a 7 percent increase from 2017 first quarter net income of $371 million. Reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.09 in the quarter, a 15 percent increase from diluted EPS of $0.95 in the year-ago quarter.\nFirst quarter 2018 adjusted net income totaled $487 million, a 30 percent increase over 2017 first quarter adjusted net income of $375 million. Adjusted net income excludes merger-related adjustments, cost reimbursement revenue, and reimbursed expenses. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 also excludes a net tax charge resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act), which the company first recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase to the gain on the sale of Avendra, which the company also recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS in the first quarter totaled $1.34, a 40 percent increase from adjusted diluted EPS of $0.96 in the year-ago quarter. See page A-2 for the calculation of adjusted results.\nBase management and franchise fees totaled $690 million in the 2018 first quarter, an 11 percent increase over base management and franchise fees of $619 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in these fees is primarily attributable to higher RevPAR, unit growth, and higher credit card branding fees.\nFirst quarter 2018 worldwide incentive management fees increased to $155 million, an 11 percent increase compared to incentive management fees of $140 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase was largely due to unit growth, higher net house profit at properties in the Asia Pacific region and favorable foreign exchange impact.\nContract investment amortization totaled $18 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $11 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase largely reflects contract write-offs related to two terminated contracts.\nOwned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, totaled $70 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $72 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease largely reflects the negative impact from hotels sold during or after the first quarter of 2017, including in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by higher termination fees.\nGeneral, administrative, and other expenses for the 2018 first quarter totaled $247 million, compared to $212 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year $35 million increase reflects the company's incremental retirement contribution of up to $1,000 for each eligible participating associate in the U.S.\nGains and other income, net, totaled $59 million in the 2018 first quarter, largely reflecting the $53 million gain associated with the sale of two hotels in Buenos Aires.\nInterest expense, net, totaled $70 million in the first quarter compared to $63 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was largely due to higher interest rates and debt balances, partially offset by the maturity of Series I Senior Notes.\nThe provision for income taxes totaled $104 million in the first quarter, a 20.7 percent effective tax rate, compared to $123 million in the year-ago quarter, a 24.9 percent effective tax rate.\nFor the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA totaled $770 million, an 8 percent increase over first quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $716 million. Compared to the prior year, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 reflects a $20 million negative impact from sold hotels. See page A-8 for the adjusted EBITDA calculations.\nSelected Performance Information\nThe company added 100 new properties (14,905 rooms) to its worldwide lodging portfolio during the 2018 first quarter, including the Marriott Hotel Mena House in Cairo, the Moxy Tbilisi, and the Renaissance Bali Uluwatu Resort & Spa. Twenty-nine properties (6,351 rooms) exited the system during the quarter. At quarter-end, Marriott's lodging system encompassed 6,591 properties and timeshare resorts with more than 1,266,000 rooms.\nAt quarter-end, the company's worldwide development pipeline totaled 2,722 properties with nearly 465,000 rooms, including 1,148 properties with approximately 209,000 rooms under construction and 174 properties with roughly 34,000 rooms approved for development, but not yet subject to signed contracts.\nIn the 2018 first quarter, worldwide comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR increased 3.6 percent (a 5.5 percent increase using actual dollars). North American comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR increased 2.0 percent (a 2.3 percent increase using actual dollars), and international comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR increased 7.5 percent (a 14.1 percent increase using actual dollars) for the same period.\nWorldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins increased 70 basis points in the first quarter, largely due to higher RevPAR, solid cost controls and synergies from the Starwood acquisition. House profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America rose 160 basis points, while North American comparable company-operated house profit margins declined 10 basis points in the first quarter.\nBalance Sheet\nAt quarter-end, Marriott's total debt was $8,846 million and cash balances totaled $701 million, compared to $8,238 million in debt and $383 million of cash at year-end 2017.\nIn April 2018, the company issued $450 million of Series X Senior Notes due in 2028 with a 4.0 percent interest rate coupon. The company expects to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nMarriott Common Stock\nWeighted average fully diluted shares outstanding used to calculate both reported and adjusted diluted EPS totaled 363.3 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to 390.0 million shares in the year-ago quarter.\nThe company repurchased 5.6 million shares of common stock in the 2018 first quarter for $782 million at an average price of $139.20 per share. Year-to-date through May 8, the company has repurchased 7.9 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average price of $137.95 per share.\nAccounting Standards Update\nIn the 2018 first quarter, the company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 (the new revenue standard), which changes the GAAP reporting for revenue and expense recognition for franchise application and relicensing fees, contract investment costs, the quarterly timing of incentive fee recognition, and centralized programs and services, among other items. While the new revenue standard results in changes to the reporting of certain revenue and expense items, Marriott's cash flow and business fundamentals will not be impacted. A discussion of revenue recognition changes can be found in the 2017 Form 10-K the company filed on February 15, 2018, which is available on Marriott's Investor Relations website at http://www.marriott.com/investor .\nThe company has elected to use the full retrospective method in the adoption of the new revenue standard. As such, the company's financial statements in SEC filings will show prior year quarterly and full year results as if the new revenue standard had been adopted on January 1, 2016. The company anticipates providing 2017 quarterly and full year retrospective consolidated statements of income on a Form 8-K, which the company expects to file with the SEC in the second quarter of 2018.\nOUTLOOK\nThe following outlook for second quarter and full year 2018 does not include cost reimbursement revenue, reimbursed expenses, or merger-related costs and charges, which the company cannot precisely forecast. Full year 2018 outlook excludes the net tax charge and the increase in the Avendra gain, which were reported in the 2018 first quarter.\nTo assist investors in evaluating the revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for second quarter and full year 2018 in this section, the following table shows estimates for the components of, and total, gross fee revenues and adjusted EBITDA for second quarter and full year 2017 recast to reflect the full retrospective application of the new revenue standard, as if adopted as of January 1, 2016.\nSecond Quarter 2017\nFull Year 2017\nBase management fees\n$285 million\n$1,102 million\nFranchise fees\n$408 million\n$1,586 million\nIncentive management fees\n$155 million\n$607 million\nGross Fee Revenues\n$848 million\n$3,295 million\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$820 million\n$3,131 million\nFor the 2018 second quarter, Marriott expects comparable systemwide RevPAR on a constant dollar basis in North America will increase 3 to 4 percent. The company's guidance for second quarter RevPAR growth in North America reflects the favorable shift of the Easter holiday. The company expects second quarter comparable systemwide RevPAR on a constant dollar basis will increase 5 to 6 percent outside North America and 3 to 4 percent worldwide.\nThe company assumes second quarter 2018 gross fee revenues will total $935 million to $945 million, a 10 to 11 percent increase over second quarter 2017 gross fee revenues of $848 million.\nMarriott expects second quarter 2018 owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, could total approximately $80 million. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this estimate reflects the $14 million negative impact from hotels sold during or after the first quarter of 2017, including in the first quarter of 2018, but does not reflect additional asset sales that may occur in the quarter.\nThe company assumes second quarter 2018 general, administrative, and other expenses could total approximately $250 million. This estimate assumes a $25 million expense for the company's incremental retirement contribution of up to $1,000 for each eligible participating associate in the U.S.\nMarriott expects second quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA could total $880 million to $890 million, a 7 to 9 percent increase over second quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $820 million. This estimate reflects the roughly $11 million negative impact of hotels sold in 2017 and to date in 2018, but does not reflect additional asset sales that may occur in the second quarter of 2018. See page A-9 for the adjusted EBITDA calculation.\nFor the full year 2018, Marriott expects comparable systemwide RevPAR on a constant dollar basis will increase 2 to 3 percent in North America, 5 to 6 percent outside North America, and 3 to 4 percent worldwide.\nMarriott anticipates room additions, net of deletions, of 5.5 to 6 percent for full year 2018.\nThe company assumes full year 2018 gross fee revenues will total $3,650 million to $3,690 million, an 11 to 12 percent increase over 2017 gross fee revenues of $3,295 million. Full year 2018 estimated gross fee revenues include $360 million to $380 million of credit card branding fees, compared to $242 million for full year 2017. Compared to the estimate the company provided on February 14, this estimate of gross fee revenues reflects stronger expected RevPAR growth, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, as well as additional favorable foreign exchange impact. The company anticipates full year 2018 incentive management fees will increase roughly 10 percent over 2017 full year incentive fees of $607 million.\nMarriott expects full year 2018 owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, could total approximately $300 million. Compared to 2017 results previously reported, this estimate reflects the $55 million negative impact from hotels sold in 2017 and to date in 2018, but does not reflect additional asset sales that may occur in 2018. Compared to the owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, estimate the company provided on February 14, this estimate reflects the higher than expected termination fees in the first quarter.\nThe company assumes full year 2018 general, administrative, and other expenses could total $940 million to $950 million. This estimate assumes a $70 million expense for the company's incremental retirement contribution of up to $1,000 for each eligible participating associate in the U.S. This expense will not recur in 2019. Compared to the estimate the company provided on February 14, this general, administrative, and other expenses estimate reflects additional unfavorable foreign exchange impact.\nMarriott expects full year 2018 gains and other income could total $65 million to $70 million. Compared to the estimate the company provided on February 14, this estimate largely reflects a higher than expected gain on the sale of the two hotels in Buenos Aires and a gain from the sale of an interest in a joint venture.\nMarriott expects full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA could total $3,445 million to $3,500 million, a 10 to 12 percent increase over 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $3,131 million. This estimate reflects the roughly $45 million negative impact of hotels sold in 2017 and to date in 2018, but does not reflect additional asset sales that may occur in 2018. See page A-10 for the adjusted EBITDA calculation.\nSecond Quarter 2018 1\nFull Year 2018 1\nGross fee revenues\n$935 million to $945 million\n$3,650 million to $3,690 million\nContract investment amortization\nApprox. $15 million\nApprox. $60 million\nOwned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses\nApprox. $80 million\nApprox. $300 million\nDepreciation, amortization, and other expenses\nApprox. $55 million\nApprox. $225 million\nGeneral, administrative, and other expenses\nApprox. $250 million\n$940 million to $950 million\nOperating income\n$695 million to $705 million\n$2,715 million to $2,765 million\nGains and other income\nApprox. $10 million\n$65 million to $70 million\nNet interest expense\nApprox. $80 million\nApprox. $305 million\nEquity in earnings (losses)\nApprox. $10 million\nApprox. $40 million\nEarnings per share 2\n$1.34 to $1.36\n$5.43 to $5.55\nTax rate 2\n23 percent\n1 The outlook provided in this table does not include merger-related costs and charges, cost reimbursement revenue or reimbursed expenses. Full year 2018 outlook excludes the net tax charge resulting from the Tax Act and the increase in the Avendra gain, which were reported in the 2018 first quarter.\n2 Guidance for Full Year 2018 reflects the impact of employee stock-based compensation excess tax benefits. 2018 estimated EPS assumes a $0.12 favorable impact and the company's tax rate assumes a $41 million favorable impact from these benefits.\nThe company expects investment spending in 2018 will total approximately $600 million to $700 million, including approximately $225 million for maintenance capital. Investment spending also includes other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions), new mezzanine financing and mortgage notes, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments. Assuming this level of investment spending and no additional asset sales, at least $3.0 billion could be returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2018.\nMarriott International, Inc.

We discuss management's reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below, and the press release schedules reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we refer to. Although management evaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable operating measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, we may calculate and/or present these non-GAAP financial measures differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others.\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Margin. Adjusted operating income reflects revenues, excluding cost reimbursement revenue, and operating expenses, excluding reimbursed expenses and merger-related costs, charges, and other merger-related adjustments due to purchase accounting. Adjusted operating income margin reflects adjusted operating income divided by adjusted total revenues. We believe that these are meaningful metrics because they allow for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations before these items and for the reasons further described below.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS. Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted EPS reflect our net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of cost reimbursement revenue, reimbursed expenses, merger-related costs, charges, and other merger-related adjustments due to purchase accounting, the gain on the sale of our ownership interest in Avendra, and the income tax effect of these adjustments, as well as a state tax expense relating to our plan to remit a portion of the accumulated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future and an adjustment to our provisional estimated federal and state Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We calculate the income tax effect of the adjustments using an estimated tax rate applicable to each adjustment. We believe that these measures are meaningful indicators of our performance because they allow for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations before these items and for the reasons further described below.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"). Adjusted EBITDA reflects net income excluding the impact of the following items: cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses, interest expense, depreciation (including depreciation classified in \"Reimbursed expenses,\" as discussed below), amortization, and provision for income taxes, pre-tax transaction and transition costs associated with the Starwood merger, gains and losses on asset dispositions, and share-based compensation expense for all periods presented.\nIn our presentations of Adjusted operating income and operating income margin, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted EPS, we exclude transaction and transition costs associated with the Starwood merger, which we record in the \"Merger-related costs and charges\" caption of our Income Statements, and other merger-related adjustments due to purchase accounting, to allow for period-over period comparisons of our ongoing operations before the impact of these items. We exclude cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses, which relate to property-level and centralized programs and services that we operate for the benefit of our hotel owners. We do not operate these programs and services to generate a profit over the contract term, and accordingly, when we recover the costs that we incur for these programs and services from our hotel owners, we do not seek a mark-up. For property-level services, our owners typically reimburse us at the same time that we incur expenses. However, for centralized programs and services, our owners may reimburse us before or after we incur expenses, causing temporary timing differences between the costs we incur and the related reimbursement from hotel owners in our operating and net income. Over the long term, these programs and services are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively. Because we do not retain any such profits or losses over time, we exclude the net impact when evaluating period-over-period changes in our operating results.\nA-11\nMARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nEXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations before these items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provisions for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. Our Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense which we report under \"Depreciation, amortization, and other\" as well as depreciation classified in \"Reimbursed expenses\" and \"Contract investment amortization\" in our Consolidated Statements of Income (our \"Income Statements\"), because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Depreciation classified in \"Reimbursed expenses\" reflects depreciation of Marriott-owned assets, for which we receive cash from owners to reimburse the company for its investments made for the benefit of the system. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. We exclude share-based compensation expense in all periods presented to address the considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use share-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted.\nRevPAR. In addition to the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures, we present Revenue per Available Room (\"RevPAR\") as a performance measure. We believe RevPAR is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales (recorded in local currency) for comparable properties by room nights available for the period. We present growth in comparative pro forma combined company RevPAR on a constant dollar basis, which we calculate by applying exchange rates for the current period to each period presented. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our properties' performance as it removes currency fluctuations from the presentation of such results.\nA-12\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/marriott-international-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300644802.html\nSOURCE Marriott International, Inc.",
