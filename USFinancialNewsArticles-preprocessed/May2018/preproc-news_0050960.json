S&P 500 e-minis were down 16.25 points, or 0.6 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 65.75 points, or 0.95 percent.\nU.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to eight-day lows as investors shunned risk. Of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components trading premarket, 29 were in the red.\nA majority of the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 100 stocks trading premarket were also lower.\nTarget sank 4.5 percent after the retailer’s quarterly profit rose less than expected as increasing investments dented margins.\nTiffany jumped 14.7 percent after the jeweler’s quarterly results blew past estimates and the company also raised its full-year profit forecast and announced a $1 billion share buyback program.\nLowe’s gained 4.4 percent after the home improvement retailer maintained its annual financial targets on expectations that demand will recover after a disappointing first quarter.\nComcast fell 2.0 percent after the company said it was preparing to top Disney’s offer for certain Twenty-First Century Fox assets.\nDisney dropped 0.8 percent, while Fox gained 1.4 percent.
