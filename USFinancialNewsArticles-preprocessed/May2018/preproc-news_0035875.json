    "text": "Modest Revenue Growth Over 4 th Quarter\nConsistent Software as a Service Growth\nCOLUMBUS, OH, Intellinetics, Inc. (OTCQB: INLX), a cloud-based document solutions provider, announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\n● Total Revenue increased 5% from Q4 2017 ● Total Revenue decreased 26% from Q1 2017. ● Software as a Service Revenue increased 36% from Q1 2017. ● Net Loss increase of $188,316 from Q1 2017. ● Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $307,744. Summary – First Quarter Results\nRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $525,374 as compared with $707,617 for the same period in 2017. Intellinetics reported a net loss of $(638,510) and $(450,194) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase in net loss of $188,316. The increased net loss was a result of lower revenue, driven by lower one-time software and professional services sales compared to 2017. Net loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was ($0.04) and ($0.03), respectively.\nJames F.

This includes our new content, case studies, fact sheet, web site update, and other essential elements that provide the infrastructure for us to successfully grow our sales via campaigns targeted at our strategic markets. These markets include Human Service Providers, as well as state and local government and local education.”\nDeSocio continued, “Our strategy is to accelerate our sales through strategic solutions partners, and continue to grow our subscription sales so that we are less reliant on one-time sales. This strategy will enable us to scale, provide greater revenue consistency and higher growth. I am bullish on our target market opportunities.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n● Strengthened support of existing partner channel with new messaging. ● Identified key strategic solutions partners who support our strategic vision. ● Implemented customer relationship management and lead management tools. ● Prepared and piloted a series of email campaigns for each target market which will launch in Q2 and continue on an ongoing basis.

The forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the effect of changing economic conditions, trends in the products markets, variations in Intellinetics’ cash flow or adequacy of capital resources, market acceptance risks, the success of Intellinetics’ channel partners and distribution partners, technical development risks, and other risks and uncertainties discussed in Intellinetics’ most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and Form 8-Ks. Intellinetics cautions investors not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Intellinetics disclaims any obligation and does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements in this press release. Expanded and historical information is made available to the public by Intellinetics on its website at www.intellinetics.com or at www.sec.gov .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIntellinetics uses non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).\nA non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity. Intellinetics urges investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP Net Loss, which is included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Intellinetics’ financial performance.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure and is used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest expense, any income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and other non-cash expenses such as share-based compensation, note conversion warrant expense and other financing related transaction costs.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net loss - GAAP $ (638,510 ) $ (450,194 ) Interest expense, net 208,984 132,095 Depreciation and amortization 2,194 3,006 Share-based compensation 119,588 86,383 Note issue warrant expense - 52,951 Adjusted EBITDA $ (307,774 ) $ (175,759 )\nINTELLINETICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARY\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Revenues: Sale of software $ 40,994 $ 162,984 Software as a service 176,600 129,531 Software maintenance services 243,568 249,922 Professional services 58,951 107,604 Third Party services 5,261 57,576 Total revenues 525,374 707,617 Cost of revenues: Sale of software 17,861 23,704 Software as a service 77,093 94,357 Software maintenance services 25,536 26,078 Professional services 16,825 49,653 Third Party services 10,245 13,088 Total cost of revenues 147,560 206,880 Gross profit 377,814 500,737 Operating expenses: General and administrative 543,437 580,544 Sales and marketing 261,709 235,286 Depreciation 2,194 3,006 Total operating expenses 807,340 818,836 Loss from operations (429,526 ) (318,099 ) Other income (expense) Interest expense, net (208,984 ) (132,095 ) Total other income (expense) (208,984 ) (132,095 ) Net loss $ (638,510 ) $ (450,194 ) Basic and diluted net loss per share: $ (0.04 ) $ (0.03 ) Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic and diluted 17,719,220 17,354,619\nINTELLINETICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARY\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash $ 710,088 $ 1,125,921 Accounts receivable, net 211,131 295,815 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 181,752 162,450 Total current assets 1,102,971 1,584,186 Property and equipment, net 12,566 14,760 Other assets 10,284 10,284 Total assets $ 1,125,821 $ 1,609,230 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 496,738 $ 475,459 Deferred revenues 604,753 708,130 Deferred compensation 202,089 213,166 Notes payable - current 875,000 875,000 Notes payable - related party - current 418,024 416,969 Total current liabilities 2,596,604 2,688,724 Long-term liabilities: Notes payable - net of current portion 1,321,326 1,221,384 Notes payable - related party - net of current portion 328,060 312,680 Other long-term liabilities - related parties 42,308 29,997 Total long-term liabilities 1,691,694 1,564,061 Total liabilities 4,288,298 4,252,785 Stockholders’ deficit: Common stock, $0.001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized;
