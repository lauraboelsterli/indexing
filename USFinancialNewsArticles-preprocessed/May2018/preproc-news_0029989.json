These are exciting technologies that increase the value Altair can deliver for customers and exemplify our expanding number of opportunities for future growth.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nSoftware product revenue was $68.1 million, an increase of 26% from $54.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Total revenue was $91.7 million, an increase of 19% compared to $76.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income was $3.9 million, compared to net loss of $(2.2) million for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted net income per share was $0.05, based on 72.4 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, compared to diluted net loss per share of $(0.04) for the first quarter of 2017, based on 50.1 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.7 million, compared to $2.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) adjusted for income tax expense, interest expense, interest income and other, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management.

Cash flow from operations was $26.7 million, compared to $19.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow, which consists of cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was $25.0 million compared to $18.2 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on information available as of today, Altair is issuing forward-looking statements on guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018 as indicated below.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Full Year 2018 Software Product Revenue $69.0 to $70.0 $276.0 to $280.0 Total Revenue $91.0 $92.0 $369.0 $373.0 GAAP Net Income $0.5 $1.0 $11.0 $13.0 Adjusted EBITDA $5.0 $5.5 $33.0 $35.0 Non-GAAP Net Income $2.5 $3.0 $19.0 $21.0 (All figures in millions)\nConference Call Information\nWhat: Altair First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call When: Monday, May 14, 2018 Time: 4:30 p.m. EDT Live Call: (866) 754-5204, domestic (636) 812-6621, international Replay: (855) 859-2056, passcode 2474564, domestic (404) 537-3406, passcode 2474564, international Webcast: http://investor.altair.com (live & replay) Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share and Free Cash Flow.\nAltair believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. The Company also believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nCompany management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Altair urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\nReconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release.\nAbout Altair\nAltair transforms design and decision making by applying simulation, machine learning and optimization throughout product lifecycles.
