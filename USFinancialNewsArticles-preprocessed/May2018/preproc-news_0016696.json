Soccer Football - Premier League - AFC Bournemouth vs Swansea City - Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth, Britain - May 5, 2018 Swansea City manager Carlos Carvalhal looks dejected after the match Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs\nSwansea were dealt a potentially fatal blow in their battle to avoid the drop as winger Ryan Fraser’s deflected shot earned Bournemouth a 1-0 win at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday.\nDefeat left Carvalhal’s side 18th in the standings on 33 points from 36 games. Southampton are level on points with the Welsh side but are one place above them due to a superior goal difference.\n\"After losing a game like we did at Bournemouth, everyone is sad, of course. But tomorrow is another day and we will react,\" Carvalhal told Swansea's website here\nSwansea host already relegated Stoke City in their final game while Southampton have a potentially tough match against champions Manchester City at St Mary’s Stadium.\nCarvalhal is well aware of the importance of three points against Southampton.\n“On Tuesday, we must be at the top of our game. This is the main point and the players know about that. They know they must react very fast,” the manager added.\n“My players will give the maximum and the fans will give the maximum, and when we play in Liberty, usually we are a strong team. It is our plan to be a strong team on Tuesday.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru",
