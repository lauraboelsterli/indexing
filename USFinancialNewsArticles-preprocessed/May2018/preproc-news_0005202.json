The index lost 0.15 percent last week.\nTeejay closed down 6.3 percent.\n“Teejay shares were hit by both rupee depreciation and higher cotton prices in the world market,” said Atchuthan Srirangan, assistant manager-research at First Capital Holdings PLC.\nDistilleries Company of Sri Lanka fell 0.9 percent.\nThe Sri Lankan rupee hit a fresh low on Wednesday on importer demand for the U.S. currency, dealers said, but recovered after the central bank intervened in the market.\nFitch Ratings said on Thursday that recent political developments in Sri Lanka have created some uncertainty over reform momentum and fiscal consolidation, and prolonged upheaval could undermine investor confidence ahead of large external debt maturities in 2019-22.\nTurnover stood at 612.8 million rupees ($3.89 million), less than this year’s daily average of around 1.1 billion rupees.\nForeign investors sold a net 18.3 million rupees worth of equities on Wednesday, extending the net foreign outflow to 669.1 million rupees worth of equities so far this year. $1 = 157.4500 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Sunil Nair",
