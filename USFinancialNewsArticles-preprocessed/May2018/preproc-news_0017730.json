    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:ESIO), an innovator of laser-based manufacturing solutions for the microtechnology industry, today announced results for its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2018. Financial measures are provided on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of purchase accounting, equity compensation, restructuring, and other items shown in the non-GAAP reconciliation table.\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights\nFourth quarter orders of $111.8 million, reflecting 36% year over year growth. Fiscal 2018 orders of $451.4 million, up 144% from fiscal 2017.\nFourth quarter and fiscal 2018 revenue of $113.4 million and $367.9 million, respectively; each more than doubled the revenue in fiscal 2017\nBacklog of $148.4 million, primarily expected to ship in the first half of fiscal 2019\nFiscal 2018 GAAP operating margin of 20.6%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.4%.\nFiscal 2018 GAAP EPS of $3.27 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.78. For the fourth quarter GAAP EPS was $2.10 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.02, exceeding one dollar for the first time in recent history.\nFiscal 2018 operating cash flow of $67.4 million, leading to total cash and investments balance of $125.0 million\nFourth Quarter Results\nFourth quarter revenue was $113.4 million, compared to $49.9 million in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year and $110.8 million last quarter. GAAP net income was $75.1 million or $2.10 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $17.9 million or $0.54 per share last year, as the Company’s strong financial performance over the last twelve months triggered the reversal of our tax valuation allowance, resulting in a fourth quarter tax credit of approximately $41 million. On a non-GAAP basis net income was $36.5 million or $1.02 per diluted share, compared to $2.9 million or $0.09 per diluted share last year and net income of $35.6 million or $0.99 per diluted share last quarter.\nMichael Burger, ESI's president and CEO, stated, “We delivered another quarter of exceptional financial results, which closed out a defining and transformative year for ESI. Our team executed well and capitalized on strong market conditions, positioning us for future success.\"\nOrders in the fourth quarter were $111.8 million, compared to $82.3 million one year ago. Burger continued, “Overall, our markets enabled strong bookings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of demand for flex circuit drilling. Demand for our semiconductor and component test products remained strong and total book to bill was 0.99, even as we delivered our highest quarterly revenues in recent history.\"\nGAAP gross margin was 48.3%, compared to 36.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. Operating expense was $20.0 million, down from $36.3 million last year. Operating income was $34.7 million, or 30.6% of sales, compared to a loss of $18.1 million in the year-ago quarter.\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 49.2%, up from 45.7% one year ago, on significantly higher revenues. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased year over year from $20.1 million to $18.8 million as a result of the completion of our restructuring activities, and non-GAAP operating income was $37.0 million, or 32.6% of sales, up from $2.7 million, or 5.4% of sales, in last year's fourth quarter.\nFirst Quarter 2019 Outlook\nBased on current market and backlog conditions, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 are expected to be between $97 and $111 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $0.75 to $0.95.\nBurger concluded, \"We enter our fiscal 2019 with a product portfolio that is retaining or growing market share. In this coming fiscal year we expect to introduce significant new products that will expand our addressable market, extend our competitive advantage, generate incremental revenue, and increase our exposure to secular growth drivers. Our markets will naturally cycle, and our visibility into the timing of those cycles remains limited. That said, the long-term technology trends and drivers indicate solid growth across our markets, and our new products should enable us to retain or grow share. Through the cycles our technology advantages and lower fixed cost base should allow us to generate solid earnings in all market conditions.\"\nThe company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET. The session will include a review of the financial results, operational performance and business outlook, and also a question and answer period.\nThe conference call can be accessed by calling 888-419-5570 (domestic participants) or 617-896-9871 (international participants). The conference ID number is 48069661. A live audio webcast can be accessed at www.esi.com . The webcast will be available on ESI’s website for one year.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this press release, we have presented financial measures which have not been determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are therefore non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP, or adjusted, financial measures exclude the impact of purchase accounting, equity compensation, restructuring, reversal of tax valuation allowance, inventory and goodwill write-downs, and other items. We believe that this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to assess the company’s operating performance by comparing it to prior periods on a more consistent basis. We have included a reconciliation of various non-GAAP financial measures to those measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Because our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing our non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.\nAbout ESI\nESI’s integrated solutions allow industrial designers and process engineers to control the power of laser light to transform materials in ways that differentiate their consumer electronics, wearable devices, semiconductor circuits and high-precision components for market advantage.
