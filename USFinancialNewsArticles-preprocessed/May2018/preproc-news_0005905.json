    "text": "HOUSTON, May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today reported net income of $165 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for , compared with $192 million, or $0.44 per diluted share for the same period of the prior year. On a guidance basis, first quarter 2018 earnings were $0.55 per diluted share, consisting of $0.43 from utility operations and $0.12 from midstream investments. First quarter 2017 earnings on a guidance basis were $0.37 per diluted share, consisting of $0.27 from utility operations and $0.10 from midstream investments.\nOperating income for was $251 million, compared with $291 of the prior year. The retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for compensation-retirement benefits (ASU 2017-07) resulted in an increase to operating income and a corresponding decrease to other income of $17 million for the first quarter of 2017. Equity income from midstream investments was $69 million for , compared with $72 million for the first quarter of the prior year.\n\"We are off to a strong start this year,\" said Scott M. Prochazka, president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. \"Continued growth across our service territories, rate recovery and Energy Services' performance all position us to be at the high end of our 2018 EPS guidance. Beyond 2018 we are looking forward to closing the recently announced merger agreement with Vectren in the first quarter of 2019.\"\nBusiness Segments\nElectric Transmission & Distribution\nThe electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $115 million for , consisting of $99 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $16 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $86 million, consisting of $66 million from the TDU and $20 million related to securitization bonds.\nOperating income for the TDU benefited primarily from higher equity return related to the annual true-up of transition charges, rate relief and increased usage resulting from favorable weather and customer growth. These benefits were partially offset by lower revenues reflecting the lower federal tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and higher operation and maintenance expenses.\nThe retrospective adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in an increase to electric transmission and distribution operating income and a corresponding decrease to other income of $8 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNatural Gas Distribution\nThe natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $156 million for , compared with $168 million for the same period of 2017. Operating income benefited from rate relief, increased usage due to favorable weather and customer growth. These increases were more than offset by lower revenues reflecting the lower federal tax rate due to the TCJA, higher operation and maintenance expenses, higher taxes due primarily to the Minnesota property tax refund of $9 million in 2017, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses.\nThe retrospective adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in an increase to natural gas distribution operating income and a corresponding decrease to other income of $4 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nEnergy Services\nThe energy services segment reported an operating loss of $26 million for , which included a mark-to-market loss of $80 million, compared with operating income of $35 million for the same period in 2017, which included a mark-to-market gain of $15 million. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments, operating income was $54 million for compared with $20 million for the same period of 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to incremental volumes from customers and improved margin rates, resulting from commercial opportunities attributable to recent acquisitions and from colder than normal weather in several U.S. regions.\nMidstream Investments\nThe midstream investments segment reported $69 million of equity income for , compared with $72 of the prior year.\nEarnings Outlook\nCenterPoint Energy anticipates achieving the high end of the $1.50 - $1.60 guidance range for 2018, excluding one-time costs associated with the proposed Vectren merger. This guidance is inclusive of Enable's net income guidance of $375 million - $445 million announced on Enable Midstream's first quarter earnings call on May 2, 2018. The guidance range assumes ownership of 54.0 percent of the common units representing limited partner interests in Enable Midstream and includes the amortization of CenterPoint Energy's basis differential in Enable Midstream and effective tax rates. CenterPoint Energy does not include other potential Enable Midstream impacts on guidance, such as any changes in accounting standards or unusual items.\nThe guidance range considers utility operations performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates, financing activities, and regulatory and judicial proceedings to include regulatory action as a result of recent tax reform legislation.\nIn providing this guidance, CenterPoint Energy uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not consider other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and the related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business.\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet Income\n(in millions)\nDiluted EPS\nNet Income\n(in millions)\nDiluted EPS\nConsolidated net income and diluted EPS as reported\n$ 165\n$ 0.38\n$ 192\n$ 0.44\nMidstream Investments\n(52)\n(0.12)\n(45)\n(0.10)\nUtility Operations (1)\n113\n0.26\n147\n0.34\nTiming effects impacting CES (2) :\nMark-to-market (gains) losses (net of taxes of $19 and $5) (3)\n61\n0.14\n(10)\n(0.02)\nZENS-related mark-to-market (gains) losses:\nMarketable securities (net of taxes of $1 and $16) (3)(4)\n-\n-\n(28)\n(0.06)\nIndexed debt securities (net of taxes of $3 and $4) (3)(5)\n15\n0.03\n6\n0.01\nUtility operations earnings on an adjusted guidance basis\n$ 189\n$ 0.43\n$ 115\n$ 0.27\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS used in providing earnings guidance:\nUtility Operations on a guidance basis\n$ 189\n$ 0.43\n$ 115\n$ 0.27\nMidstream Investments\n52\n0.12\n45\n0.10\nConsolidated on a guidance basis\n$ 241\n$ 0.55\n$ 160\n$ 0.37\n(1) CenterPoint earnings excluding Midstream Investments\n(2) Energy Services segment\n(3) Taxes are computed based on the impact removing such item would have on tax expense\n(4) As of January 31, 2018, comprised of Time Warner Inc. and Charter Communications, Inc.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. CenterPoint Energy's adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation excludes from net income and diluted earnings per share, respectively, the impact of ZENS and related securities and mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company's Energy Services business. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities and mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company's Energy Services business are not estimable.\nManagement evaluates the company's financial performance in part based on adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of CenterPoint Energy's overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods. The adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that Management believes does not most accurately reflect the company's fundamental business performance. These excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release, where applicable. CenterPoint Energy's adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income and diluted earnings per share, which respectively are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures also may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAdditional Information and Where to Find It\nIn connection with the proposed transactions, Vectren expects to file a proxy statement, as well as other materials, with the SEC.
