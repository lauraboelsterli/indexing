    "text": "Revenue of $68.6 million for the quarter High Speed Products increased to 86% of total revenue for the quarter\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NeoPhotonics Corporation (NYSE: NPTN), a leading designer and manufacturer of optoelectronic solutions for the highest speed communications networks in telecom and data center applications, today announced financial results for its first quarter year ended March 31, 2018.\n“Continuing our focus on 100G and above High Speed Products, which reached the highest proportion of revenue in our history at 86% in the quarter, we introduced and demonstrated new products for 400G and 600G coherent and datacenter applications. During the quarter we saw strength in metro and DCI deployments, driven by North America, and we have accelerating demand for these segments going into the remainder of the year,” said Tim Jenks, NeoPhotonics Chairman and CEO. “At the same time, while demand in China had stabilized, the recent regulatory and trade actions have introduced new uncertainty in that region, we continue to monitor and adjust plans accordingly.”\nFirst Quarter Summary\nRevenue was $68.6 million, down 4% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter Gross margin was 13.4%, compared to 20.4% in the prior quarter Non-GAAP Gross margin was 14.7%, compared to 21.3% in the prior quarter Net loss was $18.2 million, compared to a net loss of $14.3 million in the prior quarter Non-GAAP net loss was $14.6 million, compared to a net loss of $11.7 million in the prior quarter Diluted net loss per share was $0.41, in comparison to a net loss of $0.32 per share in the prior quarter Non-GAAP diluted net loss per share was $0.33, compared to a net loss of $0.27 in the prior quarter Adjusted EBITDA was negative $5.5 million, compared to negative $0.4 million in the prior quarter\nNon-GAAP results in the first quarter of 2018 excludes $3.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.3 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and $0.1 million of restructuring charges. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the financial schedules portion at the end of this press release.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, together totaled $86.9 million, compared to $93.9 million at December 31, 2017. Restricted cash as of March 31, 2018 was $2.7 million, flat compared to December 31, 2017.\nOutlook for the Quarter Ending June 30, 2018\nGAAP Non-GAAP Revenue $70 to $76 million Gross Margin 17% to 21% 18% to 22% Operating Expenses $25 to $26 million $22 to $23 million Earnings per share $0.34 to $0.24 net loss $0.26 to $0.16 net loss The Non-GAAP outlook for the second quarter of 2018 excludes the expected impact of stock-based compensation expense of approximately $3.4 million, of which $0.5 million is estimated for cost of goods sold, and the impact of expected amortization of intangibles of approximately $0.3 million.\nNon-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA Measures vs. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company’s non-GAAP and adjusted EBITDA measures exclude certain GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the financial schedules portion at the end of this press release. These non-GAAP financial measures differ from GAAP measures with the same captions and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its operating performance and future prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. NeoPhotonics believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today, Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 5:00 P.M.
