Formula One F1 - Spanish Grand Prix - Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain - May 13, 2018 Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton leads Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel and Mercedes’ Valtteri Bottas during the race REUTERS/Albert Gea\nThe victory, from pole position in a race that stayed dry despite the threat of rain, was the Briton’s second of the season, 64th of his career and third at the Circuit de Catalunya.\nFinland’s Valtteri Bottas was second, a hefty 20.5 seconds behind, with Dutch 20-year-old Max Verstappen completing the podium for Red Bull and Vettel fourth.\nHamilton’s win followed on from the lucky victory that fell into his lap in Azerbaijan two weekends ago, but Sunday had nothing to do with chance and all to do with champions back to their best.\n“This is more like it, let’s keep this up,” Hamilton told his celebrating team over the radio as he swept past the chequered flag.\n“Today the car and myself, I felt that synergy which I hadn’t been feeling for the whole year,” he added in a pre-podium interview after parking up in pit lane. “It’s a good feeling.\n“We’ve got our Mercedes board with us... so it’s great to have them all here and see that true force within the team, strength in depth, so I hope we can continue.”\nHamilton now has 95 points to Vettel’s 78 after five rounds of the 21-race championship.
