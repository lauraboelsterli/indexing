    "text": "BELOIT, Wis., May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE: RBC) today reported first quarter 2018 diluted earnings per share of $1.31 up 28% from the prior year. First quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share* were $1.34, up 25% from the prior year.\nKey financial results for the first quarter 2018 included:\nTotal net sales of $878.8 million increased 8.0% from the prior year and included a positive 2.2% foreign currency translation impact. The result was a positive organic sales growth rate of 5.8%. Income from operations was $88.2 million or 10.0% of net sales, up 80 basis points from prior year. Adjusted income from operations was $89.6 million or 10.2% of net sales, up 60 basis points from prior year. Repurchased 351,000 shares for a total of $26.0 million.\nFirst quarter 2018 segment results versus the prior year first quarter included:\nCommercial and Industrial Systems Segment net sales were $414.0 million, an increase of 8.6%. Foreign currency had a positive 3.0% translation impact. The result was a positive organic sales growth rate of 5.6% driven by strength in commercial HVAC, oil & gas, and power generation. Operating margin was 7.0%. Excluding $1.3 million in restructuring and related costs and a $0.3 million gain on sale of assets, adjusted operating margin was 7.3%. Climate Solutions Segment net sales were $259.9 million, an increase of 4.9%. Foreign currency had a positive 1.0% translation impact. The result was an organic sales growth rate of 3.9% driven by strength in North American residential HVAC partially offset by commercial refrigeration. Operating margin was 12.4%. Excluding restructuring and related costs of $0.4 million, adjusted operating margin was 12.6%. Power Transmission Solutions Segment net sales were $204.9 million, an increase of 11.0%. Foreign currency had a positive 2.2% translation impact. The result was a positive organic sales growth rate of 8.8% driven by increased demand in the oil & gas and renewable energy end markets. Operating margin was 13.1%. There were no adjustments to the segment operating margin in the quarter.\n*This earnings release includes non-GAAP financial measures. Descriptions of why we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included with this earnings release.\n\"We had a strong first quarter with organic sales up 5.8%, adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points and adjusted EPS up 25%,\" said Regal Chairman and CEO Mark Gliebe. \"We were also pleased that we were able to close on the acquisition of Nicotra Gebhardt shortly after the end of the quarter. Nicotra Gebhardt's portfolio of products are complementary to our existing air moving systems and will allow us to offer our customers a more complete lineup of energy efficient solutions.\"\n2018 Outlook\n\"The first quarter was a good start to the year, and we are pleased that we continue to see order strength in all three segments as we enter the second quarter. While our input costs are inflationary, we expect the benefits from our price actions will offset the commodity inflation headwind. Additionally, we expect the Nicotra Gebhardt acquisition to be $0.13 - $0.15 accretive to adjusted earnings in 2018. Accordingly, we are raising our 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share to $5.60 to $6.00,\" continued Mr. Gliebe.\nThe Company forecasts 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.29 to $5.69. The difference between the GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance and the adjusted diluted per share guidance relates to expected restructuring and related costs of $0.16 per share as well as purchase accounting and transaction costs of $0.15 per share.\nConference Call\nRegal will hold a conference call to discuss the earnings release at 9:00 am CDT (10:00 am EDT) on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.

We also periodically disclose certain financial measures in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and in investor presentations and similar events that may be considered \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. This additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nIn this earnings release, we disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures, and we reconcile these measures in the tables below to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures: adjusted diluted earnings per share (both historical and projected), adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, and free cash flow as a percentage of net income attributable to Regal Beloit Corporation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures for providing investors with additional information regarding our results of operations and for helping investors understand and compare our operating results across accounting periods and compared to our peers. Our management primarily uses adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin to help us manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions, while adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of net income are primarily used to help us evaluate our business and forecast our future results. Accordingly, we believe disclosing and reconciling each of these measures helps investors evaluate our business in the same manner as management.\nIn addition to these non-GAAP measures, we also use the term \"organic sales\" to refer to GAAP sales from existing operations excluding sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to any divested businesses (\"acquisition sales\"), and the impact of foreign currency translation. The impact of foreign currency translation is determined by translating the respective period's sales (excluding acquisition sales) using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year periods. We use the term \"organic sales growth\" to refer to the increase in our sales between periods that is attributable to organic sales. For further clarification, we may use the term \"acquisition growth\" to refer to the increase in our sales between periods that is attributable to acquisition sales.\nADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThree Months Ended\nMar 31,\n2018\nApr 1,\n2017\nGAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share\n$\n1.31\n$\n1.02\nRestructuring and Related Costs\n0.03\n0.05\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\n$\n1.34\n$\n1.07\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME\nThree Months Ended\nCommercial &\nIndustrial\nSystems\nClimate Solutions\nPower\nTransmission\nSolutions\nTotal Regal\nMar 31,\n2018\nApr 1,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nApr 1,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nApr 1,\n2017\nMar 31,\n2018\nApr 1,\n2017\nGAAP Income from Operations\n$\n29.1\n$\n25.7\n$\n32.3\n$\n31.4\n$\n26.8\n$\n17.9\n$\n88.2\n$\n75.0\nRestructuring and Related Costs\n1.3\n1.7\n0.4\n1.1\n—\n0.4\n1.7\n3.2\nGain on Disposal of Businesses\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(0.1)\n—\n(0.1)\nGain on Sale of Assets\n(0.3)\n(0.1)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(0.3)\n(0.1)\nAdjusted Income from Operations\n$\n30.1\n$\n27.3\n$\n32.7\n$\n32.5\n$\n26.8\n$\n18.2\n$\n89.6\n$\n78.0\nGAAP Operating Margin %\n7.0\n%\n6.7\n%\n12.4\n%\n12.7\n%\n13.1\n%\n9.7\n%\n10.0\n%\n9.2\n%\nAdjusted Operating Margin %\n7.3\n%\n7.2\n%\n12.6\n%\n13.1\n%\n13.1\n%\n9.9\n%\n10.2\n%\n9.6\n%\nFREE CASH FLOW\nThree Months Ended\nMar 31,\n2018\nApr 1,\n2017\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n$\n42.5\n$\n50.5\nAdditions to Property Plant and Equipment\n(19.3)\n(17.0)\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n23.2\n$\n33.5\nFree Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Regal Beloit Corporation\n39.7\n%\n72.4\n%\n2018 ADJUSTED ANNUAL GUIDANCE\nMinimum\nMaximum\n2018 Diluted EPS Annual Guidance\n$\n5.29\n$\n5.69\nPurchase Accounting and Transaction Costs\n0.15\n0.15\nRestructuring and Related Costs\n0.16\n0.16\n2018 Adjusted Diluted EPS Annual Guidance\n$\n5.60\n$\n6.00\nORGANIC SALES GROWTH\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nCommercial &\nIndustrial\nSystems\nClimate\nSolutions\nPower\nTransmission\nSolutions\nTotal Regal\nNet Sales\n$\n414.0\n$\n259.9\n$\n204.9\n$\n878.8\nImpact from Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n(11.3)\n(2.5)\n(4.0)\n(17.8)\nAdjusted Net Sales\n$\n402.7\n$\n257.4\n$\n200.9\n$\n861.0\nNet Sales Three Months Ended April 1, 2017\n$\n381.2\n$\n247.7\n$\n184.6\n$\n813.5\nOrganic Sales Growth %\n5.6\n%\n3.9\n%\n8.8\n%\n5.8\n%\nNet Sales Growth %\n8.6\n%\n4.9\n%\n11.0\n%\n8.0\n%\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regal-beloit-corporation-announces-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300643780.html\nSOURCE Regal Beloit Corporation",
