The benchmark fell 0.5 percent this week, ending a six-week winning streak.\nThe healthcare index closed at a record-high led by CSL Ltd, which jumped 4.1 percent to an all-time high, after the biotherapeutics company raised its full-year net profit for the second time this year, underpinned by a severe influenza season in northern hemisphere.\nThe healthcare index rose 2.4 percent over the week.\nWeak commodity prices weighed on material stocks, with major miners BHP and Rio Tinto, down over 1 percent each, among the biggest decliners on the benchmark.\nChinese steel futures fell to a one-week low on Friday, with supply rising and concerns of seasonal recovery in demand ending soon.\nIn the financial sector, lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group rose 0.6 percent while its ‘Big Four’ peers fell between 0.7 percent to 0.9 percent.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.6 percent, or 53.95 points, to 8,657.33. However, the benchmark fell slightly on the week after rising for the past three.\nAuckland International Airport was the biggest gainer on the index, rising 2.4 percent to a near nine month closing high.\nRyman Healthcare closed 2.5 percent higher, after reporting a 14 percent jump in its full-year profit.
