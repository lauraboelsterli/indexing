    "text": "The Los Angeles Rams would love to wear their iconic blue and yellow throwback uniforms more often, but the NFL apparently won’t allow it.\nSep 18, 2016; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Joe Rincon of Santa Fe Springs, CA. gets a photo with NFL former player Eric Dickerson before the game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Los Angeles Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports They currently wear the uniforms made famous during the Eric Dickerson era in Los Angeles twice per season, but asked to wear them for two additional games last season and were denied.\nRams COO Kevin Demoff says fans have expressed disappointment with their Navy blue jerseys and that the team has tried to communicate it to the league. The Rams most often wore a white and blue jersey and white pants with a navy blue stripe for home games last season, and the same jersey with blue pants on the road.\n“We have spent the year educating them on our fan base,” Demoff said, per the Los Angeles Times. “We forwarded them all of the fan complaints, the emails we get, so I think they’re well aware of our fans’ preferences.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) “It was always with the idea that we’d be able to revisit it during the offseason when there’s more time to plan,” Demoff said. “Hopefully, they recognize the challenge we have and appreciate the connection the fan base has to the blue and yellow. If we can avoid wearing our Navy jerseys next year, we will.”\nDemoff said the team has begun the process of redesigned uniforms with Nike, with an eye toward 2019 or 2020. The team also expects to open its new stadium in Inglewood in 2020.\n“As we do every offseason, we are working with Nike and a number of our clubs, this year including the Rams, on various issues and ideas around their uniforms,” an NFL spokesperson told the Times via email.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
