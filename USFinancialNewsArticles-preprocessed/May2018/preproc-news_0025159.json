The biggest utilities operating in that area are units of Entergy Corp .\n* MISO said the grid has enough power reserves to meet peak demand during the summer air conditioning seasons.\n* The MISO grid covers parts of 15 U.S. states from Montana and Minnesota south to Louisiana and Texas, and the Canadian province of Manitoba.\n* Some of the biggest energy companies in the MISO region, include units of Entergy, Ameren Corp, Duke Energy Corp , CMS Energy Corp, DTE Energy Co, Xcel Energy Inc and WEC Energy Group Inc.
