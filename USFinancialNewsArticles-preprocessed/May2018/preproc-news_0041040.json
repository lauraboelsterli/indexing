A street-cleaner walks past the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Britain, February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\nThe Australian took refuge in the small diplomatic headquarters in 2012 to avoid sexual abuse charges in Sweden. He rejects the charges and prosecutors have abandoned their investigation.\nHowever, British authorities are still seeking his arrest. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is seen on the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Britain, May 19, 2017. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n“The President of the Republic, Lenin Moreno, has ordered that any additional security at the Ecuadorian embassy in London be withdrawn immediately,” the government said in a statement. “From now on, it will maintain normal security similar to that of other Ecuadorian embassies,” the statement said. Ecuador suspended Assange’s communication systems in March after his pointed political comments on Twitter.\nMoreno has described Assange’s situation as “a stone in his shoe.” Reporting by Alexandra Valencia in QuitoWriting by Girish GuptaEditing by Paul Tait",
