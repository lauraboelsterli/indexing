Plans for the move are expected to take place toward the end of this year.\n\"The Metro Boston region is widely recognized as a hub for driving technology innovation and producing top technology talent,\" said Tom Turner, President and CEO of BitSight. \"We're excited to move deeper into the Boston tech community, contribute to its innovative spirit and provide our employees with an exceptional work experience. The location of the property and the area's surrounding amenities will not only help us retain and attract top local talent, but will encourage collaboration between employees, customers and partners, furthering our leadership position.\"\nBitSight pioneered the security ratings market in 2011, as the first company to offer a security ratings product.
