Non-GAAP net income of $41.9 million, or $0.75 per diluted share.\nIRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Masimo (NASDAQ: MASI) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results:\nFirst quarter 2018 total revenue, including royalty and other revenue, increased to $213.0 million. Product revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $204.4 million.\nThe Company’s worldwide direct product revenue, which accounted for 87.5% of total product revenue, increased to $178.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. OEM sales, which accounted for 12.5% of total product revenue, increased to $25.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nGAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $45.6 million, or $0.82 per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $41.9 million, or $0.75 per diluted share.\nAs a result of the strong performance in the first quarter, Masimo is raising its fiscal year 2018 product revenue guidance from $808 million to $818 million, its GAAP EPS guidance from $2.90 to $3.01 and its non-GAAP EPS guidance from $2.80 to $2.88.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company shipped approximately 53,600 noninvasive technology boards and monitors.\nAs of March 31, 2018, total cash and cash equivalents were $369.5 million. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $16.5 million.\nJoe Kiani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Masimo, said, “We had another record quarter for product revenues and earnings, demonstrating once again the clinical and economic value of our innovative technologies for improving patient care. We achieved another strong quarter of shipments of our noninvasive monitoring technologies, at 53,600. Our positive outlook is visible in our higher guidance for sales and earnings in 2018 as we introduce important new products and gain new customers around the world.”\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company provided the following updated estimates for its full year 2018 guidance:\n2018 Updated Guidance 1 Prior 2018 Guidance 1 (in millions, except percentages and earnings per share) GAAP Non-GAAP GAAP Non-GAAP Total revenue, including royalty and other revenue $ 846 $ 846 $ 836 $ 836 Product revenue $ 818 $ 818 $ 808 $ 808 Royalty and other revenue $ 28 $ 28 $ 28 $ 28 Operating margin 24.2 % 24.4 % 24.2 % 24.4 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.01 $ 2.88 $ 2.90 $ 2.80 EBITDA 26.8 % 29.9 % 26.9 % 29.9 % Estimated tax rate 20.2 % 24.0 % 22.0 % 25.0 %\n1 Updated guidance provided May 2, 2018. Prior guidance provided February 27, 2018.\nTotal revenue, including royalty and other revenue, increasing to $846 million; Product revenue increasing to $818 million; GAAP diluted earnings per share increasing to $3.01; and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increasing to $2.88.\nImpact of Adoption of New Revenue Accounting Standard:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). The new revenue recognition standard requires the Company to make numerous assumptions that are based upon historical trends and management judgment. These assumptions may change over time and may have a material impact on our revenue recognition, guidance and results of operations. In accordance with the full retrospective method of adoption, the Company has adjusted certain amounts previously reported in its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to comply with the new standard, as indicated by the notation, “As Adjusted”. For additional information with respect to the impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard and reconciliations to the prior reported amounts, please reference Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements that will be included in Part I, Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 once filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Exhibit 99.3 that was included in our Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC today.\nSupplementary Non-GAAP Financial Information\nFor additional non-GAAP financial details, please visit the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.masimo.com to access Supplementary Financial Information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained herein are a supplement to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude the items described below. Management believes that adjustments for these items assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. Furthermore, management also believes that these items are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the Company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTherefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP measures to assist investors in understanding the Company’s core net operating results on an ongoing basis: (i) non-GAAP net income, (ii) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, (iii) non-GAAP gross profit, (iv) non-GAAP operating income and (v) adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of the Company’s core operating results with those of other companies. Management believes non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA are important measures in the evaluation of the Company’s performance and uses these measures to better understand and evaluate our business.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments for the following items, as well as the related income tax effects thereof:\nAcquisition-related costs, including depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization related to the revaluation of assets and liabilities (primarily intangible assets, property, plant and equipment adjustments, inventory revaluation, lease liabilities, etc.) to fair value through purchase accounting related to value created by the seller prior to the acquisition rather than ongoing costs of operating our core business. As a result, we believe that exclusion of these costs in presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors a more effective means of evaluating historical performance and projected costs and the potential for realizing cost efficiencies within our core business. Depreciation and amortization related to the revaluation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities will generally recur in future periods.\nLitigation damages, awards and settlements.\nIn connection with litigation proceedings arising in the course of our business, we have recorded expenses as a defendant in such proceedings in the form of damages, as well as gains as a plaintiff in such proceedings in the form of litigation awards and settlement proceeds; most recently in connection with our November 2016 settlement agreement with Koninklijke Philips N.V. We believe that exclusion of these expenses and gains is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of our ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis. In this regard, we note that these expenses and gains are generally unrelated to our core business and/or infrequent in nature.\nRealized and unrealized gains or losses from foreign currency transactions.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables related to certain customer sales agreements, product costs and other operating expenses. As the Company does not actively hedge these currency exposures, changes in the underlying currency rates relative to the U.S. Dollar may result in realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses between the time these receivables and payables arise and the time that they are settled in cash. Since such realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses are the result of macro-economic factors and can vary significantly from one period to the next, we believe that exclusion of such realized and unrealized gains and losses are useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of our ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis. Realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses are likely to recur in future periods.\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nCurrent authoritative accounting guidance requires that excess tax benefits or costs recognized on stock-based compensation expense be reflected in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital. Since we cannot control or predict when stock option awards will be exercised or the price at which such awards will be exercised, the impact of such guidance can create significant volatility in our effective tax rate from one period to the next. We believe that exclusion of these excess tax benefits or costs is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of our ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis. These excess tax benefits or costs will generally recur in future periods as long as we continue to issue equity awards to our employees.\nTax impacts that may not be representative of the ongoing results of our core operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act) was signed into law in December 2017, and became effective January 1, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act included a number of changes to existing U.S. federal tax law impacting businesses including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time transition tax on the “deemed repatriation” of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 and changes in the prospective taxation of the foreign operations of U.S. multinational companies. We believe that exclusion of the tax charges related to the 2017 Tax Act is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of our ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis. In this regard, we note that this tax charge is unrelated to our core business and non-recurring in nature.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Actuals versus First Quarter 2017 Actuals:\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017\nAs Adjusted\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) $ Per Diluted\nShare\n$ Per Diluted\nShare\nGAAP net income, as originally reported $ 45,630 $ 0.82 $ 45,334 $ 0.82 ASC 606 adjustments — — 6,199 0.11 GAAP net income, as adjusted 45,630 0.82 51,533 0.93 Non-GAAP adjustments: Acquisition related depreciation and amortization 360 0.01 427 — Litigation damages, awards and settlements — — — — Non-operating other (income) expense (1,113 ) (0.02 ) (557 ) (0.01 ) Tax impact of above item 120 — (102 ) — Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation (3,148 ) (0.06 ) (15,147 ) (0.27 ) Remeasurement of deferred taxes 16 — — — Total non-GAAP adjustments (3,765 ) (0.07 ) (15,379 ) (0.28 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 41,865 $ 0.75 $ 36,154 $ 0.65 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 55,496 55,529 Full Year 2017 Actuals versus Full Year 2018 Guidance:\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE\nFull Year 2018\nUpdated Guidance 1\nFull Year 2017\nActuals As Adjusted\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) $ Per Diluted\nShare\n$ Per Diluted\nShare\nGAAP net income, as originally reported $ 167,800 $ 3.01 $ 131,616 $ 2.36 ASC 606 adjustments — — (6,827 ) (0.13 ) GAAP net income as adjusted 167,800 3.01 124,789 2.23 Non-GAAP adjustments: Acquisition related depreciation and amortization 1,500 0.03 1,597 0.03 Non-operating other (income) expense (1,100 ) (0.02 ) 270 0.01 Tax impact of above items (100 ) — (456 ) (0.01 ) Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation (8,000 ) (0.14 ) (39,241 ) (0.70 ) Tax impact of U.S. tax reform 2, 3 — — 41,392 0.74 Total non-GAAP adjustments (7,700 ) (0.13 ) 3,562 0.07 Non-GAAP net income $ 160,100 $ 2.88 $ 128,351 $ 2.30 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 55,700 55,595 1 Estimated effective tax rate of 22% applied to GAAP earnings and 25% applied to non-GAAP earnings. 2 As previously reported in February 2018, the 2017 Tax Act resulted in an unfavorable charge of $43.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The amount recognized was a provisional estimate and subject to change, possibly materially, due to, among other things, refinements of the Company’s calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made or additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission or Financial Accounting Standards Board. 3 Includes adjustments related to the full retrospective application of ASC 606 of $2.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.
