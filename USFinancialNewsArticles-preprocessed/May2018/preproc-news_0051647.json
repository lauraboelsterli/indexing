    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif. and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Global content leader Lionsgate (NYSE: LGF.A, LGF.B) today reported revenue of $4.1 billion and net income attributable to Lionsgate shareholders of $474 million, or fully diluted EPS of $2.15 on 220.4 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for fiscal 2018 (year ended March 31, 2018). Adjusted net income attributable to Lionsgate shareholders was $332 million or adjusted diluted EPS of $1.51, operating income was $249 million, and adjusted OIBDA was $604 million.\nThe Company generated $330 million in free cash flow during the fiscal year which, combined with proceeds from the sale of its stake in EPIX, enabled it to reduce net debt by $650 million.\nNet income for the fiscal year includes a discrete net tax benefit of $259 million resulting from the impact of the change in U.S. federal corporate tax rates on net deferred tax liabilities as well as internal capital restructuring related to debt refinancing transactions in the fourth quarter, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax valuation allowances.\n\"Our strong quarter capped a successful year in which we exceeded our internal and consensus financial expectations with significant contributions across our film, television and Starz platforms,\" said Lionsgate Chief Executive Officer Jon Feltheimer. \"We enter fiscal 2019 well positioned to continue growing our worldwide content platform, deepening our key talent relationships, and rolling out Starz as a truly global consumer brand. Today I'm pleased to announce that we've taken a major step forward in this initiative by launching STARZPLAY branded channels in the UK and Germany on Amazon Prime Video.\"\nFourth Quarter Results\nFor the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported revenue of $1.04 billion, net income attributable to Lionsgate shareholders of $91 million or fully diluted EPS of $0.41 on 221.8 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Adjusted net income attributable to Lionsgate shareholders in the quarter was $55 million or adjusted diluted EPS of $0.25, with operating income of $48 million and adjusted OIBDA of $136 million.\nSegment Results\nWith Lionsgate's acquisition of Starz, fiscal 2018 results are not directly comparable to prior reporting periods, so the following segment results will be discussed as compared to the prior year on a combined pro forma basis.\nMedia Networks segment revenues increased by 5% to $1.53 billion due to strong over-the-top (OTT) revenue growth, driven by a 101% increase in OTT subscribers during the fiscal year, along with revenues from worldwide digital media licensing arrangements. Segment profits increased by 5% in the year to $469 million.\nMotion Picture segment revenues decreased by 11% in fiscal 2018 due to a smaller theatrical slate and comparison to a prior year that included the blockbuster hit La La Land. Segment profits increased by 36% to $179 million, and the Company will achieve ultimate profitability on over 90% of its fiscal 2018 theatrical releases.\nTelevision Production segment revenues of $805 million compared to $843 million in the prior year due to the composition of the television slate. Segment profits increased by 6% to $67 million in the fiscal year.\nLionsgate's backlog, or already contracted future revenue on the licensing of film and television product not yet recorded, was $1.2 billion at March 31, 2018.\nLionsgate senior management will hold its analyst and investor conference call to discuss its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year financial results at 5:00 PM ET/2:00 PM PT this afternoon, May 24. Interested parties may listen to the live webcast by visiting the events page on the Lionsgate corporate website or via https://services.choruscall.com/links/lgf180524pmsLXxtx.html . A full replay will become available later this afternoon, May 24, by clicking the same link.\nABOUT LIONSGATE\nThe first major new studio in decades, Lionsgate is a global content platform whose films, television series, digital products and linear and over-the-top platforms reach next generation audiences around the world.

As a result of the Starz Merger, beginning December 8, 2016, the Motion Pictures segment includes Starz's third-party distribution business.\nTelevision Production consists of the development, production and worldwide distribution of television productions including television series, television movies and mini-series, and non-fiction programming.\nMedia Networks (which was not a reportable segment prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2016) consists of (i) Starz Networks, which includes the licensing of premium subscription video programming to U.S. multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") including cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunication companies, and over-the-top (\"OTT\") providers, and on a direct-to-consumer basis (ii) Content and Other, which includes the licensing of the Media Networks' original series programming to digital media platforms, international television networks, home entertainment and other ancillary markets and (iii) Streaming Services, which represents the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming services on its subscription video-on-demand (\"SVOD\") platforms which were moved under the Media Networks segment in connection with the Starz Merger.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company's reportable segments enter into transactions with one another. The most common types of intersegment transactions include licensing motion pictures or television programming from the Motion Pictures and Television Production segments to the Media Networks segment. In addition, intersegment transactions include distribution fees charged to the Media Networks segment by the Television Production segment for the distribution of Media Networks' original series programming in ancillary markets. While intersegment transactions are treated like third-party transactions to determine segment performance, the revenues (and corresponding expenses or assets recognized by the segment that is the counterparty to the transaction) are eliminated in consolidation and, therefore, do not affect consolidated results.\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)\nSegment information by business unit is presented in the table below. The Media Networks segment was not previously a reportable segment prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and reflects Starz Networks and Content and Other from the date of acquisition of Starz (December 8, 2016), and the Lionsgate direct to consumer streaming services on SVOD platforms for the historical periods presented.\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited, amounts in millions)\nSegment revenues\nMotion Pictures\n$\n424.9\n$\n654.0\n$\n1,822.1\n$\n1,920.6\nTelevision Production\n252.7\n242.6\n805.3\n837.4\nMedia Networks\n365.7\n370.8\n1,532.5\n456.6\nIntersegment eliminations\n(3.1)\n(11.3)\n(30.8)\n(13.1)\n$\n1,040.2\n$\n1,256.1\n$\n4,129.1\n$\n3,201.5\nGross contribution\nMotion Pictures\n$\n61.3\n$\n82.8\n$\n292.6\n$\n237.8\nTelevision Production\n35.4\n22.4\n107.5\n91.9\nMedia Networks\n140.5\n155.5\n570.2\n183.6\nIntersegment eliminations\n0.3\n(2.8)\n(1.9)\n(3.2)\n$\n237.5\n$\n257.9\n$\n968.4\n$\n510.1\nSegment general and administration\nMotion Pictures\n$\n32.1\n$\n30.8\n$\n113.2\n$\n105.3\nTelevision Production\n12.0\n9.4\n40.3\n32.1\nMedia Networks\n25.3\n30.7\n100.9\n45.0\n$\n69.4\n$\n70.9\n$\n254.4\n$\n182.4\nSegment profit\nMotion Pictures\n$\n29.2\n$\n52.0\n$\n179.4\n$\n132.5\nTelevision Production\n23.4\n13.0\n67.2\n59.8\nMedia Networks\n115.2\n124.8\n469.3\n138.6\nIntersegment eliminations\n0.3\n(2.8)\n(1.9)\n(3.2)\nTotal segment profit\n$\n168.1\n$\n187.0\n$\n714.0\n$\n327.7\nCorporate general and administrative expenses\n(32.1)\n(24.3)\n(110.3)\n(92.6)\nAdjusted OIBDA (1)\n$\n136.0\n$\n162.7\n$\n603.7\n$\n235.1\n(1)\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for the definition of Adjusted OIBDA and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)\nThe following table sets forth revenues and segment profit by product line for the Media Networks segment for the three months and years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited, amounts in millions)\nMedia Networks Revenue:\nStarz Networks\n$\n350.5\n$\n340.6\n$\n1,404.1\n$\n423.4\nContent and Other\n12.3\n28.9\n121.3\n30.3\nStreaming Services (1)\n2.9\n1.3\n7.1\n2.9\n$\n365.7\n$\n370.8\n$\n1,532.5\n$\n456.6\nMedia Networks Segment Profit:\nStarz Networks\n$\n122.4\n$\n127.3\n$\n468.0\n$\n165.9\nContent and Other\n0.5\n8.1\n40.2\n8.2\nStreaming Services (1)\n(7.7)\n(10.6)\n(38.9)\n(35.5)\n$\n115.2\n$\n124.8\n$\n469.3\n$\n138.6\n(1)\nStreaming Services represents the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming service initiatives on SVOD platforms which are now included in the Media Networks segment.\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\nPRO FORMA COMBINED SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe following table sets forth segment information for the year ended March 31, 2017 on a pro forma combined basis as if the Starz Merger and our segment reorganization occurred on April 1, 2016, compared with the actual consolidated segment information for the year ended March 31, 2018:\nACTUAL\nPRO FORMA\nCOMBINED\nYear Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited, amounts in millions)\nSegment revenues\nMotion Pictures\n$\n1,822.1\n$\n2,040.2\nTelevision Production\n805.3\n843.2\nMedia Networks\n1,532.5\n1,458.9\nIntersegment eliminations\n(30.8)\n(23.8)\n$\n4,129.1\n$\n4,318.5\nGross contribution\nMotion Pictures\n$\n292.6\n$\n250.3\nTelevision Production\n107.5\n97.9\nMedia Networks\n570.2\n569.6\nIntersegment eliminations\n(1.9)\n(6.9)\n$\n968.4\n$\n910.9\nSegment general and administration\nMotion Pictures\n$\n113.2\n$\n118.5\nTelevision Production\n40.3\n34.8\nMedia Networks\n100.9\n122.5\n$\n254.4\n$\n275.8\nSegment profit\nMotion Pictures\n$\n179.4\n$\n131.8\nTelevision Production\n67.2\n63.1\nMedia Networks\n469.3\n447.1\nIntersegment eliminations\n(1.9)\n(6.9)\nTotal segment profit\n$\n714.0\n$\n635.1\nCorporate general and administrative expenses\n(110.3)\n(92.3)\nAdjusted OIBDA (1)\n$\n603.7\n$\n542.8\n(1)\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for the definition of Adjusted OIBDA and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nNOTE: The pro forma combined amounts above for the year ended March 31, 2017 were determined by combining the historical financial information of Lionsgate and Starz for each respective period, applying the new Lionsgate segment structure, and applying the acquisition related accounting.

The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.\nAdjusted OIBDA: Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income (loss) before adjusted depreciation and amortization (\"OIBDA\"), adjusted for adjusted share-based compensation (\"adjusted SBC\"), purchase accounting and related adjustments, and restructuring and other costs.\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization represents depreciation and amortization as presented on our consolidated statement of operations, less the depreciation and amortization related to the amortization of purchase accounting and related adjustments associated with the acquisition of Starz and Pilgrim Media Group. Accordingly, the full impact of the purchase accounting is included in the adjustment for \"purchase accounting and related adjustments\", described below. Adjusted share-based compensation represents share-based compensation excluding immediately vested stock awards granted as part of the Company's annual bonus program issued in lieu of cash bonuses (which are, when granted, included in segment or corporate general and administrative expense), and excluding the impact of the acceleration of certain vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements, which are included in restructuring and other expenses, when applicable. Restructuring and other includes restructuring and severance costs, certain transaction and related costs, and certain unusual items, when applicable. Purchase accounting and related adjustments represent the amortization of non-cash fair value adjustments to certain assets acquired in the acquisition of Starz, Pilgrim Media Group and Good Universe.\nAdjusted OIBDA is calculated similar to how the Company defines segment profit and manages and evaluates its segment operations. Segment profit also excludes corporate general and administrative expense.\nFree Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus or minus the net increase or decrease in production loans. The adjustment for the production loans is made because the GAAP based cash flows from operations reflects a non-cash reduction of cash flows for the cost of films and television programs associated with production loans prior to the time the Company actually pays for the film or television program. The Company believes that it is more meaningful to reflect the impact of the payment for these films and television programs in its free cash flow when the payments are actually made.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders: Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders, adjusted for share-based compensation, purchase accounting and related adjustments, restructuring and other items, loss on extinguishment of debt, and unusual gains or losses, net of the tax effect of the adjustments at the applicable blended statutory rate and net of the impact of the adjustments on non-controlling interest.\nAdjusted Basic and Diluted EPS : Adjusted basic earnings (loss) per share is defined as adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but is adjusted for the effects of securities that are diluted based on the level of adjusted net income (loss), similar to GAAP.\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Continued)\nThese measures are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the SEC and are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and cash flows before non-operating items. Adjusted OIBDA is considered an important measure of the Company's performance because this measure eliminates amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Free Cash Flow is considered an important measure of the Company's liquidity because it provides information about the ability of the Company to reduce net corporate debt, make strategic investments, dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders and Adjusted EPS are considered important measures of the Company's business operations as, similar to Adjusted OIBDA, these measures eliminate amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses.\nThese non-GAAP measures are commonly used in the entertainment industry and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry to measure operating performance. However, not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner and the measures as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items.\nA general limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of operating income, cash flow, net income (loss), or earnings (loss) per share as determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the adjusted metrics utilized to their corresponding GAAP metrics are provided below.\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\nRECONCILIATION OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\nTO ADJUSTED OIBDA\nThe following table reconciles the GAAP measure, operating income (loss) to the non-GAAP measure, Adjusted OIBDA:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited, amounts in millions)\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n48.4\n$\n71.3\n$\n248.7\n$\n(16.3)\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization (1)\n10.0\n9.7\n39.3\n22.8\nRestructuring and other (2)\n24.0\n16.4\n59.8\n88.7\nAdjusted share-based compensation expense (3)\n14.0\n27.1\n85.6\n77.1\nPurchase accounting and related adjustments (4)\n39.6\n38.2\n170.3\n62.8\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n136.0\n$\n162.7\n$\n603.7\n$\n235.1\n(1)\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization represents depreciation and amortization as presented on our consolidated statements of income less the depreciation and amortization related to the non-cash fair value adjustments to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Starz and Pilgrim Media Group which are included in the purchase accounting and related adjustments line item above, as shown in the table below:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited, amounts in millions)\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n39.9\n$\n39.9\n$\n159.0\n$\n63.1\nLess: Amount included in purchase accounting and related adjustments\n(29.9)\n(30.2)\n(119.7)\n(40.3)\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization\n$\n10.0\n$\n9.7\n$\n39.3\n$\n22.8\n(2)\nRestructuring and other includes restructuring and severance costs, certain transaction and related costs, and certain unusual items, when applicable, as shown in the table below:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited, amounts in millions)\nRestructuring and other:\nSeverance (a)\nCash\n$\n11.4\n$\n3.2\n$\n21.5\n$\n26.7\nAccelerated vesting on equity awards\n窶能n窶能n2.9\n2.4\nTotal severance costs\n11.4\n3.2\n24.4\n29.1\nTransaction and related costs (b)\n7.8\n13.2\n22.2\n59.6\nDevelopment expense (c)\n4.8\n窶能n13.2\n窶能n$\n24.0\n$\n16.4\n$\n59.8\n$\n88.7\na)\nSeverance costs in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 were primarily related to the restructuring of the Motion Pictures business in connection with the acquisition of Good Universe and additional workforce reductions in connection with the Starz Merger. Severance costs in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 were primarily related to workforce reductions for redundancies in connection with the Starz Merger.\n(b)\nTransaction and related costs in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 reflect transaction, integration and legal costs incurred associated with certain strategic transactions. In fiscal 2018, these costs were primarily related to the sale of EPIX, the Starz Merger, the legal fees associated with the Starz class action lawsuits and certain other legal matters. In fiscal 2017, these costs were primarily related to the Starz Merger, the legal fees associated with the Starz class action lawsuits, and an arbitration award of $5.8 million and related legal expenses.\n(c)\nDevelopment expense in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 represents write-downs resulting from the restructuring of the Motion Pictures business in connection with the acquisition of Good Universe and new management's decisions around the creative direction on certain development projects which were abandoned in the fiscal year.\n(3)\nAdjusted share-based compensation represents share-based compensation excluding amounts related to immediately vested stock awards granted as part of the Company's annual bonus program (which are, when granted, included in segment and corporate general and administrative expense) and excludes share-based compensation included in restructuring and other.

Accordingly, share-based compensation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was reduced by the reversal of stock-based compensation bonus recorded in previous periods which are now reflected as cash-based bonus expense. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, this amount adjusts the share-based compensation to reflect share-based compensation excluding the bonus reversal.\n(b) Represents share-based compensation expense included in restructuring and other expenses reflecting the impact of the acceleration of certain vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements.\n(4)\nPurchase accounting and related adjustments represent the amortization of non-cash fair value adjustments to certain assets acquired in the acquisition of Starz, Pilgrim Media Group and Good Universe.
