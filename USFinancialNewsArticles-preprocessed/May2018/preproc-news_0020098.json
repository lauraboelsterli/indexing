    "text": "WILLIAMSBURG, Va., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sotherly Hotels Inc. (NASDAQ:SOHO), (“Sotherly” or the “Company”), a self-managed and self-administered lodging real estate investment trust (a “REIT”), today reported its consolidated results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company’s results include the following*:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 ($ in thousands except per share data) Total Revenue $ 41,736 $ 38,695 Net (loss) income available to common stockholders (238 ) 1,851 EBITDA 10,345 9,751 Hotel EBITDA 11,879 11,479 FFO 4,499 5,000 Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders 4,746 5,134 Net (loss) income per share available to common stockholders $ (0.02 ) $ 0.13 FFO per share and unit $ 0.29 $ 0.32 Adjusted FFO available to common holders per share and unit $ 0.31 $ 0.32 (*) Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), hotel EBITDA, funds from operations (“FFO”), adjusted FFO, FFO per share and unit and adjusted FFO per share and unit are non-GAAP financial measures. See further discussion of these non-GAAP measures, including definitions related thereto, and reconciliations to net income (loss) later in this press release. The Company is the sole general partner of Sotherly Hotels LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), and all references in this release to the “Company”, “Sotherly”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Sotherly Hotels Inc., its Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated.\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nRevenue and RevPAR . For the three-month period ending March 31, 2018, Total Revenue increased 7.9% over the three-month period ending March 31, 2017. Room revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) for the Company’s composite portfolio, which includes the performance of the rooms participating in our rental program at the Hyde Resort & Residences, during the three-month period ending March 31, 2018, increased 6.6% over the three months ended March 31, 2017, to $112.03 reflecting a 4.6% decrease in occupancy and an 11.8% increase in average daily rate (“ADR”).\nCommon Dividends . As previously reported on May 1, 2018, the Company announced its quarterly dividend (distribution) on its common stock (and units) of $0.12 per share (and unit) to stockholders (and unitholders) of record as of June 15, 2018.\nHotel EBITDA . The Company generated hotel EBITDA of approximately $11.9 million during the three-month period ending March 31, 2018, an increase of 3.5%, or approximately $0.4 million, from the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nEBITDA . The Company generated EBITDA of approximately $10.3 million during the three-month period ending March 31, 2018, an increase of 6.1% or approximately $0.6 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAdjusted FFO . For the three-month period ending March 31, 2018, Adjusted FFO decreased 7.5% or approximately $0.4 million from the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAndrew M. Sims, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sotherly Hotels Inc., commented, “The first quarter of 2018 started out slow, with January showing weakness, followed by a steady increase in business volume during February and March. With Easter week occurring in the first quarter this year, some revenue migrated to the second quarter. We believe the first half of 2018 will be strong in terms of performance for the Company. The acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington is a nice addition to the Company’s upper upscale portfolio.”\nBalance Sheet/Liquidity\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $35.6 million of available cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $4.9 million was reserved for real estate taxes, insurance, capital improvements and certain other expenses or otherwise restricted. The Company had approximately $380.7 million in outstanding debt at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.94%.\nOn February 1, 2018, the Company drew down the final $5.0 million of loan proceeds available on the Hilton Wilmington Riverside mortgage loan after completing a significant portion of the renovation of the hotel and meeting certain other requirements under the loan documents.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company and the Operating Partnership closed on a sale and issuance by the Operating Partnership of an aggregate $25.0 million of the 7.25% senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership, unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (the “7.25% Notes”), for net proceeds after estimated expenses of approximately $23.3 million. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from this offering, together with existing cash on hand and $57.0 million of first and second lien asset-level mortgage indebtedness, to finance the acquisition of the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel located in Arlington, Virginia (the “Arlington Hotel”) and for working capital.\nOn February 26, 2018, we entered into a First Amendment to the Loan Agreement, Amended and Restated Promissory Note, and other related documents with International Bank of Commerce to amend the terms of the mortgage loan on The Whitehall hotel located in Houston, TX. Pursuant to the amended loan documents, the maturity date is extended until February 26, 2023, the loan amortizes on a 25-year schedule with payments of principal and interest beginning immediately, and the loan has an initial principal balance of $15.0 million, with no additional principal available.\nOn April 5, 2018, the Company drew down an additional $3.30 million of loan proceeds available on the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore mortgage loan.\nPortfolio Update\nOn March 1, 2018, we acquired the Arlington Hotel from RP/HH Rosslyn Hotel Owner, LP for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $79.7 million. Concurrent with the closing, we entered into an agreement with Highgate Hotels L.P. to manage the Arlington Hotel. The management agreement has an initial term of three years commencing on March 1, 2018. In connection with the acquisition, we entered into a loan agreement, a first and second promissory note (“Note A” and “Note B”, respectively), and other loan documents, including a guarantee by the Operating Partnership, to secure an aggregate $57.0 million mortgage (the “Mortgage Loan”) on the Arlington Hotel with Fifth Third Bank. Pursuant to the Mortgage Loan documents, Note A is in the amount of $50.0 million; has a term of 3 years, with two 1-year extension options, each of which is subject to certain criteria and bears a floating interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 3.00%. Pursuant to the Mortgage Loan documents, Note B is in the amount of $7.0 million; has a term of 1-year, with two 1-year extension options, each of which is subject to certain criteria; bears a floating interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 5.00%; and requires monthly principal payments of $100,000 during the initial 1-year term, $150,000 during the first 1-year extended term, and $250,000 during the second 1-year extended term, with interest payments due monthly on the outstanding principal amount during all three terms.\nOn April 2, 2018, the Company’s hotel in Wilmington, North Carolina was converted to the Hotel Ballast, a member of the Tapestry Collection by Hilton, following the completion of a $10.0 million renovation of the guest rooms and public space, which included the addition of two new food and beverage outlets the Board & Barrel Coastal Kitchen and the Buffalo Bayou.\nAt the Company’s hotel in Tampa, Florida, renovations are underway for an estimated $11.0 million renovation project in anticipation of a planned conversion in March 2019 from the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore to Hotel Alba, which we expect to become a member of the Tapestry Collection by Hilton. As of March 31, 2018, we incurred costs totaling approximately $1.3 million toward this renovation.\n2018 Outlook\nAs previously disclosed, set forth below is the Company’s guidance for 2018, which accounts for the impact of renovations at the Company’s hotels in Wilmington and Tampa, the issuance of the 7.25% Notes, and the acquisition of the Arlington Hotel. The guidance is predicated on estimates of occupancy and ADR that are consistent with the most recent 2018 calendar year forecasts by STR for the market segments in which the Company operates.\nThe table below reflects the Company’s projections, within a range, of various financial measures for 2018, in thousands of dollars, except per share and RevPAR data:\n2018 Guidance Low Range High Range Total revenue $ 167,750 $ 169,095 Net loss (2,804 ) (2,352 ) EBITDA 40,997 41,481 Hotel EBITDA 46,997 47,581 FFO 15,843 16,352 Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders 15,873 16,493 Net loss per share available to common stockholders $ (0.21 ) $ (0.17 ) FFO per share and unit $ 1.04 $ 1.07 Adjusted FFO available to common holders per share and unit $ 1.04 $ 1.08 Rev PAR $ 106.23 $ 107.09 Hotel EBITDA margin 31.4 % 31.6 % Earnings Call/Webcast\nThe Company will conduct its first quarter 2018 conference call for investors and other interested parties at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.

These measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or amounts available for the Company’s discretionary use and should not be considered alternative measures of net income, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP.\nFFO\nIndustry analysts and investors use Funds from Operations (“FFO”), as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for any noncontrolling interest from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by itself.\nThe Company considers FFO to be a useful measure of adjusted net income (loss) for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because we believe FFO is most directly comparable to net income (loss), which remains the primary measure of performance, because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Although FFO is intended to be a REIT industry standard, other companies may not calculate FFO in the same manner as we do, and investors should not assume that FFO as reported by us is comparable to FFO as reported by other REITs.\nAdjusted FFO\nThe Company presents adjusted FFO, including adjusted FFO per share and unit, which adjusts for certain additional items including changes in deferred income taxes, any unrealized gain (loss) on hedging instruments or warrant derivative, loan impairment losses, losses on early extinguishment of debt, aborted offering costs, loan modification fees, franchise termination costs, costs associated with the departure of executive officers, litigation settlement, over-assessed real estate taxes on appeal, change in control gains or losses and acquisition transaction costs. We exclude these items as we believe it allows for meaningful comparisons between periods and among other REITs and is more indicative than FFO of the on-going performance of our business and assets. Our calculation of Adjusted FFO may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs.\nEBITDA\nThe Company believes that excluding the effect of non-operating expenses and non-cash charges, and the portion of those items related to unconsolidated entities, all of which are also based on historical cost accounting and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance, can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods and between REITs, even though EBITDA also does not represent an amount that accrued directly to shareholders.\nHotel EBITDA\nThe Company defines Hotel EBITDA as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) income tax provision or benefit, (4) equity in the income or loss of equity investees, (5) unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments not included in other comprehensive income, (6) gains and losses on disposal of assets, (7) realized gains and losses on investments, (8) impairment of long-lived assets or investments, (9) loss on early debt extinguishment, (10) gains or losses on change in control, (11) corporate general and administrative expense, (12) depreciation and amortization, (13) gains and losses on involuntary conversions of assets, (14) distributions to preferred stockholders and (15) other operating revenue not related to our wholly-owned portfolio. We believe this provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our wholly-owned hotels and its operators have direct control. We believe Hotel EBITDA provides investors with supplemental information on the on-going operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis. The Company’s calculation of hotel EBITDA may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs.\nSource:Sotherly Hotels Inc.",
