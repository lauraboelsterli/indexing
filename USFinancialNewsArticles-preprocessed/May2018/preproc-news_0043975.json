FILE PHOTO: Cycling - the 101st Giro d'Italia cycling race - The 229-km Stage 3 from Beersheba to Eilat, Israel - May 6, 2018 - Team Quick-Step rider Elia Viviani of Italy stands on the podium after the 3rd stage in Eilat, Israel. REUTERS/Nir Keidar\nThe Quick-Step Floors rider won a bunch sprint of a mainly flat 180-kilometre ride from Ferrara to finish ahead of Irishman Sam Bennett for his first win since his Israel brace.\n“After a few difficult days that is what I need and what the team needs because they worked hard today and they deserve it,” Viviani said.\nWith just two expected sprints remaining before the race finishes in Rome, Viviani leads Bora-Hansgrohe’s Bennett by 40 points.\nDutchman Danny van Poppel (LottoNL-Jumbo) took third place ahead of Italy’s Sacha Modolo (EF Education First-Drapac).\nBritain’s Simon Yates (Mitchelton-Scott) finished safely in the bunch to retain his 47-second advantage over defending champion Tom Dumoulin (Team Sunweb) in the overall standings.\nThe riders next face a climb up Monte Zoncolan in a 180-kilometre ride on Saturday.
