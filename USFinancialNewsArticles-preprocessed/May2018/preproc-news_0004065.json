In our hands is to finish third because we have one game more than Liverpool,” Pochettino told a news conference. “We need to win the three games but we have to wait for Manchester United to lose.\n“All can happen in football, which is why it is such an amazing sport.”\nChelsea are challenging Tottenham for a fourth-placed league finish but Pochettino is confident that his team can hold on as their fifth-placed rivals sit five points behind, having played a game more.\n“No, I wasn’t worried and I am not now. I am worried about being focused on performing better than Monday, to perform better and be sure that we are going to win the games ahead. That is my only worry,” he added.\nThe Argentine boss said that midfielder Mousa Dembele was a doubt for Saturday’s league trip to West Bromwich Albion due to an ankle injury.\nA win for Tottenham or a draw at the Hawthorns will ensure West Brom’s relegation to the Championship.
