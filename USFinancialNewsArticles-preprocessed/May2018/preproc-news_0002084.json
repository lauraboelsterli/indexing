    "text": "MELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Telidyne, Inc. (OTC: TLDN), a technology company, announced today that it is developing platforms for companies that are generating Mobile Apps services and operating systems to disrupt the ecommerce with Blockchain technology.\nTelidyne, Inc. is a technology company that it is developing platforms for disrupting the ecommerce using Blockchain technology with smart contracts and automated methods for international payment transfers. A blockchain is a distributed ledger and all the transactions that ever occurred on that blockchain are recorded and stored in a block of data. Once stored they can never be removed, and so the chain of blocks becomes longer with every transaction. All the data entered into the distributed ledger is protected by complex cryptography, which can easily be unwrapped when you have the key, but impossible to crack when you donâ€™t have it.\nThe Company received approval from FINRA for trading symbol TLDN on April 3, 2018.\nThe Company currently has 4,500,253 common shares outstanding with a public float of 500,253 shares.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties. Statements made herein are as of the date of this press release and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date.\nTelidyne Inc., 68 S. Service Rd., Melville, NY 11747, USA; Tel: (631) 293-6400\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502005975/en/\nTelidyne, Inc.\nInvestor relations: info@telidyne.com\nSource: Telidyne, Inc.",
