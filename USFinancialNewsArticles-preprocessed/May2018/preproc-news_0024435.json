    "text": "Scooter Gennett went 4-for-5 with a home run and three RBIs and Matt Harvey pitched four scoreless innings in his Cincinnati debut as the Reds recorded a 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night at Dodger Stadium.\nMay 11, 2018; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Cincinnati Reds second baseman Scooter Gennett (3) hits a single in the first inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports Tucker Barnhart and Joey Votto also had run-scoring hits as the Reds beat Los Angeles for the second straight night while winning their fourth game in a row.\nHarvey allowed one hit and struck out two before departing after 55 pitches in his first start since being acquired from the New York Mets for catcher Devin Mesoraco and cash.\nThe right-hander faced one batter over the minimum, and the lone hit was tainted as right fielder Scott Schebler was unable to locate Cody Bellinger’s sky-high fly to right-center field in the second inning. The ball dropped in for a triple between Schebler and center fielder Billy Hamilton. Harvey responded to the misfortune by striking out Chris Taylor and retiring Max Muncy on a liner to center.\nMets 3, Phillies 1\nMichael Conforto and Devin Mesoraco hit home runs on consecutive pitches in the ninth inning as New York stormed back to stun host Philadelphia.\nThe Phillies were two outs away from extending their winning streak to five — and possibly moving into first place in the National League East for the first time since the final day of the 2011 season — when Wilmer Flores singled off Hector Neris (1-3).\nConforto hit an 0-1 pitch barely foul into the right field seats but left no doubt two pitches later, when he blasted a two-run homer off the advertising signage along the second deck in right field. Mesoraco followed with his first hit for the Mets, who scored as many runs on two pitches as they had in the previous 31 innings.\nBlue Jays 5, Red Sox 3 (12 innings)\nLuke Maile hit his first two home runs of the season, including a two-run walkoff shot, as Toronto beat visiting Boston despite 15 strikeouts in nine strong innings from Red Sox ace Chris Sale.\nMaile also had an RBI single in addition to his first career multi-homer game in the opener of a three-game series, with his game-winner coming against left-hander Brian Johnson (1-2) after Curtis Granderson led off the 12th with a walk.\nSam Gaviglio (1-0), just recalled from Triple-A Buffalo, allowed one hit over three scoreless relief innings to earn the win. Xander Bogaerts homered for Boston.\nBrewers 11, Rockies 10 (10 innings)\nTravis Shaw drove in Lorenzo Cain with a two-out single in the top of the 10th inning, and visiting Milwaukee rallied from six down to beat Colorado.\nShaw also homered among his three hits, Manny Pina tied it with a two-run homer in the ninth and Cain finished with three hits for the Brewers. Trevor Story drove in four runs, Gerardo Parra had four hits and Carlos Gonzalez and Chris Iannetta homered for the Rockies, who fell to 6-10 at home this season. The teams combined for 33 hits.\nCain reached on a one-out single off Rockies reliever Jake McGee (0-2) in the 10th, Tyler Saladino had a two-out single and Shaw followed with a single to center to put Milwaukee ahead. Josh Hader got the heart of the Rockies order in the bottom of the 10th to earn his sixth save. Jeremy Jeffress (3-0) worked the ninth for the win.\nCubs 11, White Sox 2\nWillson Contreras hit a pair of home runs, including a grand slam to highlight a big first inning, and the hot-hitting Cubs rolled over their visiting crosstown rival.\nContreras hit his fourth and fifth home runs of the season and had two doubles, giving him seven extra-base hits in his last two games. He finished with a career-high seven RBIs as the White Sox lost their sixth in a row and 10th of 11.\nKris Bryant hit a solo home run, and Anthony Rizzo had an RBI single for the Cubs, who have won four in a row. They are averaging more than 10 runs a game in the first four games of the current homestand. Bryant went 2-for-3 with two RBIs and three runs scored. The Cubs had 15 hits.\nMay 11, 2018; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Cincinnati Reds left fielder Adam Duvall (23) catches a hit off Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Max Muncy (13) for the final out of the game at Dodger Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports Nationals 3, Diamondbacks 1\nMax Scherzer went seven innings for his major league-leading seventh victory and Trea Turner and Anthony Rendon homered as Washington beat host Arizona.\nScherzer (7-1) gave up four hits and one run, and he retired the final 15 he faced after David Peralta homered to lead off the third inning. Scherzer struck out 11 and did not walk a batter as the Nationals won for the 11th time in 13 games.\nThe Diamondbacks have lost three in a row and six of nine and are in danger of losing their first series of the season after dropping the first two games of this four-game set. They are 10-0-2 in series.\nRangers 1, Astros 0\nCole Hamels threw six shutout innings, and Texas contributed to Houston’s ongoing scoring difficulties at home as three Rangers relievers clamped down on the defending World Series champions.\nHamels (2-4) had been winless over his six previous starts yet befuddled the Astros, allowing just one hit while recording five strikeouts with three walks. He also hit two batters, but Houston failed to build a consistent threat, continuing a recent theme.\nThe Astros suffered their fourth shutout loss of the season, with each coming at home. Houston wasted a good start from Justin Verlander (4-2), who carried a shutout into the seventh but allowed a leadoff double to Nomar Mazara and then walked Adrian Beltre and Joey Gallo. Right-hander Chris Devenski came on to face Jurickson Profar, who hit a sacrifice fly to left to score Mazara.\nTwins 5, Angels 4\nMinnesota scored three runs in the ninth inning, rallying from a 4-2 deficit to upend host Los Angeles.\nThe Angels went into the ninth inning with a lead thanks mostly to a two-run homer by Justin Upton and six strong innings from starter Tyler Skaggs, but the bullpen couldn’t hold on.\nThe Twins scored their first run of the inning on a solo home run by Eddie Rosario, his second homer of the game. Logan Morrison doubled with one out, and after an intentional walk to Max Kepler, Justin Anderson (0-1) was replaced by Jim Johnson. Pinch hitter Mitch Garver slapped an RBI single to right field, tying the game at 4-4. Catcher Bobby Wilson followed with a sacrifice fly to put Minnesota up 5-4 before Johnson could get out of the inning.\nAthletics 10, Yankees 5\nDustin Fowler recorded his first major league hit while Khris Davis and Matt Chapman hit long homers off former teammate Sonny Gray as visiting Oakland beat New York, sending the Yankees to consecutive losses for the first time since April 8-10.\nFowler was among three prospects traded to the Athletics for Gray and was recovering from a ruptured patella tendon in his right knee following a scary collision on June 29 while playing for the Yankees in a game against the Chicago White Sox.\nFowler’s first career hit occurred after Davis and Chapman homered in a span of seven pitches off Gray (2-3).\nPirates 11, Giants 2\nStarling Marte, Jose Osuna, Josh Bell and Max Moroff hit home runs as Pittsburgh won its fourth straight game, hammering visiting San Francisco on former Pirates star outfielder Andrew McCutchen’s return to PNC Park.\nSlideshow (11 Images) Marte and Jordy Mercer each had three hits for the Pirates, who had 15 in all. The Giants lost their fifth game in a row.\nMcCutchen, who was traded to San Francisco in January, got several ovations and video tributes and finished 1-for-5, with his one-out double in the seventh extending his streak of getting on base to 21 games but not figuring in the scoring.\nRoyals 10, Indians 9\nSalvador Perez ripped a two-run home run in the seventh inning off Cleveland reliever Andrew Miller to cap Kansas City’s wild come-from-behind victory in the first of a three-game series.\nMiller, who had been activated from the disabled list earlier in the day, had allowed only one earned run in 45 appearances against teams from the American League Central division since the Indians acquired him at the 2016 trade deadline.\nPerez doubled that with one swing of the bat. Brad Keller (1-1), the fourth of five Kansas City pitchers, earned the win with three shutout innings, allowing two hits and a walk. Kelvin Herrera hurled a perfect ninth for his eighth save of the year.\nMarlins 6, Braves 3\nJ.T. Realmuto and Starlin Castro homered to lead Miami over visiting Atlanta as the Marlins snapped a four-game losing streak.\nDan Straily (1-0), who started the season on the disabled list, won his first game of the year. It was his third start of the season, and he allowed three hits, three walks and three runs, two earned. He struck out five and went past four innings for the first time this season.\nBrandon McCarthy (4-2) took the loss as Atlanta’s three-game win streak was snapped. Atlanta’s eight-game road win streak also ended.\nOrioles 9, Rays 4\nManny Machado hit two home runs, including a grand slam, and drove in six runs as Baltimore ripped visiting Tampa Bay, giving the Orioles their first three-game winning streak of the season.\nMachado hit a two-run homer in the first and his grand slam in the seventh off Ryne Stanek. The shortstop has three homers in his past two games, and the grand slam was the 150th homer of his career, making the 25-year old the youngest Oriole to reach that milestone.\nOrioles starter Kevin Gausman (3-2) went 7 1/3 innings and gave up two runs while scattering 11 hits. He was backed up by four home runs.\nCardinals 9, Padres 5\nPaul DeJong’s three-run homer in the second off left-hander Eric Lauer was the first of five home runs hit by visiting St. Louis in a rout of San Diego.\nFour of the home runs came against Lauer in 2 1/3 innings. In the third inning, Harrison Bader, Marcell Ozuna and Jedd Gyorko all went deep off the rookie. Lauer (1-2) allowed six runs on seven hits (including the four home runs) and a walk.\nDeJong got his career-high fourth RBI in the fifth with a run-scoring single against Bryan Mitchell, who was making his first appearance out of the Padres bullpen after losing his spot in the rotation. Tommy Pham made it 9-0 in the sixth with a two-run homer off Mitchell.\nTigers-Mariners, ppd.\nThe contest between the host Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners was postponed due to rain and will be made up as part of a doubleheader Saturday, with the first game beginning at 4:10 p.m. ET and the second game starting approximately 30 minutes after the conclusion of Game 1.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
