    "text": "Grom To Introduce Original Preschool Brand For Animated Series Production And Consumer Product Licensing to Expand is User Base and Potential Revenue Opportunities\nBoca Raton, FL., May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grom Social Enterprises (OTCQB: GRMM) (\"Grom\" or the \"Company\"), an innovative leader and pioneer in providing original social media content to children between the ages of five and 16,www.gromsocial.com ; today announced that it had acquired the preschool entertainment and consumer products brand “ Bonnie Boat & Friends”(“Bonnie Boat”). The Company intends to distribute Bonnie Boat’s short features through its existing platform of millions of users, to gain worldwide appeal which it believes will lead to licensing and merchandising opportunities.\nGrom will work closely with its wholly-owned animation subsidiary, Top Draw Animation (“Top Draw”), for enhancements in the production of the Bonnie Boat & Friends animated series. The brand will also appear in the Company’s centerpiece Grom Social website as an ecology educational tool for growing children. Top Draw, an award-winning animation company has a track record as an industry leader having produced content for such high-profile properties such as Tom and Jerry, My Little Pony, and Disney Animation’s Penn Zero.\n“Bonnie Boat is an ideal acquisition for us. We have built our company to be able to capitalize on this type of opportunity. We believe having original content that appeals to a younger audience (3-7) gives us instant access to a new and trending larger demographic, and extends the user life of our children. Not only does Bonnie Boat add to our growing portfolio of content and unique apps such as MamaBear and Fyoosion, it also demonstrates our ability to move quickly and to produce this type of high-quality content from expertise and talent that we have within our company, instead of having to rely on third parties. We are very excited to bring Bonnie Boat & Friends aboard and prepare the brand for a global launch. In keeping with the Grom tradition of teaching kids how to be “good digital citizens”, Bonnie Boat teaches children to respect the environment at an early age,” said Darren Marks, Chief Executive Officer of Grom Enterprises, Inc.\nAbout Grom Social Enterprises, Inc.\nGrom Social Enterprises, Inc. owns five separate subsidiaries, including Grom Social, a safe social media platform for kids between the ages of five and 16. Since its beginnings in 2012, Grom Social has attracted kids and parents with the promise of a safe and secure environment where their kids can be entertained and can interact with their peers while learning good digital citizenship. The Company also owns and operates Top Draw Animation, Inc., an award-winning animation company which produces animated content for Grom Social and other high-profile media properties such as Tom and Jerry, My Little Pony and Disney Animation's Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero. In addition, Grom Educational Services provides web filtering services up to an additional two million children across 3,700 schools and libraries, and Grom Nutritional Services is in the process of creating a line of healthy nutritional supplements for children.
