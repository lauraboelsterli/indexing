    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 11:01 AM / Updated 5 hours ago Avon first-quarter results largely in line with estimates Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Avon Products Inc’s ( AVP.N ) first-quarter results were roughly in line with analysts’ estimates and the cosmetics maker reported a drop in the number of its door-to-door saleswomen, known as “Avon Ladies.”\nThe ‘Little Black Dress’ perfume maker’s number of active representatives declined 4 percent for the quarter ended March 31, largely due to declines in Brazil.\n“Avon’s first-quarter results were unsatisfactory and do not represent the underlying potential of the business,” Chief Executive Jan Zijderveld said in a statement.\nSales were flat in Latin America, where active representatives declined 6 percent, but were offset by growth in its markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa.\nNet loss attributable to the company narrowed to $20.3 million, or 6 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from a loss of $36.5 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Avon reported a loss of 2 cents, in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose to $1.39 billion, edging past the average estimate of $1.35 billion.\n(This story has been corrected to remove analysts’ estimate for sales in last paragraph as the figure is not comparable with reported net sales) Reporting by Jaslein Mahil; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri",
