    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Williams replaced head of aerodynamics Dirk De Beer on Wednesday after a troubled start to the Formula One season that has left the former champions languishing in last place with only four points from six races.\nThe team, who have the same engines as championship leaders Mercedes, said in a statement the South African had stepped down with immediate effect.\nDave Wheater has been handed De Beer’s title, while chief engineer Doug McKiernan assumes responsibility over the aerodynamic and design direction of the car.\nDe Beer’s departure followed that of chief designer Ed Wood, who left earlier in May for personal reasons.\nThis year’s FW41 car has disappointed in the hands of Canadian teenager Lance Stroll and Russian rookie Sergey Sirotkin.\nThe car had been presented in February with technical head Paddy Lowe saying the team had “pursued a very different aerodynamic concept which has allowed us some significant progress in aerodynamic performance”.\nHowever Williams failed to score a point until Stroll finished eighth in Azerbaijan at the end of April, and that remains the only race in which they have scored.\nStroll finished two laps down and last of those classified in Monaco at the weekend, while Sirotkin was one place ahead of the Canadian in 16th.\nDe Beer joined from Ferrari last year and was previously at Sauber, Renault and Lotus.\nMcKiernan joined from McLaren, where he was head of aerodynamics, earlier this year.\nWilliams were the only team other than Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull to have a driver on the podium last year, with Stroll third in Azerbaijan, but have not won a race since 2012.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by David Holmes\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
