    "text": "EAST AURORA, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Astronics Corporation (NASDAQ:ATRO), a leading supplier of advanced technologies and products to the global aerospace, defense, and semiconductor industries, today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Results include the acquisition of Custom Control Concepts (“CCC”) on April 3, 2017 and Telefonix PDT on December 1, 2017 (collectively, the \"Acquired Businesses\").\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nApril 1, 2017\n% Change\nSales $ 179,059 $ 152,396 17.5 % Gross profit $ 37,132 $ 38,317 (3.1 )% Gross margin 20.7 % 25.1 % SG&A $ 30,500 $ 21,383 42.6 % SG&A percent of sales 17.0 % 14.0 % Income from Operations $ 6,632 $ 16,934 (60.8 )% Operating margin % 3.7 % 11.1 % Net Income $ 3,294 $ 11,587 (71.6 )% Net Income % 1.8 % 7.6 % Peter J. Gundermann, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"While we had a strong quarter of sales and bookings, margins were impacted by a number of items. We had strong revenue, recording our highest quarterly sales level in more than two years. Bookings were strong as well, reinforcing our expectation for solid growth in 2018. Enhanced by our acquisitions, our Aerospace segment, in particular, set new records for quarterly revenue, bookings and backlog, all of which point to a strong near-term future for our business.”\nHe continued, “Margins were weak for a number of reasons, in part due to a particularly slow quarter for our Test segment, which was the result of program timing. There were also a number of acquisition-related items impacting margin, including increased amortization of intangibles and inventory step-up expenses. Other costs in the quarter included an increased loss reserve related to a revised estimate to complete one particular job and the recording of a legal reserve related to a long-term dispute we have been litigating for the last several years. Most of these expenses are expected to decrease or not recur in coming quarters.”\n“All in all, we feel our first quarter was a decent start to the year. We expect our sales growth momentum to continue in the coming quarters, with revenue increasing to approximately\n$200 million in the second quarter and then climbing again in the final two quarters of the year. The increased revenue, combined with a drop in acquisition-related and other unusual expenses that affected our first quarter, will drive improved operating margins considerably in the coming quarters.”\nConsolidated Review\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nConsolidated sales were up $26.7 million from the same period last year. Aerospace segment sales of $164.6 million were up $27.8 million and Test Systems segment sales of $14.5 million were down $1.1 million. Organic revenue was $154.0 million, up 1% compared with the same prior year period. The 2018 first quarter included $25.1 million in sales from the Acquired Businesses all in the Aerospace segment.\nConsolidated gross margin was 20.7% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 25.1% in the first quarter of 2017. Consolidated gross margin was negatively impacted by several expenses that are expected to decrease or not recur through the remainder of 2018, including $1.3 million in expense related to the fair value step-up of inventory from the Acquired Businesses, which is now fully expensed. Another factor impacting gross margin in the quarter was a program charge of $2.1 million recognized due to the revision of estimated costs to complete a long-term contract assumed with the acquisition of the CCC business. Gross margin was impacted as well by the change in product mix, higher organic Engineering and Development (\"E&D\") costs and market pricing pressures primarily relating to cabin power.\nOrganic E&D costs were $24.3 million in the quarter, compared with $22.9 million in last year’s first quarter. As a percent of organic sales, organic E&D costs were 15.8% and 15.0% in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Acquired Businesses incurred E&D costs of $4.6 million in the first quarter, which equates to 18.3% of acquired revenue.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were up $9.1 million to $30.5 million, or 17.0% of sales, in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $21.4 million, or 14.0% of sales, in the same period last year. Acquired Businesses contributed $7.1 million to SG&A, including\n$3.4 million of intangible asset amortization expense. Also contributing to higher SG&A was a\n$1.0 million litigation reserve recorded during the quarter for an ongoing matter. Corporate expenses increased by $1.5 million due to increased headcount, legal and accounting costs.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.1%, compared with 25.2% in the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 first quarter tax rate was favorably impacted by the decrease in the Federal statutory tax rate partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet income was $3.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared with $11.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share in the prior year.\nBookings were strong at $196.2 million, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.10:1. The Company ended the first quarter with record backlog of $398.6 million. Approximately 89% of backlog is expected to ship in 2018.\nAerospace Segment Review (refer to sales by market and segment data in accompanying tables)\nAerospace First Quarter 2018 Results\nAerospace segment sales increased by $27.8 million, or 20.3%, when compared with the prior year’s first quarter, to $164.6 million. The Acquired Businesses contributed $25.1 million in sales in the 2018 first quarter. Organic sales increased $2.7 million, or 2%.\nAvionics sales were up $23.9 million, due to the addition of the Acquired Businesses, which contributed $22.5 million, coupled with an organic increase in antenna sales. System Certification sales increased by $2.6 million on higher project activity. Sales of other products were up $2.4 million, due primarily to the Acquired Businesses. These increases were offset by a decrease in Lighting & Safety sales of $1.0 million.\nAerospace operating profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $13.1 million, or 8.0% of sales, compared with $19.8 million, or 14.4% of sales, in the same period last year. Organic Aerospace E&D costs were $21.3 million compared with $20.3 million in the same period last year. The Acquired Businesses incurred E&D costs of $4.6 million during the quarter.\nAerospace operating profit was negatively impacted by several expenses that are expected to decrease or not recur through the remainder of 2018. As is typical during the first few quarters following an acquisition, non-cash costs were higher than what is expected over the long-term, as short-lived intangible assets are amortized and the fair value step-up costs relating to the acquired inventory is expensed. Intangible asset amortization expense for the Acquired Businesses was $3.4 million in the first quarter and fair value inventory step-up expense was $1.3 million. The inventory step-up was fully expensed in the quarter and intangible asset amortization expense related to the Acquired Businesses is expected to decline to $2.2 million in the second quarter and settle at a run rate of $1.6 million beginning in the third quarter of this year.\nAnother factor impacting operating profit in the quarter was the program charge of $2.1 million and the $1.0 million litigation reserve, as discussed above. Operating margin was also negatively impacted by change in product mix, coupled with market pricing pressures primarily relating to cabin power.\nAerospace orders in the first quarter of 2018 were up 47% to $180.9 million compared with the prior year period, and up 1% compared with the trailing fourth quarter of 2017. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.10:1 for the quarter. Backlog was $306.0 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018, up from $298.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nMr. Gundermann commented, “Our Aerospace segment had a solid start to the year, with record sales, bookings, and quarter-end backlog. We expect revenue in coming quarters to increase even higher, especially in the second half of the year. We also expect margin improvement, driven by the leverage gained from higher sales as well as the expected reduction of the one-time expenses of the first quarter, including acquisition-related inventory step-up and amortization expenses, the program charge and the litigation reserve.”\nHe continued: “Importantly, we are making progress with our three operations facing temporary challenges: AeroSat, CCC, and Armstrong. In the fourth quarter of 2017, these three collectively produced an operating loss of $27.3 million, including the goodwill impairment at Armstrong of $16.2 million. In the 2018 first quarter, their combined loss was reduced to $8.9 million, which included the $2.1 million loss associated with the CCC program charge. We are expecting the loss to be reduced by about half in the second quarter. Collectively, these three operations are making substantial progress.”\n“This improvement, combined with expected revenue growth, will drive substantial margin improvement for the Company.”\nTest Systems Segment Review (refer to sales by market and segment data in accompanying tables)\nTest Systems First Quarter 2018 Results\nSales in the first quarter of 2018 decreased approximately $1.1 million to $14.5 million compared with the same period in 2017, a decrease of 7.1%. A $2.4 million increase in sales to the Semiconductor market was offset by a $3.5 million decrease in sales to the Aerospace & Defense market when compared with the prior-year period.\nThe operating loss was $1.9 million compared with $0.3 million in operating profit, or 2.0% of sales, in last year’s first quarter. The lower margin was driven by an unfavorable sales mix compared with the same period last year. E&D costs were $3.0 million, up from $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOrders for the Test Systems segment in the quarter were $15.3 million, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06:1 for the quarter. Backlog was $92.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018, down from $95.1 million at the end of 2017.\nMr. Gundermann said, “Our Test segment had a difficult first quarter due primarily to customer timing. However, our backlog of firm, scheduled deliveries is strong and we feel we are on track to achieve our expectations for the year. In fact, we expect revenue to more than double in the second quarter and remain strong through the second half of the year.”\n2018 Outlook\nConsolidated sales in 2018 are forecasted to be in the range of $765 million to $815 million, with $650 million to $680 million expected from the Aerospace segment and $115 million to $135 million from the Test segment.\nConsolidated backlog at March 31, 2018 was $398.6 million, up from $393.7 million. Approximately $356.1 million of backlog is expected to ship in 2018.\nThe effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be in the range of 18% to 21%.\nExpectations for capital equipment spending in 2018 are unchanged from a range of $24 million to $28 million.\nE&D costs for 2018 continue to be expected in the range of $110 million to $115 million.\nMr. Gundermann commented, \"We expect the year to strengthen progressively. Our second quarter should see revenue of approximately $200 million, with operating profits more than double those of the first quarter. The second half of the year will see quarterly revenue climb even higher and we expect to reestablish operating margins in the mid-teens by year-end.”\n“The first quarter was not all that we hoped for, but demand remains strong, and we feel we are on track for the year we expected.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Webcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will host a teleconference today at 11:00 a.m. ET.
