Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy speaks during a news conference with Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov (not pictured) in Sofia, Bulgaria, May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov\nThe Spanish government on Monday recognised the powers of newly-elected Catalan leader Quim Torra but failed to ratify his chosen administration, official documents showed, meaning Madrid will continue to impose direct rule on the northeastern region.\nFervent separatist Torra, who has said he wants to recreate the administration that declared independence from Spain in October, put forward on Saturday four men as councillors who are either being held in custody or living in self-imposed exile.
