    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 3:25 PM / a minute ago Louis Dreyfus completes $466 million sale of metals unit to Chinese fund Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nPARIS (Reuters) - Louis Dreyfus Company [AKIRAU.UL] said on Friday it had completed the sale of its metals business to a Chinese investment fund for $466 million, as part of a push to revive profits by focusing on its core agricultural markets.\nLouis Dreyfus announced in December an agreement to sell LDC Metals to NCCL Natural Resources Investment Fund, without disclosing financial details.\nThe metals business is one of the largest copper, zinc and lead concentrates merchants worldwide, according to Louis Dreyfus, and has been one of the group’s most profitable activities in recent years.\nA new name for the business would be announced soon, Paul Akroyd, chief executive of LDC Metals, said in a statement issued by Louis Dreyfus.\nThe divestment of LDC Metals attracted interest from several potential buyers including mining giant Anglo American ( AAL.L ), sources said last year.\nThe sale price of $466 million compares with a book value of $314 million as of 2016, according to company filings.\nExcluding the metals unit, Louis Dreyfus’ annual results showed underlying profits steadied in 2017 after two years of decline but net profit from continuing operations fell to $224 million from $266 million in 2016.\nNCCL Natural Resources Investment Fund is managed by New China Capital Legend as general partner and has AXAM Asset Management and China Molybdenum Co., Ltd ( 603993.SS ) as limited partners.\nChina Molybdenum is one of China’s largest producers of molybdenum, a mineral used in metal alloys, and it announced last November plans to set up a natural resources fund worth $1 billion with New China Capital Legend.\nLouis Dreyfus has also sold part of its fertilizer operations and is looking for partners to invest in its juice and dairy activities, as it bets on a closer focus on core markets like grains and oilseeds.\nThe 167-year-old family firm, controlled by Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, is the “D” of the so-called ABCD quartet of global agricultural commodity traders alongside Archer Daniels Midland ( ADM.N ), Bunge ( BG.N ) and Cargill [CARG.UL].\nThe global firms have been reorganising operations in response to declining profits in traditional grain trading after several years of ample supply of staple crops.
