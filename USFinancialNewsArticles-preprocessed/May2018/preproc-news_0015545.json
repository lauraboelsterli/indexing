    "text": "(Adds background on one-off charges, CEO comment)\nMay 7 (Reuters) - Australia’s Orica Ltd, the world’s top supplier of commercial explosives, said on Monday its first-half underlying profit fell 37 percent, as unplanned plant shutdowns and bad weather crimped production.\nUnderlying profit, a measure of earnings that excludes one-off gains and losses, fell to A$123.6 million ($93.1 million) for the six months to March from A$195.2 million a year ago.\nOrica flagged in March that its first-half earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) would take a hit from factors including maintenance work at its Yarwun and Kooragang Island plants in Australia, severe winter weather that disrupted mines in North America, and construction issues at its Burrup plant.\nIncluding significant items, the company reported a statutory net loss after tax of A$229.3 million, compared with a profit of A$195.2 million last year.\n“We remain positive that the majority of headwinds are behind us and we can capitalise on the improved outlook for volume demand and firmer pricing,” said Chief Executive Alberto Calderon.\nIn Australia, Pacific and Asia, Orica’s largest region, volumes rose by 10 percent.\nHowever, the company said performance at Burrup remained “uncertain” pending a permanent fix.\nOrica declared an interim dividend of 20 Australian cents per share, down from 23.5 cents a year earlier.\nThe company is set to benefit from two recent contract wins, snatched from its rival Incitec Pivot Ltd, to supply ammonium nitrate to the Roy Hill iron ore mine and BHP Billiton in Western Australia.\nAmmonium nitrate volumes rose 3 percent to 1.83 million tonnes.
