REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman With the game’s sites through 2022 already awarded, the league will name Arizona as the host for Super Bowl LVII in 2023 and New Orleans as the host the following year, according to the SportsBusiness Journal.\nThat would make for the fourth time a Super Bowl has been hosted in Arizona and a league-high 11th time for New Orleans. Miami, which will host the Super Bowl after the 2019 season, will also have hosted the game 11 times.\nAtlanta is the site of next season’s Super Bowl LIII, which will showcase the team’s new Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The aforementioned game in Miami is up next, followed by Tampa Bay and Los Angeles. The game in L.A. will be played in the stadium being built for the Rams and Chargers to share.\nA dust storm surrounds high rise buildings in Phoenix, Arizona August 18, 2011. REUTERS/Joshua Lott The NFL will also end the process of potential host cities bidding to win the league’s approval. Instead, the league will ask cities if they would like to host the game, while giving special merit to locations that have new stadiums.\nThe owners meetings run Monday through Wednesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
