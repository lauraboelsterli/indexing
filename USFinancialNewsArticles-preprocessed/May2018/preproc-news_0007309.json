    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 11:13 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago UPDATE 1-AmerisourceBergen profit falls on low PharMEDium sales Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Adds details)\nMay 2 (Reuters) - AmerisourceBergen Corp on Wednesday reported a 30 percent fall in quarterly profit hurt by lower revenues from its PharMEDium unit.\nThe drug distributor now sees 2018 full year adjusted profit at the lower end of its prior forecast of between $6.45 to $6.65 per share, reflecting underperformance at its unit.\nAmerisourceBergen has repeatedly been rapped on the knuckles by regulators and state authorities who have cited violations and raised public health concerns relating to facilities in its PharMEDium business.\nOperations at a key plant in Memphis, Tennessee, that produced around half the compounded drugs the company supplied, remain suspended.\nThe companyâ€™s pharmaceutical distribution services unit, its largest by revenue, brought in a revenue of $39.5 billion in the quarter ahead of estimates of $39.17 billion.\nExcluding items the company earned $1.94 per share.\nAnalysts on average were expecting $1.82 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet income fell to $287.5 million, or $1.29 per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $411.5 million, or $1.86 per share, a year ago.\nRevenue rose 10.5 percent to $41.03 billion.
