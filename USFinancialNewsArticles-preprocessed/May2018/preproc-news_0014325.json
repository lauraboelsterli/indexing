    "text": "* Eyes on U.S. China trade talks\n* U.S. dollar higher despite jobs data\n* Oil prices rise (Updates with oil prices settlements)\nNEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped more than 1 percent on Friday, helped by Apple and other technology shares and by data that showed weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs and wage growth, while U.S. oil prices hit their highest in more than three years.\nApple shares rose after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the iPhone maker.\nThe Labor Department's closely watched report showed non-farm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent. However, wages edged up only 0.1 percent, easing concerns that inflation pressures were increasing.\nThat bolstered investor views that the pace of U.S. rate hikes will be gradual.\n\"If people were worried about a faster pace of hike, this report should calm those ... The curve will likely resume its flattening bias in the long term, but it wont invert in the foreseeable future,\" said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research in New York.\nThe U.S. central bank on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged and said it expected annual inflation to run close to its \"symmetric\" 2 percent target over the medium term.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 344.7 points, or 1.44 percent, to 24,274.85, the S&P 500 gained 35.28 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,665.01 and the Nasdaq Composite added 127.52 points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,215.68.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.66 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.86 percent.\nOil prices rose as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran.\nU.S. crude rose $1.29 to settle at $69.72 a barrel while Brent gained $1.25 to $74.87.\nThe U.S. dollar leaped to its highest levels this year against a basket of currencies despite disappointing U.S. employment data for April, before dropping back to trade little changed.\nThe dollar index rose 0.22 percent, with the euro down 0.28 percent to $1.1953.\nThe dollar has gained as investors bet that the Fed will continue raising rates while other central banks, including the European Central Bank, will act more slowly.\nWhile the Fed is seen raising interest rates at least two more times this year, expectations of policy tightening from the ECB and the Bank of England are receding.\nThat has driven the difference between German and U.S. government bond yields to near the highest in nearly three decades, with the short-dated and long-dated \"transatlantic spread\" standing at 305 and 240 basis points respectively.\nU.S. Treasury yields were little changed after dropping to multi-week lows, supported by U.S. equity gains.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last /32 in price to yield 2.9459 percent, from 2.946 percent late on Thursday.\n(Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Karen Brettell in New York and Ritvik Carvalho in London; Editing by Jane Merriman and Dan Grebler)",
