    "text": "Sonny Gray pitched six effective innings as the New York Yankees capitalized on two errors by shortstop Francisco Lindor and recorded a 5-2 victory over the Cleveland Indians Saturday afternoon at Yankee Stadium.\nGray (2-2) allowed two runs and four hits in a 93-pitch outing. It was the first time since joining the Yankees in a trade from Oakland on July 31 the right-hander pitched at least six innings and allowed two runs or less.\nGray was in line for another tough-luck loss until the Yankees rallied in the fifth. Five days after being on the losing end of a 2-1 decision to Charlie Morton in Houston, Gray watched as his teammates struggled against Trevor Bauer (2-3).\nBauer retired the first 13 hitters before walking Neil Walker and Miguel Andujar. He lost his no-hit bid when Gleyber Torres singled and the lead when Austin Romine drew a bases-loaded walk.\nAfter Torres ended Bauer’s no-hit bid, Ronald Torreyes hit a ground ball towards Lindor. Lindor booted the ball for his first error and was charged with a throwing error when the throw to third baseman Jose Ramirez went wide.\nThe errors allowed Torres and Andujar to score, giving the Yankees a 3-1 lead. New York then took a 4-1 lead on a sacrifice fly to left field by Brett Gardner.\nGardner also added an RBI single in the seventh.\nChad Green struck out four in two scoreless innings and David Robertson fanned two in the ninth for his first save.\nBeing able to get to Bauer in the fifth enabled the Yankees to win their fifth straight and 14th in 15 games. At 23-10, they are off to their best start since 2003.\nLindor homered in the top of the fifth off Gray and Edwin Encarnacion drove in the other run with a groundout.\nBauer allowed four runs (two earned) and two hits in six innings.\nThe Indians also lost center fielder Bradley Zimmer in the seventh due to a violent collision with the fence. Attempting to track down Romine’s double, Zimmer hit his head and shoulder on the fence and fell to the warning track before exiting the game.\nLindor made it 1-0 by driving Gray’s full-count fastball 419 feet into the right-field seats with two outs in the fifth before it unraveled for the Indians.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
