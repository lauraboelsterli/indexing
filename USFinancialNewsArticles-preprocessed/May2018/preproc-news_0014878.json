    "text": "HOUSTON, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Salient Midstream & MLP Fund (the \"Fund\") (NYSE: SMM) today announced a dividend of $0.171 per share for the second quarter ending May 31, 2018.\nAt the close of business on April 30, 2018, the Fund's total assets were $257.6 million and the Net Asset Value (NAV) per share was $10.68. On April 30, 2018, the closing share price of the Fund was $10.05, which was trading at a 5.9% discount to the NAV. 1 For the month ending April 30, 2018 the Fund's yield was 9.7% 2 while the Fund's NAV and market price total returns were 9.7% and 10.4%, respectively, compared to 8.1% for the Alerian MLP Index. 3\nAcross the Master Limited Partnership (MLP) and midstream industry, many companies have announced plans to simplify their corporate structure and funding models. Several management teams are taking steps to reduce their cost of capital by removing incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and reducing dividend or distribution payments in order to internally fund capital expenditures for the company rather than issuing more equity at depressed prices. 4 Management teams are looking to create value for shareholders by reducing debt, improving their credit rating, and funding growth capital via internally generated cash flow versus the old model of more frequent equity issuances.\nThe Fund's private equity investment in EMG Utica I Offshore Co-Investment, L.P., continues to perform in line with expectations and is now distributing cash to the Fund. While we do not ultimately control the timing, we expect to monetize this asset at some point over the next few years and redeploy the cash proceeds into income generating midstream securities, which we believe should help support future dividend growth for the Fund.\nAs a result of recent distribution and dividend cuts by some of the Fund's holdings, as well as announced strategic consolidations, mergers and other strategic initiatives relating to various company goals discussed above, the Fund has elected to reduce its quarterly dividend from $0.244 per share to $0.171 per share.\nThe Fund's second quarter dividend will be payable on May 30, 2018 to common stockholders of record on May 17, 2018. It is anticipated that this dividend will be a combination of return of capital and ordinary income for tax purposes. The final tax status of the dividend may differ substantially from this preliminary information, and the final determination of such amount will be made in early 2019 when the Fund can determine its earnings and profits for the 2018 fiscal year.\nThe Fund's quarterly dividends per share over the past year are shown below: 5\nAmount\nPayable Date\nEx-Date\nRecord Date\n$0.171\nMay 30, 2018\nMay 16, 2018\nMay 17, 2018\n$0.244\nFebruary 27, 2018\nFebruary 14, 2018\nFebruary 15, 2018\n$0.244\nNovember 29, 2017\nNovember 16, 2017\nNovember 17, 2017\n$0.244\nAugust 31, 2017\nAugust 16, 2017\nAugust 18, 2017\n$0.244\nMay 31, 2017\nMay 17, 2017\nMay 19, 2017\nPast performance is not indicative of future results.\nThe Fund distributions are comprised of distributable cash flow generated from its portfolio investments plus any realized capital gains.
