    "text": "74 COMMENTS The most important international problem confronting the Trump administration isn’t in North Korea or Iran. Instead, it lies in the rapidly multiplying challenges posed by China.\nEvents of recent days have underscored that a global tug of war between the U.S. and China is now fully on. Indeed, it has become the dominant feature on the global landscape, and figures to stay that way for a long while.\nIn short, welcome to the future.\nThe newest challenges from China are military ones. The Pentagon last week disinvited China from participating in a set of military exercises in the Pacific to protest the way the Chinese have broken their promise not to militarize the disputed Spratley Islands. Those islands lie some 500 miles away from the Chinese mainland, nicely illustrating how China is extending its reach.\nAs if to underscore its unhappiness, the U.S. over the weekend sent two warships into waters near another set of disputed South China Sea islands, the Paracels, where the Chinese also have been flexing their military muscles. In response, China said it had dispatched its own warships to challenge the U.S. vessels—or, as the Chinese put it in a statement, “to drive them away.”\nRelated\nU.S. Puts New Korea Sanctions on Hold U.S. Sanctions Target North Korea’s Vast Finance Network U.S., North Korea Meet to Try to Salvage Summit Other challenges are diplomatic. It appears China was at least partly responsible for the more belligerent tone North Korea struck last week in the run-up to a planned summit meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump. North Korea’s attitude became noticeably more blustery after Mr. Kim met with Chinese President Xi Jinping . It’s a reasonable guess that the Chinese leader warned his young and highly dependent North Korean counterpart against moving too far or too fast in deal-making with the U.S.\nThe resulting North Korean bluster prompted Mr. Trump to cancel the summit meeting , briefly. The summit now appears to be back on track , but the Chinese have made their point: They aren’t to be left on the sidelines when the U.S. deals with their southern neighbor and supplicant. They will demand a seat at the table. Thus, if the Trump-Kim summit produces a new round of follow-on diplomacy, look for it to take the form of four-sided talks involving the U.S., North Korea, South Korea—and China.\nMany China-related challenges are economic. In the wake of Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon the nuclear deal with Iran , the Chinese are maneuvering to take advantage of business opportunities that now may arise as the Trump administration pressures European firms to back away from Iran or face new economic sanctions imposed by the U.S.\nAlready, two big Chinese state-owned energy companies are positioning themselves to take over big oil and natural-gas deals being negotiated by European companies. In the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Iran may well be tempted to turn to the east rather than the west for economic development. China will be there to oblige.\nAtop all those challenges lies the most obvious one, the rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing . The trade skirmishes are still unfolding, and their outcome uncertain, but the Chinese so far appear to be maneuvering through them nicely . The Trump administration threatened tariffs on Chinese goods but has backed off imposing them in exchange for promises for more access to Chinese markets. Similarly the administration threatened crippling sanctions on Chinese telecom giant ZTE for violating trade sanctions on North Korea and Iran, but has backed away from them as well , in anticipation of a broader trade deal.\nThe upshot is that the U.S. likely will get some additional access to Chinese markets, and American auto makers will end up with lower tariffs standing in the way of car sales there. But the Chinese have resisted pressure to cut their trade surplus with the U.S. in half and have done little to make structural changes in a system that advantages Chinese companies and compels American firms to surrender intellectual property.\nIn sum, the tensions between the U.S. and China are coming into sharper relief every day. They are nowhere close to breaking into open hostilities, and areas of cooperation exist alongside the competition. U.S. officials say the Chinese continue to do more than ever before to clamp down on economic activity along their border with North Korea, adding pressure on Pyongyang to come to an agreement to curb its nuclear program.\nThus, American officials say they are bracing for a long-term pattern in which China will cooperate in areas where interests intersect, while testing the U.S. in other areas.\nHere’s the broader challenge: Unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War, China isn’t simply seeking to gain advantage under existing international rules. It seeks to create a new, alternate model. That’s a recipe for long-term tension.\nWrite to Gerald F. Seib at jerry.seib@wsj.com",
