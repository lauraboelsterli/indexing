During the quarter, we continued to focus on our core lithium products, such as by attending the 2018 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where we showcased our advanced rechargeable battery products for notebooks, smart phones, wearable devices, smart house appliances, portable power stations, and other digital products. We also increased our R&D efforts in order to fine-tune and develop new technologies that improve product safety and reliability as well as to provide solutions that fulfill the innovations of our international customer base.\"\n\"While we continue to face industry cost headwinds, we are committed to improving our production efficiency and maintaining an efficient supply chain. As always, we remain focused on sustainable growth and on providing clean, safe, and efficient power solutions to meet society's needs,\" Mr. Pan concluded.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNe t Sales\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 increased 18.9% to $49.8 million from $41.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by sales of the Company's lithium business, which grew 33.1%, or $9.1 million, during the quarter. Excluding the impact of GZ Highpower, net sales increased 24.1% to $49.8 million from $40.1 million.\nGros s Profit\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 23.8% to $7.6 million from $9.9 million in the prior year period due to high raw material prices. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 15.2% compared to 23.7% in the prior year period.

As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses increased to 5.1% from 4.3% in the prior year period due to the Company's continued investments in R&D. Selling and distribution expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.0 million compared to $1.6 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, selling and distribution expenses increased to 4.0% from 3.9% in the prior year period, remaining relatively stable.

As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 8.3% from 7.3% in the prior year period. The increase was due to an increase of the provisions for the Company's incentive plan.\nNet Income\nNet loss attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.1 million. During the prior year period, the Company achieved a net income attributable to the Company of $2.5 million.

EBITDA was derived by taking earnings before interest expense (net), taxes, depreciation and amortization. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as it provides a basis for evaluating the Company's operating results in the ordinary course of its operations. This non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Company believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with its results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company's results of operations in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, the corresponding GAAP measures. EBITDA is reconciled in the accompanying table to the most directly comparable measure as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \" \" within the meaning of the \"safe-harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are not historical facts.
