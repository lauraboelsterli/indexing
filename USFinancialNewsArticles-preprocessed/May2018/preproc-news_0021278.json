The use of cash in connection with the repurchases decreased net asset value as of period end; however, the reduction in shares outstanding as of period end resulted in an increase in the net asset value per share . Weighted-average common basic shares outstanding were approximately 21.2 million and 22.2 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGSV Capital’s liquid assets were $114.4 million as of March 31, 2018, consisting of $90.3 million of cash and $24.1 million of marketable securities subject to sales restrictions.\nAt quarter-end and as of May 8, 2018 GSV Capital did not have any borrowings outstanding under its $12.0 million credit facility.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn December 15, 2017, we announced the commencement of a cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase any and all of the $69.0 million aggregate principal amount our outstanding 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due September 15, 2018 (the “5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018”). As of the expiration of the Tender Offer on January 17, 2018, approximately $4.8 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 representing approximately 7.0% of the outstanding 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer. On March 27, 2018, we repurchased an additional $14.2 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018.\nOn March 28, 2018, we issued $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due September 30, 2023 (the “4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023”). The 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 are convertible into shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 93.2836 shares of our common stock per $1,000 of principal amount of the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $10.72 per share of common stock.\nShare Repurchase Program\nUnder the publicly announced share repurchase program, as of March 31, 2018 the Company had repurchased 1,114,465 shares of its common stock for approximately $6.2 million. From April 1, 2018 through May 8, 2018, the Company did not repurchase any additional shares of its common stock.\nAs of May 8, 2018, in light of the Board of Directors’ authorization to increase the amount of shares of Company common stock that may be repurchased under the share repurchase program, the dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased by the Company under the program is approximately $8.8 million.\nConference Call and Webcast\nManagement will hold a conference call and webcast for investors today at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET).
