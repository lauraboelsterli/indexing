(NASDAQ:ASUR) , a leading provider of Human Capital Management (HCM) and workplace management software, reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Key Financial Highlights\nFirst Quarter Total Revenue of $19.3 Million, up 80% Year-Over-Year Cloud Bookings were up 225% Year-Over-Year First Quarter Cloud Revenue of $16.4 Million, up 110% Year-Over-Year Deferred Revenue of $13.2 Million, up 33% Year-Over-Year Unbilled Deferred Revenue of $14.1 Million, up 422% Year-Over-Year Backlog of $27.3 Million, up 167% Year-Over-Year\nActual Results For the three months ended (in millions except per share data and percentages) March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Change (%) Revenue $ 19.3 $ 10.7 80% GAAP Gross Profit $ 13.7 $ 8.3 66% GAAP Gross Margin 71.2% 77.3% -8% Non-GAAP Gross Profit* $ 14.0 $ 8.4 67% Non-GAAP Gross Margin* 72.8% 78.3% -7% GAAP Net Loss $ (1.9 ) $ (1.1 ) 82% Non-GAAP Net Income* $ 1.7 $ 0.9 76% GAAP Net Loss per Share $ (0.15 ) $ (0.12 ) 25% Non-GAAP Net Earnings per Share ** $ 0.13 $ 0.11 18% Non-GAAP EBITDA * $ 3.8 $ 1.7 121% Non-GAAP EBITDA Margin * 19.6% 16.0% 23%\n* Non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to GAAP in the tables set forth in this release.\n** Historical non-GAAP Net Earnings Per Share adjusted for 0% effective tax rate for comparison purposes Management Commentary\n“The first quarter was a strong start to the year,” said Pat Goepel, CEO. “From a financial standpoint, we achieved strong results, including revenue, cloud bookings, cloud revenue, and non-GAAP EBITDA. Total revenue in the quarter grew 80% over the prior year. First quarter’s performance was driven by continued strong execution and growth across the entire business, but particularly in our cloud business, which grew 110% from the year-ago quarter. In addition, cloud bookings for first quarter were up 225% year-over-year. Clearly, our cloud offerings are resonating in the market and new business activity has been promising. As a result of the momentum we are seeing in the marketplace we are raising our annual guidance for 2018.”\nCFO Kelyn Brannon noted, “Our cloud strategy continues to experience strong momentum. For the first time, quarterly cloud revenue mix grew beyond the 80% threshold to reach 85% of total revenue in the first quarter. GAAP gross margin declined to 71.2% from 77.3% in the year-ago quarter as a result of revenue mix. As you recall, Asure acquired three resellers at the beginning of the year. These resellers typically carry lower gross margins, and represented a larger portion of our revenue mix in the first quarter, which resulted in the overall gross margin reduction. We ended the quarter with $25.8 million in cash.”\nGoepel continued, “In addition to our solid organic performance, we’ve also continued to execute on our acquisition strategy of capitalizing on synergistic and accretive acquisition opportunities. We closed three acquisitions since our last earnings call, bringing the total number we’ve consummated this year to six. These acquisitions enhance our scale, product, customers, cross-sell opportunities, and prepare us for future growth.”\n“We remain focused on the key initiatives that have and will continue to drive us forward: accelerating the velocity of our cross-selling opportunities and scaling our business further. What was our intermediate goal of reaching $100 million in revenue is now clearly within our line of sight. Asure‘s industry-leading solutions and proven growth strategy have created significant financial and operational momentum that will scale our business over the long-term.”\nAsure delivered the following results for its first quarter 2018:\nCloud Bookings: First quarter cloud bookings were up 225% year-over-year.\nRevenue: Total first quarter revenue was $19.3 million, an increase of 80% from $10.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Recurring revenue represented 91% of total revenue, up from 83% in the year-ago quarter. Normalized recurring revenue represented 82% of total revenue, up from 80% in the year-ago quarter. Cloud revenue represented 85% of total, up from 73% in the year-ago quarter.\nGross Profit: GAAP gross profit was $13.7 million (71.2% margin), a 66% increase from $8.3 million (77.3% margin) in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross profit* was $14.0 million (72.8% margin), up 67% from $8.4 million (78.3% margin) in the year-ago quarter.\nNon-GAAP EBITDA*: Non-GAAP EBITDA was $3.8 million (19.6% margin), an increase of 121% from $1.7M (16.0% margin) in the first quarter of 2017.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share: GAAP loss per share was $(0.15) compared with $(0.12) in the first quarter of 2017.

All three companies are current resellers of Asure's leading Human Resource Information System platform, Evolution.\nCredit Facility Amendment: Amended credit facility, increasing the term loans and amount of available financing to $175 million.

Note that guidance for both revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA were previously increased on April 9, 2018.\nNew Range Prior Range Revenue $90.0 million to $93.0 million $89.0 million to $92.0 million Non-GAAP EBITDA* $20.0 million to $23.0 million $20.0 million to $23.0 million Additional 2018 Guidance:\nInterest expense $9.0 million to $9.5 million Depreciation $1.7 million to $2.3 million Amortization $7.7 million to $8.5 million Stock compensation expense $0.7 million to $0.8 million Acquisition costs and other one-time expenses $2.3 million to $3.3 million Non-GAAP Effective Tax Rate 0.0% Conference Call Details\nAsure management today (Wednesday, May 9, 2018) at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (3:30 p.m. Central time) to discuss these financial results and outlook. Asure CEO Pat Goepel and CFO Kelyn Brannon will host the presentation, followed by a question and answer period.\nU.S. dial-in: 877-853-5636\nInternational dial-in: 631-291-4544\nConference ID: 8967146\nThe conference call will be broadcasted live and available for replay via the investor section of the company's website .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: This press release includes information about non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP tax rates, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP EBITDA, and non-GAAP free cash flow (collectively the \"non-GAAP financial measures\"). These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes things such as interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation, and one-time expenses. Asure Software is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Asure Software has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking Non-GAAP EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss.\nManagement uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating the company's performance.\nThe primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the company's results in the same way management does.\nManagement believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the company's operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company's business. Further, to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the company's relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results.\nSpecifically, management is excluding the following items from its non-GAAP earnings per share, as applicable, for the periods presented in the first quarter 2018 financial statements and for its non-GAAP estimates for 2018:\nStock-Based Expenses: The company's compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles: The company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company's research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.\nIncome Tax Effects and Adjustments: Beginning in first quarter 2018, the company is using a fixed projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and non-cash tax effects of acquired goodwill and amortization, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. This tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the acquisition activity or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the company operates. The company re-evaluates this tax rate on an annual basis or when any significant events that may materially affect this rate occur. The non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2018 is currently projected to be approximately 0.0 percent.\nAmortization of Capitalized Internal-Use Software, Acquisition-Related, and One-Time Expenses: The company’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of internal-use capitalized software costs and acquisition-related expenses as well as one-time expenses, such as material tax credits, material interest-expense credits, severance, recruitment, and relocation.\nAbout Asure Software\nAsure Software, Inc.
