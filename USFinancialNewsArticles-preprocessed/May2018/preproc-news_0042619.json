Actual expense to be recorded in connection with these shares is dependent upon several factors, including future changes in Take-Two's stock price. 4) For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, the Company’s fully diluted share count used for both GAAP and management reporting purposes is expected to be 117.2 million, which includes 113.6 million basic shares and 3.6 million shares representing the potential dilution from unvested employee stock grants. The interest expense, net of tax, on the convertible notes, which is added back to net income to calculate diluted net income per share for management reporting purposes is $0.03 million. Key assumptions and dependencies underlying the Company’s financial outlook include: the timely delivery of the titles included in this financial outlook; continued consumer acceptance of Xbox One and PlayStation 4; the ability to develop and publish products that capture market share for these new-generation systems while also leveraging opportunities on Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC and mobile platforms; and stable foreign exchange rates.
