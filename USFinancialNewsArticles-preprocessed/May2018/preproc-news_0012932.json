    "text": "NEW YORK, May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFirst quarter results in line with Company's expectations 1.50% Convertible Note debt refinancing complete Projecting stable cash position and debt covenant compliance Reiterating full year 2018 revenue and free cash flow guidance Launched Umbro brand at Target and continued to grow Starter on Amazon\nIconix Brand Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: ICON) (\"Iconix\" or the \"Company\") today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nJohn Haugh, CEO of Iconix commented, \"Following intense focus on our balance sheet resulting in the successful resolution of all near term debt obligations, we are excited to speak with the investor community to discuss progress on our growth initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we launched Umbro with Target. The product looks great and customers are responding favorably. We are thrilled to bring Umbro's world leadership in soccer apparel and equipment to a valuable partner like Target.\nWe have demonstrated our ability to successfully reposition some of our core brands and we continue to work closely with our best-in-class licensees to maintain the strength of our long-term partnerships, while evaluating opportunities to drive brand portfolio growth.\nWe are thus maintaining our revenue and free cash flow guidance for the year.\"\n2018 Guidance:\nReiterating previously announced full year revenue guidance of $190 million to $220 million On track to deliver approximately $12 million of full year cost-savings, aligning expenses with revenue base Previous GAAP net income guidance of approximately $7 million to $17 million, being increased to $17 million to $27 million principally due to the Q1 gain on extinguishment of debt and the elimination of non-cash interest expense related to our 5.75% convertible notes Reiterating non-GAAP net income guidance of $20 million to $30 million Reiterating full year free cash flow guidance of $50 million to $70 million\nIt should be noted that GAAP net income will be affected by non-cash adjustments to fair value from the Company's 5.75% Convertible Notes discussed below. Such periodic adjustments to fair value cannot be estimated in advance and thus are not taken into account in guidance.\nNon-GAAP net income and free cash flow are non-GAAP metrics, and reconciliation tables for each are included in this press release.\nUnless otherwise noted, the following represents financial results for continuing operations only.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal Revenue:\nAdjusted Non-GAAP Revenue by Segment\nThree months ended Mar. 31,\n($, 000's)\n2018\n2017*\n% Change\nWomens\n16,598\n28,143\n-41%\nMens\n9,945\n10,193\n-2%\nHome\n6,512\n7,336\n-11%\nInternational\n15,493\n12,032\n29%\nTotal Adjusted Revenue\n48,548\n57,704\n-16%\n*Revenue is adjusted for approximately $1.0 million of revenue from the SE Asia joint venture which was deconsolidated in 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total revenue was $48.5 million, a 17% decline as compared to $58.7 million in the prior year quarter. Such decline was expected principally as a result of the transition of our Danskin, Ocean Pacific and Mossimo DTR's in our Women's segment, as previously announced. Revenue in the first quarter of 2017 included approximately $1.0 million of licensing revenue from the Company's Southeast Asia joint venture which was deconsolidated in the second quarter of 2017. As a result, there was no comparable revenue for this item in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding Southeast Asia, revenue declined approximately 16% for the first quarter of 2018.\nIn the first quarter 2018 the Company adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard (ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers â€“ Topic 606). Adoption of the standard decreased Q1 2018 revenue by approximately $1.9 million but is expected to increase full-year 2018 revenue by approximately $2.5 to $3 million.\nSG&A Expenses:\nTotal SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $28.6 million, a 13% increase compared to $25.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. However, 2018 includes a number of unique items, including special charges, restructuring costs, and a non-cash purchase accounting adjustment. Adjusting for these items in 2018 and special charges in 2017, SG&A decreased approximately $1.1 million or 5%. Stock based compensation was $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGain on sale of trademarks:\nGain on sale of trademarks in the first quarter of 2018 were $1.1 million. The gain on sale of trademarks for the current quarter was related to the completion of the sale of the Sharper Image and Badgley Mischka trademarks from certain of the Company's international joint ventures.\nOperating Income:\nOperating Income by Segment\nThree months ended Mar. 31,\n($, 000's)\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nWomens\n14,628\n26,281\n-44%\nMens\n5,874\n5,944\n-1%\nHome\n5,743\n6,625\n-13%\nInternational\n6,486\n5,520\n18%\nCorporate\n(12,238)\n(10,760)\n-14%\nOperating Income\n20,493\n33,610\n-39%\nOperating Margin by Segment\nThree months ended Mar. 31,\n2018\n2017\nVar\nWomens\n88%\n93%\n-5%\nMens\n59%\n58%\n1%\nHome\n88%\n90%\n-2%\nInternational\n42%\n46%\n-4%\nOperating Margin\n42%\n58%\n-16%\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $20.5 million, as compared to $33.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating margin for the first quarter 2018 was 42% as compared to 58% in the first quarter 2017. However, when excluding special charges, restructuring costs, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and gain on sale of trademarks from 2018 results and special charges from 2017 results, operating income is $25.8 million and $35.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and operating margin is 53% and 61% in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest Expense:\nInterest expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $14.5 million, as compared to interest expense of $15.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The Company's reported interest expense includes non-cash interest related to its 1.50% Convertible Notes of approximately $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOther Income:\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company recognized a $24.4 million gain resulting from the Company's accounting for the 5.75% Convertible Notes which requires recording the fair value of this debt at the end of each period with any change from the prior period accounted for as other income or loss in the current period's income statement. The first quarter of 2018 also includes a gain of $4.5 million related to the early extinguishment of a portion of the Company's 1.50% Convertible Notes and a $1.0 million gain related to the final payment received from the sale of its minority interest in Complex Media in 2016. This compares to a loss of $5.5 million related to the early extinguishment of a portion of the Company's term loan in the first quarter of 2017. The Company has excluded these amounts from its non-GAAP results.\nProvision for Income Taxes:\nThe effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 is approximately 4.4% which resulted in a $1.7 million income tax provision, as compared to an effective income tax rate of 46.0% in the prior year quarter which resulted in a $5.9 million income tax provision. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first quarter is primarily as a result of the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, as well as the impact of the gain related to the mark-to-market adjustment from the Company's 5.75% Convertible Notes in the current quarter of which a large portion was a permanent difference and therefore no tax was provided. Excluding any mark-to-market adjustments from the Company's 5.75% Convertible Notes, we expect the full year 2018 tax rate to be approximately 32% and approximately 30% on a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis, respectively.\nGAAP Net Income and GAAP Diluted EPS:\nGAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Iconix Brand Group, Inc. for the first quarter of 2018 reflects income of $32.7 million as compared to income of $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 reflects income of $0.51 as compared to income of $0.06 in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS:\nNon-GAAP Net Income & Diluted EPS Reconciliation: (1)\n($, 000's, except per share data)\nNET INCOME\nEPS\nThree Months Ended Mar. 31,\nThree Months Ended Mar. 31,\n2018\n2017\n% Change\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nGAAP net income (loss) & EPS from continuing operations\nattributable to Iconix (1)\n32,715\n4,402\n643%\n$0.51\n$0.06\n750%\nAdd:\nnon-cash interest related to ASC 470\n2,998\n4,046\n$0.05\n$0.07\n(gain) / loss on extinguishment of debt\n(4,473)\n5,482\n($0.08)\n$0.10\ngain on sale of Complex Media\n(958)\n-\n($0.02)\n$0.00\ngain on change in fair value of convertible debt\n(25,174)\n-\n($0.43)\n$0.00\nspecial charges\n2,706\n2,167\n$0.05\n$0.04\nforeign currency translation gain/(loss)\n(551)\n431\n($0.01)\n$0.01\nincome taxes (benefit) related to above\n1,256\n(4,224)\n$0.02\n($0.07)\nvaluation allowance & foreign tax credit\n(2,793)\n0\n($0.05)\n$0.00\nnon-controlling interest\n(38)\n45\n($0.00)\n$0.00\naccretion of redeemable non-controlling interest\n-\n-\n$0.04\n$0.02\nNet Adjustments\n(27,027)\n7,947\n($0.42)\n$0.16\nNon-GAAP net income & EPS from continuing operations\nattributable to Iconix\n5,688\n12,349\n-54%\n$0.10\n$0.21\n-55%\nNote: All items in the above reconciliation table may not add due to rounding.\nNon-GAAP weighted average diluted shares reconciliation (1)\nThree Months Ended Mar. 31,\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nGAAP weighted average diluted shares\n59,117\n56,964\n4%\nAdd: antidilutive shares resulting from net loss\n-\n599\nNA\nNon-GAAP weighted average diluted shares\n59,117\n57,563\n3%\nNon-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.7 million as compared to $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.

The Company believes these are useful financial measures in evaluating its financial condition because they are more reflective of the Company's business purpose, operations and cash expenses.\nBased on the average closing stock price for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, there were no potential dilutive shares related to our convertible notes for GAAP purposes.\n(2) Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net cash provided by operating activities, plus cash received from the sale of trademarks and formation of joint ventures, less distributions to non-controlling interests and capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow excludes notes receivable from sale of trademarks and the formation of joint ventures, cash used to acquire the membership interests of our joint venture partners, mandatory debt service requirements, and other non-discretionary expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is useful because it provides information regarding actual cash received in a specific period from the Company's comprehensive business strategy of maximizing the value of its brands through traditional licensing, international joint ventures and other arrangements. We have excluded the cash used to buy back our joint venture membership interests from the above definition because we believe that, like other acquisitions, such actions are capital transactions. It also provides supplemental information to assist investors in evaluating the Company's financial condition and ability to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iconix-reports-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-2018-300642652.html\nSOURCE Iconix Brand Group, Inc.",
