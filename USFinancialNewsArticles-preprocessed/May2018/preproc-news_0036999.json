    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 1:21 PM / Updated 8 hours ago Korean spy film screens at Cannes while real-world plot thickens Natasha Howitt 3 Min Read\nCANNES, France (Reuters) - “The Spy Gone North”, the tale of a South Korean who infiltrated North Korea in the 1990s, is full of plot twists, but the movie might be outdone by the news, as efforts to resolve the nuclear stand-off face a real-life cliffhanger.

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/File Photo\nFor the South Korean cast and crew of “The Spy Gone North”, current events were never far from their minds.\n“When I read the script for the first time, I made a joke to the director, saying: is it possible to actually produce this movie?” said actor Lee Sung-min who plays an aide to the North’s former leader, Kim Jong Il.\n“Since then, the relationship has improved, but if tensions had remained as they were before, this movie could have been a very problematic one,” he told Reuters in an interview conducted before the cancellation of Wednesday’s talks.\nHwang Jung-min, who plays Black Venus, said he hoped the film would help foreign audiences understand Korean history, and how there is no “fun” in and “no need” for political war games.\nAsked if he thought Kim would watch his movie, director Yoon Jong-bin replied: “It would be nice”.\nThe Cannes Film Festival runs to May 19.
