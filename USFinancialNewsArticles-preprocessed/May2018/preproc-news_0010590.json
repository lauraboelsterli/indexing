    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump did not initially know that his personal lawyer had paid $130,000 to adult-film star Stormy Daniels but later learned about the payment, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday.\nTrump in April told reporters he did not know about the payment, made by his lawyer Michael Cohen. But on Wednesday, Rudy Giuliani, who has joined Trumpâ€™s legal team, said the president knew about the payment and reimbursed Cohen.\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she had a brief affair with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the affair.\nReporting by Jeff Mason, writing by Roberta Rampton, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\nOur ",
