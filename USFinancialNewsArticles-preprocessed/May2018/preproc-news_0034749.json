REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\nThe Indian steelmaker on Wednesday reported an exceptional gain of 113.76 billion rupees in the quarter to the end of March, which included a non-cash gain of 140.77 billion rupees relating to the restructuring of its British pension scheme.\nBritain’s pensions regulator agreed last year to allow Tata Steel UK to cut pension scheme liabilities, the main stumbling block in Tata’s efforts to merge its European operations with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp ( TKAG.DE ).\nIn the same quarter last year, Tata Steel booked charges of 40.69 billion rupees, including curtailment charges relating to the closure of Tata Steel Europe’s pension scheme.\nIncome from operations in the quarter rose by 2.6 percent to 357.37 billion rupees, the company said in a statement. It also reported a decline of about 5.9 percent in total steel deliveries for the fourth quarter, while domestic deliveries slipped 5.6 percent to 3.03 million tonnes.\nTata Steel shares were 0.8 percent lower ahead of its results on Wednesday.
