Foss, Chairman, President and CEO. “Looking forward, we are raising our full-year Adjusted EPS outlook due to improved productivity in the legacy business.”\nFoss added: “While our core business continues to perform well, we are excited about the strategic acquisitions of Avendra and AmeriPride which strengthen our competitive position in the market.

A majority of our Canadian operations were reclassified into the FSS International reportable segment beginning in fiscal 2018. The prior-year period was restated to conform to the current period presentation.\nConsolidated sales were $3.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 6% on a constant-currency basis over the prior-year period, composed of a 4% increase in revenue related to the Avendra and AmeriPride acquisitions and 2% of growth related to the legacy business. Legacy business growth was adversely impacted in the United States and International by weather conditions and the timing of the Easter holiday.\nThe Company drove productivity improvements in United States and International, while reinvesting in technology and capabilities. Uniform adjusted operating income benefited from a partial quarter of AmeriPride results, as well as higher revenue in the legacy business.\nSECOND QUARTER SUMMARY\nOn a GAAP basis, sales were $3.9 billion, operating income was $136 million, net income attributable to Aramark stockholders was $28 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.11. This compares to the second quarter of 2017 where, on a GAAP basis, sales were $3.6 billion, operating income was $191 million, net income attributable to Aramark stockholders was $70 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.28. Operating income was adversely impacted by merger and integration related charges, as well severance and other charges. Second quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased (61)% year-over-year for the same reasons.\nAdjusted net income was $122 million or $0.48 per share, versus adjusted net income of $113 million or $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2017. A weaker U.S. dollar increased sales by approximately $89 million, and had a positive impact on adjusted operating income of $2 million. Adjusted earnings per share was not materially impacted by currency fluctuations.\nSTRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS & FINANCING\nDuring the quarter, the Company completed the acquisition of AmeriPride on January 19, 2018, and borrowed a total of $1.15 billion to finance the acquisition and related fees and expenses.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE & LIQUIDITY\nTotal trailing 12-month net debt to covenant adjusted EBITDA was 4.7x at the end of the quarter, a 100 basis point increase versus the prior year measurement due to the recent acquisitions of Avendra and AmeriPride. At quarter-end the company had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and availability on its revolving credit facility.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nThe Company provides its expectations for full-year adjusted EPS and full-year free cash flow on a non-GAAP basis, and does not provide a reconciliation of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that could be made for the impact of the change in fair value related to certain gasoline and diesel agreements, severance and other charges and the effect of currency translation.\nThe Company is increasing its 2018 adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, which includes 1-2 cents of currency benefit. The Company is affirming its full-year free cash flow outlook of greater than $400 million. This outlook now reflects an expectation of approximately $100 million benefit due to tax reform and the results of the acquisitions, offset by approximately $100 million in one-time costs and certain assumed obligations related to the acquisitions. The Company expects its leverage ratio to be below 4.5x by the end of the fiscal year.\nCONFERENCE CALL SCHEDULED\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call at 10 a.m. ET today to discuss its earnings and outlook. This call and related materials can be heard and reviewed, either live or on a delayed basis, on the Company's web site, www.aramark.com on the investor relations page.\nAbout Aramark\nAramark (NYSE: ARMK) proudly serves Fortune 500 companies, world champion sports teams, state-of-the-art healthcare providers, the world’s leading educational institutions, iconic destinations and cultural attractions, and numerous municipalities in 19 countries around the world.

The tax effect for adjusted net income for our U.S. earnings is calculated using a blended U.S. federal and state tax rate. The tax effect for adjusted net income in jurisdictions outside the U.S. is calculated at the local country tax rate.\nAdjusted Net Income (Constant Currency)\nAdjusted Net Income (Constant Currency) represents Adjusted Net Income adjusted to eliminate the impact of currency translation.\nAdjusted EPS\nAdjusted EPS represents Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nCovenant Adjusted EBITDA\nCovenant Adjusted EBITDA represents net income attributable to Aramark stockholders adjusted for interest and other financing costs, net; provision (benefit) for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; and certain other items as defined in our debt agreements required in calculating covenant ratios and debt compliance. The Company also uses Net Debt for its ratio to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as total long-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment, client contract investments and other. Management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it represents a measure of cash flow available for distribution among all the security holders of the Company.\nWe use Constant Currency Sales, Adjusted Operating Income (including on a constant currency basis), Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (including on a constant currency basis), Adjusted EPS (including on a constant currency basis) and Free Cash Flow as supplemental measures of our operating profitability and to control our cash operating costs. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors because they enable better comparisons of our historical results and allow our investors to evaluate our performance based on the same metrics that we use to evaluate our performance and trends in our results. These financial metrics are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Our presentation of these metrics has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. You should not consider these measures as alternatives to sales, operating income, net income, or earnings per share, determined in accordance with GAAP. Constant Currency Sales, Adjusted Operating Income, Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow as presented by us, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical calculations.\nExplanatory Notes to the Non-GAAP Schedules\nAmortization of acquisition-related customer relationship intangible assets resulting from the 2007 Leveraged Buy-out - adjustments to eliminate the change in amortization resulting from the purchase accounting applied to the January 26, 2007 going-private transaction executed with investment funds affiliated with GS Capital Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC and J.P.

(\"AmeriPride\") and related financings, as well as statements regarding these companies’ services and products and statements relating to our business and growth strategy. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as \"outlook,\" \"aim,\" \"anticipate,\" \"are or remain confident,\" \"have confidence,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"will be,\" \"will continue,\" \"will likely result,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"see,\" \"look to\" and other words and terms of similar meaning or the negative versions of such words.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. All statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates, financial results and our estimated benefits and costs of our acquisitions are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Some of the factors that we believe could affect our results or the costs and benefits of the acquisitions include without limitation: unfavorable economic conditions; natural disasters, global calamities, sports strikes and other adverse incidents; the failure to retain current clients, renew existing client contracts and obtain new client contracts; a determination by clients to reduce their outsourcing or use of preferred vendors; competition in our industries; increased operating costs and obstacles to cost recovery due to the pricing and cancellation terms of our food and support services contracts; the inability to achieve cost savings through our cost reduction efforts; our expansion strategy; the failure to maintain food safety throughout our supply chain, food-borne illness concerns and claims of illness or injury; governmental regulations including those relating to food and beverages, the environment, wage and hour and government contracting; liability associated with noncompliance with applicable law or other governmental regulations; new interpretations of or changes in the enforcement of the government regulatory framework; currency risks and other risks associated with international operations, including Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption law compliance; continued or further unionization of our workforce; liability resulting from our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans; risks associated with suppliers from whom our products are sourced; disruptions to our relationship with, or to the business of, our primary distributor; the inability to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or increases in labor costs; healthcare reform legislation; the contract intensive nature of our business, which may lead to client disputes; seasonality; disruptions in the availability of our computer systems or privacy breaches; failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls; our leverage; the inability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness; debt agreements that limit our flexibility in operating our business; our ability to successfully integrate the businesses of Avendra and AmeriPride and costs and timing related thereto, the risk of unanticipated restructuring costs or assumption of undisclosed liabilities, the risk that we are unable to achieve the anticipated benefits (including tax benefits) and synergies of the acquisition of AmeriPride and Avendra including whether the proposed transactions will be accretive and within the expected timeframes, the availability of sufficient cash to repay certain indebtedness and our decision to utilize the cash for that purpose, the disruption of the transactions to each of Avendra and AmeriPride and their respective managements; the effect of the transactions on each of Avendra's and AmeriPride's ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties, our ability to attract new or maintain existing customer and supplier relationships at reasonable cost, our ability to retain key personnel and other factors set forth under the headings Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" Item 3 \"Legal Proceedings\" and Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on November 22, 2017 as such factors may be updated from time to time in our other periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and which may be obtained by contacting Aramark's investor relations department via its website www.aramark.com . Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. As a result of these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included herein or that may be made elsewhere from time to time by, or on behalf of, us.
