    "text": "New York, May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Augmate today announced the hiring of Dave Evans as chief technology officer, further cementing the company’s position at the center of connected devices and blockchain. Evans, who throughout his career at Cisco coined the phrase “Internet of Everything,” and correctly predicted the proliferation of the Internet, the World Wide Web, the Internet of Things, and numerous other trends, will now help shape Augmate’s vision for the future of blockchain and the Internet of Things.\n“Dave’s reputation as one of the most innovative and creative thinkers in Silicon Valley and beyond is unassailable,” said Pete Wassell, CEO and founder of Augmate. “Yes, his accomplishments speak for themselves, but he also has the innate ability to explain complex things and simplify the terminology so people can understand it. That skill, coupled with all he brings to the table, will help bring Augmate to the next level.”\nIn 24 years at Cisco and most recently as co-founder of Stringify — an Internet of Things startup later bought by Comcast that now powers the cable giant’s smart home strategy — Evans has always focused on what’s next. Evans has had numerous projects and thought leadership featured in industry-leading publications such as Forbes, Fortune, CIO Magazine, Financial Times, CNN, TechCrunch, Politico and many others. In addition Evans has 24 patents either already issued or currently pending, including ones related to IoT, RFID, connected vehicles, virtual people and more. In his new role, Evans will help guide the company as it shapes Augmate Connect into the premier platform for relieving the pain points in IoT management and security.\n“The number of connected devices is getting bigger every day, and that will only continue over the next few years,” Evans said. “At the same time, the implications of blockchain are world changing. Helping to shape Augmate’s platform as the standard in IoT interoperability is an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.”\nABOUT AUGMATE\nAugmate is the first company to develop a blockchain agnostic IoT device management platform. https://www.augmate.io/\nJoe Checkler, Peppercomm jcheckler@peppercomm.com 212-931-6144\nSource: Augmate",
