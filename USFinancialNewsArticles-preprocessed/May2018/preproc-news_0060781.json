(“Amplify” or the “Company”) (OTCQX:AMPY) announced today that it closed the previously announced transaction to sell certain assets located in South Texas for cash consideration of approximately $20.0 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.

Pro forma for this sale, the Company expects to have net debt of approximately $300 million under its revolving credit facility.\nThe Company also announced that it has completed the regularly scheduled redetermination of its revolving credit facility borrowing base and entered into an amendment to its credit agreement. Following the redetermination and including a $15 million reduction following the South Texas divestiture, the revised borrowing base will be $415 million effective immediately with scheduled monthly reductions of $5 million until the borrowing base reaches $390 million in October 2018. The next regularly scheduled borrowing base redetermination is expected to occur in October 2018.\n“Today we announced the successful completion of our South Texas divestiture and the conclusion of our semi-annual redetermination of our revolving credit facility.
