    "text": "NEW YORK, May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Siguler Guff, a multi-strategy private equity investment firm with over $13 billion of assets under management, has sold its ownership stake in GlobalLogic Inc. (\"GlobalLogic\" or the \"Company\") to Partners Group. The transaction, which values GlobalLogic at over $2 billion, represents a continuation of Siguler Guff's strong track record of investing in, managing and exiting industry-leading technology companies.\nIn January 2014, Siguler Guff invested $26 million in GlobalLogic through two affiliated funds that focus on technology and software investments in the emerging markets. Siguler Guff originally acquired an 8% stake in partnership with Apax Partners who purchased the remaining majority stake in the Company. In April 2017, Siguler Guff, alongside Apax Partners, sold approximately half of its stake in GlobalLogic to the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (\"CPPIB\").\nThe sale, also led by Apax Partners, values GlobalLogic at a total transaction value of approximately $2.1 billion. Inclusive of all prior transactions, GlobalLogic represents a 4.9x gross multiple of invested capital for Siguler Guff, with proceeds amounting to $126 million. Following the acquisition, Partners Group and CPPIB will become equal shareholders in the Company.\nDrew Guff, Managing Director and Founding Partner of Siguler Guff, commented, \"We are pleased to announce the sale of our stake in GlobalLogic to Partners Group. During the 4+ years since our initial investment in the Company, we have seen GlobalLogic become a leader in digital product engineering services. Demand has grown rapidly for GlobalLogic's services as next-generation cloud-based software platforms, mobile and web applications, and Internet of Things (IoT) have amplified the urgent need for design-led software development expertise.\"\nFounded in 2000, GlobalLogic combines strategic design, complex engineering and vertical industry expertise to help its customers design, build and deliver next-generation products, platforms and digital experiences. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, GlobalLogic has 12,000 employees and operates design studios and engineering centers around the world.
