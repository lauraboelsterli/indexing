    "text": "BRIARCLIFF MANOR, N.Y., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Saw Mill Capital is pleased to announce that it has successfully completed the sale of Gateway Packaging Company, LLC (\"Gateway\") to ProAmpac Holdings Inc., a portfolio company of PPC Partners. Gateway is one of the largest designers and manufacturers of pet food packaging in North America, offering a full range of paper and plastic flexible packaging products to the pet care, specialty human care, and institutional markets.\n\"Our successful investment in Gateway was a testament to both the industry research conducted by our in-house research team, which enabled us to identify the growth opportunity in the pet food packaging market, as well as the outstanding management team that was able to execute on our collective vision,\" commented Tim Nelson, Partner of Saw Mill Capital.\nAt the time of the investment, Saw Mill Capital concluded that pet care was a relatively non-cyclical segment of the broader packaging industry. Saw Mill Capital's research team also uncovered that the pet care segment had unique barriers to entry and that there was an unmet need for a single, comprehensive provider of pet care packaging solutions. These trends, along with the expansion of Gateway's pet care packaging capabilities over the investment period, helped drive phenomenal performance and exceptional results.\n\"Saw Mill Capital was a terrific partner throughout our journey and helped us transform into the largest provider of flexible packaging solutions serving the pet care market,\" stated Omar Abuaita, CEO of Gateway. \"As a result of our partnership, Gateway is well positioned for continued growth and innovation.\"\nBased in Briarcliff Manor, New York, Saw Mill Capital is a private equity firm that acquires industrial and commercial service, specialty distribution and manufacturing businesses with enterprise values of $25 million to $200 million. Since 1997, Saw Mill Capital has been partnering with management teams to help successful businesses reach their full potential. www.sawmillcapital.com\nGateway Packaging Company, LLC manufactures flexible packaging products for pet food, human food, and institutional end-markets, specializing in high-quality printed and converted bags, pouches, lidding, labels, and printed rollstock.
