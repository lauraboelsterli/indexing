    "text": "DENVER and MORGANVILLE, N.J., May 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Breakthrough Technology Group (BTG) and NexusTek today announced that the two companies have merged, integrating two of the nation’s top service providers. Effective April 3, 2018, the combined entity will be marketed under the NexusTek brand and bring to market an unrivalled portfolio of customizable solutions that can address the critical touchpoints in an organization’s technology environment.\nFounded in 1989, Abry Partners is an experienced media, communications, business and information services-focused private equity investment firm in North America.
