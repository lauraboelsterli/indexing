REUTERS/Olivier Hoslet/Pool\n“Looking ahead we are now facing the termination of the nuclear arms deal with Iran and the destruction of the transatlantic alliance,” Soros said in a speech in Paris.\nThis would have negative effects on the European economy and cause further dislocations, he said, citing the strength of the dollar and a flight from emerging market currencies as warning signs.\n“We may be heading for another major financial crisis,” Soros said, adding that the EU should launch a 30 billion a year Marshall Plan for Africa to alleviate the migratory pressure.\n“It is no longer a figure of speech to say that Europe is in existential danger; it is the harsh reality,” he said.\nFor a transcript of the whole speech, click on: here Reporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Leigh Thomas",
