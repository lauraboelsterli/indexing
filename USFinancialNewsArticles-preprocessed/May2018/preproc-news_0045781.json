S&P 500 e-minis were up 15.75 points, or 0.58 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 48 points, or 0.70 percent.\nAll 26 of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components trading premarket were higher.\nShares of Boeing, which sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers, were up 1.4 percent. Caterpillar gained 1.8 percent.\nThe biggest Dow gainer was General Electric, which rose 2.3 percent after the company said it would merge its transportation business with rail equipment maker Wabtec .\nChipmakers, whose major clients include Chinese companies who often build the U.S. chips into devices sold back to Americans, also posted broad gains.\nIntel was up 0.9 percent. Micron gained 2.5 percent, with Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD and Applied Materials up between 1 percent and 1.6 percent.\nShares of regional bank MB Financial jumped 12.7 percent after Fifth Third Bancorp said it would buy the smaller rival in a $4.7 billion deal. Shares of Fifth Third fell 4.1 percent.\nFears of a potential Sino-U.S. trade war, which would have hurt the global economy, have roiled the markets in the recent months and spooked investors who have enjoyed a multi-year bull run.\nWall Street posted losses last week as U.S.-China trade summit, rising U.S. Treasury yields and increasing oil prices weighed on investor sentiment.
