(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:LSBK), the holding company for Lake Shore Savings Bank (the “Bank”), announced today that its Board of Directors has adopted a new stock repurchase program. Under the repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to 121,190 shares of its common stock, or approximately 5% of its outstanding shares, excluding the shares held by Lake Shore, MHC. As of May 16, 2018 there were 34,101 shares remaining in the existing repurchase plan. The existing repurchase plan was terminated as a result of the new plan. The Company repurchased 83,600 shares under the existing repurchase plan at an average cost of $15.29 per share since the plan’s inception in December 2015.\nThe repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions, through block trades, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRepurchases will be made at management’s discretion at prices management considers to be attractive and in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders, subject to the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, and the Company’s financial performance. Open market purchases will be conducted in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements.\nThe repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. These factors may also affect the timing and amount of share repurchases.
