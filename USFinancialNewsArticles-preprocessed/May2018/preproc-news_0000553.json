The stock is up by nearly 20 percent so far this year.\nAerospace sales dipped 0.3 percent from the first quarter of last year, when in-flight entertainment and space revenues had been particularly strong, Thales said in a statement.\nNevertheless its overall order intake, reflecting additions to future business, grew 39 percent on a comparable basis to 3.032 billion euros, led by a major air traffic management deal in Australia, French fighter sales to Qatar and a rail signalling contract in Poland.\nFor 2018, Thales sees an order intake of around 15.5 billion euros, marked by a recovery in defence spending and a slowdown in the telecom satellite market.\nIt expects 4-5 percent higher underlying aerospace sales and a group operating profit of 1.62-1.66 billion euros, up 19 to 22 percent from a restated 2017 level.\nThales said it expects to exceed its mid-term objectives which anticipate 2016-2018 organic sales growth above 5 percent and a 2018 operating margin that should exceed a range of 9.5-10 percent originally set out for the 2017-2018 period.\nThales’ chief finance officer Pascal Bouchiat also told reporters on a conference call that Thales’ acquisition of digital security company Gemalto, which is due to be closed later in 2018, was progressing well.\n$1 = 0.8344 euros Reporting by Cyril Altmeyer and Tim Hepher; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\nOur ",
