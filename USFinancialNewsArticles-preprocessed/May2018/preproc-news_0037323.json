    "text": "DALLAS, May 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Generational Equity , a leading mergers and acquisitions advisor for privately held businesses, is pleased to announce the sale of its client, Clover M Enterprises, LLC dba Riechers Truck Bodies & Equipment Co., to Coin Acceptors, Inc. The acquisition closed April 20, 2018.\nRiechers Truck Bodies , based in Washington, Missouri, has been manufacturing the highest quality truck bodies since 1934. In addition to mass production, the business can design and customize truck beds to meet customer specifications such as stake, platform, chipper, farm and other types of beds. It also manufacturers trailers and carries a full line of truck body accessories.\nCoin Acceptors is a 60-year-old company that provides the unattended point-of-sale industry with currency services and refrigerated vending equipment. Based in St. Louis, Missouri, the family-owned company was seeking to diversify its wealth by investing in manufacturing businesses with metal fabricating capabilities and other processes with which it is familiar.\nGenerational Equity Senior Managing Director Michael Goss successfully closed the deal, and Senior Managing Director Roger Dean established the initial relationship with Riechers.\n\"This transaction represents a very solid fit for both Coin Acceptors, and the owners of Riechers - Gil, Wayne, and Roland Mohesky,\" said Goss. \"The Mohesky family was looking to exit their investment and move closer to full retirement, and Gil will continue to partner with Coin Acceptors and its team to ensure a smooth and successful transition.\"\nAbout Generational Equity\nGenerational Equity , DealForce , and Generational Capital Markets , member FINRA/SIPC, are part of the Generational Group , which is headquartered in Dallas and is one of the leading M&A advisory firms in North America.
