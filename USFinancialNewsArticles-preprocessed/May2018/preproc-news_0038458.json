    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Plastiq, the best way to pay your bills and business expenses by credit card, today announced it has raised $27 million in additional financing from Atlas Venture, Khosla Ventures and Top Tier Capital Partners. Plastiq will use the funds to roll out new payment services and accelerate growth in the small business market.\nThe latest investment comes as Plastiq is experiencing record growth with business owners and consumers who are looking for a reliable and convenient way to pay virtually any bill, while benefiting from credit card points programs, early payment discounts, or a few days' float while an invoice settles. The company works with all major credit card providers, including American Express, Discover, Mastercard, Visa, and JCB, and its payments platform has served more than one million clients, processing billions in payments for a wide range of expenses, from business supplier payments, to contractors, to taxes and rent.\n\"We have a singular vision to make it easy to pay for virtually any expense with your credit card. Whether you are a small business owner looking to take advantage of hard-earned credit to pay for inventory or a commercial lease, or a consumer looking to maximize points by using Plastiq to pay your rent or tuition, Plastiq helps fund your most important paymentsâ€”the ones you need to grow, compete, and win.\" said Eliot Buchanan, Plastiq CEO.\nPlastiq recently expanded its leadership team, bringing on seasoned executives with expertise in the SMB market and payments industry who are adept at scaling teams for growth. New team members include:\nNoah Goldberg joins Plastiq as Head of Operations. An early employee of StubHub, he led Operations as the company experienced massive growth resulting in a $300 million acquisition by eBay. Robert Mahnke was appointed General Counsel and Head of Compliance. He brings 20 years of legal experience and deep payments expertise from legal roles at PayPal and eBay. Serena Satyasai joins Plastiq as Head of Marketing and SMB Sales. A former Google and YouTube executive, she has extensive experience growing small business products globally.\nIn addition, Plastiq has added new Board members and advisors. Karen Appleton Page , a former Apple executive and founding executive at Box, joins the Plastiq Board of Directors. Sam Garvin , Vice Chairman of the Phoenix Suns and a Plastiq investor, is now also serving as an advisor to the company.\n\"Plastiq has a unique opportunity to change the way businesses manage their payments and bring new levels of flexibility and convenience that business owners crave,\" said Garth Timoll, managing director, Top Tier Capital Partners.\nPlastiq plans to use the funds from this round to acquire new business customers and develop additional payment services designed for small and medium-sized businesses.\nAbout Plastiq\nPlastiq is bill pay with benefits, enabling business owners and consumers to use a credit card for virtually any expense, even ones like rent or business supplies that normally require a check. With Plastiq, it's easier to earn credit card rewards, tap early-payment discounts, and use your cash in ways that make the most sense for you. In 2012, Plastiq was selected as the first approved third-party provider of credit card payments to the Canada Revenue Agency. Over the past six years taxpayers have made hundreds of millions in CRA payments through Plastiq. Founded in 2012 and based in San Francisco, California, Plastiq has processed billions in payments for more than one million businesses and consumers.
