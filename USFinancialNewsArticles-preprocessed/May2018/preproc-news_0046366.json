(TSX:AZ) (“Arizona Mining” or the “Company”) announces robust results for two drill holes from the current program focused on expansion of the Taylor Deeps Zone (“TDS”) located on its 100%-owned Hermosa Project in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. The drill holes highlighted in this release are successful step-out exploration drill holes highlighting the continued potential for resource growth, increased zinc-lead-silver grades and significant copper grades associated with the high-grade Taylor Deeps Zone. These results are subsequent to and distinct from drilling completed for the Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) (see Press Release dated January 16, 2018).\nFigure 1.

Long Section of Hermosa Geology and Ore Deposits\nFigure 5. Land Status Map\n“Our exploration drilling continues to confirm high-grade extensions to major areas of mineralization identified in the updated PEA. Exploration drilling in the southwestern portion of the Trench property, especially to the south, continues to demonstrate potential for high-grade expansion of the Taylor Deeps Zone,” said Chief Operating Officer Don Taylor. “In addition to the continued high-grade zinc-lead-silver mineralization, the current and previous drilling has identified an area of potentially significant copper (see Figure 3) which is open to the north and south. The copper-rich zone is characterized by coarse-grained chalcopyrite disseminated within the massive sphalerite/galena mineralization. Based on the robust copper grades in this zone and a previously identified zone to the east, we will be accelerating test work to evaluate the viability of adding a copper circuit to the flotation milling process.”\nHDS-516 is a vertical step-out hole targeting Taylor Deeps Sulfide (TDS) mineralization. The drill hole intercepted several mineralized horizons within the Taylor Deeps Sulfide Zone, including one very substantial zone. The Taylor Deeps intercept extends the mineralization 300 feet southwest of previously reported HDS-436 (see Press Release dated May 18, 2017). Significant mineralized intervals in the Taylor Deeps include:\n160 feet assaying 7.3% combined zinc-lead, and 6.0 opt silver and 1.6% copper (TDS) including 64 feet assaying 13.9% combined zinc-lead; and 11.9 opt silver and 2.5% copper (TDS)\nHDS-525 is an angled step-out drill hole targeting Taylor Deeps Sulfide (TDS) mineralization. The drill hole intercepted multiple mineralized zones in the Taylor Deeps Zone and one high grade vein (TVS). The Taylor Deeps intercept extends the mineralization 300 south of HDS-501 (see Press Release dated February 20, 2018). The noteworthy mineralized intervals were:\n14 feet assaying 22.9% combined zinc-lead; and 3.0 opt silver and 0.8% copper (TVS) 30.5 feet assaying 10.8% combined zinc-lead; and 6.7 opt silver and 2.9% copper (TDS)\nFor a full list of the Trench Vein, Taylor Sulfide and Taylor Deeps Sulfide mineralized intervals from these holes refer to Table I.\nTable I.

Sulfide drill intervals from the Taylor Sulfide Zone and Taylor Deeps Sulfide Zone are down-the-hole drill intervals. Vertical drill holes are considered to be within +5% of true width based on the dip of the mineralized stratigraphy at 20-25 degrees. Angle drill holes are considered to be within +15% of true width based on the dip of the mineralized stratigraphy at 20-25 degrees.\n*The exception to this are the intervals noted as veins. It is not possible to determine the true width of the veins based on the drill density and no representation is made here regarding true width of the veins. Zones shown include: Taylor Sulfide Zone (TS); Taylor Deeps Sulfide Zone (TDS) and Trench Vein System (TVS).\nFigure 1.

Taylor, MSc., PG, Chief Operating Officer for Arizona Mining Inc., a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). Mr. Taylor has 30 years of mineral exploration and mining experience, and is a Registered Professional Geologist through the SME (registered member #4029597).\nAssays and Quality Assurance/Quality Control\nTo ensure reliable sample results, the Company has a rigorous QA/QC program in place that monitors the chain-of-custody of samples and includes the insertion of blanks, duplicates, and certified reference standards at statistically derived intervals within each batch of samples. Core is photographed and split in half with one-half retained in a secured facility for verification purposes.\nSample preparation (crushing and pulverizing) has been performed at ALS Minerals Laboratories, an ISO/IEC accredited lab located in Tucson, Arizona. ALS Minerals Laboratories prepares a pulp of all samples and sends the pulps to their analytical laboratory in Vancouver, B.C. Canada for analysis. ALS analyzes the pulp sample by ICP following a 4-acid digestion (ME-ICP61 for 33 elements) including Cu (copper), Pb (lead), and Zn (zinc). All samples in which Cu (copper), Pb (lead), or Zn (zinc) are greater than 10,000 ppm are re-run using four acid digestion with an ICP – AES finish (Cu-OG62; Pb-OG62; and Zn-OG62) with the elements reported in percentage (%). Silver values are determined by ICP (ME-ICP61) with all samples with silver values greater than 100 ppm repeated using four acid digestion with an ICP-AES finish (Ag-OG62) calibrated for higher levels of silver contained. Any values over 1,500 ppm Ag trigger a fire assay with gravimetric finish analysis. Gold values are determined by a 30 gm fire assay with an ICP-AES finish (Au-ICP21).\nAbout Arizona Mining\nArizona Mining Inc.
