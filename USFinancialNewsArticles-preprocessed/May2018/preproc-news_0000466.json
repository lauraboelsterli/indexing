(ProGreen) (OTCQB:PGUS), a San Diego-based company with land development projects in Baja California, Mexico, today announced that it is acquiring an additional 2,500 acre tract of land near its existing projects in Baja California.\nProGreen, through its Procon subsidiary, is in the process of acquiring a large tract of land less than a mile from the existing Arenoso farm, with the same access.\nClick to Tweet: https://ctt.ec/Apb3Y\nTo learn more about ProGreen's projects, visit: https://www.progreenus.com/\n\"It's a beautiful piece of land with enormous possibilities for our projects, and within walking distance of the Arenoso farm.\" said Jan Telander, CEO of ProGreen. \"The first use of the land will be for expansion of the farming operations, for which we expect more than 1,000 acres to be farmable, providing for substantial growth in the coming years.\"\nThe existing Arenoso farm is situated on the 300 acre tract that was purchased in 2016. Planting of chili peppers for the 2018 crop is now advancing well, for supply of harvested peppers to Huy Fong Foods beginning in late summer.\nOther recent developments at the farm include a solar installation for powering office equipment and use by the workers' living quarters, fixed phone and permanent internet access with wifi, as well as a fuel station currently being installed on location by Dagal, distributor for Pemex, for convenient access at the farm for all diesel-powered equipment.\nAbout ProGreen US, Inc.\nProGreen US, Inc.
