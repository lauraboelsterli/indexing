    "text": "EditorsNote: Edits throughout\nRick Porcello tossed 6 2/3 innings of three-run ball with five strikeouts and Sandy Leon had three RBIs as the host Boston Red Sox beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-3 in the second of a three-game series Tuesday night.\nPorcello (7-2) allowed two earned runs on five hits and two walks to pad his staff lead in wins. Mitch Moreland, J.D. Martinez, Andrew Benintendi and Leon all hit RBI doubles for Boston, which won the opener 8-3 on Memorial Day.\nLeon also hit a two-run homer, his second of the season, Xander Bogaerts had a solo blast, his eighth, and Jackie Bradley Jr. added an RBI for the Red Sox.\nJustin Smoak hit a solo shot, his eighth, and Curtis Granderson drove in a run for Toronto, which lost for the 12th time in 16 games. The Blue Jays are 2-6 against American League East rival Boston this season.\nToronto starter Marco Estrada (2-6) gave up four runs on seven hits and struck out one in 3 2/3 innings.\nBoston star Mookie Betts (left side tightness) missed his third straight game. Red Sox manager Alex Cora said on the team’s flagship radio station that Betts might not return until Thursday in Houston.\nMoreland and Martinez each slapped their RBI doubles in the first inning and Benintendi hit his in the second as the Red Sox led 3-0.\nSmoak put the Blue Jays on the board with his fourth-inning homer, but Bradley got the run back with an RBI single in the Red Sox’s fourth. Leon’s double in the sixth made it 5-1.\nGranderson’s RBI infield single produced two runs as a missed catch by Porcello covering first base allowed a second run to score, making it 5-3. Bogaerts’ blast was in the seventh and Leon’s came in the eighth.\nWith the bases loaded and one out in the ninth, Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel recorded the final two outs for his 17th save.\nBlue Jays right-hander Sam Gaviglio (2-0, 2.30 ERA) opposes Red Sox lefty Eduardo Rodriguez (5-1, 4.02) in Wednesday’s finale.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
