    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Federal Reserve achieved an inflation milestone this week, but that isn't likely to alter expectations for what the Fed will announce when its latest policy meeting ends Wednesday.\nAfter six years of mostly missing its annual 2 percent target for inflation, the Fed learned Monday that its preferred gauge of consumer inflation had reached a year-over-year pace of 2 percent. And in the coming months, inflation is widely expected to stay around that level.\nThe debate the Fed is now likely to have is whether it should accept a period in which inflation rises above 2 percent without accelerating its pace of rate increases. But for now, a rate increase is considered unlikely. In a statement it will issue Wednesday afternoon, the Fed is expected to leave its benchmark rate unchanged at a still-low level of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.\nSolid economic growth, low unemployment and evidence of inflation pressures, though, are expected to keep the central bank on a path of gradual rate hikes the rest of the year. Most Fed watchers foresee either two or three additional increases in the Fed's key rate by year's end, coming after an earlier hike in January.\nThe appointees by President Donald Trump who\n\"The Trump Fed could have been a much more hawkish Fed but so far, these choices are pretty middle-of-the road,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago.\nAs Jerome Powell, Trump's hand-picked new Fed chairman, said at a news conference after the central bank's most recent meeting in March, that by week's end. A year ago, the 10-year yield was just 2.3 percent.\nUnder Powell's predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, the Fed's board endured criticism from House lower\nBut so far, Trump's reshaping of the Fed's board reflects a generally status quo approach.\n\"Trump's criticisms during the campaign have not been borne out by his decisions on who to put on the Fed,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\nWhen the Fed announced its most recent rate hike in March, it forecast that it would raise rates twice more this year. But some economists think that the Fed will respond to the increased government stimulus in the form of tax cuts and higher spending to accelerate the rate hikes slightly from three to four this year.\nCongress in December passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut that took effect in January. And then in February, it approved $300 billion more in government spending for this year and next year. That stimulus, coming at a time when unemployment is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, could raise the threat of higher inflation.\nYet even against this backdrop, the prevailing view is that the Trump-shaped Fed will remain cautious about rate increases.\n\"The central bank does not want to make the mistakes made in the past when the Fed raised rates too high, too fast and became the No. 1 cause of a recession,\" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands.",
