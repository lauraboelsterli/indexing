    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 12:44 PM / Updated 29 minutes ago German police detain rail traffic controller after fatal train crash Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBERLIN (Reuters) - German police said on Tuesday they detained a rail traffic controller for questioning on suspicion of causing death by negligence in a crash between two trains that killed two people in Bavaria.\nThe collision between a freight train and a passenger train occurred late on Monday near Aichach, a station on the line that links the southern cities of Ingolstadt and Augsburg.\nPolice said in a statement the 24-year-old controller was detained over the death of a train driver and a 73-year-old female passenger.\nProsecutors in Augsburg will decide whether to ask a court to issue a formal arrest warrant against him.
