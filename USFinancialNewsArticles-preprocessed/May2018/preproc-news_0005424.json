    "text": "TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ) today announced its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Highlights\n1Q 2018 Net Income of $360 Million 1Q 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.122 Billion, Up $5 Million vs. 1Q 2017 All Three Current Business Segments Improved Year-Over-Year Adjusted EBITDA Current Business Segments Increased Adjusted EBITDA by $53 Million or 5% in 1Q 2018 vs. 1Q 2017 Cash Distribution Coverage Ratio of 1.33x In 2018, Williams Partners Has Set One- and Three-Day Delivery Records on Transco and Established Three New Volume Records on Susquehanna Supply Hub Williams Partners Analyst Day Set for May 17\nSummary Financial Information 1Q Amounts in millions, except per-unit amounts. Per unit amounts are reported on a diluted basis. All amounts are attributable to Williams Partners L.P. 2018 2017 GAAP Measures Cash Flow from Operations $752 $852 Net income (loss) $360 $634 Net income (loss) per common unit $0.37 $0.68 Non-GAAP Measures (1) Adjusted EBITDA $1,122 $1,117 DCF attributable to partnership operations $784 $752 Cash distribution coverage ratio 1.33 x 1.33 x (1) Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow (DCF) and cash distribution coverage ratio are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most relevant measures included in GAAP are attached to this news release. First-Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nWilliams Partners reported unaudited first-quarter 2018 net income attributable to controlling interests of $360 million, a $274 million decrease from first-quarter 2017. The unfavorable change was driven primarily by the absence of a $269 million gain in first-quarter 2017 associated with a transaction involving certain joint-venture interests in the Permian basin and Marcellus shale. Commodity margins were $59 million lower due primarily to the absence of margins from the Geismar olefins facility, which was sold July 6, 2017. The unfavorable change also reflects the absence of $43 million of gains on early retirement of debt and contract settlements and terminations, and $25 million lower equity earnings due primarily to lower earnings at Discovery Producer Services. Partially offsetting the decreases were $90 million increased service revenues due primarily to Transco expansions and higher gathered volumes in the partnership's West business segment and $28 million lower operating and maintenance (O&M) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses.\nWilliams Partners reported first-quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.122 billion, a $5 million increase over first-quarter 2017. The partnership's current business segments improved by $53 million over the same time period in 2017, driven by $58 million increased revenues from Transco expansion projects being placed into service in 2017 and 2018 and a $14 million increase in natural gas liquids margins. Partially offsetting the increases was a $23 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures due primarily to a significant decline in volumes on the Discovery system. The improvement from the current business segments was partially offset by the absence of $49 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in first-quarter 2017 from the NGL & Petchem Services segment primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.\nDistributable Cash Flow and Distributions\nFor first-quarter 2018, Williams Partners generated $784 million in distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, compared with $752 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations for first-quarter 2017. DCF was favorably impacted by the partnership's change in Adjusted EBITDA and a $12 million decrease in net interest expense. DCF was unfavorably impacted by a $47 million increase in maintenance capital expenditures. Beginning with first-quarter 2018 results, the partnership has discontinued the adjustment which removed the DCF associated with 2016 contract restructuring prepayments in the Barnett Shale and Mid-Continent region. This first-quarter 2017 adjustment to DCF was a reduction of $58 million. For first-quarter 2018, the cash distribution coverage ratio was 1.33x.\nWilliams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash distribution of $0.614 per unit, payable May 11, 2018, to its common unitholders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2018.\nCEO Perspective\nAlan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners’ general partner, made the following comments:\n“The organization utilized our stable foundation of advantaged positions to deliver another impressive quarter of steady growth driven once again by our consistent fee-based revenue growth as all three of our current business segments demonstrated year-over-year improvement in Adjusted EBITDA.\n“The demand for low-cost U.S. natural gas continues to increase as reflected in the year-over-year growth in fee-based revenues that occurred thanks in large part to our ‘Big 5’ Transco expansions being placed into service last year. And that demand continues as we recently filed our application with FERC for our Southeastern Trail expansion project, another fully-subscribed Transco expansion.\n“I’m extremely pleased with our project execution and operational performance in 2018. Already this year, we have set one- and three-day delivery records on Transco, established three new volume records on our Susquehanna Supply Hub, started construction on the Gulf Connector’s 475 MMcf/d Gulf Coast LNG delivery expansion, reached several key milestones on the 1,700 MMcf/d Atlantic Sunrise project, placed Phase 2 of the Garden State Transco expansion into service, and also placed additional gathering expansions into service on our Susquehanna Supply Hub in Pennsylvania and Wamsutter Gathering System in Wyoming.\n“No one is as well positioned as Williams to capture the ongoing demand growth of natural gas in the U.S., and we look forward to updating investors about our significant achievements and plans for the future at our Analyst Day event May 17.”\nBusiness Segment Results\nFor first-quarter 2018 results, Williams Partners' operations are comprised of the following reportable segments: Atlantic-Gulf, West, and Northeast G&P. Following the sale of Williams Partners' ownership interest in the Geismar olefins plant on July 6, 2017, the partnership's NGL & Petchem Services segment no longer contained any operating assets.\nAmounts in millions 1Q 2018 1Q 2017 Modified\nEBITDA Adjust. Adjusted\nEBITDA Modified\nEBITDA Adjust. Adjusted\nEBITDA\nAtlantic -Gulf $ 451 $ 15 $ 466 $ 450 $ 3 $ 453 West 413 (7 ) 406 385 4 389 Northeast G&P 250 — 250 226 1 227 NGL & Petchem Services — — — 51 (2 ) 49 Other (7 ) 7 — 20 (21 ) (1 ) Total $ 1,107 $ 15 $ 1,122 $ 1,132 ($15 ) $ 1,117 Williams Partners uses Modified EBITDA for its segment reporting. Definitions of Modified EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and schedules reconciling these measures to net income are included in this news release. Atlantic-Gulf\nThis segment includes the partnership’s interstate natural gas pipeline, Transco, and significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, and various petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, as well as a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, a 41 percent interest in Constitution (a consolidated entity) which is developing a pipeline project, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\nThe Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of $451 million for first-quarter 2018, compared with $450 million for first-quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $13 million to $466 million for the same time period. Modified EBITDA reflects a $58 million increase in revenues due to Transco expansions being placed into service, partially offset by a $29 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures due primarily to a significant decline in volumes on the Discovery system's Hadrian field and an increase in segment expenses mainly related to pipeline integrity program costs. Modified EBITDA was also unfavorably impacted by an $11 million non-cash adjustment to the regulatory liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform Act\"), which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\nWest\nThis segment includes the partnership’s interstate natural gas pipeline, Northwest Pipeline, and natural gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, Delaware and Permian basins. This reporting segment also includes an NGL and natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, and an undivided 50 percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, and a 50 percent equity-method investment in OPPL. The partnership completed the sale of its 50 percent equity-method investment in a Delaware Basin gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region during first-quarter 2017.\nThe West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $413 million for first-quarter 2018, compared with $385 million for first-quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $17 million to $406 million. Gathered volumes were higher in nine of 10 franchises versus first-quarter 2017. Increased fee-based revenue from higher volumes was partially offset by lower rates charged by Northwest Pipeline under its 2017 rate stipulation and settlement agreement. The improvement also reflects $16 million increased commodity margins, and a decrease in segment expenses partially offset by decreased proportional EBITDA from joint ventures, due in part to the partnership's sale of its interests in certain non-operated Delaware Basin assets in first-quarter 2017.\nNortheast G&P\nThis segment includes the partnership’s natural gas gathering and processing, compression and NGL fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia and Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 66 percent interest in Cardinal (a consolidated entity), a 62 percent equity-method investment in UEOM, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain, a 58 percent equity-method investment in Caiman II, and Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC, which owns an approximate average 66 percent equity-method investment in multiple gas gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale.\nThe Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $250 million for first-quarter 2018, compared with $226 million for first-quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $23 million to $250 million. The improvement was driven primarily by $11 million increased fee-based revenues due in large part to higher volumes from the partnership's Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio River Supply Hub. Results for the current year also benefited from an $11 million increase in proportional EBITDA of joint ventures due largely to the partnership's increase in ownership in two Marcellus shale gathering systems in first-quarter 2017 as well as higher volumes gathered by those systems.\nNGL & Petchem Services\nIn first-quarter 2017, this segment produced $51 million in Modified EBITDA and $49 million in Adjusted EBITDA. As of July 7, 2017, this segment no longer contained any operating assets following the sale of the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nThe partnership's guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, expected distribution growth, cash distribution coverage ratio, and debt to EBITDA remains unchanged. The partnership continues to identify attractive new growth capital projects and plans to provide an update on its capital expenditures guidance for these new projects at its annual Analyst Day event. These new projects are expected to contribute to EBITDA for 2019 and beyond.\nWilliams Partners, Williams Analyst Day Set for May 17\nWilliams Partners and Williams are scheduled to host their 2018 Analyst Day event May 17, 2018. During the event, Williams' management will give in-depth presentations covering all of the partnership's and company's energy infrastructure businesses. This year's Analyst Day meeting is scheduled to begin at 8:15 a.m. Eastern Time (7:15 a.m. Central Time) and run approximately four hours. Presentation slides along with a link to the live webcast will be accessible at www.williams.com the morning of May 17. A replay of the 2018 Analyst Day webcast will also be available on the website for at least 90 days following the event.\nWilliams Partners’ First-Quarter 2018 Materials to be Posted Shortly; Q&A Webcast Scheduled for Tomorrow\nWilliams Partners’ first-quarter 2018 financial results package will be posted shortly at www.williams.com . The materials will include the analyst package.\nWilliams Partners and Williams will host a joint Q&A live webcast on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time (8:30 a.m. Central Time). A limited number of phone lines will be available at (888) 394-8218. International callers should dial (323) 794-2149. The conference ID is 8527513. The link to the webcast, as well as replays of the webcast, will be available for at least 90 days following the event at www.williams.com .\nForm 10-Q\nThe partnership plans to file its first-quarter 2018 Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Once filed, the document will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners websites.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nThis news release and accompanying materials may include certain financial measures – Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio – that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC.\nOur segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.\nWe define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, cash portion of net interest expense, income attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments.\nWe also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss).\nThis news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's assets and the cash that the business is generating.\nNeither Adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\nAbout Williams Partners\nWilliams Partners is an industry-leading, large-cap natural gas infrastructure master limited partnership with a strong growth outlook and major positions in key U.S. supply basins. Williams Partners has operations across the natural gas value chain including gathering, processing and interstate transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids.
