    "text": "LAS VEGAS, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GB Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB: GBLX), the previously announced proposed acquisition of NevadaPURE, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, by GB Sciences has been terminated. In accordance with the terms of the non-binding letter of intent signed between the parties and after the due diligence period (which was mutually extended by one week), GB Sciences and NevadaPURE, LLC mutually agreed not to proceed with the transaction.\nGB Sciences' Chairman of the Board and CEO John Poss said: \"A nondisclosure agreement between the parties prevents GB Sciences from making extensive comments on the proposed transaction.

Everyone involved in the due diligence process worked conscientiously to consummate a final agreement; unfortunately there were differences of opinion that could not be overcome.\"\nAbout GB Sciences, Inc.\nGB Sciences, Inc.
