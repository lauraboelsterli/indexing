The company has said the unit would become profitable this year.\n“It looks as though the company is on track to deliver,” said Chris Kallos, a healthcare analyst at Morningstar, referring to Seqirus.\n“They’ve got an R&D pipeline which leverages their basic raw material, which is plasma. This is only the tip of the iceberg,” Kallos added.\nShares in CSL, also the world’s second-largest influenza vaccine maker, jumped as much as 5 percent in morning trade while the broader market was slightly lower. The shares have gained 29 percent so far this year.\n“People will always get sick, and the flu viruses have a very clever way of mutating, meaning that vaccines each year have to be upgraded ... and CSL is right at the forefront of that,” said James McGlew, executive director for corporate stockbroking at Perth-based broker Argonaut.\nCSL also said it was experiencing stronger-than-expected sales of Idelvion, an injection to help hemophiliacs get blood clots, and Haegarda, a treatment for swelling attacks known as angiodema.\nIn contrast to CSL’s share rally, NAB has tumbled 7 percent for the year to date while ANZ has lost nearly 2 percent.
