Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations represents earnings before interest or financing expenses, income tax, depreciation and amortization, and further eliminates the effect of stock based compensation expense, patent litigation and maintenance expenses and other expenses. OTI believes that adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations should be considered in evaluating the Company's operations since it provides a clearer indication of the Company's operating results. This measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for the U.S. GAAP results. The non-GAAP measures included in this press release have been reconciled to the U.S. GAAP results in the tables below.\nON TRACK INNOVATIONS LTD.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENT\nThe following table reflects selected On Track Innovations Ltd. non-GAAP results reconciled to GAAP results:\n(US dollars in thousands)\nThree months ended March 31\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nNet loss\n$ (333)\n$ (865)\nNet loss from discontinued operations\n38\n83\nFinancial expenses, net\n32\n71\nDepreciation\n335\n281\nTaxes on income\n(11)\n31\nTotal EBITDA From continuing operations\n$ 61\n$ (399)\nStock-based compensation\n53\n90\nTotal adjusted EBITDA From continuing operations\n$ 114\n$ (309)\nAbout On Track Innovations Ltd\nOn Track Innovations (OTI) is a global leader in the design, manufacture, and sale of secure cashless payment solutions using contactless NFC technology.
