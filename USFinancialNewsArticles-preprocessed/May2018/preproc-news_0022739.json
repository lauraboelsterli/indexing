    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 8:00 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Rugby union-Cipriani back, Shields in for England's South Africa tour Mitch Phillips 5 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Danny Cipriani has been recalled to the England squad to tour South Africa next month three years after his last appearance, while New Zealand-based back rower Brad Shields was also included for the three-test tour. Rugby Union - Premiership - Wasps v Northampton Saints - Ricoh Arena, Coventry, Britain - April 29, 2018 Wasps' Danny Cipriani gestures Action Images/Andrew Boyers\nCoach Eddie Jones released his squad on Thursday that included seven new players and included Shields after he was released by the New Zealand rugby union overnight.\nBen Earl (Saracens), Jonny Hill (Exeter Chiefs), Dan Robson (Wasps), Ben Spencer (Saracens), 18-year-old Cameron Redpath (Sale Sharks) and Jack Willis (Wasps) were all given their chance in the face of a series of absentees.\nCipriani is the headline name, forcing his way back into contention after a great season for Wasps.\nHe won his first cap in 2008 but has won only 14 in all since then, with his last start also coming 10 years ago.\nA succession of England coaches have declined to include him, deterred by his reputation for individualism, but Jones has given him a final lifeline.\nBrilliantly talented but also too often disruptive, the 30-year-old is leaving Wasps at the end of the season and is currently without a club.\nHe will travel as third-choice flyhalf behind George Ford and Owen Farrell, who captains the squad in the absence of the injured Dylan Hartley, though Cipriani could also feature at fullback.\n“I’ve watched him play closely and he’s done some things I’ve asked him to do in matches and deserves the opportunity,” said Jones, who has picked him for the first time. Rugby Union - England - Eddie Jones names South Africa squad - Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain - May 10, 2018 England head coach Eddie Jones during the press conference Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs\n“He’s got to prove he’s the best 10 or best 15 in the squad.”\nBilly Vunipola (Saracens) is recalled after recovering from injury having last played for England in the 2017 Six Nations. Mark Wilson (Newcastle Falcons) — a year after last featuring for England in the two Test series in Argentina — is also included.\nDanny Care (Harlequins), Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers), James Haskell (Wasps) and Richard Wigglesworth (Saracens) have been rested for the tour.\nJones denied that Shields’ selection reflected badly on the England pathway system which is designed to promote the best young English talent. “That is not my responsibility, it is to pick the best English-qualified players,” said Jones.\nNew-Zealand born Shields qualifies through his parents, both of whom come from England.\n“He’s a good hard working player, he plays for best team in southern hemisphere and is a considerable influence in their team. He’s a gritty player, a great back up to Chris Robshaw for us.”\nJones also confirmed that Australian Scott Wisemantel will join the coaching staff for the tour as an attack consultant. Rugby Union - England - Eddie Jones names South Africa squad - Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain - May 10, 2018 England head coach Eddie Jones during the press conference Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs\nEngland, coming off the back of three successive Six Nations defeats, will play South Africa in three Tests in Johannesburg (June 9), Bloemfontein (June 16) and Cape Town (June 23).\n“Our tour to South Africa will be the most exciting challenge for us as a group since 2016,” Jones said. “We have an opportunity to create some history next month and win the Test series, something no England side has done before.”\nEngland squad for South Africa Tour:\nBacks",
