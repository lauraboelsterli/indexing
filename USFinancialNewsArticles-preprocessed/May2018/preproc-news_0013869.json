(OTCQB:WLKR) (“Walker Innovation” or the “Company”), which seeks to develop and commercialize its unique portfolio of intellectual property assets through licensing and enforcement operations and is pursuing an effort to acquire one or more operating businesses, today announced first quarter 2018 results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nAs of March 31, 2018, Walker Innovation had in excess of $23 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and no outstanding long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet. Operating expenses were $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 49% reduction compared to the first quarter of 2017, and a 6% reduction compared to the previous quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company reported net loss for the first quarter of 2018 of $0.6 million, or ($0.03) per common share, compared to net loss of $1.2 million, or ($0.06) per common share, in the prior-year period.\n“Although we have continued to reduce our operating expenses, our primary focus remains identifying and assessing acquisitions and other opportunities that can create shareholder value,” said Jonathan Siegel, Chief Executive Officer.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nWalker Innovation reported no revenue for both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. As previously stated, the timing and results of patent prosecution and the Company’s enforcement proceedings relating to its intellectual property rights will fluctuate from period to period and is unpredictable.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter 2018 were approximately $0.7 million, including costs associated with patent prosecution and maintenance, versus $1.2 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to reduced overhead by eliminating positions and streamlining processes to conserve cash across its business.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.6 million compared to net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $1.2 million. Net loss per common share for the first quarter of 2018 was ($0.03), compared to net loss per common share of ($0.06) for the first quarter of 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, Walker Innovation had $23.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and no outstanding long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain certain “forward-looking statements” that reflect the Company’s current expectations and projections about its future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.
