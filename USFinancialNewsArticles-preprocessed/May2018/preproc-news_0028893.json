Representatives from Cisco Systems Inc, Western Digital Corp, Honeywell International Inc and Herbalife Nutrition Ltd were also present.\nWashington and Beijing have proposed tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks, fanning worries of a full-blown trade war that could hurt global supply chains and dent business investment plans.
