    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sanford Heisler Sharp, LLP, has amended its $300 million gender discrimination complaint against Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart, P.C. (\"Ogletree\"). The case is in U.S District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. The Amended Complaint includes the addition of three former shareholders who have 'opted-in' to the collective claim that Ogletree violated the Equal Pay Act by paying female shareholders less than their male counterparts. Ogletree is alleged to have violated the Equal Pay Act through a discriminatory compensation system that resulted in women receiving significantly less compensation for similar work.\n\"Many current and former shareholders have reached out to our firm to discuss their experiences while at Ogletree,\" said David Sanford, Chairman of Sanford Heisler Sharp and lead counsel in the case. \"We anticipate a second amended complaint in the near future.\"\nThe Amended Complaint also adds two additional individual defendants, Charles Matthew Keen and Kim Ebert, the current and former managing shareholders of Ogletree, respectively, and adds new claims against these two defendants for breach of fiduciary duty. Ms. Knepper, the named plaintiff in the case, alleges that these individual shareholders, along with Ogletree management, owed a fiduciary duty not to discriminate or retaliate against shareholders on the basis of sex, and that they breached that duty by maintaining a discriminatory system of compensation, credit allocation, and opportunity for promotion, among other things.\nThe Amended Complaint also notes that since filing her initial complaint on January 11, 2018, Ms. Knepper has left Ogletree to join Buchalter as a shareholder.\nAbout Sanford Heisler Sharp, LLP\nSanford Heisler Sharp, LLP is a public interest class-action litigation law firm with offices in Baltimore, MD; New York; Washington, D.C; Nashville; San Francisco, and San Diego.
