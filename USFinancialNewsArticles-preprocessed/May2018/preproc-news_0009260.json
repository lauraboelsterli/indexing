    "text": "DALLAS, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc. (NYSE:NXRT) reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nNXRT reported Net Income, FFO 1 , Core FFO 1 and AFFO 1 of $10.1M, $7.7M, $8.3M and $9.5M, respectively, attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, Same Store properties average effective rent, total revenue and NOI 1 increased 3.9%, 3.6% and 5.9%, respectively, over the prior year period. The weighted average effective monthly rent per unit across all 32 properties held as of March 31, 2018 (the \"Portfolio\"), consisting of 11,471 units, was $958, while physical occupancy was 94.0%. NXRT paid a first quarter dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock on March 29, 2018. During the first quarter, NXRT completed the disposition of Timberglen for gross sales proceeds of $30.0 million. In February 2018, NXRT used $8.6 million of proceeds from the Timberglen sale to pay the remaining outstanding balance on the bridge facility with KeyBank National Association (the \"2017 Bridge Facility\"), which retired the bridge facility. During the first quarter, for the properties in our Portfolio, NXRT completed 298 full and partial upgrades and leased 167 upgraded units, achieving $95 average monthly rent premiums and a 21.2% ROI 2 . Since inception, for the properties in our Portfolio, we have completed 4,527 full and partial upgrades and achieved a $90 average monthly rental increase per unit, equating to a 21.2% ROI on all units leased as of March 31, 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, NXRT repurchased 203,953 shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $5,058,000, or $24.80 per share. As of March 31, 2018, NXRT had repurchased a total of 558,470 shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $12,079,000, or $21.63 per share. On February 12, 2018, NXRT's board of directors, including its independent directors, unanimously approved a renewal of the Advisory Agreement with NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. (the \"Adviser\") for a one-year term that expires on March 16, 2019.\n\"We achieved a strong start for the year in the first quarter, maintaining a steady pace of revenue growth while limiting controllable operating expense inflation. The Company strategically disposed of Timberglen for gross sale proceeds of $30.0 million, retired the 2017 Bridge Facility, and bought back over 200,000 shares at appreciable discounts to our internal Net Asset Value projection,\" according to NXRT's Chairman and President, Jim Dondero. \"Management remains bullish on the fundamentals for well-located workforce housing in the Southeast and Southwest and we will keep working methodically to produce strong financial performance.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues were $35.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $37.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $10.1 million, or earnings of $0.47 per diluted share, which included $13.7 million of gain on sale of real estate and $11.4 million of depreciation and amortization expense. This compared to a net loss of $(3.6) million, or $(0.17) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017, which included $12.4 million of depreciation and amortization expense. The change in our net income (loss) between the periods primarily relates to increases in gain on sale of real estate and same store operating results, and was partially offset by increases in corporate general and administrative expenses and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. For the first quarter of 2018, NOI¹ was $19.1 million on 32 properties, compared to $19.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 on 40 properties. For the first quarter of 2018, Same Store NOI¹ increased 5.9% to $16.5 million, compared to $15.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, FFO¹ totaled $7.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $8.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, Core FFO¹ totaled $8.3 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $8.1 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, AFFO¹ totaled $9.5 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $9.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\n1.\nFFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI are non-GAAP measures. For reconciliations of FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI to net income, and a discussion of why we consider these non-GAAP measures useful, see the \"Definitions and Reconciliations\" section of this release.\n2.\nWe define Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as the sum of the actual rent premium divided by the sum of the total cost.\nSame Store Results of Operations\nThere are 29 properties encompassing 10,123 units of apartment space in our same store pool for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (our \"Same Store\" properties). As of March 31, 2018, our Same Store properties were approximately 94.1% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $933. As of March 31, 2017, our Same Store properties were approximately 94.6% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $899.\nThe following table reflects the revenues, property operating expenses and NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 for our Same Store and Non-Same Store properties (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\nRevenues\nSame Store\nRental income\n$\n26,167\n$\n25,183\n$\n984\n3.9\n%\nOther income\n3,996\n3,943\n53\n1.3\n%\nSame Store revenues\n30,163\n29,126\n1,037\n3.6\n%\nNon-Same Store\nRental income\n4,406\n6,725\n(2,319)\n-34.5\n%\nOther income\n488\n1,140\n(652)\n-57.2\n%\nNon-Same Store revenues\n4,894\n7,865\n(2,971)\n-37.8\n%\nTotal revenues\n35,057\n36,991\n(1,934)\n-5.2\n%\nOperating expenses\nSame Store\nProperty operating expenses (1)\n7,723\n7,565\n158\n2.1\n%\nReal estate taxes and insurance\n4,033\n4,079\n(46)\n-1.1\n%\nProperty management fees (2)\n911\n874\n37\n4.2\n%\nProperty general and administrative expenses (3)\n1,024\n1,047\n(23)\n-2.2\n%\nSame Store operating expenses\n13,691\n13,565\n126\n0.9\n%\nNon-Same Store\nProperty operating expenses (4)\n1,130\n2,301\n(1,171)\n-50.9\n%\nReal estate taxes and insurance\n823\n886\n(63)\n-7.1\n%\nProperty management fees (2)\n143\n239\n(96)\n-40.2\n%\nProperty general and administrative expenses (5)\n143\n308\n(165)\n-53.6\n%\nNon-Same Store operating expenses\n2,239\n3,734\n(1,495)\n-40.0\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n15,930\n17,299\n(1,369)\n-7.9\n%\nNOI\nSame Store\n16,472\n15,561\n911\n5.9\n%\nNon-Same Store\n2,655\n4,131\n(1,476)\n-35.7\n%\nTotal NOI (6)\n$\n19,127\n$\n19,692\n$\n(565)\n-2.9\n%\n(1)\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes approximately $23,000 and $0, respectively, of casualty-related expenses.\n(2)\nFees incurred to an unaffiliated third party that is an affiliate of the noncontrolling limited partner of NexPoint Residential Trust Operating Partnership, L.P.

We used $8.6 million of the proceeds from the sale to pay the remaining $8.6 million outstanding on our 2017 Bridge Facility, which retired the bridge facility.

These non-GAAP measures should be used as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP. For a more complete discussion of FFO, Core FFO, AFFO, and NOI, see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nThis press release also includes an analysis of our Same Store properties, which are defined as those that are stabilized and comparable for both the current and the prior reporting periods. Same Store analysis for the first quarter includes 29 properties totaling 10,123 units, or approximately 88% of our Portfolio.\nNet Operating Income\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) advisory and administrative fees, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate general and administrative expenses, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us, (7) casualty-related expenses/(recoveries), and (8) property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on behalf of NXRT at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nThe following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of noncontrolling interests, reconciles our NOI and Same Store NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n$\n10,094\n$\n(3,304)\nAdjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to NOI:\nAdvisory and administrative fees\n1,838\n1,825\nCorporate general and administrative expenses\n1,813\n1,333\nCasualty-related expenses\n(1)\n24\n5\nProperty general and administrative expenses\n(2)\n380\n231\nDepreciation and amortization\n11,372\n12,443\nInterest expense\n6,797\n7,159\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs\n551\n—\nGain on sale of real estate\n(13,742)\n—\nNOI\n$\n19,127\n$\n19,692\nLess Non-Same Store\nRevenues\n(4,894)\n(7,865)\nOperating expenses\n2,239\n3,734\nSame Store NOI\n$\n16,472\n$\n15,561\n(1)\nAdjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property operating expenses that are casualty-related expenses.\n(2)\nAdjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nFFO, Core FFO and AFFO\nWe believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), Core FFO, and AFFO are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT.\nSince the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with net income (loss) before adjusting for amounts attributable to (1) noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures and (2) redeemable noncontrolling interests in the OP; we show the combined amounts attributable to such noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders. Core FFO makes certain adjustments to FFO, which are either not likely to occur on a continuing basis or are otherwise not representative of the continuing operating performance of our portfolio.\nCore FFO adjusts FFO to remove items such as acquisition expenses, losses on extinguishment of debt and modification costs (includes prepayment penalties incurred and the write-off of unamortized deferred loan costs related to the early retirement of debt and costs incurred in connection with a debt modification that are expensed), the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining short-term debt financing, the ineffective portion of fair value adjustments on our interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe Core FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nAFFO makes certain adjustments to Core FFO. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. AFFO adjusts Core FFO to remove items such as equity-based compensation expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining long-term debt financing, and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nThe effect of the conversion of OP Units held by noncontrolling limited partners is not reflected in the computation of basic and diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share, as they are exchangeable for common stock on a one-for-one basis. The FFO, Core FFO and AFFO allocable to such units is allocated on this same basis and reflected in the adjustments for noncontrolling interests below. As such, the assumed conversion of these units would have no net impact on the determination of diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share.\nWe believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. While FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income (loss) as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO, Core FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do.\nThe following table reconciles our calculations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n$\n10,094\n$\n(3,304)\nDepreciation and amortization\n11,372\n12,443\nGain on sale of real estate\n(13,742)\n—\nAdjustment for noncontrolling interests\n(23)\n(1,123)\nFFO attributable to common stockholders\n7,701\n8,016\nFFO per share - basic\n$\n0.37\n$\n0.38\nFFO per share - diluted\n$\n0.36\n$\n0.38\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs\n551\n—\nChange in fair value on derivative instruments - ineffective portion\n—\n20\nAmortization of deferred financing costs - acquisition term notes\n21\n94\nAdjustment for noncontrolling interests\n(2)\n(2)\nCore FFO attributable to common stockholders\n8,271\n8,128\nCore FFO per share - basic\n$\n0.39\n$\n0.39\nCore FFO per share - diluted\n$\n0.39\n$\n0.38\nAmortization of deferred financing costs - long term debt\n368\n438\nEquity-based compensation expense\n914\n608\nAdjustment for noncontrolling interests\n(4)\n(33)\nAFFO attributable to common stockholders\n9,549\n9,141\nAFFO per share - basic\n$\n0.45\n$\n0.43\nAFFO per share - diluted\n$\n0.45\n$\n0.43\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic\n20,987\n21,044\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n21,430\n21,293\nDividends declared per common share\n$\n0.25\n$\n0.22\nFFO Coverage - diluted\n1.44x\n1.71x\nCore FFO Coverage - diluted\n1.54x\n1.74x\nAFFO Coverage - diluted\n1.78x\n1.95x\nFFO was $7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $8.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.3 million. The change in our FFO between periods primarily relates to a decrease in total revenues of approximately $1.9 million and an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of approximately $0.6 million, and was partially offset by decreases in total property operating expenses of approximately $1.2 million and interest expense of approximately $0.4 million and adjustments for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nCore FFO was $8.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $8.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.2 million. The change in our Core FFO between periods primarily relates to an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of approximately $0.6 million, and was partially offset by decreases in amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining short-term debt financing of approximately $0.1 million and FFO.\nAFFO was $9.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $9.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.4 million. The change in our AFFO between periods primarily relates to increases in equity-based compensation expense of approximately $0.3 million and Core FFO.\nSame Store Properties\nWe review our stabilized multifamily communities on a comparable basis between periods.
