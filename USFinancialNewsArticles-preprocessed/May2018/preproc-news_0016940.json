    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 4:38 AM / Updated 32 minutes ago Swansea hoping for miracle to avoid relegation, says Carvalhal Reuters Staff 1 Swansea City’s defeat to Southampton on Tuesday means their Premier League survival depends on other teams but manager Carlos Carvalhal has not given up hope of a miracle. Soccer Football - Premier League - Swansea City v Southampton - Liberty Stadium, Swansea, Britain - May 8, 2018 Swansea City manager Carlos Carvalhal before the match REUTERS/Rebecca Naden\nManolo Gabbiadini’s 72nd minute winner almost certainly secured Southampton’s Premier League survival but left Swansea three points adrift of safety in 18th position with one league game left.\nWith Southampton’s goal difference better than Swansea’s by nine, it would take a remarkable swing against the south-coast club for them to drop out of the top flight.\nSwansea, on the other hand, need to win their final game against already relegated Stoke City and hope Huddersfield Town lose at Chelsea on Wednesday and at home to Arsenal on Sunday.\n“We still have a chance but we don’t depend on ourselves,” Carvalhal said, adding that the picture would become clearer after Wednesday.\n“After that, let’s see if a kind of miracle can happen.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
