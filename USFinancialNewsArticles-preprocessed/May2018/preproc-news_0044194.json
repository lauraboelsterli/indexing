Boeing , which sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers, jumped 3.3 percent, the biggest gainer on the Dow and providing the maximum support to the blue-chip index.\nAt 11:25 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 316.70 points, or 1.28 percent, at 25,031.79, the S&P 500 was up 19.20 points, or 0.71 percent, at 2,732.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 35.76 points, or 0.49 percent, at 7,390.10.’\nGeneral Electric rose 3.1 percent on an $11.1 billion deal to merge its transportation business with rail equipment maker Wabtec, which jumped about 5 percent to a near three-year high.\nStill, not all U.S. business leaders were happy with the trade war truce, with some cautioning that Washington would find it tough to rebuild momentum to address what they see as troubling Chinese policies.\nAK Steel and U.S. Steel both fell about 3.5 percent following a delay in implementing tariffs on Chinese imports.\nMicron surged 3.2 percent, the most on the S&P, after the chipmaker lifted its current-quarter forecast.\nThe easing of the trade dispute also boosted chipmakers, whose major clients include Chinese firms, with the Philadelphia chip index gaining 0.8 percent. The technology sector rose 0.7 percent.\nTesla jumped 3.9 percent on pricing of Model 3’s fully-loaded version and after brokerage Berenberg raised its already bullish price target.\nRegional lender MB Financial jumped 13.3 percent after agreeing to be bought for $4.87 billion by Fifth Third Bancorp, which fell 7.7 percent, the most on the S&P.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.61-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.79-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 32 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 135 new highs and 22 new lows.
