    "text": "TORONTO, May 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. (“Kirkland Lake Gold” or the “ Company ”) (TSX:KL) (NYSE:KL) (ASX:KLA) is pleased to announce that it has received acceptance from the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) to renew its normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”). The NCIB allows Kirkland Lake Gold to purchase up to 16,456,561 common shares of the Company (the “Shares”), representing 10% of the current issued and outstanding Shares in the public float as of May 15, 2018. As at May 15, 2018, the Company had 211,199,478 Shares issued and outstanding.\nPurchases of the Common Shares pursuant to the NCIB may be made through the facilities of the TSX and/or alternative Canadian trading systems, commencing on May 22, 2018 and ending on May 21, 2019, or such earlier time as the NCIB is completed or terminated by the Company. Any purchases made pursuant to the NCIB will be made in accordance with the rules of the TSX and will be made at market price at the time of purchase.\n­­The average daily trading volume for the six months’ period ended April 30, 2018, less prior NCIB purchases made on the TSX, was 799,839. Under the renewed NCIB, the maximum number of securities that the Company may purchase on a daily basis, other than block purchase exemptions, are 199,959 Common Shares. The actual number of Common Shares purchased for cancellation and the timing of such purchase will be determined by the Company. There cannot be any assurance as to how many Common Shares will ultimately be purchased for cancellation under the NCIB.\nThe Board of Directors of Kirkland Lake Gold has determined that the repurchase of Common Shares pursuant to the proposed NCIB presently constitutes an appropriate use of financial resources and would be in the best interest of Kirkland Lake Gold shareholders.\nUnder the previous NCIB, the Company sought and received approval from the TSX to purchase up to 15,186,571 Shares for the period of May 17, 2017 to May 16, 2018. The Company purchased 5,512,800 Shares pursuant to the previous NCIB in the last twelve months at an average price of C$14.12 per Share on the TSX and alternates.\nAbout Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd.\nKirkland Lake Gold Ltd. is a mid-tier gold producer that in 2018 is targeting over 620,000 ounces of gold production from mines in Canada and Australia. The production profile of the company is anchored from two high-grade, low-cost operations, including the Macassa Mine located in Northeastern Ontario and the Fosterville Mine located in the state of Victoria, Australia. Kirkland Lake Gold's solid base of quality assets is complemented by district scale exploration potential, supported by a strong financial position with extensive management and operational expertise.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains statements which constitute \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding the plans, intentions, beliefs and current expectations of Kirkland Lake Gold with respect to future business activities and operating performance.
