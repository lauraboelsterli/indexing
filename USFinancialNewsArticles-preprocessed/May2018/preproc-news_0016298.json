    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The quest to free Tommy and Kiko may have reached the end of the line.\nNew York state’s highest court on Tuesday rejected an appeal by the Nonhuman Rights Project seeking to transfer the chimpanzees to a sanctuary, and end their confinement in cages by private owners.\nBy a 5-0 vote, the court let stand a June 2017 ruling by an intermediate state appeals court in Manhattan that chimpanzees are not legal persons, and that it is up to legislators to decide what rights animals deserve.\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project believes chimpanzees are, like humans, entitled to bodily liberty, and has for several years sought to persuade courts to afford legal rights to the animals.\nThe group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nWhile agreeing with Tuesday’s outcome, Judge Eugene Fahey said the question of whether animals are entitled to writs of habeas corpus, entitling them to freedom from detention, touches on a “deep dilemma of ethics and policy” that must be addressed.\nHe said chimpanzees share at least 96 percent of their DNA with humans, and that eminent primatologists have said the animals have advanced cognitive skills including the abilities to recognize themselves, remember, plan, imitate, exercise self-control, and display compassion and humor.\n“While it may be arguable that a chimpanzee is not a ‘person,’ there is no doubt that it is not merely a thing,” Fahey wrote.\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project previously failed to win freedom for two chimpanzees from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. They moved after the school stopped using them for research.\nThe cases are In re: Nonhuman Rights Project Inc on behalf of Tommy v Lavery et al, and In re: Nonhuman Rights Project Inc on behalf of Kiko v Presti et al, New York Court of Appeals, Motion No. 2018-268.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ",
