FILE PHOTO: Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak attend a news conference at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser/File Photo\nSaudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said the easing of restrictions would be gradual in order not to shock the market.\nRussian minister Alexander Novak said current cuts were in reality 2.7 million barrels per day due to a drop in Venezuelan production - somewhere around one million barrels per day higher than the initially agreed cuts of 1.8 million bpd.\nHe declined to say however whether OPEC and Russia could decide to boost output by one million bpd at their meeting on June 22.
