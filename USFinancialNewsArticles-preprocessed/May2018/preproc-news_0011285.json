    "text": "TORONTO, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Braveheart Resources Inc. (TSX Venture:BHT) (\"Braveheart\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has appointed Ian Berzins to the position of Chief Executive Officer and Doug Porter to the position of Chief Financial Officer, replacing Alex Falconer who has left the Company. Mr. Berzins will also join the Company's Board of Directors. Braveheart believes that both gentlemen bring valuable expertise to the Company’s operations as it moves forward to explore and develop its Alpine Mine property (“the Property”) near Nelson in southeastern British Columbia.\nMr. Berzins holds a B.Sc. in Mining Engineering from Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario and is a registered Professional Engineer in Alberta and British Columbia. He has more than 35 years of experience in all facets of the mining industry including engineering, operations, maintenance, human resources and senior management. Most recently Mr. Berzins was Vice President and GM at the Mount Milligan copper-gold mine in BC. He previously held the positions of President, CEO and COO at the Rice Lake underground gold mine in Manitoba. Mr. Berzins is a strong advocate for First Nations and local community participation in mineral exploration and mining. Of particular note is the fact of his having managed three complex underground gold mines in Canada including the Con Mine, Lupin Mine and Rice Lake Mine.\nMr. Porter has a wide range of experience in mining finance both in Canada and internationally, including gold, minerals, coal and oil sands. He holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Calgary, Alberta and is a Chartered Accountant as well as a Chartered Business Valuator. Since 1997 Mr. Porter has been the Managing Director of Porter Valuations Inc., a specialty business firm providing valuations and financing consulting services. He also holds the position of CFO for two other junior mining companies and a privately held mineral explorer located in Colombia. He is on the Board of Directors for the private company and one of the public companies.\nDavid Johnston, Chairman of the Board, stated “These men have a wealth of experience as mine builders and operators. They are joining Braveheart at a critical juncture in time as we unlock the vast potential of the past producing Alpine gold mine”. Phil Keele, President added “I look forward to working closely with Ian and Doug and welcome their appointments as we broaden and strengthen the depth of our management team and better prepare for the advancement of our Alpine property\".\nThe 2,177-hectare Property is approximately 20 km northeast of Nelson within which is the Alpine Mine, a former operating underground mine with a recorded production of approximately 17,000 tonnes between 1938 and 1948. This material contained approximately 11,500 oz of gold, 7,200 oz of silver, 49 tonnes of lead and 17 tonnes of zinc. The source of this information is from the following report: \" Little, H.W., (1960): Nelson map-area, west-half, British Columbia Nelson map-area, west half, British Columbia; Geological Survey of Canada, Memoir 308\". This excerpt was included in a report prepared for the previous owner of the property by Bernhardt Augsten, P.Geo. a Qualified Person under the definition of National Instrument 43-101.\nBraveheart carried out a comprehensive exploration program on the Alpine Mine property in 2017. The program included helicopter assisted diamond drilling, road rehabilitation, prospecting, sampling of old mine workings and dumps to corroborate technical information from work done on the Property by previous owners. A total of 11 holes were completed totaling close to 1,600m. The results from the 2017 program were combined with previous historical data and a National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report was published outlining an Inferred Resource of 142,000 oz of gold averaging 16.5 g/t Au using a cut-off grade of 5 g/t. The NI 43-101 resource report was announced on January 22, 2018 and the Company filed the complete report on SEDAR on March 8, 2018.\nThe Company has an ambitious program for 2018 and has submitted an application for an extensive work program for the Alpine Mine property that includes 3,500m of diamond drilling, access road upgrades, general surface exploration and background data collection for environmental study purposes. A Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA) is currently being developed with completion anticipated early in Q3, 2018.\nAbout Braveheart Resources Inc.\nBraveheart is a Canadian based junior exploration company focused on building shareholder wealth through aggressive exploration in a favorable and proven mining jurisdiction - the West Kootenays in southeast British Columbia (silver and gold). Braveheart's shares are listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol BHT.V.
