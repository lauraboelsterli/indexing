    "text": "4 COMMENTS A Northern California ranch owned by the descendants of the late Dean Witter, founder of the eponymous investment bank, is asking $31 million.\nCalled Lone Pine Ranch, the roughly 27,000-acre property spans Trinity and Mendocino counties, about a six-hour drive from San Francisco. The approximately 5,300-square-foot main house has 10 bedrooms and five bathrooms. Expanded by the Witters, it has changed little over the years. “You walk into the house and there’s a sense of being whisked away back in time,” said Brooks Witter, Mr. Witter’s great-grandson.\nThe property includes timber and cattle operations as well as approximately 16½ miles of the Eel River. The roughly 800 cow-calf pairs are for sale separately, along with the equipment. There are also four other homes, two bunkhouses, barns, sheds and corrals. The area is home to elk, blacktail deer, pig, bear and quail.\nMore from Mansion\nAOL’s Steve Case Sells Estate to Saudi Government For $43 Million May 30, 2018 Northern California Ranch of the Late Dean Witter Asks $31 Million May 30, 2018 Ben Affleck Lists Private Georgia Compound for $8.9 Million May 30, 2018 Mr. Witter and his wife, Helen, assembled the ranch from three separate purchases in 1942. The couple used the property as both a working ranch and a personal retreat, according to family members. “It’s been a place where a lot of Witters have grown up in ways that we would not have, had we not had the experience of these trips to the ranch,” said Mr. Witter, age 42, a psychotherapist in Boulder, Colo.\nThe family is selling the ranch as “it feels like the time is right,” said Mr. Witter. “We’ve enjoyed this property for 76 years.” He said there are currently 13 owners.\nBill McDavid of Hall and Hall shares the listing with Kevin Sullivan of Kevin Sullivan Realty , and Jim Redd of Four Star Realty. Also available is the Witters’ 3,019-acre White Ranch, which sits across the Kekawaka Creek from Lone Pine and has an asking price of $4.95 million. Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Redd share that listing.\nWrite to Sarah Tilton at sarah.tilton@wsj.com",
