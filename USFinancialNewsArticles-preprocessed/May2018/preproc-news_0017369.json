    "text": "Exceeded All Guidance Metrics; Increased Full-Year Guidance\nNIWOT, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ: CROX), a world leader in innovative casual footwear for men, women, and children, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nAndrew Rees, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The year is off to a strong start, with first quarter results exceeding guidance on all metrics. Our Spring/Summer 2018 collection is being well-received, and our LiteRide launch surpassed our expectations. We continue to successfully execute against our strategic priorities and are increasing our guidance. We now expect full year revenues to be up low single digits, as double-digit e-commerce growth and moderate wholesale growth more than offset the decline in retail revenues associated with our store closure plan.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results:\nRevenues were $283.1 million, growing 5.7% over the first quarter of 2017, or 0.7% on a constant currency basis. Top line growth was achieved despite the loss of approximately $12 million due to operating fewer stores and business model changes. E-commerce grew 24.1%, wholesale grew 6.5%, and the retail channel delivered positive comparable store sales of 7.6%. Gross margin was 49.4%, declining 50 basis points from last year’s first quarter. At the beginning of the first quarter, the Company changed its inventory costing methodology from average cost to first-in-first-out, or FIFO. This change resulted in a timing-related charge to cost of sales in the first quarter, but will have no impact on the full year. Absent this charge, first quarter gross margin would have been up modestly to prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $114.0 million compared to $118.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. As a percent of revenues, SG&A improved 380 basis points and represented 40.2% of revenues. First quarter 2018 results included $2.5 million of non-recurring charges associated with our SG&A reduction plan compared to $2.2 million in last year’s first quarter. Income from operations of $25.9 million increased 66.4% compared to $15.6 million in last year’s first quarter. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $12.5 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to $7.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in last year’s first quarter. We had 71.7 million and 74.6 million weighted average diluted common shares outstanding on March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights:\nCash used in operating activities decreased 6.6% to $46.6 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $49.9 million during the first quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 increased 14.7% to $102.0 million compared to $88.9 million as of March 31, 2017. This growth reflects the successful execution of the Company’s strategic objectives along with improved working capital management. Inventory declined 17.0% to $148.2 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $178.5 million as of March 31, 2017, reflecting the Company’s continued focus on inventory management. Capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2018 were $1.7 million compared to $5.4 million during the same quarter in 2017, as the Company opened fewer stores, completed fewer store remodels, and incurred lower technology-related expenditures. At March 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding against the Company’s $100 million credit facility. This compares to $3.5 million of borrowings at March 31, 2017.\nShare Repurchase Activity:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of its common stock for $20.1 million, at an average price of $14.32 per share. At March 31, 2018, $198.8 million of the Company’s $500 million share repurchase authorization remained available for future share repurchases.\nClosure of Company-Operated Mexico Manufacturing and Distribution Facilities:\nIn connection with ongoing efforts to simplify the business and improve profitability, the Company has made the decision to close its manufacturing and distribution facilities in Mexico. Manufacturing has ceased, and the distribution center will be closed by the end of the third quarter. Related one-time charges are identified in the Company’s second quarter and full year SG&A guidance.\nFinancial Outlook:\nSecond Quarter 2018:\nWith respect to the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects:\nRevenues of $315 to $325 million compared to $313.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. Gross margin to be slightly above last year’s 54.2% rate. SG&A to be approximately flat with $140.4 million last year. Non-recurring charges incurred in connection with our SG&A reduction plan are estimated at $1 million, compared to $1.8 million in last year’s second quarter. In addition, the Company will incur approximately $5.0 million of non-recurring charges in connection with the closure of its Mexico manufacturing and distribution facilities.\nFull Year 2018:\nWith respect to 2018, the Company now expects:\nRevenues to increase low single digits over 2017 revenues of $1,023.5 million, as we expect double digit e-commerce growth and moderate wholesale growth to more than offset lower retail revenues due to operating fewer stores and business model changes. Gross margin to be up approximately 70 to 100 basis points over 2017 gross margin of 50.5%. SG&A to be approximately $485 million. This includes approximately $15 million of non-recurring charges. Approximately $5 million of the non-recurring charges relate to the SG&A reduction plan. Approximately $10 million relate to the closure of the Mexico manufacturing and distribution facilities, with approximately half being non-cash. 2017 SG&A was $499.9 million, including $17.0 million of non-recurring charges. Income from operations to be approximately $50 million compared to $17.3 million in 2017. Depreciation and amortization to be approximately $30 million compared to $33.1 million in 2017. Income tax expense of approximately $17 million compared to $7.9 million in 2017.\nConference Call Information:\nA conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results is scheduled for today, Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. EDT.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), we present certain information related to our current period results of operations through “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior year comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nManagement uses non-GAAP results to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and other users of our condensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool for evaluating operating performance. We believe they also provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our operations. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCROCS, INC.

Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening.
