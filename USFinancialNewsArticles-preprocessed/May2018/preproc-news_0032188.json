Photo: Sasha Maslov for The Wall Street Journal Brian Koppelman is miserable when he doesn’t write. And he didn’t write until he was 30.\n“My desire to be better than I was, my desire to be perfect on the page, my knowledge that I would fail to be as good as I wished as I was,” he says, “stopped me from doing the work.”\nDoing the work helped him overcome his fear of it. For two hours every morning, whether he wanted to or not, Mr. Koppelman and his writing partner, David Levien, worked on a movie script about two poker-playing friends. Mr. Koppelman, who spent his 20s working in the record industry, says it was transformative.\n“Those two hours changed me,” he says. “I was finally facing this thing that scared the shit out of me, and I was trying every day to do it.”\nHis career changed, too. After many rejections, the script eventually sold and became the 1998 movie “Rounders,” starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton. In the two decades since, there have been successes, such as writing “Ocean’s 13,” and disappointments, from flopped movies (“Runner Runner”) to being fired by Martin Scorsese from the showrunner job on HBO’s “Vinyl.” (Mr. Scorsese’s representative didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Showtime is now airing the third season of “Billions,” for which he and Mr. Levien are executive producers, co-creators and showrunners.\nAlong the way, Mr. Koppelman launched “The Moment,” a podcast in which he invites people who create things—actors, musicians, writers, chefs—to talk about their career paths. Guests range from well-known names like the novelist John Grisham , who recounted the initial commercial failure of “A Time to Kill,” to behind-the-scenes types like screenwriter Eric Heisserer , who detailed the years of rejections he waded through en route to an Oscar nomination for “Arrival.”\nMr. Koppelman interviews Food Network host Guy Fieri for 'The Moment.’ Photo: Rebecca Brooks Mr. Koppelman, 52 years old, spoke with the Journal about rejection, failure and what comes next. Here are edited excerpts:\nYou seem genuinely curious about how people have made it in creative fields. Is that because there are so few replicable paths to success?\nI only will put people on the show if I’m fascinated by their story or their work, ideally both.\nWhat I hope happens in those conversations is that the audience realizes how much dedication, craft, work and rigor goes into what these people have accomplished. These are talented people, but not one of them is just like, “Yeah, I’m talented and it all came easily.”\nWhy is failure such intriguing territory for you?\nIt feels like a death. But what these stories of the people on the podcast show me over and over is that almost all failures are only temporary and can be used as fuel to get you to the next success.\nThat’s not just a platitude. We have hundreds of examples of people figuring it out, like Dave Chang almost not being able to keep his payroll at Ssäm Bar, then they redo the whole thing and boom, it succeeds.\nHow have you used failure as fuel in your career?\nWhen I was younger I certainly used business rejections as a way to stoke a kind of anger and determination, but I don’t do that anymore. I feel like anger works really well when you’re young, but when you’re old, if you keep using it, I don’t think it burns clean.\nInfluencers\nCarol Burnett, In Charge Again (May 2) Judd Apatow: The King of Comedy Mentors (March 10) Imran Amed: How to Fix the Fashion Industry (Feb. 13)\nWas there any correlation between losing the “Vinyl” job and “Billions” happening?\nOnly in that it made us determined to write our own thing next. Because “Vinyl” was never our project.\nHow do you differentiate between rejection and failure?\nWell, “Runner Runner” there was no rejection, it was just a failure. Rejection doesn’t equal failure at all. I think those are entirely different things. I’m only now interested in failure for its impermanence. It’s not romantic to me. What I’ve come to view it as is just a stop along the way, unless you let it be a final stop.\nHow do you talk people down after and during failure in a way that’s not Pollyanna-ish?\nJust do the thing. If you’re a singer or you’re a songwriter, find a way to do that thing for an hour a day in a way where no one else is judging you, where you’re not asking anyone else for permission, where you’re not trying to get an agent to say yes or a music publisher to say yes or someone to book you into their club. Find an hour where you’re just doing the thing. And you’re not just doing it casually, you’re dreaming and then you’re working with rigor to realize that dream. If you have that time, I believe you will come alive again, and that soon whatever that failure was just won’t loom so large because this new thing you’re doing will start to loom larger, and will start to gain momentum, and will start to push you forward.\nNow that you’ve reached a level of success that won’t quickly be taken away, what kind of failures do you continue to experience and that you’re on the lookout for?\nYou’re a writer, so you know: the failure of not being as you hope you can be on the page.\nWho Is He?\nName : Brian Koppelman What He Does : Screenwriter, showrunner, producer, host of “The Moment” How He Got There : Worked as an A&R man for record labels while he wrote his first screenplay, “Rounders,” with his childhood friend and collaborator, David Levien. His Big Break : “Rounders” opened up the door to a writing and producing career that has led to three—going on four—seasons as the co-creator and showrunner of “Billions.” In “The Moment,” he mines the stories of success and failure from creatives like Jon Bon Jovi, Amy Schumer and Salman Rushdie. His Obsession : Morning pages, a daily exercise in Julia Cameron’s book “The Artist’s Way.” “When David Levien gave me that book, and then I started doing the exercises in it, it freed me from [my] perfectionism.”",
