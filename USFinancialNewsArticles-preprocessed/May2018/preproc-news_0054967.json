    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 10:23 AM / Updated an hour ago U.N. urges Saudi-led coalition to speed Yemen imports, avoid starvation Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nGENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations aid chief has called on the Yemen government and Saudi-led coalition to loosen restrictions on imports of food and fuel through commercial ports into the war-wracked country, warning that millions more could face starvation. Mark Lowcock, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator (OCHA) attends a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n“I am particularly concerned about the recent decline of commercial food imports through the Red Sea ports. Pressure on the currency and a liquidity crisis in the Yemeni banking system make imports less viable for traders,” Mark Lowcock, U.N. emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement.Confidence among commercial shippers has eroded due to delays, “including as a result of inspections undertaken by the Saudi-led coalition after these vessels have been cleared by UNVIM,” he said, referring to the U.N. verification mechanism.
