    "text": "Closed the Drop Down acquisition of Buckthorn Solar from NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG) Maintaining 2018 financial guidance Refinanced the $495 million Revolving Credit Facility; extended maturity and improved cost of borrowing Declared 3.7% quarterly dividend increase to $0.309 per share in second quarter 2018; continue to target annualized dividend per share growth of 15% through 2018 Transaction with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) remains on track to close in the second half of 2018\nPRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NRG Yield, Inc. (NYSE:NYLD, NYLD.A) today reported first quarter 2018 financial results including Adjusted EBITDA of $189 million, Cash from Operating Activities of $65 million, and Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD) of $(4) million.\n\"With the GIP transaction remaining on schedule to close in the second half of the year, we continue to execute across the Company through ongoing growth with the closing of both the Buckthorn Solar and City of Tulare fuel cell acquisitions and the refinancing of NRG Yield's revolving credit facility,\" said Christopher Sotos, NRG Yield's President and Chief Executive Officer. “Despite lower than expected wind resource during the first quarter, the Company's results were in line with seasonal expectations and we are pleased to announce an increase in the quarterly dividend leaving NRG Yield on track to deliver 15% dividend per share growth through 2018.”\nOverview of Financial and Operating Results\nSegment Results 1\nTable 1: Net (Loss)/Income\n($ millions) Three Months Ended Segment 3/31/18 3/31/17 Conventional 27 20 Renewables (8 ) (3 ) Thermal 8 6 Corporate (27 ) (25 ) Net Loss — (2 ) Table 2: Adjusted EBITDA\n($ millions) Three Months Ended Segment 3/31/18 3/31/17 Conventional 66 62 Renewables 112 113 Thermal 16 15 Corporate (5 ) (4 ) Adjusted EBITDA 189 186 Table 3: Cash from Operating Activities and Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD)\nThree Months Ended ($ millions) 3/31/18 3/31/17 Cash from Operating Activities 65 64 Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD) (4 ) — For the first quarter of 2018, NRG Yield reported Adjusted EBITDA of $189 million, Cash from Operating Activities of $65 million, and CAFD of $(4) million. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA results were higher than 2017 primarily due to growth in the business-renewable focused distributed solar partnerships, higher availability at the El Segundo Energy Center, and favorable results in the solar portfolio, partially offset by lower wind production in 2018 versus first quarter 2017. CAFD results were lower than 2017 primarily due to lower wind production and lower distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by the acquisition of the 25% interest in NRG Wind TE Holdco.\nOperational Performance\nTable 4: Selected Operating Results\n(MWh and MWht in thousands) Three Months Ended 3/31/18 3/31/17 Equivalent Availability Factor (Conventional) 85.0% 83.7% Renewables Generation Sold (MWh) 1,616 1,677 Thermal Generation Sold (MWht) 22 Also includes Thermal MWh sold 626 578 In the first quarter of 2018, generation in the Renewables segment was below median expectations and 4% lower than the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower wind resources across the portfolio.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 5: Liquidity 3\n($ millions) 3/31/18 12/31/17 Cash and Cash Equivalents: NRG Yield, Inc. and NRG Yield LLC 40 24 Subsidiaries 133 124 Restricted Cash: Operating Accounts 38 25 Reserve Accounts 66 143 Total Cash 277 316 Revolver Availability 353 366 Total Liquidity 630 682 Total liquidity as of March 31, 2018 was $630 million, a decrease of $52 million from December 31, 2017. This reflects a decrease in total cash of $39 million 4 resulting primarily from the acquisition of Buckthorn Solar and common stock dividends paid. Revolver availability during the same period decreased by $13 million due to draws related to the acquisition of Buckthorn Solar offset by decreases in issued letters of credit.\nPotential future sources of liquidity include excess operating cash flow in the business, the $150 million at-the-market (ATM) program, of which $99 million remained available as of May 3, 2018, and availability under the corporate revolver. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company sold 936,662 shares of Class C common stock under the ATM program raising gross proceeds of approximately $16 million 5 .\nStrategic Sponsorship with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP)\nOn February 6, 2018, GIP entered into a purchase and sale agreement with NRG for the acquisition of NRG's full ownership interest in NRG Yield and NRG's renewable energy development and operations platform consisting of a robust pipeline of over 6.4 GW of backlog and development projects, as well as operational oversight of 2.4 GW across 17 states (the \"NRG Transaction\"). In connection with the NRG Transaction, NRG Yield entered into a Consent and Indemnity Agreement (the \"C&I Agreement\") with NRG and GIP setting forth the key terms and conditions of NRG Yield's Corporate Governance, Conflicts, and Nominating Committee's consent to the NRG Transaction. Refer to the Company's press release on February 7, 2018 for further details.\nThe NRG Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including customary legal and regulatory approvals. NRG Yield expects the NRG Transaction to close in the second half of 2018.\nGrowth Investments\nClosed the Buckthorn Solar Drop Down Asset Transaction with NRG\nOn March 30, 2018, the Company acquired the 154 MW Buckthorn Solar utility-scale project from NRG for cash consideration of $42 million, plus assumed non-recourse debt of approximately $131 million 6 . Buckthorn Solar will sell power under a 25-year PPA to the City of Georgetown, Texas starting in July 2018 when it is expected to achieve commercial operation. The purchase price was funded via revolver borrowings and cash on hand and is expected to deliver approximately $4 million 7 of average annual CAFD beginning in 2019.\nAcquired City of Tulare Fuel Cell Project\nOn April 18, 2018, the Company acquired the 2.8 MW Central CA Fuel Cell project located in Tulare, CA from FuelCell Energy, Inc. for $11 million. The project will sell electricity under a 20-year PPA with the City of Tulare and does not have project level non-recourse debt. The purchase price was funded via cash on hand and is expected to deliver approximately $1.2 million 8 of average annual CAFD.\nInvestment Partnerships with NRG Energy\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, NRG Yield invested approximately $6 million in the existing business-renewable focused distributed solar partnerships bringing total capital invested to $215 million 9 in the distributed solar investment partnerships. As of March 31, 2018, through the existing partnership agreements, NRG Yield owns approximately 262 MW 10 of distributed solar capacity with a weighted average contract life by CAFD of approximately 19 years.\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Thermal Project and Non-Recourse Thermal Financing\nOn October 31, 2016, NRG Business Services LLC, a subsidiary of NRG, and NRG Energy Center Pittsburgh LLC (NECP), a subsidiary of NRG Yield, entered into an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) agreement for the construction of an 80 MWt district energy system for NECP to provide steam, chilled water and emergency backup power service to UPMC. The initial term of the energy services agreement (under fixed capacity payments) with UPMC will be for a period of twenty years from the service commencement date. Pursuant to the terms of the EPC Agreement, NECP shall pay NRG Business Services LLC $88 million, subject to adjustment based upon certain conditions in the EPC Agreement, $84 million of which will be paid at substantial completion and $4 million of which will be paid at final completion. The project is expected to achieve commercial operations in the second quarter of 2018.\nIn connection with the UPMC project, NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC established shelf facilities for the anticipated issuances of $70 million of Series E notes and $10 million of Series F notes. The proceeds from the notes, if issued, will be utilized to make payments with respect to the EPC Agreement described above. The UPMC project, net of non-recourse financing, is expected to deliver approximately $4 million 11 in annual average CAFD starting in 2019.\nFinancing Updates\nRefinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility\nOn April 30, 2018, the Company closed the refinancing of the $495 million revolving credit facility, which extends the maturity of the facility to April 28, 2023 and decreases the Company's overall cost of borrowing at current leverage levels by 75 basis points to LIBOR + 175 basis points. The refinancing was led by JPMorgan Chase Bank as Sole Lead Arranger and the bank group continues to include eleven financial institutions. The facility will continue to be used for general corporate purposes including corporate working capital needs due to seasonality, financing of future acquisitions, and posting letters of credit.\nQuarterly Dividend Update\nOn April 24, 2018, NRG Yield’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on Class A and Class C common stock of $0.309 per share (approximately $1.24 per share annualized) payable on June 15, 2018, to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2018. This equates to a 3.7% increase over the prior quarter.\nSeasonality\nNRG Yield’s quarterly operating results are impacted by seasonal factors, as well as variability in renewable energy resources. The majority of NRG Yield’s revenues are generated from the months of May through September, as contracted pricing and renewable resources are at their highest levels in the Company’s core markets. The factors driving the fluctuation in Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Cash from Operating Activities, and CAFD include the following:\nHigher summer capacity prices from conventional assets; Higher solar insolation during the summer months; Higher wind resources during the spring months; Debt service payments which are made either quarterly or semi-annually; and Timing of maintenance capital expenditures and the impact of both unforced and forced outages.\nThe Company takes into consideration the timing of these factors to ensure sufficient funds are available for distribution on a quarterly basis.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nNRG Yield is maintaining 2018 full year financial guidance. This financial guidance does not include growth investments under evaluation or not yet completed. Financial guidance continues to be based on median renewable energy production estimates.\n($ millions) 2018 Full\nYear\nGuidance\nNet Income 125 Adjusted EBITDA 950 Cash from Operating Activities 599 Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD) 280 NRG Yield is targeting dividend per share growth of 15% annually on each of its Class A and Class C common stock through 2018.\nEarnings Conference Call\nOn May 3, 2018, NRG Yield will host a conference call at 9:15 a.m. Eastern to discuss these results.
