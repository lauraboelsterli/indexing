    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Shanghai stock exchange is cracking down on shareholders with controlling stakes in companies who pledge a high percentage of their holdings as collateral for financing, the China Securities Journal said on Friday, without citing sources.\nInvestors look at an electronic board showing stock information at a brokerage house in Shanghai, China, March 7, 2016. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo The practice has prompted regulatory concern that a sharp fall in share prices could lead to a sudden change in the controlling shareholders of firms, which could consequently destabilize the market.\nThe newspaper said the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) has\nasked controlling shareholders to disclose the share-backed loans they’ve taken out and to take measures to avoid a credit crisis.\nIn some cases, they have assisted investors in share disposals in “a safe way”.\nThe controlling shareholders of around 150 firms have pledged over 80 percent of their shares, the paper said.\nFor these companies, the SSE has delivered regulatory work letters to the relevant controlling shareholder and asked such investors to set aside funds to mitigate associated risks.\nThe SSE also looked into whether controlling shareholders had misdirected funds or breached guarantees, and initiated disciplinary procedures for a group of offenders.\nThe exchange is also finalizing new disclosure requirements on share pledges that will require the publication of associated credit arrangements, the paper said.\nReporting by Engen Tham and Wang Jing; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
