    "text": "KIRKLAND, Wash., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GrowLife, Inc. (OTCQB:PHOT), one of the nation’s most recognized indoor cultivation product and service providers, today announced that it has promoted Lauren Schmitt to Vice President of the company’s Consumer Division, which includes management of the company’s e-commerce sales platform in both the United States and Canada.\n“After working with Lauren for over five years, we are extremely confident that we have found the perfect addition to our leadership team to help facilitate further expansion of our direct to consumer sales channel,” said GrowLife CEO Marco Hegyi. “We have seen a major uptick in sales through our direct-to-consumer channels servicing the rapidly expanding indoor cultivation market under Lauren’s leadership. She completely understands the industry and our products as well as possesses the necessary skills to drive our team to maximum efficiency.”\nThe company’s consumer division has seen significant growth in recent months due to continued legalization of cannabis across the US and Canada. Currently eight states, accounting for more than 61 million people, allow anyone 21 years of age or older to grow cannabis plants in their home with an additional 9 states that allow cultivation with a medical recommendation. The consumer division offers products specifically designed for this type of legal indoor cultivation as well as offers educational resources for new and experienced home growers. The division will also continue to act as an e-logistics network for the thousands of current and potential commercial licensed cultivators across North America.\nSchmitt has proven that she will be the best person for the position having been with the company for six years and has been an integral part of the expansion of the direct-to-consumer sales channel to date -- acting previously as the company’s head of procurement and e-commerce platform. With a background in environmental science with an emphasis in plant and soil science, Schmitt has worked in executive level positions with various companies including launching a nationwide nutrient line where she ran store-to-store distribution and channel management. In her new role, Schmitt will focus on further expansion of the consumer sales channels and product offering, working closely with the product development division GrowLife Innovations, and increasing margins and profitability for the consumer division as a whole.\n“In this new role, I plan to capitalize on the momentum GrowLife is experiencing in its consumer division and empower our growing customer base with innovative solutions and resources for this emerging market,” Schmitt said. “In recent years consumer behavior has shifted toward favoring online purchasing -- and with recent legalization taking place across the country allowing for home-grown cannabis, I see a tremendous potential for growth within GrowLife’s consumer division.”\nFor more information about GrowLife, including the CEO’s most recent video statement, please visit the company’s website .
