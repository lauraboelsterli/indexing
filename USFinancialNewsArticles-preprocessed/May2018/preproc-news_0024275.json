Slideshow (4 Images)\nDejan Lovren made it 2-0 with a header just before the break and Salah then provided the assist for Dominic Solanke to rifle home his first goal for Liverpool just after halftime.\nAndrew Robertson fired home the fourth in the 85th minute as Liverpool rounded off a dominant display.\nWith the Champions League final against Real Madrid still to come, the win over Brighton put Liverpool in fourth place on 75 points, five clear of Chelsea who slumped to a 3-0 defeat away to Newcastle.
