    "text": "398 COMMENTS Iran’s theocratic regime may be facing even greater economic challenges than previously reported—perhaps even including a shortage of contemporary metaphors. Bloomberg reports :\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressed defiance of the U.S. with a side order of American pop culture, invoking the cat-and-mouse adventures of Tom and Jerry. “The U.S. has tried various political, economic, military and propaganda undertakings to hit the Islamic Republic” throughout its four decades, the nation’s top religious leader told a gathering of officials on Wednesday. But “all these plots failed. Like the famous cat in Tom and Jerry they will lose again.” For the millennials in the crowd, Bloomberg provides helpful context:\nIn the cartoon series created 78 years ago, the plucky mouse Jerry consistently outsmarted the larger cat Tom, although both did their best to torment each other. Khamenei’s comments, posted on his official website, were his first since U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s speech this week outlining a list of demands for Iran, including that the Persian Gulf nation permanently end its nuclear program and withdraws support for groups like the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah that the U.S. considers terrorists. The U.S. Government’s Radio Liberty reports that Mr. Khamenei’s comments “were not included in state television coverage of the address but were posted in English on his official website.” Radio Liberty adds:\nKhamenei’s reference to Tom and Jerry is ironic given the supreme leader has often warned of the dangers of American influence on Iranian culture. But there are obvious parallels to draw on: While the threat of ultimate destruction is always there, Tom seldom actually tries to eat Jerry; the two rarely, if ever, speak to each other; and both appear to take some pleasure from torturing each other. But there are flaws in the comparison as well. Jerry, for example, has often been portrayed as a devoted American patriot, as evidenced by the award-winning 1943 episode The Yankee Doodle Mouse, in which Tom does his best to snuff out Jerry’s ambitions to launch a rocket. It is perhaps comforting to think that, just like many Americans, the ayatollah enjoyed watching the Hanna-Barbera classic as a youngster. Of course that was well before Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution. So it’s chilling to wonder if he has this aged cartoon in mind now because his regime has become so adept at blocking more recent productions.\nMany of the productions that do appear on Iranian television are not at all entertaining. The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies writes : “During the recent protests in Iran, dissidents both inside and outside the country asked the U.S. government to enforce sanctions against Tehran’s state-run media enterprise,” the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, and its partners including Tasnim News, which “published pictures of individual protesters and asked its readers to identify them. Tasnim later published the forced confessions of jailed protesters.”\nProducing news or entertainment not approved by the regime can have severe consequences. United Nations Special Rapporteur Asma Jahangir, who monitored human rights in Iran, died earlier this year in her home country of Pakistan. Her final report noted that she “has continued to receive reports of the arbitrary arrest, detention, and harassment of journalists, media workers, and their families” in Iran. According to the report:\nAs at August 2017, Reporters without Borders estimated 27 journalists were imprisoned, and that 94 internet users, most of whom were Telegram users, had been arrested since the beginning of 2017. The organisation further documented threats to at least 50 journalists based abroad in the year ending September 2017. In April 2017, Special Procedures mandate holders raised concerns following the arrest and detention of eight journalists, members of political groups, social activists, and film producers. In its reply, the Government denied the concerns raised. Iran’s Ministry of Culture and Guidance is in charge of censorship and does its best to ensure that very little is reported about the dissidents who remain in its jails. But the regime still needs to worry about the dissidents outside its jails. Mark Dubowitz and Richard Goldberg recently wrote in the Journal:\nThe Trump administration has declared financial war on the Iranian regime. Given the seriousness of its currency emergency, it’s a good bet America will win. Iran’s economy is in crisis. Inflation is skyrocketing, banks are in turmoil, and Iranians protest daily against the regime’s ineptitude, corruption and foreign adventurism. The currency is collapsing. Here’s hoping that Tom and Jerry will be remembered long after Mr. Khamenei is forgotten.\n***\nFollow James Freeman on Twitter.\nSubscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.\nTo suggest items, please email best@wsj.com .\n(Lisa Rossi helps compile Best of the Web.)",
