    "text": "Pittsburgh, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TeleTracking Chairman and CEO Michael Zamagias announced today that Christopher Johnson , Chief Solutions Officer, has been promoted to President. Effective immediately, Mr. Johnson will have responsibility for the operational business units of TeleTracking, including sales and marketing, strategy and business development, technology and delivery services. Mr. Zamagias also formally confirmed that he will continue in his role as Chief Executive Officer for the company, and that TeleTracking remains committed to its mission of ensuring that no one will ever have to wait for the care they need.\nMr. Johnson joined TeleTracking nearly three years ago as Chief of Staff, and was then promoted to Chief Solutions Officer where he led the technology, product management, user experience and technology support teams, in addition to being responsible for the development of new patient flow solutions and the migration of the current portfolio to a single cloud-based platform. Prior to joining TeleTracking, Mr. Johnson held a number of technical leadership roles including Chief Technology Officer for GE Healthcare’s Global Asset Management & Hospital Operations portfolio.\n“Chris has made a tremendous impact during his tenure at TeleTracking and has a deep understanding of the culture of collaboration and teamwork that makes TeleTracking unique,” says Mr. Zamagias. “He also recognizes the challenges facing healthcare―that it is unacceptable for patients to wait for the care they need because of operating inefficiencies―and has a sharp vision for how TeleTracking can and will operationalize the care continuum. I’m extraordinarily confident in Chris’ ability to further advance TeleTracking’s leadership position and vision.”\n“For more than 25 years TeleTracking has been creating value and providing actionable data for the nation’s leading healthcare institutions―and we are well-positioned to help them continue to evolve with a scalable platform supported by unmatched expertise,” says Mr. Johnson. “I have unbridled enthusiasm for what we can accomplish—a future where operational complexities never stand between patients and their care.”\nAbout TeleTracking\nChristopher Johnson, President, TeleTracking\nFor every hour patients wait for care, they face objectively worse outcomes. TeleTracking believes it is unacceptable that patients are not able to access the care they need, when they need it, due to operating inefficiencies and unnecessary cost barriers. Our mission is simple, to ensure no one waits for the care they need. Named one of Becker’s “Great Places to Work” and a Pittsburgh Business Times “Corporate Citizenship Award” winner, TeleTracking delivers extraordinary outcomes that have been the subject of study by the RAND Corporation , and is the perennial KLAS Patient Flow Category Leader.
