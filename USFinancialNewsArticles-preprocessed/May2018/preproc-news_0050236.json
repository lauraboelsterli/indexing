    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cato Corporation (NYSE: CATO) today reported net income of $23.4 million or $.94 per diluted share for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018, compared to net income of $22.2 million or $.85 per diluted share for the first quarter ended April 29, 2017. Net income increased 5% and earnings per diluted share increased 11% for the quarter. Sales for the first quarter were $236.0 million, or a decrease of 1% from sales of $237.7 million for the first quarter ended April 29, 2017. The Company's same-store sales for the quarter decreased 1% to last year.\n\"We are starting to see more favorable sales trends as a result of adjustments to our merchandise strategy,\" stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. \"We remain optimistic about our ability to build on this momentum going forward.\"\nGross margin increased 1.0% to 39.7% of sales in the quarter, primarily due to higher merchandise margins and lower buying and occupancy costs. SG&A expenses as a percent of sales increased 1.1% to 28.0% during the quarter primarily due to higher incentive compensation and insurance costs offset by lower payroll expenses. The effective tax rate decreased to 11.9% versus the prior year at 14.7% due to ongoing tax saving initiatives and favorable tax adjustments in the quarter. The Company ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $222.3 million.\nAs of May 5, 2018, the Company operated 1,351 stores in 33 states, compared to 1,374 stores in 33 states as of April 29, 2017.\nThe Cato Corporation is a leading specialty retailer of value-priced fashion apparel and accessories operating three concepts, \"Cato,\" \"Versona\" and \"It's Fashion.\" The Company's Cato stores offer exclusive merchandise with fashion and quality comparable to mall specialty stores at low prices every day.
