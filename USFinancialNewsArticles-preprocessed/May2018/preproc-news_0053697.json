    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Thursday that it had not increased the already high-level of vigilance or changed its posture on North Korea after President Donald Trump called off a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n“There is a high state of vigilance - the state of vigilance that we always have because they have proven to be unpredictable in the past,” Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, joint staff director, said at a Pentagon briefing referring to North Korea.\n“But it is not a heightened state of vigilance. It is the normal state of vigilance that we maintain.”\nReporting by Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart Editing by Bill Trott\n ",
