Soccer Football - Champions League Final - Real Madrid v Liverpool - NSC Olympic Stadium, Kiev, Ukraine - May 26, 2018 Liverpool's Mohamed Salah looks dejected after sustaining an injury REUTERS/Hannah McKay\nSalah’s final ended prematurely in Kiev on Saturday after a first-half challenge from Real captain Sergio Ramos led to the 25-year-old leaving the pitch in tears, clutching his shoulder.\nLiverpool manager Juergen Klopp said that the injury “did not look good” after the match, but Salah posted on Sunday: “It was a very tough night, but I’m a fighter. Despite the odds, I’m confident that I’ll be in Russia to make you all proud. Your love and support will give me the strength I need.”\nOn Saturday the Egyptian FA also posted on Twitter that it is “optimistic” Salah would recover in time to travel to Russia.
