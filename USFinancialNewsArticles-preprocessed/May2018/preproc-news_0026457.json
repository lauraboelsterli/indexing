    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - A British parliamentary committee said on Thursday it had summonsed the former chief executive of Cambridge Analytica and a director of the official Brexit campaign group to appear before lawmakers.\nFile Photo: Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica arrives at the offices of Cambridge Analytica in central London, Britain, March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls The media committee has launched a fake news investigation but its inquiry has broadened to examine the role of Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, and Facebook in the Brexit vote and in the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nThe committee said it had asked former CEO Alexander Nix to appear in parliament on Wednesday, June 6. It has asked Dominic Cummings, a former director of Vote Leave, to appear on Tuesday, May 22.\nReporting by Kate Holton; Editing by William Schomberg\n ",
