    "text": "PepsiCo said on Friday it would buy baked fruit and vegetable snack maker Bare Foods, in a deal that underscores the company's efforts to strengthen its healthy snack portfolio.\nThe companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, but a source told CNBC that Pepsi will pay less than $200 million for the snack company.\nBare Foods sells Granny Smith apple chips, banana and coconut snacks and was founded in 2001 in a family owned organic apple farm in Washington .\nSource: Bare Toasted coconut snack from Bare. U.S. food companies have made a flurry of acquisitions in the snack food space as they seek to tap rising demand for snacks that have low salt content and are less processed.\nLast year, Kellogg said it would buy the owner of RXBAR protein bars for $600 million, while Campbell Soup acquired Snyder's-Lance, the maker of Cape Cod potato chips, in a $4.9 billion deal.\nBare Foods will operate independently and will report into Frito-Lay North America, Pepsi said.\nâ€” CNBC's Sara Eisen contributed to this report.",
