(CSE: EPW), a leading owner and operator of medical cannabis clinics in the US, today announced that Peter McDonough, one of the world’s leading brand and marketing executives, has joined its Board of Directors, effective immediately.\nMcDonough has more than 30 years leadership experience in building and managing some of the world’s most iconic brands. In 2015 McDonough completed his tenure as President, Chief Marketing Officer, and Chief Innovation Officer for Diageo North America, where his portfolio included the top two largest spirits brands in the world, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff, as well as 20 of the world’s top 100 spirits brands. With a market capitalization of $85 billion, Diageo is a global leader in beverage alcohol, owning renowned brands in spirits, beer, and wine.\nMcDonough previously served as Procter & Gamble’s Vice President of European Marketing for Duracell Batteries and Braun Appliances. Prior to his overseas work, he was Gillette’s head of North American marketing for the company’s flagship blade/razor and personal care business and introduced market-leading brands such as Mach3 Turbo and Venus Razors. Earlier in his career, he was Director of North American marketing at Black & Decker where he was involved in launching the DeWalt Power Tool Company. McDonough also has Board of Director experience relevant to Empower, as he currently serves on the advisory board of Viridian Capital Advisors, a financial advisory firm dedicated to the cannabis industry.\n“Peter McDonough brings Empower a strong base of expertise in building and managing global brands, along with a current and direct understanding of the medical cannabis market,” said Craig Snyder, Empower CEO. “As we look to rapidly expand Empower’s brand and value proposition throughout North America and beyond, Peter’s experience will be invaluable to our Board and to the entire company.”\n“Building a respected medical cannabis business requires an understanding of consumer motivations related to cannabis and its role in improving a patient’s health and well-being,” McDonough said. “As the benefits of medical cannabis become clearer, Empower is uniquely positioned to advance treatment in many important areas and build brand leadership based on best-in-class care for our patients. As a Board member, I’m excited to work with Empower to ensure our products lead the way in serving patients and position the organization among the industry’s most admired companies.”\nMcDonough is an alumnus of Cornell University and holds a Masters of Business Administration from the Wharton School of Business.\nABOUT EMPOWER\nEmpower is a leading owner and operator of medical cannabis clinics and developer of medical products in the US, focused on enabling individuals to improve and protect their health.
