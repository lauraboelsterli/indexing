    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced results for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30, 2018. The company adopted ASC 606 1 , ASC 340-40 2 and ASU 2016-01 3 in the first quarter, and these results reflect the impact of these standards. The company also provided re-casted financial results under ASC 606 and ASC 340-40.\n\"Salesforce delivered more than $3 billion in revenue in the first quarter, surpassing a $12 billion annual revenue run rate,\" said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO, Salesforce. \"Our relentless focus on customer success is yielding incredible results, including delivering nearly two billion AI predictions per day with Einstein.\"\nSalesforce delivered the following results for its fiscal first quarter:\nRevenue : Total first quarter revenue was $3.01 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year, and 22% in constant currency. Subscription and support revenues were $2.81 billion, an increase of 27% year-over-year. Professional services and other revenues were $196 million, an increase of 4% year-over-year.\nEarnings per Share : First quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.46, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.74. Mark-to-market accounting of the company's strategic investments, required by ASU 2016-01, benefitted GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.25 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.22.\nCash : Cash generated from operations for the first quarter was $1.47 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities finished the first quarter at $7.16 billion.\nUnearned Revenue : Unearned revenue, representing ASC 605 deferred revenue less the cumulative timing differences of recognized revenue from ASC 606 adoption, on the balance sheet as of April 30, 2018 was $6.20 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year, and 23% in constant currency.\nRemaining Transaction Price : Remaining transaction price, representing future revenues that are under contract but have not yet been recognized, ended the first quarter at approximately $20.4 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year. Current remaining transaction price, which represents the future revenues under contract expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, ended the first quarter at approximately $9.6 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year.\nAs of May 29, 2018, the company is initiating revenue, earnings per share, and unearned revenue guidance for its second quarter of fiscal year 2019. In addition, the company is raising its full fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, and updating its GAAP earnings per share guidance and operating cash flow guidance for its full fiscal year 2019, previously provided on April 2, 2018. The guidance below does not reflect the future impact of ASU 2016-01 and is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that reflect the company's currently available information, including the anticipated impact of the new Tax Act and interpretations thereof, as well as other factors and assumptions. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to recent acquisitions.\nQ2 FY19 Guidance\nFull Year FY19 Guidance\nRevenue\n$3.22 - $3.23 billion\n$13.075 - $13.125 billion\nY/Y Growth\n25%\n24% - 25%\nGAAP EPS\n($0.09) â€“ ($0.08)\n$0.49 - $0.51\nNon-GAAP EPS\n$0.46 - $0.47\n$2.29 - $2.31\nUnearned Revenue\nGrowth (y/y)\n22% - 23%\n(excluding MuleSoft)\nN/A\nOperating Cash Flow\nGrowth (y/y)\nN/A\n14% - 15%\nThe following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP earnings per share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance for the next quarter and the full year:\nFiscal 2019\nQ2\nFY2019\nGAAP (loss) EPS range*\n($0.09) - ($0.08)\n$0.49 - $0.51\nPlus\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n$ 0.18\n$ 0.61\nStock-based expense\n$ 0.45\n$ 1.66\nAmortization of debt discount, net\n$ 0.00\n$ 0.01\nLess\nIncome tax effects and adjustments**\n$ (0.08)\n$ (0.48)\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS***\n$0.46 - $0.47\n$2.29 - $2.31\nShares used in computing basic net income per share (millions)\n745\n747\nShares used in computing diluted net income per share (millions)\n770\n771\n* The Company's GAAP tax provision is expected to be (195.0%) for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 23.0% for the twelve months ended January 31, 2019.

These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating the company's performance.\nThe primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the company's results in the same way management does. Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the company's operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company's business. Further, to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the company's relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and the net amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes, as well as income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the company's long-term benefit over multiple periods.\nSpecifically, management is excluding the following items from its non-GAAP earnings per share, as applicable, for the periods presented in the Q1 FY19 financial statements and for its non-GAAP estimates for Q2 and FY19:\nStock-Based Expenses: The company's compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Acquired Leases: The company views amortization of acquisition- and building-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company's research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Amortization of Debt Discount: Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the company's $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes due in April 2018 that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rate was approximately 2.5% for the convertible notes due 2018, while the actual coupon interest rate of the notes was 0.25%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management's assessment of the company's operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Gains on Strategic Investments, net: Upon adoption of 2016-01, the company is required to record all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations. As a result of potential and unknown market volatility, the company excludes any potential future gains or losses on its strategic investment portfolio from its GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for future periods. Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisitions-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and amortization of debt discount. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and considers other factors including the company's expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates. For fiscal 2019, the company uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5 percent, which reflects currently available information, including the anticipated impact of the Tax Act and interpretations thereof, as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the company's ongoing analysis of the Tax Act over the measurement period, the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the company's geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the company's strategy or business operations. The company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate.\nThe company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. For this purpose, capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments, nor does it include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, and building - leased facilities.\n1 Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\"\n2 ASC 340-40 \"Other Assets and Deferred Costs â€“ Contracts with Customers\"\n3

The Company raised approximately $2.5 billion in a public offering of unsecured debt in April 2018 in connection with the acquisition of MuleSoft, Inc. which closed in May 2018. Total cash paid in May 2018 in connection with the acquisition was approximately $4.9 billion.\n(2) The strategic investment balance as of April 30, 2018 includes the fair value adjustments of the Company's publicly traded and privately held equity investments as the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, \"Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10)\" on February 1, 2018. See discussion below for further details on the fair value adjustments.\n(3) Prior period information has been adjusted for the adoption of Topic 606, which the Company adopted on February 1, 2018. Topic 606 introduced unearned revenue, which is substantially similar to deferred revenue under previous accounting guidance, except for the removal of the limitation on contingent revenue.\nSupplemental Revenue Analysis\nRemaining Transaction Price\nTopic 606 introduced remaining transaction price, which is different than unbilled deferred revenue under previous accounting guidance. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates.

Pronouncement\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" (\"ASU 2014-09\"), which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification, replaces existing revenue recognition guidance with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts. ASU 2014-09, as amended, was effective for the beginning of fiscal 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period.\nThe Company adopted the requirements of the new standard as of February 1, 2018, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. Adoption of the new standard resulted in changes to the Company's accounting policies for revenue recognition and costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, net. The Company applied the new standard using a practical expedient where the consideration allocated to the remaining performance obligations or an explanation of when it expects to recognize that amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before the date of the initial application is not disclosed.\nRefer to the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 9, 2018 for additional
