    "text": "BERLIN, May 14 (Reuters) - Germany’s Mutares aims to raise 26 million-32 million euros ($31 million-$38 million) from an initial public offering (IPO) of a stake in commercial vehicles supplier STS Group, below the 50 million it euros originally targeted.\nInvestors have taken a tougher line on price in IPOs recently, with German publisher Springer Nature cancelling a planned flotation this month due to weak demand.\nUnveiling details on Monday, Mutares said the STS Group IPO on June 1 would consist of 1 million new shares from a capital increase and up to 1 million shares currently owned by Mutares.\nThe holding company would still hold a 62 percent stake in STS after the IPO.\nThe price range for the shares is 26-32 euros, Mutares said, with the final offer price set to be published on May 29.\nIt had said in late April that it was aiming for proceeds from the cash capital increase of some 50 million euros.\nThe proceeds will be used to expand STS Group into China and North America, plus increase production in eastern Europe.\nHauck & Aufhauuser is acting as sole global coordinator and joint bookrunner, while Mainfirst is also joint bookrunner.\n$1 = 0.8353 euros Reporting by Victoria Bryan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
