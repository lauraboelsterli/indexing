Andy is both passionate about delivering great products and customer experiences, and has successfully grown enterprise businesses to hundreds of millions of dollars. He and I are aligned on vision and culture and I’m confident that he is the right CEO to enable UserTesting to meet the needs of our customers in a fast-growing market.”\nUserTesting delivers human insights to over 35,000 customers, including 37 of the top 100 brands in the world, empowering every organization to deliver the best customer experience (CX).

Most recently, MacMillan was the CEO of Act-On Software, where he helped transform their product portfolio and put their customers at the center of their business strategy.\n“According to Forrester’s US Customer Experience Index (2017), the revenue growth of customer experience leaders is 5.1 times that of laggards .
