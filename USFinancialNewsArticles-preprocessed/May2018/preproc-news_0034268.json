    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told 27 ministers from the bloc on Monday that “no significant progress” has been made in negotiations with London since March, the chairwoman of the talks said.\nBulgaria's Foreign Minister Ekaterina Zaharieva and European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier attend an EU's General Affairs Council in Brussels, Belgium, May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Deputy Prime Minister Ekaterina Zakharieva of Bulgaria, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told reporters after the meeting of European affairs ministers: “We look forward to more a intensive engagement by the UK government in the coming weeks.”\n“October is only five months from now and still some key issues related to the withdrawal agreement need to be settled. In June we need to see substantive progress on Ireland, on governance and all remaining separation issues.”\nReporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Andrew Heavens\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
