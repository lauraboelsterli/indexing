    "text": "Continued Strong Operational Performance\nUnfavorable Weather Delayed Spring Application Season\nDEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CF), a leading global fertilizer and chemical company, today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nNet earnings of $63 million, or $0.27 per diluted share EBITDA (1) of $302 million; adjusted EBITDA (1) of $296 million 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate at company's lowest level ever Completed purchase of all publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. on April 2, 2018\nOverview of Results\nCF Industries Holdings, Inc., today announced first quarter 2018 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $63 million, or $0.27 per diluted share; EBITDA of $302 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $296 million. These results compare to first quarter 2017 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $23 million, or $0.10 per diluted share; EBITDA of $218 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $272 million.\n“The CF team executed well in all aspects of our business during the first quarter, maximizing the opportunities available to us even as the spring application season was delayed due to cold and wet weather,\" said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. \"Despite lower volumes, we generated $101 million in cash and are well-positioned to meet the strong demand we expect through the second quarter.\"\nManufacturing Operations\nCF Industries' manufacturing network continued its focus on safety and operated efficiently during the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, 2018, CF Industries' 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.6 incidents per 200,000 work hours, the lowest for the company and well below industry averages.\nGross ammonia production during the first quarter of 2018 was more than 2.5 million tons, equal to production during the first quarter of 2017.\n(1) EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense-net, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. See reconciliations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release.\nSales Overview\nNet sales in the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $957 million from $1,037 million in the same period last year due to lower sales volumes across most segments partially offset by higher average selling prices across most segments.\nTotal sales volumes for the quarter were lower compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to unfavorable weather that delayed the start of the spring application season across the Northern Hemisphere.\nAverage selling prices for the quarter were higher year-over-year across most segments due primarily to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance driven by less nitrogen production from marginal producers in Eastern Europe and China.\nThe company's average selling price for ammonia was $319 per ton in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $307 per ton in the first quarter of 2017. The average selling price for urea was $269 per ton in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $248 per ton in the first quarter of 2017, and the average selling price for UAN was $170 per ton in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $171 per ton in the first quarter of 2017.\nCost of sales decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily driven by lower sales volumes and lower realized gas costs, and an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $3 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives of $53 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the company's cost of sales was $3.33 per MMBtu, which includes a realized loss of $0.01 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges. This compares to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $3.65 per MMBtu of 2017, which included a realized gain of $0.01 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges. During the first quarter of 2018, the average price of natural gas at Henry Hub in North America was $3.02 per MMBtu, and the average price of natural gas at the National Balancing Point in the United Kingdom was $8.20 per MMBtu.\nThe company did not enter into any additional natural gas NYMEX hedges in the first quarter of 2018.\nMarket Overview\nCF management expects demand in North America for nitrogen fertilizer for the first half of 2018 to be similar to the first half of 2017, projecting 88-90 million acres of corn, 46 million acres of wheat and 13 million acres of cotton to be planted in the United States, along with 25 million acres of wheat and 21 million acres of canola in Canada. Corn planting was behind the average pace as of April 29, and ammonia shipments were behind schedule due to cold, wet weather in the Midwest, which slowed pre-plant applications. However, growers unable to apply pre-plant ammonia have the option to follow with post-planting and sidedress ammonia applications as well as other forms of nitrogen such as urea and UAN.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, urea barge prices at New Orleans traded at an average of $13 per ton below international parity, continuing a trend since early 2017 and discouraging excess imports into the region. From July through February, imports of urea and UAN to North America declined 38 percent and 35 percent, respectively, compared to the same time period a year ago. Imports of nitrogen into North America should continue to trend lower as global tradeflows adjust to account for the additional production coming from the ramp-up of the remaining North American nitrogen capacity additions. However, the region remains nitrogen import-dependent for the foreseeable future.\nGlobal urea prices are expected to remain above 2017 levels even after the traditional seasonal reset at the end of the second quarter. Energy prices remain significantly higher for producers in Eastern Europe and China. The price of natural gas per MMBtu at TTF in Europe was 32 percent higher in March 2018 compared to March 2017, while the price of a metric ton of anthracite coal in China was 52 percent higher in February 2018 compared to February 2017. Ocean freight costs are higher as well, with the average cost of shipping urea from the Arab Gulf to the Gulf of Mexico in the first quarter of 2018 nearly 25 percent higher than the first quarter of 2017.\nHigher energy and freight costs, along with enforcement of environmental regulations, have resulted in dramatically lower Chinese urea production and exports. Through the first three months of 2018, Chinese urea exports were 77 percent lower than the same period in 2017. CF expects lower Chinese urea exports to continue in the near-term.\nAdditionally, demand in India and Brazil should provide support for prices over the next few months. India recently completed a tender that secured more than one million tons of urea through the end of May, which will absorb significant volumes of urea from Black Sea, Iranian, and Middle Eastern producers. The company expects nitrogen imports into Brazil to increase slightly year-over-year due to the permanent closure of two Petrobras urea plants in the country in the coming months partially offset by lower projected corn plantings.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures in 2018 for new activity are estimated to be in the range of approximately $400 to $450 million, which takes into account a higher number of scheduled plant turnarounds in 2018 compared to 2017.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $936 million on the balance sheet, had no borrowings outstanding under its $750 million revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under its debt instruments.\nPurchase of All Publicly Traded Units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.\nOn April 2, 2018, the company's wholly owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP) completed its previously announced purchase of all of the issued and outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP) not already owned by TNGP or its affiliates for $388 million. The company funded the purchase with cash on hand.\nCHS Inc. Distribution\nCHS Inc. (CHS) is entitled to semi-annual distributions resulting from its minority equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN). The estimate of the partnership distribution earned by CHS, but not yet declared, of 2018 is approximately $39 million.\nConsolidated Results\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (dollars in millions, except per share and per MMBtu amounts) Net sales $ 957 $ 1,037 Cost of sales 767 930 Gross margin $ 190 $ 107 Gross margin percentage 19.9 % 10.3 % Net earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 63 $ (23 ) Net earnings (loss) per diluted share $ 0.27 $ (0.10 ) EBITDA (1) $ 302 $ 218 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 296 $ 272 Tons of product sold (000s) 4,303 4,745 Supplemental data (per MMBtu): Natural gas costs in cost of sales (2) $ 3.32 $ 3.66 Realized derivatives loss (gain) in cost of sales (3) 0.01 (0.01 ) Cost of natural gas in cost of sales $ 3.33 $ 3.65 Average daily market price of natural gas (per MMBtu): Henry Hub $ 3.02 $ 3.00 National Balancing Point UK $ 8.20 $ 5.98 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives $ (3 ) $ 53 Depreciation and amortization $ 193 $ 205 Capital expenditures $ 68 $ 94 Production volume by product tons (000s): Ammonia (4) 2,508 2,508 Granular urea 1,151 1,002 UAN (32%) 1,805 1,817 AN 458 542\n(1) See reconciliations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release.\n(2) Includes the cost of natural gas that is included in cost of sales during the period under the first-in, first-out inventory cost method.\n(3) Includes realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives settled during the period. Excludes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on natural gas derivatives.\n(4) Gross ammonia production including amounts subsequently upgraded into other products.\nSegment Results\nAmmonia Segment\nCF Industries’ ammonia segment produces anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is the company’s most concentrated form of nitrogen, containing 82 percent nitrogen. The results of the ammonia segment consist of sales of ammonia to external customers. In addition, ammonia is the “basic” nitrogen form that the company upgrades into other nitrogen products such as urea, UAN and AN.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts) Net sales $ 212 $ 282 Cost of sales 188 265 Gross margin $ 24 $ 17 Gross margin percentage 11.3 % 6.0 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 664 920 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 544 754 Average selling price per product ton $ 319 $ 307 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 390 374 Gross margin per product ton $ 36 $ 18 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 44 23 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 24 $ 17 Depreciation and amortization 25 44 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives (1 ) 17 Adjusted gross margin $ 48 $ 78 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 22.6 % 27.7 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.\n(2) Adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization and unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives. The company has presented adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales because management uses these measures, and believes they are useful to investors, as supplemental financial measures in the comparison of year-over-year performance. A reconciliation of adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales to gross margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table above. See \"Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release.\nComparison of 2018 to 2017 first quarter periods:\nAmmonia sales volume decreased of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to unfavorable weather that delayed the start of the spring fertilizer application season in the Southern Plains and the Midwest. Ammonia average selling prices increased primarily due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance partially offset by the effects of lower sales volumes due to the cold and wet spring delaying ammonia fertilizer applications. Ammonia gross margin per ton increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to higher average selling prices, a $1 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in the quarter compared to a $17 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives in the prior year period, the absence of production inefficiencies associated with the new Port Neal ammonia unit in the first quarter of 2017, and lower realized gas costs. These were partially offset by significantly lower sales volumes due to the cold and wet spring delaying ammonia applications and higher fixed costs associated with plant disruptions due to unseasonably cold weather early in the quarter that affected production at the company's Donaldsonville and Yazoo City plants.\nGranular Urea Segment\nCF Industries’ granular urea segment produces granular urea, which contains 46 percent nitrogen. Produced from ammonia and carbon dioxide, it has the highest nitrogen content of any of the company’s solid nitrogen products.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts) Net sales $ 264 $ 238 Cost of sales 189 213 Gross margin $ 75 $ 25 Gross margin percentage 28.4 % 10.5 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 982 958 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 452 441 Average selling price per product ton $ 269 $ 248 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 584 540 Gross margin per product ton $ 76 $ 26 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 166 57 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 75 $ 25 Depreciation and amortization 59 53 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives (1 ) 14 Adjusted gross margin $ 133 $ 92 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 50.4 % 38.7 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.\n(2) Adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization and unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives. The company has presented adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales because management uses these measures, and believes they are useful to investors, as supplemental financial measures in the comparison of year-over-year performance. A reconciliation of adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales to gross margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table above. See \"Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release.\nComparison of 2018 to 2017 first quarter periods:\nGranular urea sales volume increased for the quarter primarily due to increased production volume from the company's Port Neal Nitrogen Complex. Granular urea average selling price per ton increased primarily due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Granular urea gross margin per ton increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to higher average selling prices, a $1 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in the quarter compared to a $14 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives in the prior year period, reduced maintenance and employee costs, and lower realized gas costs.\nUAN Segment\nCF Industries’ UAN segment produces urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN). UAN is a liquid product with nitrogen content that typically ranges from 28 percent to 32 percent and is produced by combining urea and ammonium nitrate in solution.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts) Net sales $ 283 $ 317 Cost of sales 230 281 Gross margin $ 53 $ 36 Gross margin percentage 18.7 % 11.4 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 1,669 1,849 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 527 584 Average selling price per product ton $ 170 $ 171 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 537 543 Gross margin per product ton $ 32 $ 19 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 101 62 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 53 $ 36 Depreciation and amortization 63 65 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives (1 ) 16 Adjusted gross margin $ 115 $ 117 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 40.6 % 36.9 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.\n(2) Adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization and unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives.

See \"Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release.\nComparison of 2018 to 2017 first quarter periods:\nUAN sales volume decreased in the first quarter of 2018 due to unfavorable weather that delayed the start of the spring application season in the Southern Plains. UAN average selling price per ton was relatively unchanged. UAN gross margin per ton increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to a $1 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in the quarter compared to a $16 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives in the prior year period and lower realized gas costs.\nAN Segment\nCF Industries' AN segment produces ammonium nitrate (AN). AN is used as a nitrogen fertilizer with nitrogen content between 29 percent to 35 percent, and also is used by industrial customers for commercial explosives and blasting systems. AN is produced at the company's Yazoo City, Mississippi; Billingham, United Kingdom; and Ince, United Kingdom, complexes.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts) Net sales $ 100 $ 125 Cost of sales 74 106 Gross margin $ 26 $ 19 Gross margin percentage 26.0 % 15.2 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 417 568 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 140 191 Average selling price per product ton $ 240 $ 220 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 714 654 Gross margin per product ton $ 62 $ 33 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 186 99 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 26 $ 19 Depreciation and amortization 18 19 Unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives — 2\nAdjusted gross margin $ 44 $ 40 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 44.0 % 32.0 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.\n(2) Adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales are non-GAAP financial measures.

A reconciliation of adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales to gross margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table above. See \"Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release.\nComparison of 2018 to 2017 first quarter periods:\nAN sales volume decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to unfavorable weather that delayed the start of the spring application season across the Northern Hemisphere. AN average selling price per ton increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. AN gross margin per ton increased due primarily to a $2 million lower unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives compared to the prior year period and higher average selling prices.\nOther Segment\nCF Industries’ Other segment includes diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and compound fertilizer products (NPKs).\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts) Net sales $ 98 $ 75 Cost of sales 86 65 Gross margin $ 12 $ 10 Gross margin percentage 12.2 % 13.3 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 571 450 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 111 88 Average selling price per product ton $ 172 $ 167 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 883 852 Gross margin per product ton $ 21 $ 22 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 108 114 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 12 $ 10 Depreciation and amortization 17 12 Unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives — 4 Adjusted gross margin $ 29 $ 26 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 29.6 % 34.7 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.\n(2) Adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales are non-GAAP financial measures.

A reconciliation of adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales to gross margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table above. See \"Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release.\nComparison of 2018 to 2017 first quarter periods:\nOther segment volume increased in the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher year-over-year sales of DEF as additional volume available for sale from the new DEF unit at the Donaldsonville Nitrogen complex supports the company's ongoing efforts to grow its North American DEF business. Other segment average selling price per ton increased primarily due to the mix of products sold. Other segment gross margin per ton was relatively unchanged.\nDividend Payment\nOn April 27, 2018, CF Industries’ Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 31, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 15, 2018.\nConference Call\nCF Industries will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results at 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, May 3, 2018.
