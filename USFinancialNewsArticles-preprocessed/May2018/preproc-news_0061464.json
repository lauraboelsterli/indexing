    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 7:43 AM / in an hour Does UK FCA's Bailey want the Bank of England's top job? No comment Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - The chief of Britain’s financial regulator Andrew Bailey on Thursday declined to comment as to whether he was interested in succeeding Mark Carney as the Bank of England governor, saying he had a big job to do already.\nCarney will step down in June 2019, three months after the country’s scheduled exit from the European Union, but Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), would not say if he was interested in replacing him.\n“I’ve got a very big job which I hugely enjoy,” he told BBC radio when asked about the BoE top job. Asked if he would also enjoy being Bank of England Governor, he said: “I’m not going to comment on that, because it’s not for me to say.” (Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)",
