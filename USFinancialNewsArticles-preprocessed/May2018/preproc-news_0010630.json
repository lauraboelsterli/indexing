    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 9:28 PM / Updated 26 minutes ago Facebook unit WhatsApp's co-founder Jan Koum to quit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - WhatsApp Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jan Koum is planning to leave the Facebook ( FB.O ) unit, according to his post on the social media network on Monday. Jan Koum, co-founder and CEO of WhatsApp speaks at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California October 25, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\nKoum’s plan to exit comes after clashing with Facebook over the messaging service WhatApp’s strategy and Facebook’s attempts to use its personal data and weaken its encryption, the Washington Post earlier reported, citing people familiar with the internal discussions.\n“It’s been almost a decade since Brian and I started WhatsApp, and it’s been an amazing journey with some of the best people,” Koum said in the post.

Facebook bought Whatsapp in 2014 for $19 billion in cash and stock. Reporting by Anirban Paul and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur",
