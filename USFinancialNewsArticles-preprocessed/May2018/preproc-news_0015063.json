Soccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City vs Crystal Palace - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-on-Trent, Britain - May 5, 2018 Stoke City's Jack Butland reacts after the match as they are relegated from the Premier League REUTERS/Peter Powell\nStoke’s fate was sealed following the 2-1 Premier League defeat by Crystal Palace on Saturday and England international Butland did not hold back when assessing the club’s failings as their 10-year stint in the top flight came to an end.\n“I think the whole recruitment process needs looking at,” Butland told reporters. “There have been transfers that aren’t even part of the squad for all kinds of reasons, whether it be discipline, whether it be lack of performance.”\nMidfielder Jese Rodriguez, who arrived in the close season on loan from French side Paris St Germain, has made just eight starts all season and missed several weeks due to his infant son’s health problems in Spain.

You’ve got to look at that — what decisions are being made and the type of characters.”\nStoke visit relegation-threatened Swansea City in their final game on Sunday.
