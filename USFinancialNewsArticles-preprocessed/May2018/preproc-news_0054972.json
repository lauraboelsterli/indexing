Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron attend a signing ceremony after the talks in St. Petersburg, Russia May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Grigory Dukor\n“The ball is in the camp of Russia and Ukraine. It’s as simple as that. We won’t lift the sanctions if nothing’s done. That’s what we discussed with Vladimir Putin,” Macron told a news conference after meeting with his Russian counterpart.\nEU countries will meet in July to consider extending the sanctions imposed on Russia in 2015, Macron said.
