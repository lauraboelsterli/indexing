(“Clean Harbors”) (NYSE: CLH), the leading provider of environmental, energy and industrial services throughout North America, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We delivered a strong first quarter with better-than-expected results,” said Alan S. McKim, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The combination of increasing waste volumes throughout our disposal network and an improved pricing environment for base oil and blended products helped drive our financial performance. We experienced favorable trends across many of our key industry verticals, including chemical, manufacturing and energy, supported by an improved macroeconomic environment.”\nFirst-quarter revenues increased 9% to $749.8 million, compared with $688.9 million in the same period a year ago. Income from operations more than doubled to $11.0 million from $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $12.6 million, or $0.22 per share, compared with a net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $21.4 million, or $0.37 per share. Net loss results for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 included charges related to non-cash valuation allowances on tax loss carryforwards generated by certain Canadian subsidiaries of $6.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Adjusted net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.6 million, or $0.12 per share, compared with an adjusted net loss of $10.9 million, or $0.19 per share, in the same period a year ago. Net loss and adjusted net loss results included pre-tax integration and severance costs of $3.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA (see description below) in the first quarter of 2018 increased 10% to $88.3 million, compared with $80.1 million in the same period of 2017.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company created a regional sales and service organization and reorganized its management reporting structure. As a result of these actions, the Company consolidated its historical Technical Services, Industrial and Field Services, and Oil, Gas and Lodging segments under a newly formed Environmental Services segment. This change is expected to strengthen resource allocation, deepen customer relationships, reduce third-party spend, and foster cross-selling across the Company’s environmental businesses.\n“Within our new Environmental Services segment, incinerator utilization in the first quarter was seasonally strong at 87%, while landfill volumes rose 58% from the same period a year ago, driven by a large project and higher base business,” McKim said. “Our Industrial Services business benefitted from a robust start to the spring turnaround season, coinciding with our acquisition of Veolia’s U.S. Industrial Services business in late February. Early returns from that acquisition are encouraging, as we have expanded our footprint, service capabilities, fleet and customer base.\n“Within our Safety-Kleen segment, we generated continued solid top-line growth and a double-digit increase in profitability, which produced a 220-basis-point year-over-year gain in its Adjusted EBITDA margin to 22.3%. In an improving pricing environment, we effectively managed the spread within our re-refining business while waste oil collection remained strong. We also continued to advance our closed-loop initiative with direct lubricant sales accounting for 5% of our total volume, up from the prior quarter.”\nBusiness Outlook and Financial Guidance\n“We begin the second quarter with strong momentum across multiple markets and remain excited about our prospects for 2018,” McKim said. “The current economic environment is favorable for us with a healthy industrial economy and rising crude prices. We are committed to enhancing margins through pricing strategies, improved revenue mix and operating efficiencies.\n“Within Environmental Services, the outlook for our disposal network is positive, supported by the expansion of the chemical industry. We also are seeing an upward trajectory in our Industrial Services business. The addition of Veolia should accelerate the recovery we are beginning to see in that area.\n“Within Safety-Kleen, the core offerings in our branch business are generating profitable growth while our comprehensive initiatives around our closed-loop program continue to gain momentum. Our target is to double the number of gallons sold through our closed-loop initiative in 2018 as compared with the prior year, and we are on track to hit that goal. Overall, we continue to anticipate a strong Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow performance for the Company in 2018,” McKim concluded.\nBased on its first-quarter financial performance and current market conditions, Clean Harbors reiterated its full-year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $440 million to $480 million. On a GAAP basis, the Company’s guidance is based on anticipated 2018 net income in the range of $12 million to $51 million. A reconciliation of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income guidance is included below. For 2018, Clean Harbors expects to generate adjusted free cash flow in the range of $125 million to $155 million, which is based on anticipated 2018 net cash from operating activities in the range of $295 million to $345 million.\nNon-GAAP Results\nClean Harbors reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but viewed only as a supplement to those measurements. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, and therefore the Company’s measurements of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Clean Harbors believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides additional useful information to investors since the Company’s loan covenants are based upon levels of Adjusted EBITDA achieved and management routinely evaluates the performance of its businesses based upon levels of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA in accordance with its existing credit agreement, as described in the following reconciliation showing the differences between reported net loss and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended: March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Net loss ($12,631) ($21,393) Accretion of environmental liabilities 2,430 2,290 Depreciation and amortization 74,844 72,412 Other expense, net 299 1,549 Interest expense, net 20,270 22,576 Provision for income taxes 3,053 2,701 Adjusted EBITDA $88,265 $80,135 This press release includes a discussion of net loss and loss per share adjusted for non-cash tax-related valuation allowances as identified in the reconciliations provided below. The Company believes that discussion of these additional non-GAAP measures provides investors with meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance. The following shows the difference between net loss to adjusted net loss, and loss per share to adjusted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nFor the Three Months Ended: March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Adjusted net loss Net loss ($12,631) ($21,393) Tax-related valuation allowances 6,061 10,451 Adjusted net loss ($6,570) ($10,942) Adjusted loss per share\nLoss per share ($0.22) ($0.37) Tax-related valuation allowances 0.10 0.18 Adjusted loss per share ($0.12) ($0.19) Adjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation\nClean Harbors reports adjusted free cash flow, which it considers to be a measurement of liquidity that provides useful information to investors about our ability to generate cash. The Company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash from operating activities excluding cash impacts of items derived from non-operating activities, such as taxes paid in connection with divestitures, less additions to property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from sale and disposal of fixed assets. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP. Adjusted free cash flow is not calculated identically by all companies, and therefore our measurements of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAn itemized reconciliation between net cash from operating activities and adjusted free cash flow is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended: March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Adjusted free cash flow Net cash from operating activities $51,903 $57,119 Additions to property, plant and equipment (44,242) (42,462) Proceeds from sale and disposal of fixed assets 798 1,030 Adjusted free cash flow $8,459 $15,687 Adjusted EBITDA Guidance Reconciliation\nAn itemized reconciliation between projected net income and projected Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in millions):\nFor the Year Ending\nDecember 31, 2018\nProjected GAAP net income $12 to $51 Adjustments: Accretion of environmental liabilities 11 to 10 Depreciation and amortization 305 to 295 Interest expense, net 86 to 82 Provision for income taxes 26 to 42 Projected Adjusted EBITDA $440 to $480 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Guidance Reconciliation\nAn itemized reconciliation between projected cash from operating activities and projected adjusted free cash flow is as follows (in millions):\nFor the Year Ending December 31, 2018 Projected cash from operating activities $295 to $345 Additions to property, plant and equipment (180) to (200) Proceeds from sale and disposal of fixed assets 10 to 10 Projected adjusted free cash flow $125 to $155\nConference Call Information\nClean Harbors will conduct a conference call for investors today at 9:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss the information contained in this press release.
