    "text": "HOUSTON, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: PARR) (\"Par Pacific\" or the \"Company\") today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet Income of $15.2 million, or $0.33 per diluted share Adjusted Net Income of $8.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA of $26.1 million Record sales of 18,272 barrels per day for the Wyoming refining business Record on-island sales of 69,420 barrels per day in Hawaii Closed acquisition of 33 Cenex ® ZipTrip retail outlets, expanding our footprint in the attractive Northwest market\nPar Pacific reported net income of $15.2 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $27.8 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2017. First quarter 2018 Adjusted Net Income was $8.2 million, compared to Adjusted Net Income of $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $26.1 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $32.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 net income includes $13.2 million of RINs benefit primarily due to our refineries obtaining a Small Refinery Exemption, offset in part by a $10.5 million expense related to a settlement payment made to the former owner of our Hawaii refinery business to resolve the Tesoro Earnout Dispute, a description of which can be found in our 2017 Form 10-K - see \"Tesoro Earnout Dispute\" under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" First quarter 2018 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA exclude the charge associated with the settlement payment. Further, Par Pacific no longer includes its share of Laramie Energy's unrealized derivative gains and losses in the calculation of Adjusted Net Income. Accordingly, the presentation of first quarter 2017 Adjusted Net Income has been recast to exclude a $10.2 million gain that was previously included in the calculation. A reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables accompanying this news release.\n\"Our strong retail, logistics, and Wyoming refinery financial results and other accomplishments during the first quarter demonstrate the benefit of having a diversified business and the team's ability to execute on our strategy of expanding into attractive markets,\" said William Pate, Par Pacific's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"The successful addition of 33 Cenex ® ZipTrip retail outlets in the Northwest is another important step towards improving our earnings and cash generation capabilities while mitigating the impact of challenging margins in our cyclical Hawaii refining business. Looking ahead, while rising crude prices will keep the team focused on optimizing refinery gross margins and prudently managing our financial position, we remain committed to pursuing growth opportunities that will create long-term value for our shareholders.\"\nRefining\nThe Refining segment generated operating income of $26.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to operating income of $27.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Gross Margin for the Refining segment was $56.4 million inclusive of the RINs benefit in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $61.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nRefining Adjusted EBITDA was $19.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 inclusive of the RINs benefit, compared to Refining Adjusted EBITDA of $25.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nHawaii Refinery\nThe combined Mid Pacific Index was $7.40/bbl in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.90/bbl in the first quarter of 2017. The Hawaii refinery's throughput in the first quarter of 2018 was 76 thousand barrels per day (Mbpd). This compares to 77 Mbpd throughput for the same quarter in 2017. Production costs were $3.64 per throughput barrel in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.71 per throughput barrel in the same period in 2017.\nWyoming Refinery\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Wyoming 3-2-1 Index averaged $15.65/bbl, compared to $16.51/bbl in the first quarter of 2017. The Wyoming refinery's throughput was 17 Mbpd in the first quarter of 2018. This compares to 14 Mbpd throughput for the same quarter in 2017. Production costs were $7.74 per throughput barrel in the first quarter of 2018. This compares to $7.46 per throughput barrel for the same quarter in 2017.\nRetail\nThe Retail segment reported operating income of $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Gross Margin for the Retail segment was $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $17.9 million in the same quarter of 2017.\nRetail Adjusted EBITDA was $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, consistent with $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The Retail segment reported sales volumes of 22.2 million gallons in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 22.1 million gallons in the same quarter of 2017.\nLogistics\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Logistics segment generated operating income of $8.8 million, compared to $9.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Gross Margin for the Logistics segment was $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $14.7 million in the same quarter of last year.\nLogistics Adjusted EBITDA was $10.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nLaramie Energy\nEquity earnings from Laramie in the first quarter of 2018 were $5.6 million, compared to equity earnings of $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. As previously communicated, Laramie completed the acquisition of a small in-basin operator in the quarter. First quarter 2018 earnings attributable to Par Pacific's 39.1% ownership interest in Laramie included $2.0 million in unrealized gains on derivative instruments compared to $10.2 million in unrealized gains on derivative instruments during the first quarter of 2017.\nLaramie averaged 173 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfed) of production during the first quarter of 2018 and exited the quarter with production of 190 MMcfed.\nLiquidity\nNet cash provided by operations totaled $12.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $25.0 million provided by operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, Par Pacific's cash balance totaled $65.0 million, long-term debt totaled $386.5 million, and total liquidity was $122.6 million. Par Pacific's cash balance declined by $53.4 million in the quarter, primarily due to acquisition activity and the resolution of the Tesoro Earnout Dispute, offset by cash provided from operations.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call is scheduled for Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Central Time (12:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

These markets reflect the closest liquid market alternatives to source refined products for Hawaii. We believe the Singapore and Mid Pacific crack spreads (or four barrels of Brent crude converted into one barrel of gasoline, two barrels of distillate (diesel and jet fuel) and one barrel of fuel oil) best reflect a market indicator for our Hawaii refinery operations. The Mid Pacific crack spread is calculated using a ratio of 80% Singapore and 20% San Francisco indices.\n(2)\nWeighted-average differentials, excluding shipping costs, of a blend of crudes with an API of 31.98 and sulfur weight percentage of 0.65% that is indicative of our typical crude oil mix quality compared to Brent crude.\n(3)\nPlease see discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin below. We calculate Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel by dividing Adjusted Gross Margin by total refining throughput.\n(4)\nManagement uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refineries including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, insurance, utilities and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) on our consolidated statement of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations.\n(5)\nThe profitability of our Wyoming refinery is heavily influenced by crack spreads in nearby markets. We believe the Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is the best market indicator for our operations in Wyoming. The Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is computed by taking two parts gasoline and one part distillate (ultra-low sulfur diesel) as created from three barrels of West Texas Intermediate Crude. Pricing is based 50% on applicable product pricing in Rapid City, South Dakota, and 50% on applicable product pricing in Denver, Colorado.\n(6)\nRetail sales volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2018, include the nine days of retail sales volumes from Northwest Retail from the acquisition date of March 23, 2018 through March 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nManagement uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) plus operating expense (excluding depreciation), depreciation, depletion, and amortization (\"DD&A\"), inventory valuation adjustment (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase obligation, and purchase price allocation adjustments), and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) plus inventory valuation adjustments and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\") obligations, and certain hydrocarbon fees and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and inventory valuation adjustments that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin.\nManagement believes Adjusted Gross Margin is an important measure of operating performance and uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing agreement and lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) and Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.\nAdjusted Gross Margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss), net cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross Margin presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation since each company may define this term differently as they may include other manufacturing costs and depreciation expense in cost of revenues.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree months ended March 31, 2018\nRefining\nLogistics\nRetail\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n26,073\n$\n8,793\n$\n5,738\nOperating expense (excluding depreciation)\n37,349\n1,822\n11,839\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization\n8,362\n1,642\n1,868\nInventory valuation adjustment\n(11,887)\n—\n—\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n(3,505)\n—\n—\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n$\n56,392\n$\n12,257\n$\n19,445\nThree months ended March 31, 2017\nRefining\nLogistics\nRetail\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n27,416\n$\n9,413\n$\n6,120\nOperating expense (excluding depreciation)\n36,216\n3,797\n10,315\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization\n7,403\n1,487\n1,448\nInventory valuation adjustment\n(8,792)\n—\n—\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n(1,287)\n—\n—\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n$\n60,956\n$\n14,697\n$\n17,883\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding changes in the value of contingent consideration and common stock warrants, acquisition and integration expense, unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, loss on termination of financing agreements, release of tax valuation allowance, inventory valuation adjustment, and severance costs. Beginning in 2018, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) also excludes Par's share of Laramie Energy's unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives. The exclusion of Par's share of Laramie Energy's unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives from Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is consistent with our treatment of Par's unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, which are also excluded from Adjusted Net Income (Loss). We have recast the non-GAAP information for three months ended March 31, 2017 to conform to the current period presentation.\nAdjusted EBITDA is Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excluding interest expense and financing costs, taxes, DD&A, and equity losses (earnings) from Laramie Energy (excluding Par's share of unrealized loss or gain on derivatives). We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess:\nThe financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; The ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness; and Our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows provided by operating, investing, and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may define these terms differently.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), on a historical basis for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n15,185\n$\n27,786\nInventory valuation adjustment\n(11,887)\n(8,792)\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n(3,505)\n(1,287)\nAcquisition and integration expense\n632\n253\nChange in value of common stock warrants\n(745)\n689\nChange in value of contingent consideration\n10,500\n—\nSeverance costs\n—\n1,595\nPar's share of Laramie Energy's unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives (1)\n(1,988)\n(10,237)\nAdjusted Net Income\n8,192\n10,007\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization\n13,037\n11,260\nInterest expense and financing costs, net\n8,377\n8,942\nEquity losses (earnings) from Laramie Energy, LLC, excluding Par's share of unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n(3,588)\n1,491\nIncome tax expense\n34\n648\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n26,052\n$\n32,348\n(1)\nIncluded in Equity earnings from Laramie Energy, LLC on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nAdjusted Net Income\n$\n8,192\n$\n10,007\nUndistributed Adjusted Net Income allocated to participating securities (1)\n103\n108\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n8,089\n9,899\nPlus: Net income effect of convertible securities\n—\n—\nNumerator for diluted income per common share\n$\n8,089\n$\n9,899\nBasic weighted-average common stock shares outstanding\n45,634\n45,476\nAdd dilutive effects of common stock equivalents\n43\n—\nDiluted weighted-average common stock shares outstanding\n45,677\n45,476\nBasic Adjusted Net Income per common share\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.22\nDiluted Adjusted Net Income per common share\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.22",
