    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson Fistel, LLP announces that a class action complaint has been filed on behalf of shareholders of Gridsum Holding Inc. (NASDAQ: GSUM) (\"Gridsum\") and certain of its officers. Gridsum provides data analysis software for enterprises and government agencies in China.\nA Securities Class Action Complaint was filed on behalf of those who purchased securities of Gridsum. According to the lawsuit, defendants during the Class Period made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Gridsum lacked effective internal control over financial reporting; (2) consequently, Gridsum's financial statements were inaccurate and misleading, and did not fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company; and (3) as a result of the foregoing, Gridsum's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nIf you wish to discuss this action, have any questions concerning this notice, or your rights or interests, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471.
