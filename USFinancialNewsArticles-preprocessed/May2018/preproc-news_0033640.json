(“IQVIA”) (NYSE: IQV) announced today the pricing of an underwritten, secondary public offering of 10,000,000 shares of its common stock by certain of its existing stockholders, including affiliates of TPG Global, LLC, CPP Investment Board Private Holdings, Inc., investment funds associated with Bain Capital Investors, LLC, Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., and Dr. Dennis B. Gillings, CBE and certain of his affiliates (the “Selling Stockholders”), at a price to the public of $101.85 per share. IQVIA intends to repurchase from the underwriter 2,500,000 shares (the “Repurchase”).\nIQVIA is not offering any stock in this transaction and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the Selling Stockholders in the offering. IQVIA’s per-share purchase price for the repurchased shares will be the same as the per-share purchase price payable by the underwriter to the Selling Stockholders. IQVIA expects to fund the Repurchase with cash on hand and borrowings from its revolving credit facility. The Repurchase is subject to completion of the offering and the satisfaction of other customary conditions.\nMorgan Stanley is acting as the sole underwriter for the offering.\nThe offering, including the Repurchase, is expected to close on May 18, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nAn automatic shelf registration statement (including a prospectus) relating to the offering of common stock was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 24, 2017 and became effective upon filing.

LLC, Attention: Prospectus Department, 180 Varick Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10014.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\nAbout IQVIA\nIQVIA (NYSE:IQV) is a leading global provider of advanced analytics, technology solutions, and contract research services to the life sciences industry.
