    "text": "(Adds details on earnings, estimates)\nMay 1 (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp reported a quarterly profit that beat analysts' estimate on Tuesday as the oil and gas producer earned more per barrel due to higher crude prices and also put a tight lid on costs.\nOil prices have recovered from the depths hit in 2016 and are trading around $70 currently. This helped the shale oil producer sell oil at $63.66 per barrel, up from $50.34 a year earlier.\nThe company, which had warned in March about rising services costs in the Permian basin, said operating expenses declined 35.5 percent to $2.49 billion.\nAnadarko posted net income attributable to shareholders of $121 million, or 22 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $318 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned 52 cents share, higher than analysts' average expectation of 40 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nOil production fell 19 percent to 643,000 barrels per day during the first three months of 2018.
