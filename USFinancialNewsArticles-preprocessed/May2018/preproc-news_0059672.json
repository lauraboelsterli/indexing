    "text": "NEW YORK, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Varick, an audience-centric digital marketing company, announced today that it has welcomed Paul Dolan as its first ever Chief Executive Officer. Dolan brings over twenty years of industry leadership experience to Varick, with a track record of building and leading technology-enabled, data-driven media businesses. As Chief Executive Officer, Paul will oversee the corporate strategy, technology roadmap and employee development at Varick, while also focusing on the growth and success of its clients’ businesses.\n“Paul is joining Varick during a monumental time. Not only are we coming off a record breaking close in 2017, but we are also gearing up to celebrate our 10 th anniversary in August,” says Walt Cheruk, President at Varick. “The addition of Paul to our senior leadership team will allow Varick to continue to provide cross-channel performance for clients today, while also preparing for the next stage of its evolution. His expertise in bringing new programmatic opportunities to the market will drive growth for our clients, our platforms and our people.”\nPrior to joining Varick, Dolan launched and led multiple innovative businesses that brought better targeting, more insights and increased ROI to clients. Most recently, Paul launched Light Reaction, WPP’s outcome-based programmatic media platform, and served as its global General Manager across 25 countries. Prior to Light Reaction, Paul was a key member of the founding team at GroupM’s Xaxis, the industry’s largest agency trading desk. As Managing Director of North America, he led all sales, marketing, client services and operations, while opening offices in New York, Toronto and Miami. He later launched Xaxis Latin America with offices in Mexico City, Sao Paolo, Buenos Aires and Bogota. In 2008, he co-developed B3, the first data-driven media trading platform for 24/7 Real Media and WPP’s Media Innovation Group.\n“I’m thrilled to be a part of the Varick team. As the original programmatic company, Varick has developed strong technology in Alveo, our audience planning, insights and analytics platform. We have fast-growing client relationships with independent agencies and digital-first brands who are looking to unlock the power of programmatic inside their organizations. And as early adopters across the Amazon platform, we enable clients to access the full potential of the e-commerce giant,” says Dolan. “While I’m delighted to have joined in time to celebrate Varick’s 10-year anniversary, I’m especially looking forward to leading this dynamic company into its next 10 years.”\nAbout Varick\nVarick is an audience centric digital marketing company that uses state of the art technology to provide agencies and brands with full funnel, cross-channel strategies to drive brand marketing objectives.
