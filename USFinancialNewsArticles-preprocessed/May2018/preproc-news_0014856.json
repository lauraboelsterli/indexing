Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]\nThe White House is set to field reporters' questions Monday, in the wake of a media blitz from former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , a recent addition to President Donald Trump 's legal team.\nGiuliani gave a streak of media interviews beginning Wednesday and continuing through Sunday on a weekend morning show. In a lengthy interview on Fox News Wednesday night, Giuliani revealed that Trump had repaid his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure pact barring her from discussing an alleged affair with Trump.\n\"Funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it,\" Giuliani told talk show host Sean Hannity .\nTrump had denied knowledge of the payment when asked about it in April. Cohen has previously said that \"neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign\" was involved in the transaction.\nDuring the previous press briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Giuliani's remarks about the repayment were \"information that the president didn't know at the time but eventually learned.\"\nSanders said at the Thursday briefing she found about the reimbursement the night before. \"The first awareness I had was during an interview last night,\" Sanders said.\nTrump acknowledged Cohen's reimbursement in a trio of tweets the day after Giuliani spoke with Hannity.
