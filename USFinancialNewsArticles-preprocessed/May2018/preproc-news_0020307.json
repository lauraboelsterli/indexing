    "text": "Left-hander James Paxton became the second Canadian to pitch a no-hitter, the first to do so in his native land, leading the visiting Seattle Mariners to a 5-0 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday.\nMay 8, 2018; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Seattle Mariners starting pitcher James Paxton (65) throws a pitch in the first inning during a game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports It was the sixth no-hitter pitched by a Mariner in the franchise’s history that started in 1977, the same season the Blue Jays began. Seattle’s first five no-hitters all came at home.\nPaxton, who was born in Ladner, British Columbia, joins a Canadian no-hit club that previously included only Toronto native Dick Fowler, who threw his gem for the Philadelphia A’s in 1945.\nPaxton (2-1) struck out seven. He allowed the Blue Jays three walks — two in the third inning and another in the fourth.\nRoyals 15, Orioles 7\nMike Moustakas homered twice and drove in five runs, and visiting Kansas City homered four times and scored 10 runs in the first inning, finishing with five homers overall in a rout of Baltimore.\nMoustakas hit a solo home run in the first and added a two-run double later that inning. He belted a two-run homer in the fifth and finished the night 3-for-6.\nThe four homers in the first inning — all off Baltimore starter Dylan Bundy — tied a Kansas City record. Bundy, who didn’t retire any of the seven batters he faced, became the first pitcher in modern major league history to give up four home runs without recording an out, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\nYankees 3, Red Sox 2\nAaron Judge delivered the tiebreaking RBI single with one out in the bottom of the seventh inning off Joe Kelly as New York edged visiting Boston.\nJudge untied the game by lacing a 1-1 slider to left field, scoring Neil Walker, who started the rally with a double off Heath Hembree (2-1). Judge’s hit helped the Yankees win for the 16th time in 17 games. It is their best 17-game run since also going 16-1 from June 3-18, 1953.\nGiancarlo Stanton hit solo homers in consecutive at-bats for his third multi-homer game of the season and the 31st of his career.\nPhillies 4, Giants 2\nAaron Nola struck out a career-high 12 batters in seven solid innings, leading Philadelphia past visiting San Francisco.\nNola allowed only five hits and one run. He didn’t walk a batter. Aaron Altherr, Jorge Alfaro and Carlos Santana each ripped a solo home run for the Phillies, who have won the first two games in this four-game series.\nTommy Hunter got the last out in the eighth and the first out in the ninth. Hector Neris then recorded the final two outs to earn his seventh save of the season.\nBraves 1, Rays 0\nSean Newcomb recorded his second consecutive scoreless outing while making a solo home run from rookie Ronald Acuna Jr. stand up in Atlanta’s win over Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg, Fla.\nNewcomb (3-1) pitched six innings and allowed two hits and three walks. He struck out six.\nAtlanta scored the only run in the third inning when Acuna hit his third home run of the season, a long solo shot to left-center field. The Braves bullpen of Shane Carle, A.J. Minter, Dan Winkler and Arodys Vizcaino (fifth save) combined to work three scoreless innings to preserve the win.\nMay 8, 2018; Bronx, NY, USA; New York Yankees designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton (27) hits a solo home run against the Boston Red Sox during the second inning at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports Diamondbacks 8, Dodgers 5 (12 innings)\nDaniel Descalso hit a three-run home run in the 12th inning to give Arizona a victory at Los Angeles.\nA.J. Pollock, Chris Owings and John Ryan Murphy added home runs for Arizona on a night when Diamondbacks closer Brad Boxberger blew his first save chance in 12 tries this season.\nEnrique Hernandez hit a ninth-inning home run off Boxberger to tie the score 5-5 and force extra innings. Yasmani Grandal also went deep for the Dodgers.\nTwins 7, Cardinals 1\nEddie Rosario had two hits and scored three runs to back five strong innings by Jake Odorizzi as Minnesota rolled to a victory at St. Louis, sweeping the two-game interleague series.\nThe win was the fifth straight for the Twins, who outscored St. Louis 13-1 in the series and pounded out 21 hits over the two games while limiting the Cardinals to just six. St. Louis, which has lost two straight after winning five in a row, hurt its cause with three errors.\nOdorizzi (3-2) surrendered a run on two hits and two walks while striking out three. He left with a 5-1 lead after throwing 93 pitches.\nReds 7, Mets 2\nEugenio Suarez had three hits and four RBIs, and his two-run single in the first inning gave Cincinnati a lead it never relinquished in a win over visiting New York.\nThe Reds won for just the second time in eight games. The Mets have lost 15 of 22 since an 11-1 start.\nReds starter Luis Castillo retired the first 14 batters and carried a one-hitter into the sixth, when the Mets scored both their runs via a Wilmer Flores homer and a bases-loaded walk drawn by Adrian Gonzalez. Castillo (2-4) struck out out seven over 5 2/3 innings.\nBrewers 3, Indians 2\nReliever Brent Suter became the first opposing pitcher to hit a home run off Cleveland ace Corey Kluber, and Milwaukee held off the visiting Indians.\nTravis Shaw hit a two-run home run in the first inning to give the Brewers an early 2-0 lead. Suter (2-2) pitched 4 2/3 innings, surrendering two runs on five hits and a walk while striking out five.\nJose Ramirez and Francisco Lindor each hit solo home runs for the Indians, who have lost four of five.\nCubs 4, Marlins 3\nKris Bryant scored the winning run in the eighth inning, leading host Chicago to a win over Miami.\nMay 8, 2018; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Carlos Santana (41) follow through on his swing on his home run during the sixth inning as San Francisco Giants catcher Buster Posey (28) reacts at Citizens Bank Park. Mandatory Credit: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports Bryant led off the eighth by drawing a nine-pitch walk against reliever Kyle Barraclough (0-2). Bryant advanced to second when Barraclough bounced a pitch into the dirt and moved to third on a groundout by Anthony Rizzo.\nWith the infield in, Victor Caratini hit a grounder at Marlins second baseman Starlin Castro, who took too long to get the ball out of his glove, allowing Bryant to narrowly beat the throw home. It was the first run allowed by Barraclough since April 23, a span of six relief outings.\nTigers 7, Rangers 4\nVictor Martinez and Jose Iglesias hit two-run homers in the early going, and visiting Detroit held on for a victory over Texas.\nJeimer Candelario also homered for the Tigers, while Iglesias and Nicholas Castellanos scored two runs apiece.\nMike Fiers (3-2) collected the win, allowing two runs on six hits while striking out five in 5 2/3 innings. He didn’t issue a walk. Shane Greene got the last four outs, including three strikeouts, for his seventh save.\nRockies 4, Angels 2\nJon Gray tossed seven shutout innings to extend Colorado’s dominant stretch of starts, Trevor Story doubled and tripled, and the Rockies beat Los Angeles in Denver.\nGray (4-4) allowed four hits, walked one and struck out eight to help Colorado win its sixth straight. His outing was the ninth consecutive quality start for the Rockies, a franchise record. Wade Davis worked the ninth inning for his major-league-leading 14th save.\nJustin Upton homered for the Angels, and Andrew Healey (1-2) allowed two runs in six innings.\nNationals 4, Padres 0\nJeremy Hellickson took a perfect game into the seventh inning and doubled home a run as Washington won at San Diego.\nHellickson (1-0), Ryan Madson, Brandon Kintzler and Wander Suero combined on a three-hit shutout of the Padres, who were no-hit last Friday night by four Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers in Monterrey, Mexico. Tuesday marked the fifth time this season that the Padres were shut out.\nTravis Jankowski opened the seventh by grounding a single to center past Washington second baseman Howie Kendrick for the Padres’ first hit and baserunner. Kendrick, Ryan Zimmerman and Pedro Severino each had two hits for the Nationals.\nAstros 4, A’s 2\nGeorge Springer had two hits and two RBIs, and Alex Bregman homered as Houston won at Oakland.\nSpringer hit a two-out, two-run double for a 3-2 lead in the fifth inning to continue his hot series. He is 8-for-10 with a walk, four runs and five RBIs in the first two games in Oakland. His batting average, which was .264 through the weekend, is up to .297.\nMarcus Semien had two hits and scored twice, and Khris Davis had his 31st RBI on a sacrifice fly for Oakland, which had won three of four.\nPirates 10, White Sox 6\nPittsburgh erased an early four-run deficit by pounding out 16 hits in a win at Chicago.\nThe Pirates, who have won three of their past four games, scored three runs in the fifth off reliever Chris Volstad (0-2) to take the lead for good, 7-5.\nCorey Dickerson was 4-for-5 with two RBIs and Starling Marte was 3-for-5 with an RBI for the Pirates. Welington Castillo hit two homers and knocked in three runs for Chicago, which lost its fourth straight and eighth in nine games.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
