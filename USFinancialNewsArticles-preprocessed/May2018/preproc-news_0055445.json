    "text": "WHEAT RIDGE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lifeloc Technologies, Inc. (OTC: LCTC), a global leader in the development and manufacturing of breath alcohol testing devices, has announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“This was a very productive first quarter for Lifeloc,” said President and CEO Dr. Wayne Willkomm. “We saw an 11% growth in revenue over the first quarter last year. Earnings fell to just a small profit, but this is not surprising, as Lifeloc has been in a season of heavy investment for future growth.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\nThe Company posted quarterly net revenue of $2.20 million resulting in a quarterly net income of $11 thousand, or less than $0.01 per diluted share. These results compare to net revenue of $1.98 million for a quarterly net income of $78 thousand, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Net cash increased by $37 thousand in the first quarter of 2018, and total debt was reduced by $11 thousand through regular mortgage payments. Gross margin was 45% as compared to 49% in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross margin on net revenue was lower in the current quarter primarily as a result of implementation costs for a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system, lower royalties received, and costs associated with the Remote Alcohol Detection and Recognition or R.A.D.A.R. ® device business acquired last year. R.A.D.A.R. devices are alcohol monitoring units with biometrics which can be used as a tool to supervise offenders as an alternative to incarceration.\nStrategic Highlights\nNew product development through research and development investment is up over $140 thousand from the first quarter of last year. Lifeloc has focused product development on three specific fronts.\nWe are building a completely new breathalyzer with features that customers have demanded, which we expect to launch later this year. The upgraded R.A.D.A.R. device – with a more robust design and better communications – is expected to launch later this year. Work continues on our development of technology for the real-time, quantitative analysis for a panel of drugs including THC, methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, and several other drugs of abuse, utilizing the SpinDx™ technology exclusively licensed by us from Sandia Corporation, as well as on the closely related THC breathalyzer. The ability of our technology to detect very low quantities of THC has been demonstrated in our laboratories, but more work is needed to build a practical, portable device.\nAdditionally, Lifeloc has invested heavily in its information infrastructure with the implementation of a new ERP system, which went live on February 2. “Our team rallied to pull off an extraordinary transition, minimizing customer disruption and not missing a day’s shipping,” commented Dr. Willkomm. “This system includes integrated materials management, customer relations management and a faster, more robust e-commerce platform to better serve our customers.”\nAbout Lifeloc Technologies\nLifeloc Technologies, Inc.
