Law enforcement officers walk outside an Orthodox church after the attack of militants in Grozny, Russia May 19, 2018. REUTERS/Said Tsarnayev\nThe group offered no evidence in support of the claim.\nFour people attacked the Orthodox church on Saturday, killing two policemen and a churchgoer, Russia’s investigative committee said in a statement. The attackers were killed.
