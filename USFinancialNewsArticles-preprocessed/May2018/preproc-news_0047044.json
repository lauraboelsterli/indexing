    "text": "GE nears deal to merge transportation unit with Wabtec, may value combined company at $20 billion, sources tell Reuters Published 2 Hours Ago Reuters Sebastien Bozon | AFP | Getty Images An employee of General Electric works on a gas turbine at the GE plant in Belfort, France.\nGeneral Electric is nearing a deal to merge its transportation business, which manufactures train engines, with Wabtec Corp, a U.S. maker of equipment for the rail industry, two people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. A deal that could value the combined company at more than $20 billion could be announced as early as this week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. There is always a possibility that the deal talks, which center on using a tax-efficient structure called a Reverse Morris Trust, could collapse at the last minute, the sources cautioned. GE and Wabtec did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nCorrection: The combined GE and Wabtec may be valued at $20 billion or more. Related Securities",
