    "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has removed three board members at troubled state-owned logistics firm Transnet and appointed an interim board, the Public Enterprises Ministry said on Monday.\nTransnet is one of a handful of state firms accused of irregularities in the awarding of state contracts under former President Jacob Zuma.\nNew South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised to clean up governance at companies such as Transnet in an effort to kick-start economic growth and woo foreign investment, which slumped during Zuma’s nine years in power.\nZuma denies allegations of corruption and mismanagement.\nPopo Molefe, a veteran of the ruling African National Congress, will chair Transnet’s interim board, the Public Enterprises Ministry said in a statement.\n“The previous board has not demonstrated appreciation of the seriousness of issues at hand or the ability to deal with these decisively,” the ministry cited Gordhan as saying.\n“We have to hold directors of state-owned companies to a high standard of corporate governance,” Gordhan added.\nThree Transnet board members resigned earlier this month, after Ramaphosa made Gordhan public enterprises minister in February.\nReporting by Alexander Winning; Editing by Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
