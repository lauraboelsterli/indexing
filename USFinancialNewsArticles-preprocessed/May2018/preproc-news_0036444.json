    "text": "LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Long-term borrowing costs in Italy rose to their highest in almost two months in early Tuesday trade, reflecting political uncertainty in the euro zone’s third biggest economy.\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield rose three basis points to 1.947 percent, underperforming euro zone peers.\nThe Italian bond market has come under pressure in the past week from concern that a government formed by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League will enact big-spending policies.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; editing by Sujata Rao\n ",
