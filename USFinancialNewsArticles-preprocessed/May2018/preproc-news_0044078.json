    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 2:05 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago Petrobras CEO says Brazil govt not interfering in fuel pricing Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBRASILIA, May 22 (Reuters) - The CEO of Brazilian state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA said on Tuesday that the federal government is not interfering with the firm’s ability to set its own prices, though it is concerned about a steep hike in the price of diesel.\nPedro Parente told reporters in Brasilia after a meeting with the finance and energy ministers that there was no discussion of Petrobras changing its pricing strategy, and that it was not the government’s goal to interfere. A sharp rise in diesel prices in the past year has ignited a nationwide protest by truckers, who are blocking key highways in agricultural and industrial hubs.
