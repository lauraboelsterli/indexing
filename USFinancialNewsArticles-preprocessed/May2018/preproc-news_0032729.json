    "text": "HOUSTON, TEXAS, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: ESES) (“EcoStim” or the “Company”) announced its financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nRevenues for Q1 2018 grew 594% over Q1 2017 to $17.8 million from $2.6 million; revenues declined by $2.0 million, or 11%, from Q4 2017 US Fleet #2 completed 238 stages in Q1 2018; set new Company record in April with 99 stages completed US Fleet #1 resumed operations in March in the spot market Gross margin losses in Argentina improved to $0.3 million in Q1 2018 from $1.4 million in Q4 2017 Have negotiated to terminate uneconomic Argentina contract following transition period Equipment added to US operations in May 2018; providing redundancy and expanding scope of operations Raised $10 million of capital in April 2018 from preferred stock issuance\nJ. Chris Boswell, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “As we communicated in our last earnings call, our frac fleets were in the middle of transitioning from lower priced contracts to new work at improved rates. The first quarter results reflect the inactivity associated with that transition and we are happy to report significant improvements thus far in the second quarter.\nIn the US market, US fleet #2 completed 238 stages during 1Q 2018 as it suffered primarily from weather related downtime. The second quarter has seen meaningful improvement, as our US fleet #2 completed a Company record 99 stages in April. Our US fleet #1 remained idle during most of Q1 2018 while awaiting sand delivery and other equipment. That fleet is now back to work and we believe that the schedule over the coming months is looking positive. Gross margin losses for the first quarter in our US business of $4.0 million was driven by the low utilization experienced by Fleet #1.\nGross margin losses in our Argentina business of $0.3 million improved by $1.1 million as compared to Q4 2017. The main driver for that improvement was the removal of non-core third party services that we had previously provided to our customer at a substantial loss under our contract which started in early 2017.\nIn regards to the contract negotiation, we have held lengthy discussions with our Argentina customer to cancel or modify the contract as it was unfavorable and uneconomic. We have now been notified by our customer that its Board of Directors has approved the termination of the contract following a transition period. We now expect to be released from any further obligations under that contract within 90 days and to continue working for 60-90 days under different commercial terms which are currently under negotiation. Our customer has also expressed interest in continuing to work with us after the transition period under a more flexible agreement. This should enable us to work with additional customers and otherwise explore all alternatives for the profitable growth of our Argentina assets.\nOnce again, I would like to thank our entire team for their hard work and dedication. With all assets now expected to be working under improved pricing conditions, we feel Q2 2018 is an inflection point for the Company.”\nQuarter Financial Results\nRevenues\nU.S. revenue for Q1 2018 was $12.7 million, compared to $0 for Q1 2017. The Company started its US operations during Q2 2017 and as such generated no revenue in Q1 2017.\nArgentina revenue for Q1 2018 increased $2.5 million to $5.1 million, compared to $2.6 million for Q1 2017.\nCost of Sales\nU.S. cost of services was $16.6 million for Q1 2018, compared to $0.5 for Q1 2017 and $15.1 million in 4Q 2017. The increase in costs compared to 4Q 2017 was a result of additional product costs due to significantly different completion designs. Now that the Company has a more established operating history it is actively working on a number of initiatives to reduce costs.\nArgentina cost of services increased $2.0 million to $5.4 million for Q1 2018, compared to $3.4 million for Q1 2017. This increase was attributable to higher activity levels, offset by a reduction in costs incurred attributable to non-core third party services which our customer sourced directly from those providers beginning on February 1, 2018.\nSG&A Expense\nSelling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense increased $1.1 million to $2.6 million for Q1 2018, compared to $1.5 million for Q1 2017. This increase was a result of our expansion into the US market which did not occur until Q2 2017. These increases included non-cash stock compensation, increased headcount and salary increases, director compensation increases and certain increased legal and other professional expese.\nCash and Total Liquidity\nOn March 31, 2018, EcoStim had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.6 million, compared to $8.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $11.2 million on March 31, 2017. The Company raised $10 million in April 2018 to fund capital expenditures and working capital.\nCapital Expenditures\nTotal cash capital expenditures made during Q1 2018 were approximately $1.5 million compared to $10.7 million in Q4 2017 and $3.7 million in Q1 2017, comprised mainly of additional pressure pumping equipment for the Company’s capacity expansion.\nForward Guidance\nThe Company has a limited operating history, with less than one full year working in the US and only three years of operations in Argentina in a difficult but improving market environment. While the market in both Argentina and the U.S. is now stronger, utilization of our frac fleets is difficult to accurately predict and therefore the Company does not plan to provide any earnings guidance for 2018 at this time. As the Company’s capacity additions made over the past year are deployed and the Company develops a longer operating history in the US, management may decide to provide guidance in the future. Factors that may influence our outlook and performance include the reliability and performance of our equipment, utilization of our assets in both the US and Argentina markets, the size of each job, pricing levels, and the service and product components of each job, as well as other factors discussed in our filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 15th, 2018 at 8:30 AM EDT, 7:30 AM CDT. To participate in the call please dial 877-900-9524 from the United States and Canada, and 412-902-0029 internationally.

The Company’s management uses adjusted EBITDA as a supplement measure to review the Company’s overall performance. Adjusted GAAP should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and operating income. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate such other non-GAAP measures in the same manner.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss with adjustments for depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest forgiven, income tax provision, foreign exchange, and other non-recurring expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nECO-STIM ENERGY SOLUTIONS, INC.\nRECONCILIATION NET LOSS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA, which is the most comparable non-GAAP performance measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017\nNet loss $ (12,860,516 ) $ (5,029,025 ) Depreciation and amortization 5,127,863 1,341,792 Interest income (54,164 ) (39,870 ) Interest expense 420,690 1,590,458 Provision for income taxes - (633,260 ) Foreign exchange 315,747 (60,322 ) Other non-recurring expenses 191,315 8,440 Stock based compensation 651,864 128,172 Adjusted EBITDA $ (6,207,201 ) $ (2,693,615 )\nReportable Segment Information:\nThree Months\nEnded March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues (1) : Argentina $ 5,095,618 $ 2,562,657 United States 12,683,226 ‒ Total Revenue $ 17,778,844 $ 2,562,657 Cost of services (1,2) : Argentina 5,386,845 3,371,992 United States 16,638,181 482,894 Total Cost of services $ 22,025,026 $ 3,854,886 Gross margin (1,2) : Argentina (291,227 ) (809,335 ) United States (3,954,955 ) (482,894 ) Total Gross margin $ (4,246,182 ) $ $ (1,292,229)\n(1 ) U.S. activity began in February 2017 with start-up expenses being incurred.
