    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Extreme Networks, Inc. (\"Extreme\") (Nasdaq: EXTR) today released financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Results:\nThird quarter revenue was $262.0 million, an increase of 76% year-over-year. GAAP gross margin for the third fiscal quarter was 54.6%, a decrease of 90 basis points year-over-year, and non-GAAP gross margin was 57.9% year-over-year, an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year. GAAP operating margin for the third fiscal quarter was (3.1) % and non-GAAP operating margin was 9.3%, compared to (1.8) % and 9.8% , respectively, year-over-year. GAAP net loss for the third fiscal quarter was $13.6 million, or $0.12 per basic share, a decrease of $8.6 million and $0.07 per basic share, respectively, year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $19.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, an increase of $6.8 million and $0.05 per diluted share, respectively, year-over-year.\n\"We made significant progress continuing to build the 'new' Extreme in the third fiscal quarter with year-over-year revenue growth and non-GAAP gross margin improvement, hitting all of our critical milestones associated with the systems integration of our newly acquired assets,\" stated Ed Meyercord, President and CEO of Extreme Networks.\n\"We achieved organic growth of 8% in core Extreme revenue, driven by strength in our wireless business, and 10% sequential growth in our acquired Campus Fabric revenue. Given strong demand, we built our order backlog by over $7M during the quarter. We expect improvement in our gross margins in our last fiscal quarter of 2018 as we continue to approach our 60% target, in addition to significant sequential and year-over-year quarterly revenue growth.\"\n\"On January 15 th , we successfully completed the migration of the data and IT systems of the acquired Data Center assets and on April 9 th , we completed a similar migration of the acquired Campus Fabric assets. The migration was on schedule with orders being booked, billed, and shipped on the first day of the cut-over. And we relocated approximately 265 employees into our newly renovated San Jose campus as planned on April 30 th . This completed our IT integration efforts following our recent acquisitions and we are now tracking and operating in one instance of our ERP system and procurement systems. Our teams have done an outstanding job driving our business while managing these large and complex integration initiatives.\"\nMeyercord added, \"Finally, our recent acquisitions are meaningfully strengthening our brand, our competitive position and our technology differentiation in the market evidenced by significant growth in our pipeline, which includes many cross-selling opportunities. In our fourth fiscal quarter, we expect to deliver continued year-over-year organic growth in our core Extreme business with less seasonality in our fourth fiscal quarter than prior years due to revenue trends from our acquired assets. After reviewing our pipeline we anticipate we will remain on track to meet or exceed our annual target of $430 million of newly acquired revenue from our recent acquisitions. Looking out into fiscal 2019, we remain on track to grow revenue 3 to 5% in the combined portfolio as compared to our second-half 2018 run-rate.\"\nRecent Key Highlights :\nConcord Hospital , a large regional hospital system, serves half a million patients and over 5,000 network users across 30 locations.

The impact of these adjustments to the balance sheet and income statement, are noted with \"as adjusted\". Cash and investments ended the quarter at $105.3 million, a decrease of $22.9 million from Q2 and a decrease of $12.0 million from Q3 last year, driven primarily by the funding of the acquisition of the Campus Fabric and Data Center businesses. Accounts receivable balance ending Q3 was $188.4 million, with days sales outstanding (\"DSO\") of 65. Q3 ending inventory was $77.8 million, a decrease of $5.6 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $28.1 million from Q3 last year. Q3 ending debt was $178.7 million, a decrease of $4.5 million from Q2 and an increase of $83.8 million from Q3 last year, driven primarily by borrowings to fund Extreme's acquisitions of the Campus Fabric and Data Center businesses. Business Outlook :\nExtreme's Business Outlook is based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially based on market conditions and the factors set forth under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below.\nFor its fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, ending June 30, 2018, the Company is targeting revenue in a range of $277.0 million to $287.0 million. GAAP gross margin is targeted between 56.0% and 58.1% and non-GAAP gross margin is targeted between 58.0% and 60.0%.

The Company is providing with this press release non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and free cash flow.\nReconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all historical non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included with this press release. In this press release, Extreme Networks also presents its target for non-GAAP expenses, which is expenses less share-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, purchase accounting adjustments, acquired inventory adjustments, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, litigation, amortization of acquired intangibles, other income and income tax.\nNon-GAAP measures presented in this press release are not in accordance with or alternative measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Extreme Networks' results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate Extreme Networks' results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nExtreme believes these non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures to enhance investors' and management's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and the Company's prospects for the future, including cash flows available to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. In addition, because Extreme Networks has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the Company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the Company's financial reporting.\nFor its internal planning process, and as discussed further below, Extreme's management uses financial statements that do not include share-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, purchase accounting adjustments, acquired inventory adjustment, amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, litigation, other income and income tax. Extreme's management also uses non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the Company's financial results.\nAs described above, Extreme excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable.\nShare-based compensation . This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases through its ESPP. Extreme Networks excludes share-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that the Company does not believe are reflective of ongoing cash requirement related to operating results. Extreme Networks expects to incur share-based compensation expenses in future periods.\nAcquisition and integration costs. Acquisition and integration costs consist of legal and professional fees related to the acquisition of a) Wireless LAN business, b) Campus Fabric business, c) Data Center business and d) the bargain purchase gain for the capital financing business; Extreme Networks excludes these expenses since they result from an event that is outside the ordinary course of continuing operations.\nPurchase accounting adjustments . Purchase accounting adjustments relating to deferred revenue consists of adjustments to the carrying value of deferred revenue. We have recorded adjustments to the assumed deferred revenue to reflect only a fulfillment margin and thereby excluding the profit margin and revenue which would have been incurred had Extreme Networks entered into the service contract post-acquisition.\nAcquired inventory adjustments . Purchase accounting adjustments relating to the mark up of acquired inventory to fair value less disposal costs.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles. Amortization of acquired intangibles includes the monthly amortization expense of acquired intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks and order backlog. The amortization of the developed technology intangible is recorded in product cost of goods sold, while the amortization for the other intangibles are recorded in operating expenses. Extreme Networks excludes these non-cash expenses since they result from an intangible asset and for which the period expense does not impact the operations of the business and are non-cash in nature.\nRestructuring expenses . Restructuring expenses primarily consist of severance costs for employees which have no benefit to continuing operations and accrued lease costs pertaining to the estimated future obligations for non-cancelable lease payments and accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements related to excess facilities. Extreme Networks excludes restructuring expenses since they result from events that often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations.\nExecutive transition expenses. Executive transition expenses consists of severance and termination benefits. The expenses are incurred through execution of pre-established employment contracts with senior executives.\nLitigation expenses . Litigation expenses consist of legal and professional fees and expenses related to our on-going litigation matters.\nOther income . Other income consists of the gain on the sale of our equity investment in a private company.\nIncome tax . Income tax adjustments relate to the tax impact of reducing the US tax rate applied to deferred tax items pursuant to the recently enacted US tax legislation as well as the tax benefit resulting from the impairment of a lease acquired from Avaya in Canada.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, Extreme uses free cash flow as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchase of property and equipment on a GAAP basis. Extreme considers free cash flows to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in Extreme's business, make strategic acquisitions, and strengthen the balance sheet. A limitation of the utility of free cash flows as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the Company's cash balance for the period.\nEXTREME NETWORKS, INC.\nCONDENSED OPERATIONS\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n(In thousands, except percentages and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nNon-GAAP Revenue\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(As adjusted)\n(As adjusted)\nRevenue - GAAP Basis\n$\n262,004\n$\n149,196\n$\n704,842\n$\n428,177\nAdjustments:\nPurchase accounting adjustment\n—\n—\n—\n133\nRevenue - Non-GAAP Basis\n$\n262,004\n$\n149,196\n$\n704,842\n$\n428,310\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(As adjusted)\n(As adjusted)\nGross profit - GAAP Basis\n$\n142,983\n$\n82,804\n$\n384,350\n$\n228,342\nGross margin - GAAP Basis percentage\n54.6%\n55.5%\n54.5%\n53.3%\nAdjustments:\nStock based compensation expense\n517\n129\n1,172\n737\nPurchase accounting adjustments\n—\n—\n—\n133\nAcquired inventory adjustments\n597\n1,963\n4,784\n4,263\nAcquisition and integration costs\n3,068\n(413)\n7,586\n5,104\nAmortization of intangibles\n4,581\n891\n11,109\n6,027\nTotal adjustments to GAAP gross profit\n$\n8,763\n$\n2,570\n$\n24,651\n$\n16,264\nGross profit - Non-GAAP\n$\n151,746\n$\n85,374\n$\n409,001\n$\n244,606\nGross margin - Non-GAAP percentage\n57.9%\n57.2%\n58.0%\n57.1%\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(As adjusted)\n(As adjusted)\nGAAP operating loss\n$\n(8,221)\n$\n(2,619)\n$\n(34,839)\n$\n(9,621)\nGAAP operating loss percentage\n(3.1)%\n(1.8)%\n(4.9)%\n(2.2)%\nAdjustments:\nStock based compensation expense\n7,818\n2,474\n19,646\n9,328\nAcquisition and integration costs, net of bargain purchase gain\n12,384\n3,005\n55,261\n15,012\nRestructuring charge, net of reversal\n4,920\n7,719\n4,920\n9,572\nAcquired inventory adjustments\n597\n1,963\n4,784\n4,263\nAmortization of intangibles\n6,682\n2,084\n17,570\n13,537\nPurchase accounting adjustments\n—\n—\n—\n133\nExecutive transition costs\n—\n—\n—\n34\nLitigation\n207\n(44)\n(158)\n219\nTotal adjustments to GAAP operating income\n$\n32,608\n$\n17,201\n$\n102,023\n$\n52,098\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n24,387\n$\n14,582\n$\n67,184\n$\n42,477\nNon-GAAP operating income percentage\n9.3%\n9.8%\n9.5%\n9.9%\nNon-GAAP Net Income\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(As adjusted)\n(As adjusted)\nGAAP net loss\n$\n(13,613)\n$\n(4,977)\n$\n(41,160)\n$\n(14,948)\nAdjustments:\nStock based compensation expense\n7,818\n2,474\n19,646\n9,328\nAcquisition and integration costs, net of bargain purchase gain\n12,384\n3,005\n55,261\n15,012\nRestructuring charge, net of reversal\n4,920\n7,719\n4,920\n9,572\nAcquired inventory adjustments\n597\n1,963\n4,784\n4,263\nAmortization of intangibles\n6,682\n2,084\n17,570\n13,537\nPurchase accounting adjustments\n—\n—\n—\n133\nExecutive transition costs\n—\n—\n—\n34\nLitigation\n207\n(44)\n(158)\n219\nGain on sale of non-marketable equity investment\n—\n—\n(3,757)\n—\nIncome tax\n—\n—\n(3,102)\n—\nTotal adjustments to GAAP net loss\n$\n32,608\n$\n17,201\n$\n95,164\n$\n52,098\nNon-GAAP net income\n$\n18,995\n$\n12,224\n$\n54,004\n$\n37,150\nEarnings per share\nNon-GAAP net income per share-diluted\n$\n0.16\n$\n0.11\n$\n0.45\n$\n0.34\nShares used in net income per share-diluted\nNon-GAAP shares used\n120,688\n112,576\n119,588\n110,455\nFree Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nCash flow (used in) provided by operations\n$\n(15,978)\n$\n24,673\n$\n(1,730)\n$\n43,961\nLess: PP&E CapEx spending\n(8,690)\n(3,170)\n(21,999)\n(7,832)\nTotal free cash flow\n$\n(24,668)\n$\n21,503\n$\n(23,729)\n$\n36,129\nInvestor Relations\nMedia Contact\nStan Kovler\nChristi Nicolacopoulos\n919/595-4196\n603/952-5005\nInvestor_relations@extremenetworks.com\npr@extremenetworks.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/extreme-networks-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2018-financial-results-300644882.html\nSOURCE Extreme Networks, Inc.",
