    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (Nasdaq:TXRH), today announced financial results for the 13 week period ended March 27, 2018.\nFirst Quarter ($000's) 2018 2017 % Change Total revenue $ 627,705 $ 567,686 10.6 % Income from operations 64,871 49,022 32.3 % Net income 54,541 34,313 59.0 % Diluted EPS $ 0.76 $ 0.48 57.9 % Results for the first quarter included the following highlights:\nComparable restaurant sales increased 4.9% at company restaurants and 3.9% at domestic franchise restaurants; Diluted earnings per share increased 57.9% to $0.76 from $0.48 in the prior year primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses and the benefit of a lower income tax rate. General and administrative expenses included a pre-tax charge recorded in the prior year period of $14.9 million ($9.2 million after-tax), or $0.13 per diluted share, related to the settlement of a legal matter; Restaurant margin dollars increased 6.3% to $119.4 million from $112.3 million in the prior year and restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, decreased 75 basis points to 19.2%; Our income tax rate decreased to 13.0% from 26.5% in the prior year period primarily due to the impact of new tax legislation; and Seven company restaurants, including one Bubba’s 33 restaurant, and two international franchise restaurants were opened.\nKent Taylor, Chief Executive Officer of Texas Roadhouse, Inc., commented, \"We are pleased to report another solid quarter highlighted by double-digit revenue growth and comparable restaurant sales growth of 4.9%. This sales growth was largely driven by traffic gains which have continued into the second quarter. While restaurant margins remain challenged by ongoing labor inflation, our operators have remained focused on providing our guests with a legendary experience. On the development front, our new restaurant pipeline is in good shape with 11 company restaurants and two international franchise restaurants, including our first in Mexico, open so far this year.\"\n2018 Outlook\nComparable restaurant sales at company restaurants for the first four weeks of our second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased approximately 8.5% compared to the prior year period.\nManagement updated the following expectation for 2018:\nCommodity cost inflation of approximately 1.0% compared to previous guidance of relatively flat food costs.\nManagement reiterated the following expectations for 2018:\nPositive comparable restaurant sales growth; Approximately 30 company restaurant openings, including up to seven Bubba’s 33 restaurants; Mid-single digit growth in labor dollars per store week, excluding the impact of higher guest counts; An income tax rate of 15.0% to 16.0%; and Total capital expenditures of approximately $165.0 million to $175.0 million.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Within our press release, we make reference to restaurant margin (in dollars and as a percentage of sales). Restaurant margin represents restaurant and other sales less restaurant-level operating costs, including cost of sales, labor, rent and other operating costs. Restaurant margin should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income from operations. This non-GAAP measure is not indicative of overall company performance and profitability in that this measure does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders due to the nature of the costs excluded. Restaurant margin is widely regarded as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance. In calculating restaurant margin, we exclude certain non-restaurant-level costs that support operations, including pre-opening and general and administrative expenses, but do not have a direct impact on restaurant-level operational efficiency and performance. We also exclude depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which relates to restaurant-level assets, as it represents a non-cash charge for the investment in our restaurants. We also exclude impairment and closure expense as we believe this provides a clearer perspective of ongoing operating performance and a more useful comparison to prior period results. Restaurant margin as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry. A reconciliation of income from operations to restaurant margin is included in the accompanying financial tables.\nConference Call\nTexas Roadhouse is hosting a conference call today, April 30, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.
