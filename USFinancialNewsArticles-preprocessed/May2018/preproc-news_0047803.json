The officer did not respond to a question about whether the 2005 incident was too old to face prosecution.\nReuters was unable to immediately reach a representative of Batali for comment.\n is 2005 in the new criminal investigation, according to the report.\nThe woman, who was not named on 60 Minutes, told CBS she was invited by Batali to a party at the Spotted Pig, a trendy restaurant in New York’s West Village owned by a friend of Batali.\nCBS concealed her face during the interview with shaded lighting. The woman said she was afraid the revelation of her identity programme other women.\nThe new accusations are the latest in the era of the #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment, which has ensnared media moguls and celebrities.\nActor Bill Cosby, 80, who is best known for his 1980s comedy TV programme “The Cosby Show,” was convicted in April of three counts of sexual assault for an incident in 2004. He faces up to 30 years in prison.\nBatali was fired in December 2017 by ABC as co-host of The Chew, a daytime food and talk show, and also stepped away from his restaurant company after the accusations by the four women first surfaced.
