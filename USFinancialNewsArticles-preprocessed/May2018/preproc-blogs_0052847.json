    "text": "Advertisement DECENTRALIZED NEWS\n. …Rekt: The Justice Department is investigating Bitcoin trade manipulation . Nobel laureate Robert Shiller doesn’t think anyone, “outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work.” Ethereum blockchain exceeds 1 terabyte . Royal Wedding outranks Bitcoin in Google searches. Crypto influencer wars over the meaning of blockchain. Russian accused of laundering Mt. Gox’s stolen Bitcoins confesses . Bitcoin ransoms for basset hounds ? BALANCING THE LEDGER\nMichael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale Investments, dropped by Balancing The Ledger to talk about the advantages of the regulatory crackdown; how the Bitcoin selloff has brought in new Wall Street money—and $200 million so far this year—into its cryptocurrency investment products; and what happens if Bitcoin doesn’t survive. Advertisement BUBBLE-O-METER\nAbout those ubiquitous, pestilent Ether giveaway scams on Twitter…(for an example, meet one of the several scammers impersonating me, whose account has not yet been suspended: @jenwiceczner. They’ve lifted my bio verbatim, and until recently, even used my profile pic—though I assure you, I am not giving away ETH). 5%—percentage (estimated) of cryptocurrency-related Twitter conversations targeted with Ether giveaway and other phishing scams 6 million: number of suspicious Twitter accounts the company identifies and reviews per week\n(Sources: Autonomous Research and Twitter, via Bloomberg )\nAdvertisement MEMES AND MUMBLES\nMumble: There’s a rivalry brewing between Coinbase and Robinhood, with the latter telling me recently that—after just beginning to offer Bitcoin trading a few months ago—it’s now gunning to be the No.1 by the end of this year. Robinhood, which started as a no-fee stock trading app, announced its new crypto service in January with the slogan “Don’t Sleep;” the company also wallpapered its offices and bathrooms with posters bearing that motto .\nWell, when Bloomberg reporter Julie VerHage caught wind of a similar office decor scheme at Coinbase , a spy provided photographic evidence:\nMeme: Donald Trump abruptly canceled the his historic summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un this week—but not before the White House had already minted special commemorative coins for the occasion. Though there is nothing digital or cryptographic about the coins, their apparent rarity—and the resulting demand surge that crashed the White House gift shop website —prompted hilarious comparisons to cryptocurrencies. Advertisement FOMO NO MO'\nDon’t miss out: The annual Fortune 500 issue is out, and it includes a fascinating deep dive from my Ledger co-editor Robert Hackett, exploring in vivid detail the “odd-couple” relationship between JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and Amber Baldet , the bank’s recently departed head of blockchain. Baldet left to co-found a blockchain startup with Patrick Nielsen called Clovyr, whose mission seemed abstract to me until reading Robert’s story, which crystallizes it perfectly:\nBaldet and Nielsen envision a world, not far off, where permissioned (business-ready) and public (Bitcoin-like) blockchains are joined much more closely. Baldet compares the state of blockchains today to the period a few years ago when corporations were weighing using public clouds such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft’s Azure. Eventually, they settled on hybrid architectures that include both private and public clouds, enabling more resilient, efficient ways of doing business. (Christine Moy, who succeeded Baldet as head of the JPMorgan Chase team, sees the blockchain world similarly; she recently told the website Coindesk, “Maybe someday this will all converge.”) That’s part of Baldet’s and Nielsen’s impetus to found Clovyr, their new startup, which takes its name from the cloverleaf infrastructure of highway on-ramps and off-ramps.\nWe hope you enjoyed this edition of The Ledger.
