    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn., May 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Gibson Brands Inc. (\"Gibson\" or \"the Company\") , today announced that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington entered a final order granting the company authority to access the full amount of its $135 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and use of cash collateral. The Court previously granted final approvals for the Company's first day motions intended to support the business, including continuing to pay employee wages and benefits and to honor warranties and customer programs.\n\"This is the next milestone for Gibson in completing our pre-negotiated Chapter 11. Our financing has the support of all of our stakeholders. Today's decision assures that it remains business as usual at Gibson,\" said Henry Juszkiewicz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gibson Brands. \"Pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan Term Sheet, this plan already has the critical support of our majority note holders. The transaction embodied in the Restructuring Support Agreement will, once approved, reduce our leverage, and allow us to quickly emerge from this process with a stronger balance sheet to support the Company's long-term success, benefiting our valued customers, business partners, and employees in the years ahead.\"\nAs previously announced, on May 1, 2018, Gibson Brands filed its voluntary petitions and plan of reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington. The case number is 18-11025.\nAdditional information is available by calling Gibson's Restructuring Hotline, toll-free in the U.S. at 1-844-240-1258. For calls originating outside the U.S., please dial 1-929-477-8085. Email inquiries can be sent to gibsoninfo@primeclerk.com .
