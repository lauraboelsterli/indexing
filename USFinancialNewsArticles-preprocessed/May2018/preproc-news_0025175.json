(NYSE: OMI) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, including consolidated revenues of $2.37 billion, representing an increase of 1.9%, when compared to revenues of $2.33 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Quarterly net income was $8.2 million compared to $18.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $0.31 for the first quarter of last year. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $26.2 million compared to $26.4 million, or $0.43 per share, compared to $0.44 per share in last year’s first quarter. A reconciliation of reported results to adjusted (non-GAAP) measures is included below.\nConsolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $24.2 million compared to $35.5 million in last year’s first quarter. Adjusted consolidated operating income (non-GAAP) for the first quarter was $47.6 million compared to $47.7 million for the same period last year.\n“We are pleased to have completed the acquisition of Halyard Health’s S&IP business, which represents a meaningful step in the evolution of our business. Together, the Halyard S&IP business and Byram Healthcare serve to strengthen and diversify our business model,” said P. Cody Phipps, chairman, president & chief executive officer of Owens & Minor. “Our quarterly results improved sequentially, consistent with our expectations, as we continued to transform our business. By combining the Halyard S&IP business with our existing products group, our Global Products strategic business unit has an enhanced presence in the medical products sector with approximately $1.5 billion in annualized revenues. This transaction gives Owens & Minor a global platform for growth with a strong product portfolio and exceptional teammates.”\nAcquisition of Halyard Health S&IP Business\nOn April 30, 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Halyard Health’s S&IP business. Halyard S&IP’s highly regarded surgical and infection prevention offerings range from sterilization wraps, surgical drapes and gowns, facial protection and protective apparel to medical exam gloves and include brands such as AEROBLUE and AEROCHROME; exam gloves including PURPLE, LAVENDER and STERLING; and sterilization wraps such as ONE-STEP, QUICK CHECK and SMART-FOLD. This business will become an essential part of the Global Products Strategic Business Unit. With access to markets in 90 countries, the Halyard S&IP business provides Owens & Minor with global reach and a platform for growth.\nTo finance the transaction, Owens & Minor entered into new, multi-year term loan agreements with banks and institutional lenders.\nSegment Results\nOwens & Minor is now operating under two Strategic Business Units (SBUs)—Global Solutions and Global Products—reflecting the company’s evolving business. Management believes the new SBU structure will create better alignment within the organization. Results for these two new segments include the following:\nThe Global Solutions SBU is comprised of the former Domestic and International segments, which includes our U.S. and European distribution, logistics and value-added services business, as well as Byram Healthcare. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.34 billion compared to $2.29 billion a year ago. Global Solutions’ operating income was $31.6 million compared to $38.0 million a year ago, as a result of continued margin pressure and warehouse inefficiencies in our distribution centers. Teams are actively working to resolve the inefficiencies. Byram Healthcare, acquired in August 2017, contributed positively to quarterly results, adding $118 million to revenues. Byram is bringing significant momentum to Owens & Minor’s strategy to serve the market along the continuum of care.\nThe Global Products SBU is comprised of our former Proprietary Products segment, which includes Global Sourcing, Clinical & Procedural Solutions (CPS), and now the Halyard S&IP business. Revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $121 million compared to $137 million for the same period last year. Because the acquisition was completed on April 30, 2018, Global Products first quarter results do not reflect contributions from Halyard S&IP revenues. The quarterly revenue change resulted primarily from the previously discussed loss of customers last year. However, Global Products’ operating income increased by $1.7 million to $9.8 million, as a result of improved operating efficiencies.\nAsset Management\nThe balance of cash and cash equivalents was $87.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $105 million at December 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported operating cash flow of $18.3 million, compared to a use of cash of $26.4 million for the same period last year. For the quarter, asset management metrics included consolidated days sales outstanding (DSO) of 28.9 compared to 28.7 days as of year-end. Consolidated inventory turns were 8.3 times for the first quarter, compared to 8.5 times in 2017.\nUpcoming Investor Events\nOwens & Minor plans to participate in the following investor conferences in the second quarter of 2018 and the company will post webcasts of formal presentations on its corporate website:\nBank of America Merrill Lynch 2018 Healthcare Conference; May 15 Goldman Sachs 2018 Global Healthcare Conference; June 12\nInvestors Conference Call & Supplemental Material\nConference Call: Owens & Minor will conduct a conference call for investors on Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EDT.

These amounts are highly dependent on the size and frequency of acquisitions and are being excluded to allow for a more consistent comparison with forecasted, current and historical results and the results of our peers. We began to exclude these charges from our non-GAAP results in the second quarter of 2017 and thus prior year amounts have been recast on the same basis.\n(2) Acquisition related expenses in the current quarter consist primarily of transition and transaction costs for the Halyard S&IP transaction and Byram and in first quarter of 2017 consist primarily of transition and transaction costs for Byram.\n(3) Exit and realignment charges in 2018 were primarily associated with establishment of our Client Engagement Center. Amounts in 2017 were associated with the write-down of information system assets which are no longer used and severance charges from reduction in force and other employee costs associated with the establishment of our new client engagement center.\n(4) Software as a Service (SaaS) implementation costs associated with the upgrading of global IT platforms in connection with the redesign of our global information system strategy. SaaS implementation costs are recorded in other operating (income) expense, net.\n(5) These charges have been tax effected in the preceding table by determining the income tax rate depending on the amount of charges incurred in different tax jurisdictions and the deductibility of those charges for income tax purposes.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nThis earnings release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). In general, the measures exclude items and charges that (i) management does not believe reflect Owens & Minor, Inc.'s (the \"Company\") core business and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance, evaluate the balance sheet, engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation. Management provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on its financial and operating results and in comparing the Company's performance to that of its competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005367/en/\nOwens & Minor, Inc.\nTruitt Allcott, 804-723-7555\nDirector, Investor & Media Relations\ntruitt.allcott@owens-minor.com\nor\nChuck Graves, 804-723-7556\nDirector, Finance & Investor Relations\nchuck.graves@owens-minor.com\nSource: Owens & Minor, Inc.",
