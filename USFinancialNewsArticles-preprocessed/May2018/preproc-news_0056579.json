May 25, 2018; Cleveland, OH, USA; Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (0) shoots the ball against Cleveland Cavaliers center Kevin Love (0) during the first quarter in game six of the Eastern conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Quicken Loans Arena. Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\nThe All-Star was re-evaluated Saturday prior to the decision to hold him out of the final game of the Eastern Conference finals. The series is tied at three games apiece.\nLove exited Game 6 on Friday night following a head-to-head collision with Celtics rookie Jayson Tatum during the first quarter. The Cavs announced at halftime that Love would not return as a precaution as he was being evaluated for a concussion.\nCleveland went on to win 109-99 to even the series at three games apiece, but as he was leaving the arena Love told The Athletic’s Jason Lloyd that his availability for Game 7 will be a “toss-up.”\nWith 6:58 remaining in the first quarter, Tatum accidentally ran into Love while he was trying to get positioning as the Cavaliers controlled the ball. Love immediately fell to the court with his hands to his head as time was called.

Mandatory Credit: David Richard-USA TODAY Sports\nCavs point guard George Hill helped Love to the bench before the 29-year-old went to the locker room for evaluation.\nTatum, who was shaken up on the collision, remained in the game. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after the game Tatum will continue to be monitored for concussion symptoms, though “every indication is he’s fine.”\nLove entered Friday averaging 14.8 points and 10.4 rebounds in this year’s playoffs. He has a history of concussions, including one during the 2016 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, which caused him to miss Game 3 of the series.\n—Field Level Media",
