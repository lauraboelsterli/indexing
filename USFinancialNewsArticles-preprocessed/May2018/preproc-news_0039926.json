    "text": "May 19, 2018 / 5:49 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago Texas shooting suspect seems 'weirdly non-emotional,' lawyer says Erwin Seba 5 Min Read\nSANTA FE, Texas (Reuters) - The 17-year-old student who authorities said killed 10 people when he opened fire in an art class in his Houston-area high school appeared “weirdly non-emotional” on the morning after the rampage, one of his lawyers said on Saturday.\nThe teenager, identified by law enforcement as Dimitrios Pagourtzis, has been charged with capital murder and is being held without bail in Santa Fe, Texas, where authorities said he opened fire shortly before 8 a.m. on Friday.\nIn addition to 10 fatalities, the shooter wounded at least 13 people, with two of them in critical condition. One of those in critical condition was one of the two school resource officers who engaged the shooter before his surrender.\nNicholas Poehl, one of two lawyers hired by the suspect’s parents to represent him, told Reuters he had spent a total of one hour with Pagourtzis on Friday night and Saturday morning.\n“He’s very emotional and weirdly non-emotional,” the attorney said when asked to describe his client’s state of mind. “There are aspects of it he understands and there are aspects he doesn’t understand.”\nAs the shooting unfolded, Pagourtzis spared people he liked so he could have his side of the story told, a charging document seen by Reuters showed, but there was no immediate indication why he apparently targeted the art class.\nInvestigators had seen a T-shirt on the suspect’s Facebook page that read “Born to Kill,” and authorities were examining his journal, Texas Governor Greg Abbott told reporters. But there were no outward signs he had been planning an attack.\nPagourtzis waived his right to remain silent and made a statement to authorities admitting to the shooting, according to an affidavit ahead of his arrest. Later he was charged with capital murder and denied bail at a court hearing.\nAsked if Pagourtzis has provided authorities with information about the shootings, Poehl said: “Honestly because of his emotional state, I don’t have a lot on that.” Related Coverage 'Born to kill' Texas shooter a quiet teenager in trench coat\nSanta Fe High School, southeast of Houston, became the scene of the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school in modern history, joining a long list of campuses where students and faculty have fallen victim to gunfire.\nThe Texas rampage again stoked the nation’s long-running debate over gun ownership, three months after a student-led gun control movement emerged from a mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 teens and educators dead.\nStudents and faculty, bussed on to campus in small groups, were allowed to enter the high school on Saturday to retrieve belongings, though investigators closed off a section of the grounds. Police kept reporters about 100 yards (91.4 m) away.\nAll schools in the Santa Fe school district will remain closed on Monday and Tuesday, officials said at a short briefing.\nIn a letter dated Friday but posted on the district’s website on Saturday, Superintendent Leigh Wall said eight of the dead were students and two were teachers. Authorities had earlier said that nine students and one teacher were killed.\nA vigil was held on Friday night for the victims, who have not been officially identified.\n“This will bring us closer together - hopefully, a positive impact from something negative,” said Clayton George, 16, who played football with the suspect.

REUTERS/Pu Ying Huang\nThe Pakistan Embassy in Washington D.C. identified one of the victims on Twitter as Sabika Sheikh, a Pakistani exchange student, while the brother-in-law of Cynthia Tisdale, a teacher’s aide and mother of four, said on Facebook she was killed in the attack.\nNational Football League star J.J. Watt, who plays defensive end for the Houston Texans, said he will pay for the funerals of the deceased, local media reported.\n“Absolutely horrific,” he tweeted about the shooting. ‘QUIET LONER’ IN A TRENCHCOAT\nClassmates at the school of some 1,460 students described Pagourtzis as a quiet loner who played on the football team. On Friday, they said he wore a trench coat to school in Santa Fe, about 30 miles (50 km) southeast of Houston, on a day when temperatures topped 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius).\nTexas’ governor, Abbott, said Pagourtzis obtained firearms from his father, who had likely acquired them legally, and also left behind explosive devices.\nAbbott told reporters that Pagourtzis wanted to commit suicide, citing the suspect’s journals, but did not have the courage to do so.\nSome aspects of Friday’s shooting had echoes of the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999. The two teenaged killers in that incident wore trench coats, used shotguns and planted improvised explosives, killing 10 before committing suicide themselves.\nIt was the second mass shooting in Texas in less than seven months. A man armed with an assault rifle shot dead 26 people during Sunday prayers at a rural church last November.
