A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables following this news release.\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses increased primarily due to operating costs from our Veracode acquisition, which were mainly personnel-related. GAAP income tax expense included a $28 million tax benefit relating to the refinement of the provisional amount previously recorded for the impact from the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 (“US Tax Reform”). GAAP EPS was positively impacted by $0.07 from the US Tax Reform adjustment. Non-GAAP income tax expense excluded the aforementioned tax benefit relating to US Tax Reform. GAAP EPS was positively impacted by $0.09 from an increase in GAAP operating margin. Non-GAAP EPS was positively impacted by $0.11 from an increase in non-GAAP operating margin.\nFull Year\n(dollars in millions) Full Year FY18 vs. FY17 FY18 FY17 %\nChange %\nChange\nCC**\nGAAP Operating Expenses Before Interest and Income Taxes $3,116 $2,901 7% 5% Operating Income Before Interest and Income Taxes $1,119 $1,135 (1)% 0% Diluted EPS $1.13 $1.85 (39)% (38)% Operating Margin 26% 28% Effective Tax Rate 53.4% 27.8% Non-GAAP* Operating Expenses Before Interest and Income Taxes $2,684 $2,531 6% 4% Operating Income Before Interest and Income Taxes $1,551 $1,505 3% 4% Diluted EPS $2.59 $2.48 4% 6% Operating Margin 37% 37% Effective Tax Rate 24.9% 27.8%\n*Refer to the discussion of Non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures included in the tables following this news release.\n**CC or Constant Currency is a non-GAAP financial measure, as noted in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables following this news release.\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses increased primarily due to operating costs from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions, which were mainly personnel-related. GAAP operating expenses were also affected by higher amortization expenses of purchased software and other intangible assets from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions. GAAP income tax expense included a $290 million tax charge relating to the US Tax Reform. This tax charge was comprised of $194 million related to the deemed US repatriation of earnings held by non-US subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years, and $96 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in income tax rates. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $0.70 from the US Tax Reform adjustment. Non-GAAP income tax expense excluded the aforementioned tax charge relating to US Tax Reform. Non-GAAP EPS was positively impacted by $0.10 from a decrease in the non-GAAP effective tax rate. Non-GAAP EPS was positively impacted by $0.16 from an increase in non-GAAP operating margin, partially offset by a $0.12 impact from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions.\nSELECTED QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS\nJean M.

Mainframe Solutions operating margin increased primarily due to a decrease in corporate overhead costs and the Mainframe Solutions portion of the litigation settlement costs incurred during fiscal 2017. Enterprise Solutions revenue increased due to revenue generated from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions, which contributed approximately 12 points of revenue growth for the year, partially offset by a decrease in sales from our more mature Enterprise Solutions products.

Services revenue increased due to professional services revenue generated from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions. Operating margin for Services increased primarily due to an increase in professional services revenue from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions and a decrease in personnel-related costs resulting from severance actions during fiscal 2017.\nCASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS\nCash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $548 million, compared with $420 million in the prior year. Cash flow from operations increased primarily due to an increase in cash collections from billings, partially offset by an increase in vendor disbursements and payroll. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1.198 billion, compared with $1.078 billion in the prior fiscal year. Cash flow from operations increased primarily due to an increase in cash collections from billings mainly from collections from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions and a decrease in income tax payments, net, partially offset by an increase in vendor disbursements and payroll mainly from disbursements from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 were $3.405 billion. Approximately 53% of the Company's cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries outside the United States at March 31, 2018. With $2.783 billion in total debt outstanding and $137 million in notional pooling, the Company’s net cash position was $485 million. For fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased 5 million shares of stock for $163 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company was authorized to purchase $487 million of its common stock under its current stock repurchase program. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company distributed $107 million in dividends to shareholders. For fiscal 2018, the Company distributed $428 million in dividends to shareholders. The Company’s outstanding share count at March 31, 2018 was 412 million.\nFISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING CHARGE\nOn May 2, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2019 Plan”) to better align its business priorities.\nThe Fiscal 2019 Plan comprises the termination of approximately 800 employees and facility exits and consolidations. These actions are intended to better align the Company’s cost structure with the skills and resources required to more effectively pursue opportunities in the marketplace and execute the Company’s long-term growth strategy, which includes a particular focus on shifting more of the Company’s business to a subscription-based model.\nActions under the Fiscal 2019 Plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2019. Under the Fiscal 2019 Plan, the Company expects to incur a pre-tax charge between approximately $140 million and $160 million (including severance costs between approximately $90 million and $100 million and facility exit and consolidation costs between approximately $50 million and $60 million).\nOUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2019\nThe following outlook for fiscal 2019 is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2018, and is under the ASC 605 Revenue Standard. It assumes no material acquisitions, takes into account the costs and payments associated with the restructuring charge discussed above, and contains “forward-looking statements” (as defined below). As the Company implements the ASC 606 Revenue Standard for fiscal 2019, we will be reporting results under both the ASC 605 and ASC 606 Revenue Standards during fiscal 2019 but will be providing guidance that primarily messages the business to ASC 605 results for comparability purposes.\nThe Company expects the following:*\nTotal revenue to change in a range of flat to plus 1 percent as reported and minus 1 percent to flat in constant currency. At March 31, 2018 exchange rates, this translates to reported revenue of $4.25 billion to $4.29 billion. Full-year GAAP operating margin between 24 percent and 26 percent and non-GAAP operating margin of 37 percent. The Company also expects a full-year GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 22 percent.** GAAP diluted earnings per share to increase in a range of 58 percent to 65 percent as reported and 50 percent to 58 percent in constant currency. At March 31, 2018 exchange rates, this translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.87. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to increase in a range of 6 percent to 8 percent as reported and 2 percent to 4 percent in constant currency. At March 31, 2018 exchange rates, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.81. Approximately 406 million shares outstanding at fiscal 2019 year-end and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 412 million for the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations to decrease in a range of 5 percent to 1 percent as reported and 7 percent to 3 percent in constant currency. At March 31, 2018 exchange rates, this translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.14 billion to $1.18 billion. This includes the impact related to the restructuring charge, which is estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million. It also includes an estimated cash tax headwind of approximately $50 million compared to fiscal 2018 due to the convergence of ASC 606 and US Tax Reform. We estimate the impact of cash taxes in fiscal 2019 to create an approximate 4 point headwind to cash flow from operations and the impact of restructuring to create a 6 to 8 point headwind to cash flow from operations.\n*In the outlook section, certain non-material differences between growth rates and translated dollar amounts may arise from impact of rounding.\n**The tax rate guidance provided above assumes no further material refinements of the provisional amount previously recorded for the impact from US Tax Reform.\nWebcast\nThis news release and the accompanying tables should be read in conjunction with additional content that is available on the Company’s website, including a supplemental financial package, as well as a conference call and webcast that the Company will host at 5:00 p.m. ET today to discuss its unaudited fourth quarter and full fiscal year results.
