    "text": "May 7, 2018 / 3:53 PM / in 18 minutes U.S. sanctions three Venezuelans, Pence calls for more action Roberta Rampton , Alexandra Ulmer 3 Min Read\nWASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States on Monday sanctioned three Venezuelans and 20 companies with ties to socialist President Nicolas Maduro for narcotics trafficking activity, and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called for more nations to increase pressure on Caracas. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence addresses the Organization of American States at the OAS headquarters in Washington, U.S. May 7, 2018 REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nThe new sanctions continue a pattern of stepped-up U.S. measures on individuals connected to Maduro, who is blamed by President Donald Trump’s administration for a deep recession and hyperinflation in OPEC member Venezuela that has caused food shortages and sent a flood of migrants into neighboring countries.\nThe individuals sanctioned on Monday are fairly low-profile and are unlikely to create major economic hardship. Related Coverage Pence urges OAS to suspend Venezuela from organization\nTrump has so far opted not to impose new oil-related sanctions that it has considered for a Venezuelan oil services company and on insurance coverage for tankers carrying Venezuelan oil, though the measures are still under consideration, one administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence addresses the Organization of American States at OAS headquarters in Washington, U.S. May 7, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nPence told the 35-nation Organization of American States - which includes Venezuela as a member - that they needed to take greater steps to isolate Maduro.\n“We believe it is time to do more, much more,” Pence said in an address to the OAS. “Every free nation gathered here must take stronger action to stand with the Venezuelan people and stand up to their oppressors.”\nPence said the OAS should suspend Venezuela’s membership, and urged other members to cut off the nation’s leaders from financial systems and restrict them from travel visas.

They are owned or controlled by the three individuals, the U.S. Treasury said in a statement.\nOil prices rose to their highest levels since late 2014 on Monday, boosted by fresh troubles for Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and a looming decision on whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.\nU.S. oil major ConocoPhillips has moved to take Caribbean assets of PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award, three sources told Reuters. The move could deal a further blow to the company’s declining oil output and exports.
