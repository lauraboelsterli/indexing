Brent crude futures were at $78.97 per barrel, up 0.6 percent.\nThe market is also keeping an eye on Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro faces fresh international censure after his re-election in a vote foes denounced as a farce, cementing autocracy in the crisis-stricken OPEC nation.\nOil prices have been supported by plummeting Venezuelan production, in addition to a solid global demand and supply concerns stemming from tensions in the Middle East.\nThe “risk on” sentiment on the market also spurred gains copper prices with the exception of aluminium, which was pressured by more than 100,000 tonnes of inflow last week.\nReporting by Julien Ponthus; Editing by Toby Chopra, William Maclean\n ",
