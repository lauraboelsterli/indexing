    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 7:56 PM / in 4 minutes Pompeo promises North Korea future 'brimming with prosperity' if it denuclearizes Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea faces “a future brimming with peace and prosperity” if it gives up its nuclear weapons soon, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday as the two countries prepare for a historic summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo holds a joint press availability with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha after their meeting at the State Department in Washington, U.S., May 11, 2018.
