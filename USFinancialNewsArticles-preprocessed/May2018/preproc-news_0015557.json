FILE PHOTO: A view of ILVA steel plant in Taranto, Italy August 3, 2012. REUTERS/Yara Nardi/File Photo FOR EDITORIAL USE ONLY. NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES - RC17367954B0\nArcelorMittal will divest production facilities assets in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Romania and Macedonia. It will also sell some distribution activities in France and Italy.\nThe European Commission said the steel plants would be sold to buyers who would continue to operate them, allowing them to compete with ArcelorMittal.\nReuters reported on April 20 that the deal would secure conditional EU antitrust approval.
