    "text": "Fire officials say two buses have collided in the Lincoln Tunnel, and authorities say 32 people have been hurt, included seven with serious, but non-life-threatening injuries.\n@cbenavidesT47 tweet\nOfficials say a NJ Transit bus rear-ended another at about 9:50 a.m. ET Friday in the tunnel's center tube and then drove into New York City and pulled over. The accident snarled morning rush hour traffic.\n@AirCycle tweet\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the tunnel, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Lincoln Tunnel connects New York City with New Jersey and is a major transit artery.\nOfficials said the tunnel was open, with delays.\n--CNBC's Chloe Aiello contributed to this report.",
