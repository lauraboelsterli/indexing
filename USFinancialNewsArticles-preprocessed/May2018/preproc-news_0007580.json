    "text": "Company delivers record sales and adjusted earnings per share\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Littelfuse, Inc. (NASDAQ:LFUS) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nNet sales were $417.8 million, up 46% versus the prior year. Organic revenue growth was 10%. Growth by segment versus the prior year period: Electronics sales increased 72% (up 10% organically) Automotive sales increased 17% (up 10% organically) Industrial sales increased 14% (up 13% organically) GAAP diluted EPS was $1.45; this includes $23 million of after-tax charges primarily related to certain purchase accounting adjustments and costs for the acquisition of IXYS Corporation, net of non-operating foreign exchange gains Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39 increased 41% over last year GAAP effective tax rate was 19.3% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 19.6% Cash flow from operations was $69.3 million and free cash flow was $51.4 million The electronics segment book-to-bill ratio for the first quarter was 1.14 (excluding IXYS)\n\"We continued our momentum with an exceptional start to 2018,” said Dave Heinzmann, Littelfuse Chief Executive Officer. “With our focus on the secular trends of a safer, greener and increasingly connected world, and consistent operational performance, we delivered sales and adjusted earnings that meaningfully exceeded our guidance. We are off to a strong start integrating the IXYS business, and have taken initial steps to drive synergy realization. Leveraging the broad-based demand across our businesses, we expect robust top-line growth and consistent operating margins in the second quarter. We are focused on the right growth opportunities to continue executing our long-term strategy and driving double digit sales and earnings growth.”\nFor the second quarter of 2018*:\nNet sales are expected to be in the range of $450 to $462 million, up 45% on a reported basis and up 8% organically, at the midpoint versus the prior year quarter Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.39 to $2.53, representing 17% growth over the prior year quarter at the midpoint Similar to prior years, second quarter stock compensation expense is higher than other quarters due to equity grant provisions, equating to approximately eight cents of earnings per share Adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5%; the midpoint is approximately 500 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. At a constant year-over-year tax rate, EPS growth would be 25%\nThe guidance includes a full quarter of IXYS results, along with a full quarter of related share dilution and interest expense from the debt issued in conjunction with the transaction.\nFor the 2018 full year, the company expects an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 18% – 21%.\n*All comparisons are to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Littelfuse provides guidance on a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. GAAP items excluded from guidance may include the after-tax impact of items including acquisition and integration costs, impairment and severance charges, certain purchase accounting adjustments, foreign exchange adjustments and significant and unusual items. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to results computed in accordance with GAAP. Littelfuse is not able to forecast the excluded items in order to provide the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts.\nDividend and Share Repurchase Authorization\nThe company will pay a cash dividend on its common stock of $0.37 per share on June 7, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 24, 2018 The company’s previous share repurchase authorization expired on April 30, 2018 and has been replaced with a one million share repurchase authorization effective through April 30, 2019.

Many of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of certain expenses and income not related directly to the underlying performance of our fundamental business operations. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is set forth in the attached schedules.\nThe company believes that organic revenue growth, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to investors regarding its operational performance because they enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our core financial performance and facilitate comparisons to historical results of operations, by excluding items that are not related directly to the underlying performance of our fundamental business operations or were not part of our business operations during a comparable period. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure of its ability to generate cash. The company believes that all of these non-GAAP financial measures are commonly used by financial analysts and others in the industries in which we operate, and thus further provide useful information to investors. Management additionally uses these measures when assessing the performance of the business and for business planning purposes. Note that our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those terms as defined or used by other companies.\nLFUS-F\nLITTELFUSE, INC.
