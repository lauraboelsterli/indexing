(NYSE:PKE) reported net sales of $27,804,000 for the 2018 fiscal year’s fourth quarter ended February 25, 2018 compared to net sales of $27,599,000 for the 2017 fiscal year’s fourth quarter ended February 26, 2017 and net sales of $26,139,000 for the 2018 fiscal year’s third quarter ended November 26, 2017. Park’s net sales for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018 were $111,196,000 compared to net sales of $114,609,000 for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2017.\nNet earnings for the 2018 fiscal year’s fourth quarter were $17,965,000 compared to $2,477,000 for the 2017 fiscal year’s fourth quarter and $716,000 for the 2018 fiscal year’s third quarter. Net earnings were $20,595,000 for the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018 compared to $9,283,000 for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2017.\nPark reported net earnings before special items of $1,972,000 for the 2018 fiscal year’s fourth quarter compared to net earnings before special items of $2,548,000 for the 2017 fiscal year’s fourth quarter and net earnings before special items of $1,131,000 for the 2018 fiscal year’s third quarter.\nIn the 2018 fiscal year’s fourth quarter, the Company recorded a one-time tax benefit of $17,802,000 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. Additionally, in the 2018 fiscal year’s fourth quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $287,000, a pre-tax loss on the sales of marketable securities of $1,342,000, pre-tax deferred financing costs of $144,000 related to the early termination of the HSBC Bank Credit Agreement, a pre-tax stock option modification charge of $513,000 and pre-tax advisory fees of $162,000.

The loss on the sales of marketable securities was in connection with the liquidation of securities to repatriate overseas funds to pay off the HSBC loan of $68,500,000 and pay a special cash dividend of $3.00 per share in February 2018. The stock option modification charge related to a modification of previously granted employee stock options resulting from the special dividend paid in February 2018. The advisory fees pertained to the strategic evaluation of the Company’s electronics business announced in January 2018.\nIn the 2017 fiscal year’s fourth quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $107,000 in connection with the aforementioned Newburgh, New York facility closure. In the 2018 fiscal year’s third quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $472,000 related to the consolidation of its electronics business units located in California and Arizona and the closure, in fiscal year 2009, of its facility located in Newburgh, New York and advisory fees related to the strategic evaluation of the Company’s electronics business of $190,000 included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018, Park reported net earnings before special items of $7,930,000 compared to net earnings before special items of $9,480,000 for the prior fiscal year. In the 2018 fiscal year, the Company recorded the one-time tax benefit of $17,802,000 mentioned above and recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $5,022,000 related to the consolidation of electronics business units and facility closures mentioned above, a pre-tax loss on the sales of marketable securities of $1,342,000, pre-tax deferred financing costs of $144,000, a pre-tax stock option modification charge of $513,000, all mentioned above, pre-tax advisory fees of $352,000 related to the strategic evaluation of the Company’s electronics business and a pre-tax one-time litigation expense of $375,000.

The conference call replay can be accessed by dialing (855) 859-2056 in the United States and Canada and (404) 537-3406 in other countries and entering passcode 2474705 or on the Company's web site at www.parkelectro.com/investor/investor.html .\nAny additional material financial or statistical data disclosed in the conference call will also be available at the time of the conference call on the Company's web site at www.parkelectro.com/investor/investor.html .\nPark believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations would be difficult if the disclosure of its operating results were limited to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) financial measures, which include special items, such as restructuring charges, losses on sales of marketable securities, deferred financing charges, stock option modification charges, pre-tax litigation expenses and strategic evaluation advisory fees. Accordingly, in addition to disclosing its operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, Park discloses non-GAAP operating results that exclude special items in order to assist its shareholders and other readers in assessing the Company’s operating performance, since the Company’s on-going, normal business operations do not include such special items. The detailed operating information presented below reconciles the non-GAAP operating results before special items to earnings determined in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures are provided to supplement the results provided in accordance with GAAP.\nPark Electrochemical Corp. is a global advanced materials company which develops and manufactures advanced composite materials, primary and secondary structures and assemblies and low-volume tooling for the aerospace markets and high-technology digital and RF/microwave printed circuit materials principally for the telecommunications and internet infrastructure, enterprise and military/aerospace markets. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are located in Kansas, Singapore, France, Arizona and California. The Company also maintains R&D facilities in Arizona, Kansas and Singapore.\nAdditional corporate information is available on the Company’s web site at www.parkelectro.com\nPerformance table, including non-GAAP information (in thousands, except per share amounts –unaudited):\n13 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended February 25,\n2018 February 26,\n2017 November 26,\n2017 February 25,\n2018 February 26,\n2017 Sales $ 27,804 $ 27,599 $ 26,139 $ 111,196 $ 114,609 Net Earnings before Special Items 1 $ 1,972 $ 2,548 $ 1,131 $ 7,930 $ 9,480 Special Items, net of Tax: One-time Litigation Expense - - - (236 ) - Strategic Evaluation Advisory Fees (102 ) - (119 ) (221 ) - Stock Option Modification (322 ) - - (322 ) - Restructuring Charges (180 ) (71 ) (296 ) (3,153 ) (197 ) Loss on Sale of Marketable Securities (1,114 ) - - (1,114 ) - Acceleration of Deferred Financing Costs (91 ) - - (91 ) - Tax Cut and Jobs Act 17,802 - - 17,802 - Net Earnings $ 17,965 $ 2,477 $ 716 $ 20,595 $ 9,283 Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share: Basic Earnings before Special Items 1 $ 0.10 $ 0.13 $ 0.06 $ 0.39 $ 0.47 Special Items: One-time Litigation Expense - - - (0.01 ) - Strategic Evaluation Advisory Fees (0.01 ) - (0.01 ) (0.01 ) - Stock Option Modification (0.02 ) - - (0.02 ) - Restructuring Charges (0.01 ) (0.01 ) (0.01 ) (0.16 ) (0.01 ) Loss on Sale of Marketable Securities (0.05 ) - - (0.05 ) - Acceleration of Deferred Financing Costs - - - - - Tax Cut and Jobs Act 0.88 - - 0.88 - Basic Earnings (Loss) per Share $ 0.89 $ 0.12 $ 0.04 $ 1.02 $ 0.46 Diluted Earnings before Special Items 1 $ 0.10 $ 0.13 $ 0.06 $ 0.39 $ 0.47 Special Items: One-time Litigation Expense - - - (0.01 ) - Strategic Evaluation Advisory Fees (0.01 ) - (0.01 ) (0.01 ) - Stock Option Modification (0.02 ) - - (0.02 ) - Restructuring Charges (0.02 ) (0.01 ) (0.01 ) (0.16 ) (0.01 ) Loss on Sale of Marketable Securities (0.05 ) - - (0.05 ) - Acceleration of Deferred Financing Costs - - - - - Tax Cut and Jobs Act 0.88 - - 0.88 - Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share $ 0.88 $ 0.12 $ 0.04 $ 1.02 $ 0.46 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Basic 20,238 20,235 20,237 20,237 20,235 Diluted 20,311 20,253 20,261 20,267 20,239 1 Refer to \"Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures\" below for information regarding Special Items.
