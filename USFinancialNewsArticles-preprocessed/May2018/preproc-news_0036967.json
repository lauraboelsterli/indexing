    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 3:12 AM / Updated an hour ago UPDATE 1-Golf-Leishman fires career-low 61 to lead Byron Nelson Reuters Staff\n* Australian Leishman takes three-stroke lead\n* World number three Spieth rues a middling 69 (Adds details, quotes)\nMay 17 (Reuters) - Australian Marc Leishman fired a career-low 61 for a three-shot lead after the first round of the AT&T Byron Nelson at its new home in Dallas on Thursday while local favourite Jordan Spieth failed to make a move.\nWorld number 16 Leishman, buoyed by a pair of eagles at the links-style Trinity Forest Golf Club, went bogey-free through a 10-under round to sit three shots clear of Americans J.J. Spaun and Jimmy Walker.\nLeishman took kindly to the tournament’s new venue after enjoying six top-15 finishes in nine starts at its previous home at the TPC Four Seasons Las Colinas.\n“I would’ve been this place’s harshest critic just because I love that other place at Las Colinas,” Leishman said. “But I got here and looked out past the clubhouse and thought, ‘This is going to be really good.’\n“I enjoyed it today.”\nLeishman could not have asked for a better start to his round as his approach from 237 yards at the par-five first hole stopped three feet from the cup, allowing him a tap-in eagle that set the stage for a memorable day.\nThe three-times PGA Tour winner, whose previous career-low was 62, then made birdies at the sixth and seventh holes before a scorching trip around the back nine that included four birdies and an eagle at the par-five 14th.\nSpaun, who started on the 10th, made six birdies over a stunning seven-hole stretch of his back nine to sit with Walker one clear of a pack of eight that included Mexico’s Abraham Ancer and Americans Sam Saunders and Jonathan Byrd.\nWorld number three Spieth (69), the highest-ranked player in the field, did well to erase a bogey at the par-four fifth with birdies at seven and eight but only had one more birdie the rest of the way and was in a share of 57th place.\nThe Dallas native, seeking his first win this year, would love it to be at his home-town this week.\n“It was about as easy tee to green as I’ve ever seen this place,” Spieth said. “You know, the ball was running a lot, you didn’t have to hit a whole lot of club off the tees and without the wind. That’s normally the defense of the golf course.\n“So, not surprised to see a low round. 10-under is an incredible round anyway for Marc. Not surprised to see low scores. Wish I got more out of it, honestly.”\nFormer U.S. Masters champion Adam Scott, seeking his first PGA Tour win since 2016, mixed six birdies with two bogeys to reach four-under and a share of 23rd.\nJapanese world number nine Hideki Matsuyama and Spanish world number 14 Sergio Garcia carded matching one-over 72s to sit in a distant share of 120th place.\nDefending champion Billy Horschel, who started on the back nine, had an eagle at the par-five 14th en route to a three-under 68 that left him seven shots back.
