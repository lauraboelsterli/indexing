Our continued ability to set new records speaks to the quality of our teams and the breadth and enduring nature of our portfolio of franchises against the backdrop of a large and growing interactive market,” said Bobby Kotick, Chief Executive Officer of Activision Blizzard. “As we look ahead, our innovative core gaming pipeline, as well as initiatives like mobile, esports, and advertising, will continue to drive growth for our business.”\nFinancial Metrics:\nFirst Quarter Prior (in millions, except EPS) 2018 Outlook* 2017 GAAP Net Revenues $ 1,965 $ 1,820 $ 1,726 Impact of GAAP deferrals B $ (581 ) $ (540 ) $ (530 ) GAAP EPS $ 0.65 $ 0.47 $ 0.56 Non-GAAP EPS $ 0.78 $ 0.65 $ 0.72 Impact of GAAP deferrals B $ (0.40 ) $ (0.34 ) $ (0.41 ) * Prior outlook was provided by the company on February 8, 2018 in its earnings release.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Activision Blizzard’s net revenues presented in accordance with GAAP were a Q1 record $1.97 billion, as compared with $1.73 billion for the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net revenues from digital channels were an all-time quarterly record $1.46 billion. GAAP operating margin was 30%. GAAP earnings per share were an all-time quarterly record $0.65, as compared with $0.56 for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, Activision Blizzard’s operating margin was 39% and earnings per diluted share were an all-time quarterly record $0.78, as compared with $0.72 for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, operating cash flow was a Q1 record $529 million, up 29% year-over-year.\nPlease refer to the tables at the back of this press release for a reconciliation of the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP results.\nOperating Metric:\nNet bookings A is an operating metric that is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others, and is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Activision Blizzard’s net bookings A were a Q1 record $1.38 billion, as compared with $1.20 billion for the first quarter of 2017. Net bookings A from digital channels were a Q1 record $1.20 billion, as compared with $1.07 billion for the first quarter of 2017.\nSelected Business Highlights:\nActivision Blizzard’s record first-quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver strong results, even in quarters without large content releases, illustrating the enduring nature of our franchises and our shift to a games-as-a-service model.\nAudience Reach\nActivision Blizzard had 374 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs) C in the quarter. King had 285 million MAUs C . King’s engagement remained strong with daily time spent per user at record levels. Activision had 51 million MAUs C . Call of Duty® grew its audience year-over-year with players engaging across the franchise including with Call of Duty: WWII . Blizzard had 38 million MAUs C . World of Warcraft® over-performed versus the prior expansion at this point in time, with higher engagement sequentially and strong community participation with in-game purchases. Preorders for the upcoming expansion, Battle for Azeroth™ , are ahead of plan. Hearthstone® continues to reach and engage its large global audience through multiple efforts including a new promotional bundle, expansion, and player-versus-environment mode, Monster Hunts, which has had strong engagement. Overwatch® continues to add new players, and engagement remains strong, with the most recent seasonal event, Retribution, having a higher participation rate than any prior event.\nDeep Engagement\nThe Overwatch League™ launched its inaugural regular season in January and continues to have strong viewership globally, reaching millions each week, with the playoffs still to come this summer. This has led to increased engagement for the franchise overall, with combined hours spent playing and watching Overwatch increasing sequentially. The Overwatch League and its partners also introduced new engagement programs, which deliver enhanced viewing experiences. The Call of Duty World League completed stage one in mid-April and continues to have strong viewership, with cumulative hours watched doubling year-over-year.\nPlayer Investment\nActivision Blizzard delivered a first-quarter record of approximately $1 billion of in-game net bookings A . King’s mobile business had the highest quarterly net bookings A in its history. Total net bookings A were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 13% year-over-year and reached their highest level since Q1 2015, just after Candy Crush Soda Saga TM was released. This quarter, King had two of the top-10 highest-grossing titles in the U.S. mobile app stores for the eighteenth quarter in a row, with Candy Crush Saga ™ and Candy Crush Soda Saga at #1 and #2 for the second quarter in a row, respectively. 1 King continues to make progress in ramping its advertising business, with industry-leading viewability, completion, and ad-recall rates 2 . King continues to attract new advertisers and has repeat advertisers across multiple industries. Activision’s Call of Duty grew in-game net bookings A year-over-year, with WWII ’s first quarter second only to that of Black Ops III .\nCompany Outlook:\nBased on the strength of our Q1 beat and confidence in our franchises and pipeline, we’re modestly raising our full year outlook. As we previously shared, we expect revenues and operating income for 2018 to be more influenced by the last six months of our operating results than 2017.\nGAAP Outlook\nNon-GAAP Outlook Impact of GAAP deferrals B (in millions, except EPS) CY 2018\nNet Revenues $ 7,355 $ 7,355 $ 120 EPS $ 1.79 $ 2.46 $ 0.05 Fully Diluted Shares 775 775 Q2 2018\nNet Revenues $ 1,555 $ 1,555 $ (205 ) EPS $ 0.26 $ 0.46 $ (0.15 ) Fully Diluted Shares 771 771 Net bookings A (operating metric) is expected to be $7.48 billion for 2018 and $1.35 billion for the second quarter of 2018.\nCurrency Assumptions for 2018 Outlook:\n$1.21 USD/Euro for current outlook (vs. average of $1.12 for 2017 and $1.11 for 2016); and $1.39 USD/British Pound Sterling for current outlook (vs. average of $1.30 for 2017 and $1.36 for 2016). Note: Our financial guidance includes the forecasted impact of our FX hedging program.\nCapital Allocation:\nThe Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share to be paid on May 9, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018, which represents a 13% increase from 2017. Additionally, the Board of Directors authorized a debt paydown of as much as $1.8 billion during 2018.\nConference Call:\nToday at 4:30 p.m. EDT, Activision Blizzard’s management will host a conference call and Webcast to discuss the company’s results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and management’s outlook for the remainder of the calendar year. The company welcomes all members of the financial and media communities and other interested parties to visit the “Investor Relations” area of www.activisionblizzard.com to listen to the conference call via live Webcast or to listen to the call live by dialing into 866-548-4713 in the U.S. with passcode 2838651.\nAbout Activision Blizzard:\nActivision Blizzard, Inc., a member of the Fortune 500 and S&P 500, is the world's most successful standalone interactive entertainment company. We delight hundreds of millions of monthly active users around the world through franchises including Activision's Call of Duty®, Destiny, and Skylanders®, Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft®, Overwatch®, Hearthstone®, Diablo®, StarCraft®, and Heroes of the Storm®, and King's Candy Crush™, Bubble Witch™, and Farm Heroes™. The company is one of the Fortune \"100 Best Companies To Work For®.\" Headquartered in Santa Monica, California, Activision Blizzard has operations throughout the world, and its games are played in 196 countries. More information about Activision Blizzard and its products can be found on the company's website, www.activisionblizzard.com .\n1 U.S. ranking for Apple App Store and Google Play Store combined, per App Annie Intelligence for first quarter of 2018.\n2 Based on MOAT and Millward Brown.\nA Net bookings is an operating metric that is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others, and is equal to net revenues excluding the impact from deferrals.\nB Net effect of accounting treatment from revenue deferrals on certain of our online-enabled products. Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. The related cost of revenues is deferred and recognized as an expense as the related revenues are recognized. Impact from changes in deferrals refers to the net effect from revenue deferrals accounting treatment for the purposes of revenues, along with, for the purposes of EPS, the related cost of revenues deferrals treatment and the related tax impacts. Internally, management excludes the impact of this change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues when evaluating the company’s operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of its management team. Management believes this is appropriate because doing so enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers. In addition, management believes excluding the change in deferred revenues and the related cost of revenues provides a much more timely indication of trends in our operating results.\nC Monthly Active User (“MAU”) Definition: We monitor MAUs as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: As a supplement to our financial measures presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), Activision Blizzard presents certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as more important than, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nActivision Blizzard provides net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, and operating margin data and guidance both including (in accordance with GAAP) and excluding (non-GAAP) certain items. When relevant, the company also provides constant FX information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, Activision Blizzard provides EBITDA (defined as GAAP net income (loss) before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and adjusted EBITDA (defined as non-GAAP operating margin (see non-GAAP financial measure below) before depreciation). The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items, as applicable in any given reporting period and our outlook:\nexpenses related to stock-based compensation; the amortization of intangibles from purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses related to the King acquisition, inclusive of related debt financings, and refinancing of long-term debt, including penalties and the write off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs; restructuring charges; other non-cash charges from reclassification of certain cumulative translation adjustments into earnings as required by GAAP; the income tax adjustments associated with any of the above items (tax impact on non-GAAP pre-tax income is calculated under the same accounting principles applied to the GAAP pre-tax income under ASC 740, which employs an annual effective tax rate method to the results); and significant discrete tax-related items, including amounts related to changes in tax laws (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017), amounts related to the potential or final resolution of tax positions, and other unusual or unique tax-related items and activities.\nIn the future, Activision Blizzard may also consider whether other items should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures used by the company. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information to measure Activision Blizzard’s financial and operating performance. In particular, the measures facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and help investors to better understand the operating results of Activision Blizzard by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company’s core business, operating results, or future outlook. Additionally, we consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, along with others, in assessing the company’s operating results, and measuring compliance with the requirements of the company’s debt financing agreements, as well as in planning and forecasting.\nActivision Blizzard’s non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, and the terms non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP or adjusted EBITDA do not have a standardized meaning. Therefore, other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors a comparable view of Activision Blizzard’s performance in relation to other companies.\nManagement compensates for the limitations resulting from the exclusion of these items by considering the impact of the items separately and by considering Activision Blizzard’s GAAP, as well as non-GAAP, results and outlook, and by presenting the most comparable GAAP measures directly ahead of non-GAAP measures, and by providing a reconciliation that indicates and describes the adjustments made.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements: The statements contained herein that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about: (1) projections of revenues, expenses, income or loss, earnings or loss per share, cash flow or other financial items; (2) statements of our plans and objectives, including those related to releases of products and services; (3) statements of future financial or operating performance, including the impact of tax items thereon; and (4) statements of assumptions underlying such statements. The company generally uses words such as “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “to be,” “plan,” “plans,” “believes,” “may,” “might,” “expects,” “intends,” “intends as,” “anticipates,” “estimate,” “future,” “positioned,” “potential,” “project,” “remain,” “scheduled,” “set to,” “subject to,” “upcoming,” and other similar expressions to help identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to business and economic risks, reflect management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections about our business, and are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.\nThe company cautions that a number of important factors could cause Activision Blizzard's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: sales levels of Activision Blizzard’s titles, products, and services; concentration of revenue among a small number of titles; Activision Blizzard’s ability to predict consumer preferences, including interest in specific genres and modes, and preferences among platforms; the continued growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including the diversion of management time and attention to issues relating to the operations of our acquired or newly started businesses and the potential impact of our expansion into new businesses on our existing businesses; the amount of our debt and the limitations imposed by the covenants in the agreements governing our debt; counterparty risks relating to customers, licensees, licensors, and manufacturers; maintenance of relationships with key personnel, customers, financing providers, licensees, licensors, manufacturers, vendors, and third-party developers, including the ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel and developers that can create high-quality titles, products, and services; changing business models within the video game industry, including digital delivery of content and the increased prevalence of free-to-play games; product delays or defects; competition, including from other forms of entertainment; rapid changes in technology and industry standards; possible declines in software pricing; product returns and price protection; the identification of suitable future acquisition opportunities and potential challenges associated with geographic expansion; the seasonal and cyclical nature of the interactive entertainment market; the outcome of current or future tax disputes; litigation risks and associated costs; protection of proprietary rights; potential data breaches and other cybersecurity risks; shifts in consumer spending trends; capital market risks; the impact of applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including changes in those laws, rules, and regulations; domestic and international economic, financial, and political conditions and policies; tax rates and foreign exchange rates; the impact of the current macroeconomic environment; and the other factors identified in “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company at this time and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although these forward-looking statements are believed to be true when made, they may ultimately prove to be incorrect. These statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.\nACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC.

Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring costs; and other non-cash charges. See the following page for the reconciliation tables of segment revenues and operating income to consolidated net revenues and consolidated operating income.\nOur operating segments are also consistent with our internal organization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information.
