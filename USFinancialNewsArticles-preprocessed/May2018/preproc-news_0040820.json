    "text": "EditorsNote: fixes “EDT” in second graf\nThe Tuesday night game between the New York Yankees and the Washington Nationals was suspended due to rain at Nationals Park.\nThe game was tied at 3-3 going into the bottom of the sixth and will resume Wednesday afternoon at 5:05 p.m. EDT. The teams will then play a regularly scheduled game beginning at 7:05 p.m.\nThe suspension was announced after a 70-minute delay.\nBefore the game was suspended, Washington’s Anthony Rendon hit a solo homer in the first inning off Masahiro Tanaka. Andrew Stevenson hit an RBI single in the second and scored on a double by Pedro Severino.\nNew York’s Tyler Austin snapped a 0-for-23 slump with a two-run homer in the fourth off Gio Gonzalez and lifted a sacrifice fly in the fifth after the Yankees loaded the bases.\nTanaka allowed three runs and four hits in five innings while throwing 72 pitches. Gonzalez gave up three runs (two earned) and six hits in five innings.\nThe game was halted due to lightning in the area along with rain after Washington’s Wander Suero struck out Aaron Judge with rookie Gleyber Torres on second to end the top of the sixth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
