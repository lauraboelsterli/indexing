Total strategic revenue 1 of $21.8 million for the 2018 quarter, up 5.6% compared to strategic revenue of $20.6 million for the 2017 quarter. Strategic revenue was partially offset by a decline of 1.1% in legacy voice revenue (from $8.5 million for the 2017 quarter to $8.3 million for the 2018 quarter). Strategic revenue comprised 72% of NOR for the 2018 quarter, compared to 71% of NOR for the 2017 quarter. Net income of $1.6 million for the 2018 quarter compared to $2.2 million for the 2017 quarter. 2018 net income reflects a $0.2 million negative impact resulting from the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606. Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.69 for the 2018 quarter compared to EPS of $0.99 for the 2017 quarter.\nChief Executive Officer Royster Tucker III commented, “Our first-quarter results demonstrate continued progress in NorthState’s ongoing transformation into a combined fiber network, cloud enablement and IT services company. Revenues from our fiber initiative and our business focused IT services grew year-over-year. Increases in content costs are reflected in our Costs of Goods Sold. Investments in our expanded sales organization and customer engagement teams, supporting the sales ramp up around our cloud initiatives are reflected in our Sales, General and Administrative costs in this opening quarter.”\n“During the first three months of 2018, the number of fiber-connected households and businesses increased by a total of 16%, fueling revenue growth in broadband and entertainment. We expanded our fiber residential footprint by 12% as we continued to pass residential homes through our expansion in the Piedmont Triad Region of North Carolina.”\n“Our IT services business recently introduced several new solutions designed to meet the growing IT security and technology demands of businesses. The new solutions include Meraki as a Service (MaaS), a cloud-managed solution that allows organizations to streamline wireless networks, switching and security tasks via the web.
