    "text": "RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif., Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMPH) announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted approval of the company’s abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) for Calcium Chloride injection 10% in the 10 mL Luer-Jet ® Prefilled Syringe System. For the past 40 years, the company has sold and marketed the product under the “grandfather” exception (now termed “unapproved”) to the FDA’s “Prescription Drug Wrap-Up” program. Net revenues for the company’s Calcium Chloride injection for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $13.5 million.\nAmphastar's CEO, Dr. Jack Zhang, stated: \"We are pleased about the FDA’s approval of our Calcium Chloride injection which continues to demonstrate our commitment to work with the Agency to alleviate drug shortages.\"\nThe company continues to market four unapproved products, and has two ANDAs and one NDA pending approval for these products. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company recorded net revenues of $22.0 million from unapproved products.\nPipeline Information\nThe Company currently has three ANDAs filed with the FDA, which are targeting products with a market size of over $0.5 billion of three biosimilar products in development with a market size of $15.0 billion; 12 generic products in development targeting products with a market size of over $12.0 billion. This market information is based on IQVIA data for the 12 months ended March 31, 2018. The Company’s proprietary pipeline includes NDAs for Primatene ® Mist and intranasal naloxone.

These statements are not historical facts but rather are based on Amphastar’s current expectations, estimates, and projections regarding Amphastar’s business, operations, and other similar or related factors.
