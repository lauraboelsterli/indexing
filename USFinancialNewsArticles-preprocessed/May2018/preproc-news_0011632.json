(NASDAQ:TCRD) (“THL Credit” or the “Company”), a direct lender to lower middle market companies, today announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. Additionally, THL Credit announced that its Board of Directors has declared a second fiscal quarter 2018 dividend of $0.27 per share payable on June 29, 2018, to stockholders of record as of June 15, 2018.\n“We are focused on our stated strategy to invest in first lien loans of sponsor-backed companies and increase diversity across the portfolio, to monetize non-income producing equity securities, and to grow the Logan joint venture,” said Chris Flynn, CEO of THL Credit. “We have continued to support our dividend over the course of this on-going transition and benefit from the strong support of our Advisor.”\nHighlights\n($ in millions, except per share amounts) Portfolio results As of March 31 ,\n2018 Total assets $624.4 Investment portfolio, at fair value $599.9 Net assets $341.1 Net asset value per share $10.44 Weighted average yield on investments 11.0% Quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2018 Quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nPortfolio activity Total portfolio investments made, at par $11.8 $39.3 Total portfolio investments made, at cost $11.8 $38.7 Number of new portfolio investments - Number of portfolio investments at end of period 45 47 Operating results Total investment income $16.7 $19.8 Net investment income $8.8 $9.7 Net increase in net assets from operations $6.3 $5.3 Net investment income per share $0.27 $0.29 Dividends declared per share $0.27 $0.27 Portfolio and Investment Activity\nIn the first quarter, THL Credit closed on $11.8 million in follow-on, delayed draw and revolver investments.\nNotable investments for the first quarter included:\n$6.4 million equity contribution to THL Credit Logan JV, LLC (“Logan JV”); and $3.6 million DIP delayed draw term loan in Charming Charlie, LLC.\nNotable realizations for the quarter included:\nRepayment of a first lien senior secured term loan and revolver in Togetherwork Holdings, LLC, which resulted in proceeds of $5.7 million, including a prepayment premium of $0.1 million; and Sale of a first lien senior secured term loan, subordinated term loan, preferred equity and common equity in Aerogroup International, Inc.; with proceeds received of $2.5 million and $8.0 million recorded as an escrow receivable.\nThese transactions, coupled with changes in net unrealized depreciation on the portfolio during the quarter, bring the total fair value of THL Credit’s investment portfolio to $599.9 million across 45 portfolio investments at the end of the first quarter. As of March 31, 2018, THL Credit’s investment portfolio at fair value was allocated 65 percent in first lien senior secured debt, which includes unitranche investments, 12 percent in the Logan JV, 6 percent in second lien debt, 3 percent in subordinated debt, 3 percent in other income-producing securities and 11 percent in equity securities and warrants. The weighted average yield on investments made in 2018 was 11.3 percent. As of March 31, 2018, the weighted average yield of the debt and income-producing securities, including the Logan JV and reflecting the impact of investments on non-accrual, in the investment portfolio at their current cost basis was 11.0 percent. As of March 31, 2018, THL Credit had loans on non-accrual status with an aggregate amortized cost of $41.4 million and fair value of $5.7 million, or 6.7 percent and 1.0 percent of the portfolio’s amortized cost and fair value, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, 93 percent of its debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors, such as London Interbank offer rate, or LIBOR, or Canadian Dollar offer rate, or CDOR, and 7 percent of its debt investments bore interest at fixed rates.\nThis compares to the portfolio as of Dec. 31, 2017, which had a fair value of $608.7 million across 47 portfolio investments allocated 67 percent in first lien senior secured debt, which includes unitranche investments, 11 percent in the Logan JV, 5 percent in second lien debt, 3 percent in subordinated debt, 2 percent in other income-producing securities and 12 percent in equity securities and warrants. The weighted average yield of the debt and other income-producing securities in the investment portfolio, including the Logan JV, at their cost basis was 10.7 percent. As of Dec. 31, 2017, THL Credit had loans on non-accrual status with an aggregate amortized cost of $56.3 million and fair value of $21.0 million, or 8.8 percent and 3.4 percent of the portfolio’s amortized cost and fair value, respectively. As of Dec. 31, 2017, 93 percent of its debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors, such as LIBOR, and 7 percent of its debt investments bore interest at fixed rates.\nResults of Operations\nInvestment income\nTotal investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $16.7 million and $19.8 million, respectively, and consisted of $12.6 million and $14.5 million of interest income on debt securities (which included PIK interest of $0.2 million and $0.8 million and prepayment premiums of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively), $2.6 million and $3.1 million of dividend income, $1.0 million and $1.3 million of interest income on other income-producing securities, and $0.5 million and $0.9 million of other income, including fees from THL Credit’s managed vehicles, respectively.\nThe decrease in investment income compared to the prior period was primarily due to a contraction in the overall investment portfolio since March 31, 2017, which led to lower interest income, and lower dividend income from certain equity investments.\nExpenses\nExpenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $7.9 million and $10.1 million, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, base management fees were $2.3 million and $2.6 million, incentive fees were $0.0 million and $1.3 million, administrator and other expenses were $1.6 million and $1.7 million and fees and expenses related to THL Credit’s borrowings were $3.9 million and $4.3 million, respectively. In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, THL Credit recorded an income tax provision related to its consolidated blocker corporations, excise and other taxes of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nThe decrease in operating expenses was due to lower incentive fees as a result of portfolio performance, lower borrowing expenses due to a decrease in average borrowings outstanding and lower base management fees as a result of portfolio contraction.\nNet investment income\nNet investment income totaled $8.8 million and $9.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, or $0.27 and $0.29 per share based upon 32,673,590 and 32,925,369 weighted average common shares outstanding, respectively.\nNet investment income was lower due to a decrease in interest income from debt and income-producing securities as a result of contraction of the overall investment portfolio.\nNet realized gains and losses on investments, net of income tax provision\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, THL Credit recognized a net realized loss on portfolio investments of $13.1 million, primarily related to a realized loss from the exit of its investments in Aerogroup International Inc. and losses from the initial restructuring of its Charming Charlie LLC investment as part of bankruptcy proceedings. These losses were offset by a reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation totaling $10.6 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, THL Credit recognized a realized loss of $1.5 million on the sale of its two remaining CLO investments in Flagship VII, Ltd. and Flagship VIII, Ltd., which was offset by a reversal of prior period unrealized depreciation totaling the same amount. THL Credit also recognized a $0.6 million gain from an investment in Gryphon Partners 3.5, L.P.\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, THL Credit’s investment portfolio had a net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of $10.0 million and ($3.7) million, respectively.\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation on investments was driven primarily by the reversal of prior period net unrealized depreciation related to certain restructured and exited investments and the financial performance of certain portfolio companies.\nBenefit for taxes on unrealized gain on investments\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, THL Credit recognized an income tax (provision) benefit for taxes on unrealized gains of ($0.0)million and $0.2 million related to consolidated subsidiaries, respectively.\nThe change in provision for tax on unrealized gains on investments relates primarily to changes to the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the investments held in these taxable consolidated subsidiaries, other temporary differences and change in prior year estimates received from certain portfolio companies.\nChange in net assets resulting from operations\nChange in net assets resulting from operations totaled $6.3 million and $5.3 million, or $0.19 and $0.16 per share based upon 32,673,590 and 32,925,369 weighted average common shares outstanding, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe increase in net assets resulting from operations for the respective periods is due primarily to net realized and unrealized gains and losses in the portfolio.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of March 31, 2018, THL Credit had cash of $3.3 million. THL Credit’s liquidity and capital resources are derived from its credit facility, equity and debt raises and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. THL Credit’s primary use of funds includes making investments in portfolio companies, payment of dividends to stockholders and funding operating expenses. THL Credit used, and expects to continue to use, these capital resources, together with proceeds from the turnover within the portfolio and from future public and private offerings of securities to finance its investment objectives.\nAs of March 31, 2018, THL Credit had $278.8 million in outstanding borrowings, which was comprised of $168.8 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility and $110.0 million of notes payable outstanding. As of March 31, 2018, borrowings outstanding had a weighted average interest rate of 5.29 percent. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, THL Credit borrowed $13.5 million and repaid $11.4 million under the revolving credit facility.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, THL Credit operating activities provided cash of $6.4 million primarily in connection with the purchase and sales of investments. Its financing activities provided $2.1 million of net borrowings on its credit facility and used $8.8 million for distributions to stockholders.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2017, THL Credit’s operating activities used cash of $19.8 million primarily from the purchase of investments, its financing activities provided $24.9 million in net borrowings on its credit facility and used $8.9 million for distributions to stockholders.\nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nTHL Credit has provided its stockholders with notice of its ability to repurchase shares of its common stock in accordance with 1940 Act requirements. On March 7, 2017, THL Credit’s Board of Directors authorized a $20.0 million stock repurchase program, which was extended on March 2, 2018. Unless extended by THL Credit’s Board of Directors, the stock repurchase program will expire on March 2, 2019. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the repurchase program and no assurances can be given that any particular amount will be purchased. THL Credit will immediately retire all such shares of common stock that it purchases.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no stock repurchases.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nFrom April 1, 2018 through May 2, 2018, THL Credit made follow-on investments of $8.5 million at a combined weighted average yield based upon cost at the time of the investment of 7.7%.\nOn April 24, 2018, Charming Charlie LLC emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings whereby THL Credit converted its DIP facilities, Pre-petition Term Loan and DIP Roll-up Term Loan into two new exit first lien term loans and a non-controlling common equity interest (THL Credit and other funds managed by the Advisor collectively have a controlling equity interest in Charming Charlie, LLC). On the same date, THL Credit funded $0.9 million of the remaining unfunded commitments under its DIP facilities and used an additional $2.2 million to purchase another lender’s existing DIP revolving credit facility, all of which converted to the exit first lien term loans. As a result of these transactions, THL Credit’s debt investment in Charming Charlie LLC is comprised of $24.6 million in the exit first lien term loans. In addition, THL Credit provided $8.9 million of commitments under a vendor financing facility.\nOn May 1, 2018, THL Credit received proceeds of $26.6 million from the repayment of its subordinated debt and realization of its preferred equity interest in A10 Capital, LLC, which included prepayment premiums of $0.3 million.\nOn May 1, 2018, THL Credit’s board of directors declared a dividend of $0.27 per share payable on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2018.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nOn March 14, 2018, THL Credit’s external investment advisor, THL Credit Advisors, LLC, or the Advisor, informed the Company that it had adopted a stock trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to purchase up to $10.0 million of the Company’s common stock.\nOur Advisor has informed us that, from March 14, 2018 to May 1, 2018, the Advisor had purchased 0.6 million shares at an average purchase price of approximately $7.88 per share, inclusive of commissions.
