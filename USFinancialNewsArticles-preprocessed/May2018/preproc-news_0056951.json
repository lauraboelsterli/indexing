    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italyâ€™s Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte is expected to present a list of his cabinet ministers when he meets the president on Sunday at 7 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET), a step that could open the way for the formation of a coalition government.\nFILE PHOTO: Italy's newly appointed Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte speaks at the media at the end of a round of consultations with political parties at the Lower House in Rome, Italy, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile/File Photo President Sergio Mattarella has so far refused to accept 81-year-old economist Paolo Savona for the pivotal post of economy minister, stymieing efforts to end a political deadlock that has dragged on since an inconclusive election in March.\nReporting by Steve Scherer\n ",
