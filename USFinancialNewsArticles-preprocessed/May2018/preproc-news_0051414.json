    "text": "MILAN, May 22 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is buying regular amounts of Italian government bonds under its quantitative easing programme, three traders at as many primary dealers said, dismissing rumours of smaller-than-usual purchases.\nThe sharp increase in Italian government bond yields witnessed in recent days had fuelled market speculation that the ECB may have curbed its purchases of Italian debt in a warning to the countryâ€™s incoming government.\nThe anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League have agreed on a government programme and put forward their choice of prime minister in an effort to overcome political deadlock following an inconclusive March 4 election.\nThe coalition programme, which pledges to increase spending while cutting taxes and rolling back on a crucial pension reform, has spooked financial markets prompting investors to dump Italian government bonds.\nThe premium Italy pays over Germany on a 10-year bond maturity rose by nearly 60 basis points over the past four sessions, hitting a high since June 2017 on Monday at 190 basis points.\nThe ECB declined to comment on the rumours.
