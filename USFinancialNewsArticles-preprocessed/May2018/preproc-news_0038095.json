    "text": "May 15 (Reuters) - Global commodities trader Bunge Ltd said on Tuesday it has filed for a potential initial public offering of the company's sugar milling business in Brazil, Bunge Açúcar & Bionergia, with the Brazilian Securities Commission.\nBunge has tried to sell its eight Brazilian sugar and ethanol mills for four years, but a separate sale process has failed to attract firm interest from strategic or financial investors.\nOn May 8, people familiar with the matter told Reuters that the company had hired banks to prepare for a listing.
