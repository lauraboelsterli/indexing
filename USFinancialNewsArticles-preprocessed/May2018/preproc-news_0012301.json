    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 6:28 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Rolls-Royce CEO says will soon provide update on commercial marine unit review Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nDERBY, England (Reuters) - The chief executive of Britain’s Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) said he hoped to “soon” be able to provide an update on the outcome of a strategic review of the company’s commercial marine business. FILE PHOTO: Warren East, CEO of Rolls-Royce, poses for a portrait in front of a Pegasus airplane engine at the company's aerospace engineering and development site in Bristol, Britain, December 17, 2015. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nThe company said in January that it could sell the loss-making commercial marine unit, a part of its business which designs and makes equipment used in oil and gas extraction. Related Coverage Rolls-Royce interested in providing new engine for U.S. B-52s\nAsked about Rolls-Royce’s problematic Trent 1000 engines which power the Boeing ( BA.N ) Dreamliner 787, CEO Warren East told shareholders at an annual meeting that he expected the current grounded aircraft situation to be over much sooner than 2022.\nSome engines are requiring extra inspections due to parts not lasting as long as expected meaning that airlines are having to ground approximately 30 Trent 1000-powered aircrafts at any one time.\n“Based on where we are at the moment, we would expect to remove the aircraft on the ground situation much, much faster than 2022,” East said.\nRolls has said that the problems will be fully resolved by 2022.
