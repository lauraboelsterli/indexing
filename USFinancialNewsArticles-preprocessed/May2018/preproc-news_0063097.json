    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian households’ expectations for inflation rose in May back to levels seen in March, as the rouble turned more volatile and fuel prices rose, the central bank said on Wednesday.\nThe rouble declined in April following a new round of U.S. sanctions against Russian interests.\nThe central bank said in a regular monthly report that room for a decline in inflationary expectations would be limited by higher fuel prices in the coming months.\nReporting by Andrey Ostroukh; editing by John Stonestreet\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
