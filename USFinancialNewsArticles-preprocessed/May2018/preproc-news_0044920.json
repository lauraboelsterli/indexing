( reut.rs/2rUKVEW )\nIpreo’s valuation has gained about four times since 2011 when KKR took over Ipreo in a $425 million deal.\nThe company was created in 2006 when private equity firm Veronis Suhler Stevenson LLC merged i-Deal LLC and Hemscott Group Ltd, with backing from Citigroup Inc and Merrill Lynch.\nIpreo supports banks, public and private companies raise capital. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals.\nThomson Reuters Corp, the parent company of Reuters News, competes with Ipreo and IHS Markit in some segments of the financial data business.\nBarclays and HSBC are the financial advisers for IHS Markit, which is based in London.
