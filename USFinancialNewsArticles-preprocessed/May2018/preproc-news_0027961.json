    "text": "Tool revenue increased 55% over prior-year period and 33% sequentially Net income of $69 thousand improved by $0.5 million over prior year Revenue guidance for 2018 represents 28% growth at mid-point of range\nVERNAL, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (NYSE American: SDPI) (“SDP” or the “Company”), a designer and manufacturer of drilling tool technologies, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nTroy Meier, Chairman and CEO, noted, \"Continued growth in revenue was driven by the expansion of our Drill-N-Ream ® (“DnR”) well bore conditioning tool operating fleet. As more tools are deployed, both tool repair revenue and royalty income increases. The deployed DnRs are also demonstrating greater durability, extending the life of the tools. Importantly, the DnR has persistently captured greater market share as operators recognize the economic value proposition the tools offer.\nFor 2018, we have several initiatives under way to support further growth including:\nNew bit refurbishment agreement that expands our geographic territory Renegotiating distributor agreement for the DnR Testing of the DnR in the Middle East Making progress toward commercialization of our the patented Strider TM oscillation system technology\nWe believe we are on track to achieve another year of strong growth and are continuing to build a reputation in the industry as an innovator of drilling tool technologies.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary ($ in thousands, except per share amounts)\nQ1\n2018\nQ1\n2017\n$Y/Y\nChange\n% Y/Y\nChange\nQ4\n2017\n$ Seq.\nChange\n% Seq.\nChange\nTool sales/rental $ 1,992 $ 1,635 $ 357 21.8 % $ 1,434 $ 558 38.9 % Other related tool revenue\n1,533 635 898 141.4 % 1,224 309 25.2 % Tool Revenue 3,525 2,270 1,255 55.3 % 2,658 867 32.6 % Contract Services 1,075 1,100 (25 ) (2.2 )% 1,072 3 0.3 % Total Revenue $ 4,600 $ 3,370 $ 1,230 36.5 % $ 3,730 $ 870 23.3 % Operating income (loss) 168 (247 ) 415 NM (670 ) 837 NM As a % of sales\n3.6 % NM NM Net income (loss) $ 69 $ (386 ) $ 455 NM $ (786 ) $ 854 NM Diluted earnings (loss) per\nshare\n$ - $ (0.02 ) $ 0.02 NM $ (0.03 ) $ 0.03 NM Compared with the prior-year period, revenue increased 36.5% to $4.6 million. Revenue growth was primarily the result of a $1.3 million, or 55%, increase in tool revenue to $3.5 million.\nHigher tool revenue year-over-year was primarily the result of the increased numbers of tools deployed which drove a $0.9 million increase in other related tool revenue, which is comprised of royalty fees and tool maintenance and repair. Tool sales in the quarter also improved as the result of market share growth. Both market share gains and an improved oil & gas industry drove the increase in tool revenue. Contract services revenue was effectively unchanged year-over-year.\nWhen compared with the trailing fourth quarter of 2017, total revenue was up 23.3% on higher tool revenue.\nNet income of $69 thousand improved by $0.5 million over the first quarter of 2017 as a result of growth and operating leverage from higher volume.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational Review\n($ in thousands)\nQ1\n2018\nQ1\n2017\n$ Y/Y\nChange\n% Y/Y\nChange\nQ4\n2017\n$ Seq.\nChange\n% Seq.\nChange\nCost of revenue $ 1,799 $ 1,180 $ 619 52.5 % $ 1,571 228 14.5 % As a percent of sales 39.1 % 35.0 % 42.1 % Selling, general &\nadministrative\n$ 1,698 $ 1,498 $ 200 13.3 % $ 1,897 (199 ) (10.5 )% As a percent of sales 36.9 % 44.5 % 50.9 % Depreciation &\namortization\n$ 936 $ 938 $ (2 ) (0.2 )% $ 931 5 0.5 % Total operating\nexpenses\n$ 4,433 $ 3,616 $ 817 22.6 % $ 4,400 33 0.7 % Higher cost of revenue as a percent of sales was due to a change in product mix.\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) over the prior-year period reflects investments in the Middle East expansion and higher research and development costs related to the commercialization of the Strider TM technology. SG&A decreased when compared with the trailing fourth quarter which included higher incentive compensation related to year end.\nThe improvement in first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation expense and unusual items, was the result of higher sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 million, or 27% of revenue in the quarter up\n$0.3 million and $0.5 million over the 2017 first quarter and trailing 2017 fourth quarter, respectively.\nThe Company believes that when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, helps in the understanding of its operating performance. (1) See the attached tables for important disclosures regarding SDP’s use of adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nCash and cash equivalents was $2.2 million at March 31, 2018, down slightly from $2.4 million at the end of 2017. Cash generated from operations in the quarter was $0.5 million, compared with $0.8 million of cash used in operations in the prior-year period.\nTotal debt at the end of the quarter was $12.2 million, down $0.6 million, or 4.8%, compared with $12.8 million at December 31, 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018 the Company had capital expenditures of $95 thousand.\nOutlook:\nThe Company is reiterating its expectations for 2018 as follows:\nRevenue:\n$18 million to $22 million Represents 28% growth at\nmidpoint of range.\nOperating Margin:\n5% to 10% At midpoint of range, operating\nincome reaches $1.5 million, up\n$1.3 million\nInterest Expense:\nApproximately $750 thousand Down from $906 thousand in\n2017 on lower debt balances\nDepreciation and\nAmortization:\nSlightly under $4.0 million Compares with $3.7 million in\n2017\nCapital Expenditures:\nApproximately $1 million Similar to 2017 Webcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast today at 10:00 am MT (12:00 pm ET) to review the financial and operating results for the quarter and discuss its corporate strategy and outlook.

The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures of performance, including net cash provided by operations, operating income and net income. The Company’s method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may vary substantially from the methods used by other companies and investors are cautioned not to rely unduly on it.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005352/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nKei Advisors LLC\nDeborah K.
