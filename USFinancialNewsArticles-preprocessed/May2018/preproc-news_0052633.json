    "text": "MILAN, May 25 (Reuters) - Investors pulled out a record of $380 million from Italian equity funds last week on worries over the creation of a eurosceptic government in Italy, EPFR Global said.\nThat eclipsed the previous outflow record set in mid-2014 when the euro zone’s third largest economy was slipping into its third recession since the start of the financial crisis, EPFR said in an emailed statement.\nWorries over the political situation in Italy also sparked outflows from European equity and bond funds with investors pulling out a combined $4.4 billion out of these fund groups, it added.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
