    "text": "LIVERMORE, Calif., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- McGrath RentCorp (NASDAQ:MGRC) (the “Company”), a diversified business to business rental company, today announced total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $105.1 million, an increase of 11%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The Company reported net income of $14.5 million, or $0.59 per diluted share of 2018, compared to net income of $8.0 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 includes a net income benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”) that was enacted in December 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate from 35% to 21%, which contributed $0.11 to earnings per diluted share in the first quarter 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS:\nIncome from operations increased 39% year-over-year to $22.0 million. Rental revenues increased 9% year-over-year to $74.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 18% year-over-year to $42.8 million. Dividend rate increased 31% year-over-year to $0.34 per share of 2018. On an annualized basis, this dividend represents a 2.3% yield on the April 30, 2018 close price of $58.93 per share.\nJoe Hanna, President and CEO of McGrath RentCorp, made the following comments regarding these results and future expectations:\n“Our first quarter results are a positive start to the year. Overall operating profit increased by 39%, driven by growth in rental gross profit of $5.0 million and sales gross profit of $1.3 million. Demand was broad based across each of our divisions as the economy continued to show positive momentum.\nMobile Modular rental revenues for the quarter increased 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by 9% improvement in average rental rates. Rental revenue growth continued to be healthy across commercial and education markets. Portable Storage rental revenues grew by 15% on strong demand from construction projects. Modular sales revenues increased significantly year-over-year, primarily due to higher used equipment sales.\nTRS-RenTelco rental revenues for the quarter increased 9%, primarily driven by 7% higher average rental equipment and improved utilization. Demand for both communications and general purpose test equipment continued the healthy trends experienced in late 2017.\nAdler Tank Rentals rental revenues for the quarter increased 8% from a year ago. Rental revenue growth occurred across a mix of vertical markets, including upstream oil and natural gas, which increased from 6% to 10% of total rental revenues. Utilization improved as average equipment on rent increased 11%. Due to ongoing competitive price pressure, average rental rates declined slightly.\nWe continue to execute on our performance improvement initiatives. We are driving better performance from our fleet without significant new equipment investments and we are encouraged by our progress.\nNow that our first quarter is completed, we have established a good foundation for the remainder of the year.”\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities can be found at the end of this release.\nDIVISION HIGHLIGHTS:\nAll comparisons presented below are for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to the quarter ended March 31, 2017 unless otherwise indicated.\nMOBILE MODULAR\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s Mobile Modular division reported income from operations of $12.3 million, an increase of $3.7 million, or 42%. Rental revenues increased 10% to $37.0 million, depreciation expense decreased 2% to $5.2 million and other direct costs increased 7% to $10.3 million, which resulted in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of 15% to $21.4 million. Rental related services revenues increased 3% to $11.9 million, with associated gross profit increasing 4% to $2.9 million. Sales revenues increased 55% to $4.6 million. Gross margin on sales increased to 36% from 30% in 2017 due to higher margins on used equipment sales, resulting in a twofold increase in gross profit on sales revenues to $1.7 million. Selling and administrative expenses increased 2% to $14.0 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs.\nTRS-RENTELCO\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s TRS-RenTelco division reported income from operations of $7.2 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 27%. Rental revenues increased 9% to $21.5 million, depreciation expense increased 6% to $8.6 million and other direct costs increased 5% to $3.5 million, which resulted in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of 14% to $9.4 million. Sales revenues increased 18% to $5.2 million. Gross margin on sales decreased to 52% from 57% in 2017 primarily due to lower margins on used equipment sales, resulting in an 8% increase in gross profit on sales revenues to $2.7 million. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1% to $5.6 million.\nADLER TANKS\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s Adler Tanks division reported income from operations of $3.2 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or 40%. Rental revenues increased 8% to $15.7 million, depreciation expense was flat at $3.9 million and other direct costs increased 2% to $2.4 million, which together resulted in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of 13% to $9.3 million. Rental related services revenues decreased 11% to $5.1 million, with gross profit on rental related services decreasing 23% to $1.0 million. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1% to $7.2 million.\nFINANCIAL OUTLOOK:\nBased upon the Company’s year-to-date results and current outlook for the remainder of the year, the Company is raising its financial outlook and expects its 2018 total operating profit to increase 11% to 15% above 2017 results, as compared to our prior expectation of an 8% to 12% increase.\nABOUT MCGRATH RENTCORP:\nFounded in 1979, McGrath RentCorp is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions.

Average utilization is calculated by dividing the average month end costs of rental equipment on rent by the average month end total costs of rental equipment. Average monthly rental rate is calculated by dividing the averages of monthly rental revenues by the cost of rental equipment on rent for the period.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures\nTo supplement the Company’s financial data presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is defined by the Company as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate the Company’s period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\n(dollar amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, Twelve Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income $ 14,466 $ 7,973 $ 160,413 $ 39,658 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 4,552 5,286 (71,202 ) 29,679 Interest 2,992 2,789 11,825 11,440 Depreciation and amortization 19,928 19,404 78,940 79,723 EBITDA 41,938 35,452 179,976 160,500 Impairment of rental assets 39 — 1,678 — Share-based compensation 864 806 3,256 3,041 Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 42,841 $ 36,258 $ 184,910 $ 163,541 Adjusted EBITDA margin 2 41 % 38 % 39 % 38 %\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n(dollar amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, Twelve Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 42,841 $ 36,258 $ 184,910 $ 163,541 Interest paid (2,537 ) (2,420 ) (11,942 ) (11,870 ) Income taxes paid, net of refunds received (1,572 ) (5,565 ) (25,511 ) (20,414 ) Gain on sale of used rental equipment (3,848 ) (2,943 ) (18,638 ) (13,716 ) Foreign currency exchange loss (gain) 32 (226 ) (76 ) 46 Amortization of debt financing cost 13 13 50 52 Change in certain assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable, net 7,780 4,325 (5,540 ) (915 ) Prepaid expenses and other assets (3,303 ) (1,536 ) 1,357 (1,536 ) Accounts payable and other liabilities (7,537 ) (4,464 ) 4,679 10,370 Deferred income (717 ) 2,388 (1,385 ) 2,388 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 31,152 $ 25,830 $ 127,904 $ 127,946 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation.
