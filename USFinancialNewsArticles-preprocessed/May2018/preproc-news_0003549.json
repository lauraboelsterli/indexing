    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cubic Corporation (NYSE: CUB) today announced its financial results for the second fiscal 2018.\n\"We are pleased with our first half financial performance as Cubic's strong momentum continues. With the highest backlog in our history, we expect growth to accelerate going forward,\" said Bradley H. Feldmann, chairman, president and chief executive officer. \"The recently announced divestiture of our defense services operations demonstrates our commitment to high growth, high margin, technology-driven businesses that will generate greater shareholder value.\"\nFinancial Results Summary\nSix Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n(in millions, except per share data)\nSales\n$\n527.0\n$\n492.4\n$\n278.6\n$\n248.0\nOperating income (loss)\n(13.6)\n(11.7)\n(1.7)\n(6.1)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n27.3\n29.3\n15.8\n11.7\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes\n$\n(16.1)\n$\n(20.1)\n$\n(1.9)\n$\n(10.6)\nIncome tax provision (benefit) from continuing operations\n(1.3)\n(62.9)\n1.4\n(52.4)\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations\n(14.8)\n42.9\n(3.3)\n41.9\nEarnings (loss) per share from continuing operations\n(0.54)\n1.58\n(0.12)\n1.54\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes\n$\n4.1\n$\n5.6\n$\n(0.8)\n$\n4.0\nIncome tax provision (benefit) from discontinued operations\n1.1\n50.9\n(2.1)\n45.4\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations\n3.0\n(45.3)\n1.3\n(41.4)\nEarnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations\n0.11\n(1.67)\n0.05\n(1.53)\nAcquisition-related costs (excluding amortization) (2)\n$\n1.9\n$\n0.7\n$\n0.5\n$\n(0.1)\nStrategic and IT system resource planning expenses (2)\n13.7\n14.6\n5.7\n6.0\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n23.5\n24.0\n11.1\n11.6\nResearch and development expense\n26.2\n21.9\n14.2\n12.9\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n(1.3)\n(62.9)\n1.4\n(52.4)\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure - see the section titled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for additional information regarding this Non-GAAP financial measure.\n(2)\nSee the section below titled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for a description of these items.\nSales for the second quarter increased 12% to $278.6 million from $248.0 million in the second quarter of last year. Sales from Cubic Transportation Systems and Cubic Mission Solutions increased by 20% and 26%, respectively, while sales from Cubic Global Defense Systems decreased by 5%. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $7.5 million.\nThe operating loss was $1.7 million in the second quarter compared to $6.1 million in the second quarter of last year. The decrease in operating loss reflects improved profitability at all three reporting segments, led by Cubic Transportation Systems. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $1.1 million.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $15.8 million, an increase of 35% from $11.7 million in the second quarter of last year. The increase was primarily attributable to the same matters noted above and as described in more detail in the segment discussion below.\nCash provided by continuing operations was $12.5 million in the second quarter compared to $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2017.\nThe operating results of CGD Services have been classified as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) for all periods presented. Under GAAP rules regarding the accounting for discontinued operations, corporate overhead is not allocated to discontinued operations. Therefore, certain corporate overhead costs that had previously been allocated to the CGD Services segment have been included in operating loss from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. Such overhead amounts totaled $1.9 million and $2.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.\nNet loss from continuing operations in the second quarter was $3.3 million compared to a net income of $41.9 million in the second quarter last year. The change was most significantly impacted by the changes in income taxes on pre-tax losses from continuing operations.\nNet income from discontinued operations in the second quarter was $1.3 million compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $41.4 million in the second quarter last year. The comparability of net income from discontinued operations was primarily impacted by the income tax provision for discontinued operations. The assets and liabilities of a discontinued operation held for sale are measured at lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. As such, at March 31, 2018, we recognized a $6.9 million loss within discontinued operations upon classification of the CGD Services operations for the excess of the carrying value of the net assets of CGD Services over the sales price in the definitive agreement less estimated selling costs.\nReportable Segment Results\nSix Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nSales:\n(in thousands)\nCubic Transportation Systems\n$\n313.5\n$\n271.5\n$\n167.0\n$\n139.6\nCubic Global Defense Systems\n144.3\n158.3\n75.5\n79.7\nCubic Mission Solutions\n69.2\n62.6\n36.1\n28.7\nTotal sales\n$\n527.0\n$\n492.4\n$\n278.6\n$\n248.0\nOperating income (loss):\nCubic Transportation Systems\n$\n24.1\n$\n17.5\n$\n14.2\n$\n7.8\nCubic Global Defense Systems\n6.7\n8.1\n5.3\n4.8\nCubic Mission Solutions\n(16.7)\n(13.0)\n(7.8)\n(9.2)\nUnallocated corporate expenses\n(27.7)\n(24.3)\n(13.4)\n(9.5)\nTotal operating income (loss)\n$\n(13.6)\n$\n(11.7)\n$\n(1.7)\n$\n(6.1)\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nCubic Transportation Systems\n$\n30.6\n$\n21.9\n$\n17.2\n$\n9.9\nCubic Global Defense Systems\n11.6\n13.5\n7.4\n7.4\nCubic Mission Solutions\n(3.7)\n0.6\n(2.0)\n(3.2)\nUnallocated corporate expenses\n(11.2)\n(6.7)\n(6.8)\n(2.4)\nTotal adjusted EBITDA\n$\n27.3\n$\n29.3\n$\n15.8\n$\n11.7\nCubic Transportation Systems (CTS):\nCTS sales increased 20% to $167.0 million compared to $139.6 million last year supported by system engineering work on the New York New Fare Payment System contract and inclusive of a favorable foreign currency translation impact of $7.1 million.\nCTS Adjusted EBITDA increased 74% to $17.2 million compared to $9.9 million last year reflecting higher sales, lower research and development expense and operational improvements. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $1.4 million.\nCubic Global Defense Systems (CGD Systems):\nCGD Systems sales were $75.5 million compared to $79.7 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of air combat training systems. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $0.4 million.\nCGD Systems Adjusted EBITDA was $7.4 million, flat compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of $0.2 million.\nCubic Mission Solutions (CMS):\nCMS sales increased 26% to $36.1 million compared to $28.7 million last year driven by an increase in secured networking deliveries.\nCMS Adjusted EBITDA was negative $2.0 million compared to negative $3.2 million last year. The improvement reflects higher volume, partly offset by increased research and development expense.\nCubic Global Defense Services (CGD Services):\nOn April 19, 2018, Cubic Corporation announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its CGD Services business. In Cubic's second quarter results, the CGD Services segment is reflected as discontinued operations and the previous period financial results have been reclassified for comparative purposes.\nCGD Services sales increased to $98.1 million in the second quarter compared to $95.7 million last year. CGD Services Adjusted EBITDA increased to $4.7 million in the second quarter compared to $3.1 million last year, inclusive of corporate cost allocations of $1.9 million and $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFiscal 2018 Full Year Guidance (adjusted for the announced divestiture of CGD Services)\nconstant currency basis with 2017\nSales guidance: $1.135 billion to $1.185 billion Adjusted EBITDA: $90.0 million to $116.0 million\nConference Call and Webcast\nCubic will host a conference call to discuss the company's earnings results today, Wednesday, May 2 at 4:45 p.m. EST/1:45 p.m. PST.\nLive webcast: https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1188418&tp_key=492633016a .\nAn archive of the webcast will be made available in the Financials section of Cubic's Investor Relations page at https://www.cubic.com/investor-relations/financials .\nDial-In\nFinancial analysts and institutional investors are invited to dial:\n877-407-9708 201-689-8259 (international)\nTo avoid a delay in start time, please dial in beginning 4:35 p.m. EST/1:35 p.m. PST.\nAbout Cubic Corporation\nCubic is a market-leading, technology provider of integrated solutions that increase situational understanding for transportation, C4ISR and training customers worldwide to decrease urban congestion and improve the militaries' effectiveness and operational readiness.

In addition, please refer to the risk factors contained in our SEC filings available at www.sec.gov , including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10‑K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q. Because the risks, estimates, assumptions and uncertainties referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ expressed in any you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date hereof, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nWe believe that the presentation of Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA included in this report provides useful information to investors with which to analyze our operating trends and performance and ability to service and incur debt. Also, we believe EBITDA facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net interest expense), taxation, variations in organic versus inorganic growth (affecting amortization expense) and the age and book depreciation of property, plant and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We believe Adjusted EBITDA further facilitates company-to-company operating comparisons by backing out items that we believe are not part of our core operating performance. Items backed out of Adjusted EBITDA are comprised of expenses incurred in the development of our ERP system and the redesign of our supply chain which include internal labor costs and external costs of materials and services that do not qualify for capitalization, business acquisition expenses including retention bonus expenses, due diligence and consulting costs incurred in connection with the acquisitions, expenses recognized related to the change in the fair value of contingent consideration for acquisitions, restructuring costs, gains and losses on disposals of fixed assets, and income and expenses classified as other non-operating income and expenses which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to the company or as alternatives to net income as a measure of performance. In addition, other companies may define EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently and, as a result, our measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider either of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. As described above, on April 18, 2018, Cubic Corporation entered into a definitive agreement to sell the CGD Services business and all of the criteria for the classification of CGD Services as a discontinued operation have been met. The following reconciliations reflect continuing operations.\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nContinuing Operations\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and
