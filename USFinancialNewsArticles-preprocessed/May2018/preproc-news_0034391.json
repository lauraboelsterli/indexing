    "text": "May 15, 2018 / 1:09 PM / in 35 minutes COLUMN-Copper scrap a key battleground in China's war on waste: Andy Home Reuters Staff\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* China's copper scrap imports: tmsnrt.rs/2IgpZlD\n* Top 20 suppliers year-on-year change: tmsnrt.rs/2Ihlc3v\n* Top 20 suppliers by weight: tmsnrt.rs/2IgrFvr\nBy Andy Home\nLONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - China’s self-declared war on “foreign garbage” has come to America.\nFrom May 3 all U.S. shipments to China of secondary materials, from scrap metal to plastics and waste paper, are suspended for a month.\nChina Certification and Inspection Group (CCIC) North America, the sole body licensed with checking U.S. cargoes before they sail, will not be allowed to issue export certification documents until June 4.\nDuring the one-month suspension every container with U.S. waste material at Chinese ports will be opened, inspected and, if necessary, undergo laboratory testing.\nThe reason, according to China’s General Administration of Customs (GAC), is that “multiple shipments” of U.S. scrap have failed to meet tough new environmental regulations since the start of the year.\nThe rest of the world is only now waking up to how serious China is about keeping “foreign garbage out of our country’s gate”, as GAC expressed it in its notification. TIGHTENING THE SCREWS\nThat, of course, is likely to have implications for the copper market, with China the destination for almost half the world’s copper scrap exports, according to the International Copper Study Group.\nLast year China imported 3.56 million tonnes in gross weight.\nA ban on imports of lower-grade Category 7 scrap, such as motors and insulated wire that has to be dismantled and cleaned before being used as a metallic input, was announced in July last year and will be effective from the end of this year.\nAnalysts are broadly in agreement that this will affect something like 300,000 tonnes of contained metal, with the net effect offset by imports of higher-grade material and more domestic recycling.\nHowever, new rules that took effect at the start of March go way beyond simply weeding out lower-grade scrap.\nThe key is the concept of “carried waste”, which means any contaminants in a shipment of scrap material. The Chinese authorities have set thresholds at 0.5 percent of total weight for paper, wood and plastic and 1 percent for non-ferrous metals.\nThis upends the way the recycling industry has evolved in the rest of the world.\nAs the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) — a U.S. trade group — said in its formal response to the Chinese proposals, there are more than 150 specifications for non-ferrous scrap, with impurity thresholds ranging from zero to 4 percent.\n“There is no other country in the world that uses its own set of standards as a ‘pass/fail’ test for imports,” ISRI said in a Nov. 15 submission to the World Trade Organization.\nBut that is precisely what China is now doing, hence the month-long, container-by-container inspection at the country’s ports.\nNor is this a case of copper scrap suffering collateral damage from plastics or waste paper.\nA specific concern for GAC is scrap metal containing what it terms “powdery substances”.\nThe allowable threshold for powder contaminants has been set at a draconian 0.1 percent of total weight, even though ISRI has pointed out that certain types of copper oxidise into cupric oxide powders that are still copper and satisfy ISRI specifications.\nGraphic on China's copper scrap imports, in gross weight and with implied content: tmsnrt.rs/2IgpZlD\nGraphic on top 20 suppliers in Q1 and change vs Q1 2017:",
