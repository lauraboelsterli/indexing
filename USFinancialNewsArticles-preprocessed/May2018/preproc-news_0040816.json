    "text": "READING, Pa., May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EnerSys (NYSE:ENS), the global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications, announced today preliminary results for its fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2018, which ended on March 31, 2018.\nPlease note that these results are preliminary, and, while management expects them to be our final results, they could change.\nNet earnings attributable to EnerSys stockholders (“Net earnings”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 are expected to be $54.0 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, including a favorable highlighted net of tax impact of $1.5 million or $0.03 per share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts. The $1.5 million net of tax impact includes a tax benefit of $9.6 million for the release of a foreign valuation allowance, partially offset by a $4.1 million tax expense related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”).\nNet earnings attributable to EnerSys stockholders for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were $33.8 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable highlighted net of tax impact of $22.8 million or $0.52 per share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below.\nExcluding these highlighted items, adjusted Net earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, are expected to be $1.24, which meets the guidance of $1.20 to $1.24 per diluted share given by the Company on February 7, 2018. These earnings compare to the prior year fourth quarter adjusted Net earnings of $1.28 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company’s use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information which include tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the quarters and twelve months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $683.0 million, an increase of 9% from the prior year fourth quarter net sales of $626.8 million and a 4% sequential quarterly increase from the third quarter of fiscal 2018 net sales of $658.9 million. The increase in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter was the result of a 5% increase in foreign currency translation impact, 3% increase in pricing and a 1% increase in organic volume. The 4% sequential quarterly increase was due to a 2% increase in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% increase in each organic volume and pricing.\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2018 are expected to be $119.6 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, including an unfavorable net of tax impact of $80.9 million or $1.88 per diluted share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below, reconciling non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts. The $80.9 million net of tax impact includes an estimated net tax expense of $81.4 million comprised of a one-time transition tax expense of $97.5 million, a tax benefit related to the remeasurement of U.S deferred taxes of $14.1 million, and a tax benefit of $2.0 million related to the reduction of the fiscal 2018 effective federal tax rate of 31.5%, on account of the Tax Act.\nNet earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2017 were $160.2 million, or $3.64 per diluted share, which included an unfavorable net of tax impact of $48.9 million or $1.11 per share from highlighted items described in further detail in the tables shown below.\nAdjusted Net earnings for the twelve months of fiscal 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, are expected to be $4.65 per diluted share. This compares to the prior year twelve months adjusted Net earnings of $4.75 per diluted share. Please refer to the section included herein under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of the Company's use of non-GAAP adjusted financial information.\nNet sales for the twelve months of fiscal 2018 were $2,581.8 million, an increase of 9% from the net sales of $2,367.1 million in the comparable period in fiscal 2017. This increase was the result of a 4% increase in pricing, a 3% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase in foreign currency translation impact.\n“I am pleased with our fourth quarter performance and specifically in the Americas where we are experiencing strong demand for our thin plate pure lead batteries as customers recognize the value of these products,” stated David M. Shaffer, President and Chief Executive Officer of EnerSys. “Premium product sales in the fourth fiscal quarter exceeded 40% for the first time. Also, while commodities, especially lead, continued to rise during a majority of our fourth quarter, the spot rate has since declined over 10%. This reduction in commodity costs will benefit our second fiscal quarter results. Selling prices should hold steady or even rise, allowing for margin improvement for our second fiscal quarter. As I have stated previously, as lead costs start to decline, we are able to recover previous increases. During fiscal 2018 we were able to fund investment in new product development and Digital Core with record cost savings of nearly $25 million. Our first quarter of fiscal 2019 guidance for non-GAAP adjusted net earnings per diluted share is $1.15 to $1.19, which excludes an expected charge of $0.06 from our restructuring programs, ERP system implementation and acquisition expenses.”\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (\"GAAP\"). EnerSys' management uses the non-GAAP measure “adjusted Net earnings ” as applicable, in their analysis of the Company's performance. This measure, as used by EnerSys in past quarters and years, adjusts Net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP to reflect changes in financial results associated with the Company's restructuring initiatives and other highlighted charges and income items. Management believes the presentation of this financial measure reflecting these non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges that the Company incurs as a result of restructuring activities, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and other assets and those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, such as fees and expenses related to acquisition activities, stock-based compensation of senior executives, significant legal proceedings, ERP system implementation and tax valuation allowance changes, including those related to the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because these charges are not incurred as a result of ongoing operations, or are incurred as a result of a potential or previous acquisition, they are not as helpful a measure of the performance of our underlying business, particularly in light of their unpredictable nature and are difficult to forecast.\nIncome tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the applicable statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the charges (benefits) are incurred, while taking into consideration any valuation allowances. For those items which are non-taxable, the tax expense (benefit) is calculated at 0%.\nThis non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for Net Earnings determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the Company's ongoing operating results. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Net Earnings determined in accordance with GAAP.\nIncluded below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to preliminary amounts. Non-GAAP adjusted Net Earnings are calculated excluding restructuring and other highlighted charges and credits.
