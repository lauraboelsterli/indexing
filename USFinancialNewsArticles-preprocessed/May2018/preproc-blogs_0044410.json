    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning from the WSJ City desks in London. WSJ City is the app that delivers concise, smart news on business and finance for mobile. Download for iPhone or Android . Here’s essential reading on today’s developments.\nMUST READS FROM WSJ CITY\nTop European lawmakers will interrogate Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg over the company’s handling of alleged user-data misuse and election interference on the platform, as the social-network giant seeks to appease officials in a region where the company is regulated strictly. Here’s what to expect at the grilling, which starts in Brussels around 6:30 pm local time, 12:30 pm ET.\nCambridge Analytica, the firm at the heart of Facebook’s data scandal, is liquidating assets and has asked workers to vacate its London office, according to employees. In an hour-long meeting on site, administrators told about 40 employees that the firm was liquidating to pay off creditors after failing to receive any credible buyers, according to one employee attending.\nThe Bank of England may raise its key interest rate in ‘a few months’ if the UK economy rebounds from a first-quarter slowdown, Governor Mark Carney and other officials said. Speaking to lawmakers, Carney said the central bank continues to expect to raise its key interest rate gradually over coming years, while signs of a rebound in growth may come soon.\nAmong all the trade fights that President Trump has picked, his hand against China is the strongest. Yet China, incredibly, appears to be winning, argues chief economics commentator Greg Ip. Meanwhile, the US and China are moving closer toward resolving their trade dispute.\nInvestors are upping the ante on big oil companies over climate change, demanding they take more concrete action to help curb global warming. The issue was set to come into focus at Royal Dutch Shell ’s annual meeting where investors called on the company to go beyond already ambitious plans to curb emissions.\nIN THE PAPERS\nTrump and McConnell Plot Path to Hold Congress – WSJ\nToyota Warns Hybrid Clampdown Could Hit UK Plants – FT\nJacob Rees-Mogg Hints He’s Losing Faith in UK’s May – Bloomberg\nTrump and Moon Meet Amid Rising Doubts on North Korea – Politico\nEgypt’s Sisi Clamped Down on Political Opposition, Next Up Is the Economy – WSJ\nMARKETS TODAY\nEuropean stocks closed higher on waning concerns about trade tension. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.4%, while the FTSE 100 ended the session up 0.2%.\nThe somewhat upbeat tone in markets came after US industrial companies rallied on Monday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US would suspend its efforts to apply tariffs to $150 billion in Chinese imports.\nItaly’s MIB index bucked recent losses to rise 0.5% on news that the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement and League parties chose Giuseppe Conte as their compromise candidate for prime minister. Italian bonds also recovered in a relief trade, with yields on 10-year government bonds falling around nine basis points.\nBrent crude prices again breached the $80 a barrel threshold after Washington threatened ‘the strongest sanctions in history’ if Iran did not yield to US demands.\nThe Dow and Nasdaq Composite traded close to the flatline.\nShare this: WSJ City Previous Brexit & Beyond: Zuckerberg Enters the Lion's Den Next Fission for a Verdict",
