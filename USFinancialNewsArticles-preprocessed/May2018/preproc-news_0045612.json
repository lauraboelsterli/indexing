We have made significant progress through these efforts, with greater impacts expected in the quarters ahead. Our successes include a key Sprint relationship that provides a national sales channel as a ready-to-implement enterprise and commercial solution, as well as further opportunities for IGEN within the Sprint organization. We are furthering our business in the dealer pre-load model, which is a proven opportunity for new car dealers to significantly increase profitability. We are also now positioned for significant sales opportunities in the used vehicle marketplace.\n“We recently rolled out as part of the Sprint IoT Factory, which provides an exciting opportunity to expand our reach through an exciting sales channel. This positions IGEN alongside some of the best IoT solutions in the market, and alongside a partner rapidly becoming known as a leader in corporate and enterprise mobility solutions. We expect adoption of our platform to accelerate throughout 2018 as our channels ramp up, expanding our revenue from recurring subscriber revenue.”\nExpenses for Q1 2018 totaled $609,686, of which $464,969 were operating expenses representing a 35% increase reported the same period in 2017.
