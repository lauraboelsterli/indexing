    "text": "ANKARA, May 24 (Reuters) - Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek and Central Bank governor Murat Cetinkaya will travel to London next week to meet with investors, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.\nThe two-day trip will take place on May 28-29, the source said.\nThe lira has been hammered on concerns about the central bankâ€™s ability to tame double-digit inflation, particularly after President Tayyip Erdogan said during a trip to London that he expected to assert more policy control after June 24 elections.
