    "text": "Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 (1) :\nRevenue of $672 million, non-GAAP (2) revenue of $757 million Adjusted EBITDA of $187 million (2) or 24.7% of non-GAAP revenue Completed acquisition of Spoken Communications\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avaya Holdings Corp. (NYSE: AVYA) today reported financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 ended March 31, 2018. Due to the company’s emergence from Chapter 11 proceedings during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and adoption of fresh start accounting effective on December 15, 2017, the results for the first quarter and first six-months of fiscal 2018 are required by GAAP to be presented separately as the predecessor period from October 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017 (inclusive of results prior to October 1, 2017, the “Predecessor” period) and the successor period from December 16, 2017 through December 31, 2017 or March 31, 2018, as applicable (each, a “Successor” period). The application of fresh start accounting results in a new basis of accounting making the results of the Predecessor period not comparable to the results of the Successor period. Where applicable we have, however, combined results of the Predecessor and Successor periods for discussion purposes as we believe it provides the most meaningful basis to analyze our results. (1)\n“We are excited about our results for our first full quarter as a public company. They underscore the momentum generated by our increased investments in the business even during what is historically a weak seasonal quarter and represent a significant step forward in our progress against strategic goals for growth,” said Jim Chirico, President and CEO, Avaya. “We continue to deliver results by making significant progress in customer-driven innovations and advancing our technology plays, including our acquisition of Spoken Communications that has accelerated our multitenant cloud capabilities, our strategic alliance with Afiniti that uses behavioral pairing to match customers with contact center agents and our Avaya Mobile Experience announcement that changes the game by reducing contact center costs and offering omnichannel communications for mobile customers.”\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $672 million, including $1 million related to Avaya’s former Networking business, which was sold on July 14, 2017. Revenue for the combined period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 (the “Combined First Quarter Fiscal 2018” (1) ), was $752 million, including $3 million related to the Networking business. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 ending March 31, 2017 was $804 million, including $51 million related to the Networking business.\nNon-GAAP revenue adjusted to further exclude the revenue of the Networking business was $756 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, $16 million lower than the prior quarter (on a combined basis), representing a decline of approximately 2%, primarily as a result of seasonality and $2 million higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nGross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 48.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4%, a record percentage for a second quarter result, compared to 61.8% for the Combined First Quarter Fiscal 2018 and 60.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $89 million, compared to operating income of $38 million in Combined First Quarter Fiscal 2018, and operating income of $75 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $157 million, representing a second quarter record 20.7% percentage of non-GAAP revenue, compared to $172 million for the prior quarter (on a combined basis) and $159 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $130 million, compared to net income of $3,214 million for the Combined First Quarter Fiscal 2018, and a net loss of $8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018, adjusted EBITDA was $187 million or 24.7% of non-GAAP revenue, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $206 million, or 26.6% of non-GAAP revenue, for the Combined First Quarter Fiscal 2018 and $199 million, or 24.8% of revenue, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nCash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $54 million, compared to cash used for operating activities of $374 million during the Combined First Quarter Fiscal 2018, and cash provided by operating activities of $97 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $311 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $417 million at December 31, 2017 and $764 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The sequential change in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to payments for the acquisition of Spoken Communications, term loan payments to lenders and pension payments.\n1 The results for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, or March 31, 2018, as applicable, represent the sum of the reported amounts for the Predecessor period from October 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017 and the Successor period from December 16, 2017 through December 31, 2017 or March 31, 2018, as applicable (each, a “Successor” period). Refer to Supplemental Financial Information accompanying this press release for more information, including a reconciliation of combined results to our Predecessor and Successor results.\n2 Non-GAAP revenue, Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP operating income and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Refer to Supplemental Financial Information accompanying this press release for more information, including a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nAdded over 1,200 new logos worldwide.

These accounts were correctly reported as of December 31, 2017. Because of the application of fresh start accounting as of December 15, 2017, Stockholder’s Equity and Goodwill were also each understated by the same amount but not corrected as of December 31, 2017. The company determined that these errors were not material and corrected the errors in the applicable period of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this release and will correct them in the March 31, 2018 Form 10-Q.\nUse of non-GAAP (Adjusted) Financial Measures\nThe information furnished in this release includes non-GAAP financial measures that differ from measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), including the combined three month period ending December 31, 2017, combined six month period ending March 31, 2018 and financial measures labeled as “non-GAAP” or “adjusted.”\nAlthough GAAP requires that we report on our results for the periods October 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017 and December 16, 2017 through December 31, 2017 or March 31, 2018 as applicable, separately, management reviews the company’s operating results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 by combining the results of these two periods because such presentation provides the most meaningful comparison of our results. The company cannot adequately benchmark the operating results of the 16-day period ended December 31, 2017 against any of the previous periods reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and does not believe that reviewing the results of this period in isolation would be useful in identifying any trends regarding the company’s overall performance. Management believes that the key performance metrics such as revenue, gross margin and operating income when combined for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively, provide meaningful comparisons to other periods and are useful in identifying current business trends.\nWe also present the measures non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating income, as a supplement to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are the most meaningful for comparisons to prior periods because they exclude the impact of the earnings and charges noted in the applicable tables below that resulted from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, interest income and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain charges and other adjustments described in our SEC filings and the tables below.\nWe believe that including supplementary information concerning adjusted EBITDA is appropriate because it serves as a basis for determining management and employee compensation. In addition, we believe adjusted EBITDA provides more comparability between our historical results and results that reflect purchase accounting and our current capital structure. We also present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe analysts and investors utilize these measures in analyzing our results. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, such as our pricing strategies, volume, costs and expenses of the organization and it presents our financial performance in a way that can be more easily compared to prior quarters or fiscal years.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools. EBITDA measures do not represent net income (loss) or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. While EBITDA measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. In particular, our formulation of adjusted EBITDA allows adjustment for certain amounts that are included in calculating net income (loss), however, these are expenses that may recur, may vary and are difficult to predict.\nWe do not provide a forward-looking reconciliation of expected third quarter of fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP operating income or Non-GAAP revenue guidance as the amount of significance of special items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be estimated at this time without unreasonable efforts.
