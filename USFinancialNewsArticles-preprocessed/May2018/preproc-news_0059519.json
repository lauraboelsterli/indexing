The Air India logo is seen on the facade of its office building in Mumbai, July 7, 2017. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files\nThe government will not extend the deadline for submissions of interest in Air India, R.N. Choubey said on Wednesday. The deadline for receiving bids has already been extended once to May 31 from May 14.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s government, keen to sell the loss-making, debt-ridden airline, finalised plans in late March to divest a 76 percent stake and offload about $5.1 billion of its debt.
