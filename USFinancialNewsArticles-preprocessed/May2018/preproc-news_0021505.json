    "text": "HONOLULU, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Hawaiian, Inc. (NASDAQ:FHB) (the “Company”) today announced that an affiliate of BNP Paribas, the Company’s parent, intends to offer 15,300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in an underwritten public offering. In addition, the selling stockholder intends to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,530,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company will not be issuing any shares in connection with the offering and will not receive any proceeds from the offering.\nIn connection with the public offering, the Company has entered into a share repurchase agreement with BNP Paribas and the selling stockholder, pursuant to which the Company will repurchase directly from the selling stockholder shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $81.8 million (the \"direct share repurchase\"). The per-share purchase price to be paid by the Company in the direct share repurchase will be equal to the per-share purchase price paid by the underwriters in the public offering. The direct share repurchase is subject to a number of conditions, including the successful completion of the public offering.\nThe total number of shares of the Company’s common stock to be sold by the selling stockholder, including both the underwritten public offering and shares repurchased by the Company, is expected to equal approximately 18.2 million shares before the underwriters’ option. Completion of the public offering and the direct share repurchase is expected to reduce BNP Paribas’ beneficial ownership stake in the Company’s common stock from approximately 61.93% to approximately 49.93%. If the underwriters’ option is exercised in full, BNP Paribas’ remaining beneficial stake would be reduced to approximately 48.81%.\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank Securities are acting as underwriters for the proposed offering.\nThe offering will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, copies of which, when available, may be obtained from: Goldman Sachs & Co.
