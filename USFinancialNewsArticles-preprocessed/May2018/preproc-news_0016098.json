    "text": "Walmart to restrict opioid dispensing at its pharmacies Walmart said on it would restrict initial acute opioid prescriptions to no more than a seven-day supply. This is part of the retailer's effort to curb an opioid epidemic that has plagued the United States. From Jan. 1, 2020, Walmart would require e-prescriptions for controlled substances, noting that these prescriptions are proven to be less prone to errors and cannot be altered or copied. Published 55 Mins Ago Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images A customer walks past the pharmacy at a Walmart in Torrance, California.\nWalmart said on Monday it would restrict initial acute opioid prescriptions to no more than a seven-day supply as the retailer aims to curb an opioid epidemic that has plagued the United States.\nThe supply limit will begin within the next 60 days, the company said.\nIn January , Walmart said it would provide its customers filling prescriptions for opioids with a packet of powder that would help them dispose of leftover medication.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 115 Americans die on average every day from an opioid overdose.\nThe company also said on Monday that from Jan. 1, 2020 it would require e-prescriptions for controlled substances, noting that these prescriptions are proven to be less prone to errors and cannot be altered or copied.\nThe initiatives apply to all the pharmacies of Walmart and its Sam's Club unit in the United States and Puerto Rico.
