    "text": "JERICHO, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Getty Realty Corp. (NYSE:GTY) (“Getty” or the “Company”) announced today its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights For The First Quarter\n-- Net earnings of $0.25 per share\n-- Funds From Operations (FFO) of $0.44 per share\n-- Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) of $0.42 per share\n-- Entered into an amended and restated credit agreement\nChristopher J. Constant, Getty’s President & Chief Executive Officer stated, “Our first quarter financial results continue to demonstrate the stability of our platform and the sustainability of our cash flows. Our performance was supported by the strength of the convenience and gas sector, which we believe continues to be one of the strongest consumer segments in the country. Additionally, we successfully completed the refinancing of our credit facility during the quarter, which extended our near-term debt maturities by four years. Also, subsequent to quarter end, we completed an accretive acquisition leaseback transaction that added 30 convenience store and gasoline station properties in the Southern United States to our portfolio. Finally, we are pleased to have been assigned a BBB- investment grade debt rating by Fitch Ratings, which should lead to an improved cost of capital over time, which further reinforces the confidence we have in our portfolio and in our ability to deliver returns for our shareholders.”\nNet Earnings\nThe Company reported net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, of $10.0 million, or $0.25 per share, as compared to net earnings of $9.7 million, or $0.28 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nFunds From Operations (FFO) and Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)\nFFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $17.8 million, or $0.44 per share, as compared to $18.2 million, or $0.52 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nAFFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $16.8 million, or $0.42 per share, as compared to $14.2 million, or $0.40 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nAll per share amounts in this press release are presented on a fully diluted per common share basis, unless stated otherwise. FFO and AFFO are defined and reconciled to net earnings in the financial tables at the end of this release. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company revised its definition of AFFO. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues from rental properties in continuing operations increased by $4.4 million to $28.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $23.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in revenues from rental properties for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was primarily due to revenue from the properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nProperty costs from continuing operations were $4.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $4.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in property costs for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was principally due to an increase in reimbursable real estate taxes, offset by a decrease in maintenance expenses.\nEnvironmental expenses from continuing operations were $1.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a credit of $0.5 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in environmental expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was principally due to increases in environmental legal fees and net environmental remediation costs. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of change in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods.\nGeneral and administrative expenses from continuing operations were $3.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was principally due to an increase in employee related expenses.\nImpairment charges in continuing operations were $2.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2017. Impairment charges in continuing operations for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, were primarily attributable to the effect of adding asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with the Company’s environmental liabilities and reductions in estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids for certain properties.\nPortfolio Activities\nThere were no property acquisitions during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Subsequent to March 31, 2018, the Company acquired fee simple interests in 30 properties for $52.2 million and entered into a unitary triple-net lease with GPM Investments, LLC. The Company expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to net earnings. Also, subsequent to March 31, 2018, the Company acquired fee simple interests in two properties for a purchase price of $2.7 million in the aggregate.\nRedevelopment Activities\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company is actively redeveloping 10 of its former convenience store and gasoline station properties either as a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had signed leases on six additional properties, that are currently part of its net lease portfolio. These properties are expected to be recaptured from their current leases and transferred to redevelopment when the appropriate entitlements, permits and approvals have been secured.\nBalance Sheet\nOn March 23, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Restated Credit Agreement”) amending and restating its prior credit agreement. Pursuant to the Restated Credit Agreement, the Company (a) increased its borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) from $175.0 million to $250.0 million, (b) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from June 2018 to March 2022, (c) extended the maturity date of its unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”) from June 2020 to March 2023 and (d) amended certain financial covenants and provisions. The Restated Credit Agreement also reflects reductions in the interest rate for borrowings under each of the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $375.0 million of outstanding indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. The Company’s indebtedness consisted of $150.0 million in aggregate borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement and an aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million of senior unsecured notes. Total cash and cash equivalents were $18.0 million as of March 31, 2018.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company reaffirms its 2018 AFFO guidance at a range of $1.68 to $1.74 per diluted share. The Company’s guidance does not assume any potential future acquisitions or capital markets activities. The guidance is based on current plans and assumptions and is subject to risks and uncertainties more fully described in this press release and the Company’s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nConference Call Information\nGetty will hold its First Quarter Earnings Conference Call on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EDT.

As of March 31, 2018, the Company owned 824 properties and leased 78 properties from third-party landlords in 28 states across the United States and Washington, D.C.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to measurements defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company also focuses on Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) to measure its performance. FFO and AFFO are generally considered by analysts and investors to be appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measures of the performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO and AFFO are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP net earnings or as a measure of liquidity. These measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s performance in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\nFFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as GAAP net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate, impairment charges and cumulative effect of accounting change. The Company’s definition of AFFO is defined as FFO less (i) Revenue Recognition Adjustments (net of allowances), (ii) non-cash changes in environmental estimates, (iii) non-cash environmental accretion expense, (iv) environmental litigation accruals, (v) insurance reimbursements, (vi) legal settlements and judgments, (vii) acquisition costs expensed and (viii) other unusual items that are not reflective of the Company’s core operating performance. Other REITs may use definitions of FFO and/or AFFO that are different than the Company’s and, accordingly, may not be comparable.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company revised its definition of AFFO to exclude three additional items – environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments – because the Company believes that these items are not indicative of its core operating performance. While the Company does not label excluded items as non-recurring, the Company believes that excluding items from its definition of AFFO that are either non-cash or not reflective of its core operating performance provides analysts and investors the ability to compare its core operating performance between periods. AFFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, has been restated to conform to the Company’s revised definition.\nFFO excludes various items such as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate and impairment charges. In the Company’s case, however, GAAP net earnings and FFO typically include the impact of revenue recognition adjustments comprised of deferred rental revenue (straight-line rental revenue), the net amortization of above-market and below-market leases, adjustments recorded for recognition of rental income recognized from direct financing leases on revenues from rental properties and the amortization of deferred lease incentives, as offset by the impact of related collection reserves. Deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with the Company’s tenants. In accordance with GAAP, the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis rather than when payment is contractually due. The present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in-place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in-place leases. Income from direct financing leases is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest method, which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties. The amortization of deferred lease incentives represents the Company’s funding commitment in certain leases, which deferred expense is recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental revenue. GAAP net earnings and FFO include non-cash changes in environmental estimates and environmental accretion expense, which do not impact the Company’s recurring cash flow. GAAP net earnings and FFO also include environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, and legal settlements and judgments, which items are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. GAAP net earnings and FFO from time to time may also include acquisition costs expensed and other unusual items that are not reflective of the Company’s core operating performance. Acquisition costs are expensed, generally in the period when properties are acquired and are not reflective of our core operating performance.\nThe Company pays particular attention to AFFO, as the Company believes it best represents its core operating performance. In the Company’s view, AFFO provides a more accurate depiction than FFO of its core operating performance. By providing AFFO, the Company believes that it is presenting useful information that assists analysts and investors to better assess its core operating performance. Further, the Company believes that AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of its core operating performance with the sustainability of the core operating performance of other real estate companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCERTAIN STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY CONSTITUTE “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.
