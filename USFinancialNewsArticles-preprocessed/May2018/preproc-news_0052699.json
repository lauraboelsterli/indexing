    "text": "Bohemia, NY. , May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AmpliTech Inc. (OTCQB:AMPG)The company reported first quarter revenue of $428,541 with a net profit of $42,770, a 27% increase in comparison to the same period last year. The overall “dip” last year was largely attributed to a generally slow global market for the RF/Microwave industry as well as to the commitment of more resources by the company to the expansion of marketing vistas and the development of new products. As such, the significant increase in profit is a positive sign of consequent growth. CFO Louisa Sanfratello states “we are very pleased with the results of the first quarter of 2018. We have developed leading edge performance products in various sectors which has been instrumental to our success this quarter and to our $1.2M and growing backlog. In addition, AMPG recently received a $220,000 order and we anticipate much more of the same.” AMPG is seeing an increase in orders in our cryogenic LNA’s and other products for commercial, wireless, cellular, military and even medical applications.\nFurthermore, the addition of Charlie Weinhofer as Director of Global Sales gives AmpliTech a solid foundation for growth as Mr. Weinhofer’s over 25 years of marketing and management experience along with his many industry contacts will undoubtedly lead to more business and higher profits. This is but one example of how AMPG is continually expanding our team with the best candidates in the business as our product lines continue to expand.\nFinally, we are excited to announce our exhibition at the annual 2018 International Microwave Symposium in Philadelphia, PA, June 12-14, 2018. The event will provide maximum visibility for our products and services.\nAbout Amplitech Group, Inc:\nAmpliTech Group, Inc. designs, develops, and manufactures custom and standard state-of-the-art RF (Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA) and Power Amplifiers (PA) for the Domestic and International, SATCOM , Space , and Military markets.
