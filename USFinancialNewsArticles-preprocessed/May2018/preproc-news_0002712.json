    "text": "RICHMOND, Va., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Synalloy Corporation (Nasdaq:SYNL), today announced net sales for the first quarter of 2018 of $58.5 million. This represents an increase of $16.3 million or 39% when compared to net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact from the acquisition of the stainless steel pipe and tube operations of Marcegaglia USA, Inc. (“Bristol Metals-Munhall”), first quarter net sales were up 16% over the same period last year.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded net income of $3.8 million, or $0.44 per share, an increase of 421% compared to net income of $0.7 million, or $0.08 per share for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 includes financial results in the Company's Metals Segment related to the acquisition of Bristol Metals-Munhall, which closed on February 28, 2017. For the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 (month of March only), net sales for Bristol Metals-Munhall were $11.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with operating income for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 of $1.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nThe Company also reports on its performance utilizing its two non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA. The Company's performance, as calculated under the two measures, is as follows:\nAdjusted Net Income for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.3 million, or $0.49 per share, an increase of $3.0 million or 231% from $1.3 million, or $0.15 per share for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $4.1 million or 118% for the first quarter of 2018 to $7.6 million, 13.0% of sales, from $3.5 million, 8.3% of sales, for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company's results are periodically impacted by factors that are not included as adjustments to the non-GAAP totals, but represent items that help understand differences in period to period results. For the first quarter of 2018, the most significant of those was inventory price change gain which, on a pre-tax basis, totaled $2.5 million, compared to a $0.9 million gain for the first quarter of 2017, representing an improvement of $1.2 million in after tax income compared to the prior year.\n\"We are very pleased with the Company's performance in the first quarter and look for improving results over the balance of the year,\" said Craig Bram, President and CEO. \"The Metals Segment performed exceptionally well, with a 53% improvement in quarterly sales over last year, and an almost three-fold increase in operating profit. Our unique set of manufacturing capabilities and expanded product offerings, with the addition of our Munhall operations, is providing us tremendous opportunities for growth and earnings improvements in the Metals Segment as our markets continue to improve. The Specialty Chemicals Segment's operating margin, as expected, was lower than last year's first quarter due to product mix. Not counting the recently announced new business at CRI, the operating margin for the second quarter will exceed both the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of last year.\"\nMetals Segment\nMetals Segment net sales for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $45.5 million, an increase of $15.8 million or 53% from the first quarter of 2017. Excluding Bristol Metals-Munhall, first quarter net sales were up 21% over the same period last year. Sales of seamless carbon pipe and tube were up 47% over last year’s first quarter. Storage tank and vessel sales declined 8% over last year’s first quarter. Stainless steel pipe and tube sales were up 77% over last year’s first quarter. Excluding Bristol Metals-Munhall, sales for stainless steel pipe and tube were up 22% over last year’s first quarter.\nThe backlog for Bristol Metals as of March 31, 2018 was $34.0 million, while Palmer’s backlog totaled $18.0 million.\nThe Metals Segment's operating income improved $4.4 million to $6.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. The change in operating results were affected by the following factors:\nThe addition of Bristol Metals-Munhall operations as noted above.\nNickel prices and resulting surcharges for 304 and 316 alloys continued to rise during the first quarter of 2018, with surcharges for both alloys increasing by $0.03 and $0.14 per pound, respectively.\nYear over year improvements in volume, pricing, and product mix combined for a 31% improvement in gross profit margins in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017.\nSeamless carbon pipe and tube showed significant improvement with a 47% increase in sales driving an almost ten-fold improvement in operating profit over the prior year.\nThe overall Metals Segment growth was achieved despite customer requests for delayed shipment of $1.4 million in storage tanks and vessels, that moved the volume and profits into April. All tanks have been shipped as of the date of this release, bolstering an already strong outlook for second quarter Metals Segment results.\nSpecialty Chemicals Segment\nNet sales for the Specialty Chemicals Segment in the first quarter of 2018 were $13.0 million, representing a $0.5 million or 4% increase from the same quarter of 2017. Net sales were impacted during the first quarter of 2018 primarily from the initial ramp up of four significant customers; a new fire retardant customer at CRI Tolling, two new oil and gas customers at Manufacturers Chemicals, and a new product launch from an existing customer at Manufacturers Chemicals.\nOperating income for the Specialty Chemicals Segment for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.9 million, approximately $0.1 million ahead of plan expectations for the quarter. The result was approximately $0.6 million lower than the first quarter of 2017. The primary difference in operating profit performance compared to prior year first quarter is the relative product mix experienced. The segment historically experiences operating profit in a range between 5% to 12%. In 2017, the first quarter represented the higher end of that range at 12%, with the full year averaging to 9%, close to the average for the past four years. In the first quarter of 2018, operating profit was 7% of sales, close to the low end of historical quarterly performances; however, annual performance is expected to be at approximately 10%, or 1% higher than previous historical averages, primarily related to higher volumes on a substantially fixed operating cost base.\nOther Items\nUnallocated corporate expenses for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $0.1 million or 3.5% to $1.5 million (2.6% of sales) compared to $1.6 million (3.7% of sales) for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter decrease resulted from lower professional and director fees along with higher corporate allocations to the operating segments partially offset by higher salaries and wages, stock compensation expense and incentive bonus costs.\nAcquisition costs were $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 ($0.3 million in unallocated SG&A and $0.1 million in Metals Segment cost of sales), resulting from costs associated with the Bristol Metals-Munhall acquisition. There were no significant acquisition costs during the first quarter of 2018.\nInterest expense was $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, as the average debt outstanding was higher in the first quarter of 2018 as additional borrowings were required to support working capital requirements associated with increased business activity along with the acquisition of Bristol Metals-Munhall on February 28, 2017, which would have resulted in a partial quarter of interest expense in the prior year.\nDue to higher projected sales of small diameter stainless-steel pipe and tube (outside diameter of ten inches or less) for the remainder of the measurement period, the earn-out liability resulting from the acquisition of Bristol Metals-Munhall was increased by $0.2 million for the first quarter 2018.\nThe effective tax rate was 21.6% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. The 2018 effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate of 21% due to state tax expense, net of the federal benefit. The effective tax rate was 30.0% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was lower than the 34% federal statutory rate primarily due to state tax expense, net of the federal benefit and other permanent differences, including the manufacturer's exemption.\nThe Company's cash balance increased $4,000 to $19,000 as of March 31, 2018 compared to $15,000 at December 31, 2017. Fluctuations during the period were comprised of the following:\nNet accounts receivable increased $6.1 million at March 31, 2018 when compared to the prior year end, which resulted from a 17% increase in sales for the last two months of the first quarter 2018 compared to the last two months of the fourth quarter 2017. Also, days sales outstanding, calculated using a three-month average basis, decreased from 51 days outstanding at the end of December 2017 to 47 days at the end of the first quarter 2018;\nNet inventories increased $10.7 million at March 31, 2018 as compared to year-end 2017. The increase, which was entirely related to the Metals Segment, resulted from higher stainless steel surcharges for the quarter, replenishing seamless carbon steel pipe and tube inventory levels and building higher cost special alloy inventory which is scheduled to ship in the second quarter of 2018. Inventory turns decreased from 2.51 turns at December 31, 2017, calculated on a three-month average basis, to 2.44 turns at March 31, 2018;\nAccounts payable increased $5.2 million as of March 31, 2018 from the prior year-end. The significant portion of the increase was for Bristol Metals-Munhall (up $4.1 million) as a greater amount of inventory was purchased during the first quarter of 2018 to support a significant order of special alloy pipe due to ship in the second quarter 2018. Accounts payable days outstanding were approximately 50 days at March 31, 2018 compared to 60 days at December 31, 2017;\nThe Company purchased approximately 105,000 shares of a potential acquisition target for $0.2 million during the first quarter of 2018. These \"equity securities\" were acquired via open market trading; and\nCapital expenditures for 2018 were $1.9 million.\nThe Company drew $8.4 million against its line of credit during the first three months of 2018 and had $34.3 million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2018. Covenants under the Credit Agreement include maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a limitation on the Company’s maximum amount of capital expenditures per year, which is in line with currently projected needs. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2018.\nOutlook\nWhile the first quarter results were exceptionally good, there remains considerable upside to the Company's performance. In the Metals Segment, we have yet to see the level of project activity that we enjoyed in 2014 and the associated spending on special alloys and larger OD product sizes. In recent years, Bristol Metals has invested heavily in expanding its total production capacity. Just this month, we acquired a high frequency laser mill which will be installed at Munhall in the third quarter. While we anticipate total shipments greater than 65 million pounds in 2018 at our Bristol Metals unit, our total capacity is now approaching 110 million pounds annually, allowing us to further support our distribution customers and fill any voids that may develop from fewer imports. For the Specialty Chemicals Segment, new product additions like the one recently announced, should drive meaningful organic growth in the current and subsequent years. On the acquisition front, we have identified a high impact \"bolt-on\" that offers strong earnings potential at a reasonable price. We expect to have more to share regarding this opportunity before the end of the current quarter.\nSynalloy Corporation (Nasdaq:SYNL) is a growth-oriented company that engages in a number of diverse business activities including the production of stainless steel pipe and tubing, fiberglass and steel storage tanks and specialty chemicals and the master distribution of seamless carbon pipe and tubing.

An item is included in the measure if its periodic value is inconsistent and sufficiently material that not identifying the item would render period comparability less meaningful to the reader or if including the item provides a clearer representation of normalized periodic earnings. The Company includes in Adjusted EBITDA two categories of items: 1) Base EBITDA components, including: earnings before discontinued operations, interest (including change in fair value of interest rate swap), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and 2) Material transaction based items that have no relationship to earnings from operations of past, current or future periods, including: goodwill impairment, acquisition costs, acquisition related retention costs, shelf registration costs, earn-out adjustments, gain on excess death benefit, (gains) losses associated with Sale-leaseback, stock option/grant costs, and other adjustments (lesser value items meeting the criteria, where cumulative impact in a period is material).
