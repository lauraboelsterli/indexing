    "text": "HUNT VALLEY, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (NYSE:OHI) (the “Company” or “Omega”) today announced its results of operations for the three-month period The Company reported for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 net income of $87.9 million or $0.42 per common share. The Company also reported Funds From Operations (“FFO”) for the quarter of $148.0 million or $0.71 per common share, Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO” or “Adjusted FFO”) of $161.3 million or $0.78 per common share, and Funds Available For Distribution (“FAD”) of $143.8 million.\nFFO for the first quarter of 2018 includes $7.8 million in provisions for uncollectible accounts, $4.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $2.0 million for a purchase option buyout and $0.6 million of unrealized gain on warrants (Adjusted FFO excludes those four items). FFO, AFFO and FAD are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information regarding these non-GAAP measures, see the “Funds From Operations” schedule.\nGAAP NET INCOME\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $87.9 million, or $0.42 per common share, on operating revenues of $220.2 million. This compares to net income of $109.1 million, or $0.53 per common share, on operating revenues of $231.7 million, for the same period in 2017.\nThe decrease in net income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $16.2 million reduction in revenue associated with the Orianna Health Systems (“Orianna” and f/k/a ARK) portfolio, a favorable $10.4 million contractual settlement recorded in the first quarter of 2017, $5.4 million in increased provisions for uncollectible accounts, a $3.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses and $3.0 million in increased interest expense. This decrease in net income was partially offset by $10.1 million in increased gains on the sale of assets and a $2.7 million decrease in impairments on real estate assets.\nCEO COMMENTS\nTaylor Pickett, Omega’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We continue to make good progress in our strategic asset repositioning activities and I expect that those efforts will be largely completed during 2018. In addition, with the impending completion of Signature’s consensual restructuring, we will have resolved the uncertainty associated with that operator and our investment in those assets.” Mr. Pickett added, “Orianna recommenced partial rent payments in April as required by our restructuring support agreement and we expect to have further clarity in the near future regarding our efforts to transfer a significant portion of that portfolio.”\n2018 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nIn Q2 2018, the Company…\ndeclared a $0.66 per share quarterly common stock dividend rate.\nIn Q1 2018, the Company…\nsold 14 facilities and had 3 mortgage loans repaid, totaling $98.4 million in net cash proceeds. invested $38 million in capital renovation and construction-in-progress projects. completed $30 million in new investments. increased its quarterly common stock dividend rate to $0.66 per share.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS\nOperating Revenues and Expenses – Operating revenues for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 totaled $220.2 million, which included $17.4 million of non-cash revenue.\nOperating expenses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 totaled $99.6 million and consisted of $70.4 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $12.4 million of general and administrative expense, $7.8 million in provisions for uncollectible accounts, $4.9 million of impairments on real estate properties and $4.1 million of stock-based compensation expense.

For more information on impairment and provision charges, see the Asset Impairment and Disposition section below.\nOther Income and Expense – Other income and expense for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was a net expense of $49.6 million, primarily consisting of $48.0 million of interest expense and $2.2 million of amortized deferred financing costs.\nFunds From Operations – For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, FFO was $148.0 million, or $0.71 per common share on 208 million weighted-average common shares outstanding, compared to $181.0 million, or $0.88 per common share on 206 million weighted-average common shares outstanding, for the same period in 2017.\nThe $148.0 million of FFO for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 includes the impact of $7.8 million in provisions for uncollectible accounts, $4.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, a $2.0 million purchase option buyout, and $0.6 million in unrealized gain on warrants.

The following table outlines shares of the Company’s common stock issued under its Equity Shelf Program and its Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan in 2018:\n(in thousands, except price per share) Equity Shelf\n(At-the-\nMarket)\nProgram\nDividend\nReinvestment and\nCommon Stock\nPurchase Plan\nQ1 2018 Number of shares — 189 Average price per share $ — $ 25.87 Gross proceeds $ — $ 4,886 2018 FIRST QUARTER PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY\nPortfolio Activity\nGenesis Healthcare – On March 6, 2018, the Company amended certain terms of its $48.0 million secured term loan with Genesis Healthcare, Inc. (“Genesis”) and provided Genesis an additional $16.0 million secured term loan bearing interest at a fixed rate of 10% per annum, of which 5% per annum will be paid-in-kind and matures on July 29, 2020.\nIn connection with the Genesis master lease and term loan amendments, in December 2017 and March 2018, respectively, the Company received warrants to purchase 1.5 million shares of Genesis common stock. In December 2017, Genesis issued the Company a stock warrant to purchase 900,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, exercisable beginning August 2018 and ending December 2022. On March 6, 2018, Genesis issued the Company a stock warrant to purchase 600,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $1.33 per share, exercisable beginning September 2018 and ending March 2023. For the three month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded $581 thousand of other income resulting from mark-to-market gains on the warrants.\nMaplewood – During the first quarter of 2018, the Company paid Maplewood Real Estate Holdings, LLC (“Maplewood”), an existing operator, approximately $50 million in exchange for a reduction of Maplewood’s participation in an in-the-money purchase option. As a result, the Company recorded a lease inducement of approximately $28 million that will be amortized as a reduction to rental income over the remaining term of the lease. The remaining $22 million was recorded as a reduction to the initial contingent liability reported in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n$68 Million of New Investments in Q1 2018 – In Q1 2018, the Company completed approximately $30 million of new investments and $38 million in capital renovations and new construction consisting of the following:\n$13 Million Acquisition – On February 28, 2018, the Company acquired one skilled nursing facility (“SNF”) for approximately $13.2 million from an unrelated third party. The 130 bed facility located in Virginia was added to an existing operator’s master lease with an initial annual cash yield of 9.5% with 2.5% annual escalators.\n$7 Million Acquisition – On March 1, 2018, the Company acquired one SNF for approximately $7.4 million from an unrelated third party. The 66 bed facility located in Pennsylvania was added to an existing operator’s master lease with an initial cash yield of 9.5% with 2.5% annual escalators.\n$6 Million Acquisition – On March 1, 2018, the Company acquired one care home facility (similar to assisted living facilities in the United States) located in the United Kingdom (“UK”) from an unrelated third party for approximately $5.5 million. The 40 bed facility was added to an existing operator’s master lease with an initial annual cash yield of 8.5% with 2.5% annual escalators.\n$4 Million Acquisition – On February 15, 2018, the Company acquired one care home facility in the UK from an unrelated third party for approximately $3.6 million. The 30 bed facility was added to an existing operator’s master lease with an initial annual cash yield of 8.5% with 2.5% annual escalators.\n$38 Million Capital Renovation Projects – In addition to the new investments outlined above, in Q1 2018, the Company invested $38.0 million under its capital renovation and construction-in-progress programs.\nASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND DISPOSITIONS\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company sold 14 facilities for approximately $74.0 million in net cash proceeds, recognizing a gain of approximately $17.5 million. The Company also received $24.4 million for final payment on three mortgage loans. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $7.8 million of provisions for uncollectible accounts related to the write-off of straight-line receivables resulting from the transfer of 15 facilities to new operators within Omega’s portfolio.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company recorded approximately $4.9 million of impairments on real estate properties to reduce the net book values of 17 facilities to their estimated fair values or expected selling prices. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 33 facilities classified as assets held for sale totaling $143.4 million. The Company expects to sell these facilities over the next few quarters.\nAs part of its ongoing strategic asset repositioning program, in addition to the $143 million of assets held for sale, the Company is evaluating an additional $125+ million of potential disposition opportunities within its portfolio and may incur additional impairments or potential losses on the dispositions.\nDIVIDENDS\nOn April 13, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a common stock dividend of $0.66 per share, to be paid May 15, 2018 to common stockholders of record on April 30, 2018.\n2018 ADJUSTED FFO GUIDANCE AFFIRMED\nThe Company affirmed its 2018 Adjusted FFO guidance of $2.96 to $3.06 per diluted share.\nBob Stephenson, Omega’s CFO commented, “Our better than expected first quarter results largely reflect the timing of new investments and asset sales. A number of planned asset sales were completed later in the quarter than originally assumed. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our previously issued guidance for 2018 annual AFFO and FAD.” Mr. Stephenson continued, “As I stated in February; we expanded our guidance range for this year as the timing of asset sales and the redeployment of capital from those sales, as well as the timing of the ultimate resolution of the Orianna portfolio through the bankruptcy process may significantly impact our results.” Mr. Stephenson concluded, “Our asset sales and approximately $275 million of potential asset dispositions are on track to be completed over the next several months. We expect to redeploy most of the capital from the sales by year end; although the actual timing may vary.”\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Omega’s guidance regarding Adjusted FFO to projected GAAP earnings.\n2018 Annual Adjusted FFO\nGuidance Range\n(per diluted common share)\nFull Year Net Income $ 1.48 - $1.58 Depreciation 1.40 Gain on assets sold (0.08)\nReal estate impairment 0.03 FFO $ 2.83 - $2.93 Adjustments: Unrealized gain on warrants 0.00 Purchase option buyout 0.01 Provision for uncollectible accounts 0.04 Stock-based compensation expense 0.08 Adjusted FFO $ 2.96 - $3.06 Note: All per share numbers rounded to 2 decimals.\nThe Company's Adjusted FFO guidance for 2018 reflects the impact of approximately $100 million of planned capital renovation projects (of which $38 million was completed in Q1), $98 million of assets sold and mortgages repaid in Q1 2018, the sale of $143 million of assets held for sale, approximately $125 million of potential divestitures and the redeployment of capital from asset sales. It assumes the Company will not be recording revenue related to its Orianna portfolio for the majority of 2018. It also excludes the impact of gains and losses from the sale of assets, certain revenue and expense items, interest refinancing expense, capital transactions, acquisition costs, and additional provisions for uncollectible accounts, if any. The Company may, from time to time, update its publicly announced Adjusted FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.\nThe Company's guidance is based on a number of assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the Company’s control. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the timing and completion of acquisitions, divestitures, capital and financing transactions, and variations in stock-based compensation expense may cause actual results to vary materially from our current expectations. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its projected results.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will be conducting a conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 10 a.m. Eastern to review the Company’s 2018 first quarter results and current developments.

For purposes of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the company, or include amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented. As used in this press release, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company calculates and reports FFO in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), and consequently, FFO is defined as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization and impairments on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The Company believes that FFO, Adjusted FFO and FAD are important supplemental measures of its operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. The term FFO was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue. FFO described herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO of other real estate investment trusts, or REITs, that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from the Company.\nAdjusted FFO is calculated as FFO excluding the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation and certain revenue and expense items identified above. FAD is calculated as Adjusted FFO less non-cash interest expense and non-cash revenue, such as straight-line rent. The Company believes these measures provide an enhanced measure of the operating performance of the Company’s core portfolio as a REIT. The Company’s computation of Adjusted FFO and FAD are not comparable to the NAREIT definition of FFO or to similar measures reported by other REITs, but the Company believes that they are appropriate measures for this Company.\nThe Company uses these non-GAAP measures among the criteria to measure the operating performance of its business. The Company also uses Adjusted FFO among the performance metrics for performance-based compensation of officers. The Company further believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization, impairments on real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. The Company offers these measures to assist the users of its financial statements in analyzing its operating performance and not as measures of liquidity or cash flow.
