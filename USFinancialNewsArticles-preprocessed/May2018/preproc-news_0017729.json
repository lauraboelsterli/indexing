    "text": "HOUSTON, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: POWL), a leading supplier of custom engineered solutions for the management, control and distribution of electrical energy, today announced results for the fiscal 2018 second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $101.5 million, compared to revenues of $90.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 and revenues of $104.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company reported a net loss for the second quarter of $3.3 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and a net loss of $0.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nBrett A. Cope, Powell's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Our second quarter 2018 results reflect improvements in operations and a strengthening backlog, both in terms of volumes and improved price levels, over fiscal 2017. Customer sentiment in some of our end markets continues to improve, commercial and municipal projects in particular, as the outlook for U.S. infrastructure strengthens. We are now beginning to see customer activity around several larger projects which appear to be moving toward funding decisions between now and into fiscal 2019. After-market, brownfield opportunities remain steady as the need for smaller, short-cycle service work continues.\"\nNew orders placed during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $142 million compared to $100 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and compared to $62 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company's backlog as of March 31, 2018 was $300 million compared to $260 million as of December 31, 2017 and compared to $228 million at the end of last year's second quarter.\nOUTLOOK\nPowell continues to expect a net loss in fiscal 2018. However, the Company estimates its second half fiscal 2018 performance to show an improvement over the first half as new customer orders have improved as anticipated.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nPowell Industries has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
