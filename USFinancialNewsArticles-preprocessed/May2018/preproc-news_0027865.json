    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cannabis Wheaton Income Corp. (TSX.V:CBW) (the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that it has closed its previously announced acquisition (the \" Transaction \") of its streaming partner Robinson's Cannabis Inc. (\" Robinson's \"), acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Robinson's.\nRobinson's, formerly Cannahort Agriculture Inc. and an original streaming partner of the Company, is a privately-owned, late-stage licensed producer applicant under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (the \" ACMPR \") located in Kentville, Nova Scotia that is currently constructing a 27,700 square foot purpose-built cannabis cultivation facility.\nPursuant to a share purchase agreement dated April 6, 2018, the Company has acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Robinson's for an aggregate purchase price of $14,000,000, issued to the shareholders of Robinson's as an aggregate of 9,395,968 common shares in the capital of the Company. As a result of the Transaction, Robinson's is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nHugo Alves, President and Director of Cannabis Wheaton commented, “I could not be happier to announce the closing of the Robinson's acquisition. This transaction strengthens our commitment to Atlantic Canada and deepens the roots that we're establishing there. Andrew and his team are exceptionally talented, passionate professionals who are committed to the craft of growing ultra-premium cannabis and we believe that his cannabis flower will be highly sought after among cannabis connoisseurs across the country. In addition, the Robinson's purpose-built facility is located in Kentville, Nova Scotia, a short drive from our Dosecann facility in Charlottetown, PEI, where we intend to work with Andrew and his team to develop derivative products which highlight the quality of Robinson's cannabis and cater to cannabis consumers who demand and enjoy the very best.”\nAndrew Robinson, President and Master Grower of Robinson's stated, \"The Robinson’s Cannabis team could not be more excited about the announcement of our partnership. We’ve developed a terrific relationship with Chuck, Hugo and the rest of the team over that past year. There are so many invaluable benefits to having Wheaton as a partner but more than anything it is the energy, talent, and passion for cannabis of the Wheaton team that are a compliment and natural fit for the Robinson’s team and our ambitions. We want to share our distinct product with the world and to become a global brand, the Wheaton team and platform are best equipped to help accomplish our goal.\"\nFor further details on the Transaction, see the Company's press release dated April 9, 2018 available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\n\" Chuck Rifici \" Chairman & CEO\nAbout Cannabis Wheaton (TSX.V:CBW)\nCannabis Wheaton is a collective of entrepreneurs with a passion for the cannabis industry past, present and future.
