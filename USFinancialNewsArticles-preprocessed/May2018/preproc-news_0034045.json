[nL3N10K089]\nThe National Olympic Committees (NOC) will select one player or team to represent their nation in each event. These teams and players will take part in regional qualifying competitions in June.\nThe finalists from the five regional qualifiers will then take part in the main event in August.\nThe Asian Games will be held in Indonesia from Aug. 18 to Sep. 2.\nA man plays \"PES 2016, Pro Evolution Soccer 2016\" produced by Japanese developer Konami at the Gamescom 2015 fair in Cologne, Germany August 5, 2015.
