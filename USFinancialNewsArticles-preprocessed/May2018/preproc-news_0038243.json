    "text": "43 COMMENTS MEXICO CITY—Mexico’s chief trade negotiator said Tuesday that he doesn’t expect talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement to be wrapped up by Thursday, increasing the likelihood that a new Nafta won’t be voted on by the current U.S. Congress.\n“The possibility of having the entire negotiation done by Thursday isn’t easy, we don’t think it will happen by Thursday,” Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told the Televisa network.\nThe blown deadline is a setback for both the Americans and the Mexicans, who were hoping to reach at least general terms of a deal that could be approved before Mexico’s July 1 presidential election and U.S. congressional mid-term elections in November. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan had set May 17 as an informal deadline if Trump administration wants the current Congress to vote on a renegotiated trade pact between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nMr. Guajardo and his Canadian counterpart, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, spent the bulk of the last two weeks in Washington holding ministerial-level meetings trying to hammer out an accord with U.S. Trade Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, but returned to their countries Friday without any major announcements.\nNegotiators from the U.S., Canada and Mexico are scrambling to reach a Nafta deal by July, but two proposals involving autos are complicating the talks. WSJ’s Shelby Holliday explains. Among the most contentious issues is rules of origin for auto manufacturers, which dictate how much of a vehicle must originate in the U.S., Canada or Mexico to qualify for tariff-free trade under Nafta.\nMr. Guajardo pledged to continue negotiating until the countries “reach equilibrium,” but voiced frustration at U.S. demands for a five-year sunset clause for the trade pact and the elimination of international dispute-resolution mechanisms, which he said were unacceptable to Mexico because of the uncertainty they would cause.\nThose measures, which the Mexican government views as political issues rather than technical trade issues, are meant to give countries credibility among investors, particularly important for Mexico as it to seeks to cement the continuity of recent moves including the opening up the energy and telecom industries, he said.\n“Imagine asking the auto industry to change their entire business model” to accommodate new rules of origin, Mr. Guajardo said. “How can you then say, look, after five years, the leaders could decide not to continue with the agreement?”\nRelated\nAs Nafta Deadline Nears, Four Scenarios That Could Unfold Bevy of Issues Continues to Complicate Nafta Negotiations (May 14) As Nafta Deadline Nears, Hopes for Deal Focus on Autos (May 10) In Nafta Talks, U.S. Pushes Mexico to Raise Wages for Its Auto Workers (May 7) At present, 62.5% of a vehicle’s value must come from one of the three Nafta countries, although certain components purchased from low-cost supplier countries such as China can be altered once they arrive in a Nafta country to meet origin requirements.\nThe U.S. had proposed raising that number to 75% and mandating that within two to four years, 40% of light vehicles and 45% of pickup trucks traded under Nafta must be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour.\nMexico’s auto industry rejected that proposal and last week counter-proposed to require only 20% of vehicles be made in high-wage zones and to give the industry more time to adapt to the new rules. But hopes faded this week after the U.S. reacted coolly to the Mexican proposal, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMr. Guajardo said the Nafta talks could run beyond July 1, when Mexico holds presidential and congressional elections, which means responsibility for the talks would include a transition team. Mexico’s change of administration is Dec. 1.\nThe leading presidential candidate, leftist Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has opposed a number of the overhauls carried out by the administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto, including education and energy, but favors the continuation of Nafta. Mexican presidents are limited by law to a single six-year term.\nA López Obrador administration would respect any Nafta agreements reached before the election, and would want to be kept informed of the talks during the transition period if he wins, said Graciela Márquez, a Harvard-educated economist who would be Mr. López Obrador’s economy minister.\n“Nafta is a state affair that goes beyond López Obrador or Peña Nieto,” Ms. Márquez said last month in an interview. “It’s about the future of the country.”\nWrite to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com and Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com",
