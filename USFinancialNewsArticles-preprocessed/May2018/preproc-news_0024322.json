    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cellect Biotechnology Ltd. (Nasdaq: APOP), a developer of a novel stem cell manufacturing technology, announced that it will open a U.S. center of operations to be led by Andrew Sabatier.\nMr. Sabatier has over 20 years of experience in the Biotechnology/Life Sciences market, most recently with GE Cell Therapy, as the Sales and Market Development Leader for the US and Canada.\nPrior to GE, from 2010 to 2017, Mr. Sabatier was the VP of Sales of BIOSAFE America, which was acquired by GE. He was responsible for creating the foundation committed to developing the cell processing market, which became the largest market for BIOSAFE, and is currently the cornerstone of GE's cell therapy business. He has managed U.S. commercial operations and built, trained and developed international sales teams across Asia, South America, Europe, Canada, and the United States. Prior to joining BIOSAFE, Mr. Sabatier served in sales roles with Independent Health Care Consulting, Gambro, Genzyme, Cook Medical and Toshiba. He is the winner of multiple awards and holds a Bachelor of Arts and International Relations degree from the Boston University, MA.\n\"Cellect is a leader in Regenerative Medicine enabling technology,\" commented Mr. Sabatier; \"We see an upcoming surge in demand for stem cells as raw material for a wide range of soon to be FDA approved novel therapies. It is a multi-billion-dollar potential business and a new industry in the making. I am happy to be a part of this journey to bring 21 st century remedies to millions of patients worldwide.\"\nStem cells are the building blocks and raw material of 21 st century regenerative medicine enabling a world where damaged tissues and organs may be replaced and regenerated rather than fixed with drugs, radiation and surgery. However, up to 50 percent of stem cell transplant procedures, such as bone marrow transplants and others, result in life-threatening rejection disease and other immune responses such as Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD). Collect's technology aims at turning stem cell transplantations into an efficient, safe and affordable procedure by reducing the associated severe side effects and simplifying the process. While novel cell-therapy treatments show great promise, scalability of such treatments at a safe, simple and affordable cost structure remains a challenge.\nAbout Cellect Biotechnology Ltd.\nCellect Biotechnology (NASDAQ: APOP) has developed a breakthrough technology for the selection of stem cells from any given tissue that aims to improve a variety of stem cell-based therapies.\nThe Company's technology is expected to provide research, hospitals and pharma companies with the tools to rapidly isolate stem cells in quantity and quality allowing stem cell-based treatments and procedures in a wide variety of applications in regenerative medicine. The current clinical trial is aimed at bone marrow transplantations in cancer treatment.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements about the Company's expectations, beliefs and intentions.
