    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 12:39 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Sovereign investor flows to global markets turn net positive in Q1 Claire Milhench 3 Min Read\nLONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth fund (SWF) flows to stock and bond strategies managed by external asset managers turned net positive in the first quarter for the first time since 2014, data from research firm eVestment showed on Tuesday.\nA net $4.3 billion was placed with third-party fund managers by sovereign investors in the first three months of 2018 compared with a net outflow of $8.3 billion in fourth quarter 2017, ending 14 consecutive quarters of net outflows.\nThe figures from eVestment, which collates data from about 4,400 firms managing money on behalf of institutional investors, showed that allocations to non-U.S. passive equity strategies were the main driver of the change.\nIn total, this segment attracted net inflows of $6.6 billion, with passively-managed European equity strategies attracting $5.6 billion and passive global emerging markets equity pulling in a net $4.2 billion.\n“This is a more positive set of data for those servicing SWF investors, however the dominant preference for passive exposure is not necessarily a positive for active managers,” said Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment.\nEurope and emerging market equities attracted investors in the first quarter following gains in 2017, with European stocks up 7.6 percent and emerging markets up 34.3 percent.\nData from other segments were less encouraging, with global equity strategies suffering net outflows of $3.1 billion in total, while global fixed income lost $987 million overall.\nLaurelli noted that only 38.8 percent of products reported net inflows from SWF investors, although this was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2016’s 40.6 percent.\nThe last time third-party fund managers enjoyed net inflows from their SWF clients was the second quarter of 2014, with $7.3 billion. In subsequent quarters, a combination of low oil prices, low bond yields and volatile equity markets prompted sovereign investors to pull money from listed securities.\nSome rainy-day SWFs were tapped by governments to fill budget gaps, whilst others sought better returns in unlisted infrastructure, private equity or real estate investments.\nHowever, oil prices have recovered from a January 2016 low of under $30 a barrel to almost $80, the highest since late 2014, as supply has tightened. Meanwhile, some SWFs are thought to be hitting the upper limit on their allocations to private markets. (Reporting by Claire Milhench; Editing by Mark Potter)",
