As compared to the comparable quarter in 2017, the prices of both oil and natural gas and the volume of oil produced and included in the current distribution have increased while the volume of natural gas produced and included in the current distribution has decreased.\nMarine's distributions to unitholders are determined by royalties received up to the date the distribution amount is declared.
