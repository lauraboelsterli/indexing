She brings more than three decades of legal expertise and will be a tremendous addition to the executive leadership team at Fifth Third Bank,” Carmichael said. “In addition to her extensive background in financial services and regulatory affairs, she understands the power of a positive client experience. This makes her a great fit for Fifth Third.”\nCarmichael added, “We’re sad to see Jelena go, but this is a great opportunity to lead an important agency, one that maintains the stability and public confidence in our nation’s financial system. We’re thankful for Jelena’s many contributions to Fifth Third, leading our legal division and providing valuable counsel to me, our executive team and our board. With her skill, work ethic, intellect and vast experience, I know Jelena will do an excellent job leading the FDIC.”\nZaunbrecher joined Dinsmore in 1990. There, she provided counsel on transactions, mergers and acquisitions, compliance matters and securities law.

She is a member of the Ohio Bar Association and is active with numerous civic and professional organizations, including the Cincinnati Bar Association, UC Economic Center for Education and Research, United Way Tocqueville Society, Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park and Cincinnati ArtsWave.\n“It’s an exciting time to join Fifth Third,” Zaunbrecher said, “and I look forward to making immediate contributions to the team.”\nAbout Fifth Third\nFifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio.
