    "text": "LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Sterling strengthened and stocks edged lower on Thursday after data showed British retail sales jumped by its most in one-and-a half years in April.\nThe British currency extended gains to rise half a percent on the day at $1.3419 compared to $1.3385 earlier as retail sales volumes rose by 1.6 percent from March, well above the median forecast for a monthly 0.7 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists.\nGovernment bond futures extended losses by 15 ticks to hit 122.05, down 25 ticks on the day.\nBritainâ€™s FTSE 100 fell, and was down 0.1 percent after the better retail sales data boosted sterling, a negative for the index whose constituents mainly earn in foreign currencies.
