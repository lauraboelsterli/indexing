The second 8-K stated that Chioini had been terminated, and that due to the filing of an unauthorized 8-K by Chioini and CFO Thomas Klema, the Board had voted to remove Klema from his roles at the Company. In a press release issued May 24, 2018, the Company stated that Chioini was terminated following “a thorough review of the business” and the determination that “Mr. Chioini lacked key attributes necessary to oversee the growth and long-term success of the Company…” To obtain additional information, go to :\nhttp://www.zlk.com/pslra-d/rockwell-medical-inc\nor contact Joseph E.
