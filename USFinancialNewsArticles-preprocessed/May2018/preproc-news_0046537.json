    "text": "(Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn filed a lawsuit on Monday against AmTrust Financial Services Inc ( AFSI.O ) and the family that controls the company, accusing them of trying to take the insurer private at the wrong time and at the wrong price.\nFILE PHOTO: Billionaire activist-investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York, U.S. on February 11, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The lawsuit filed in the Court of Delaware accuses Karfunkel-Zyskind family of engaging in a transaction which will transfer \"huge amounts of value\" belonging to the companyâ€™s public stockholders to the controlling family. ( bit.ly/2wZY5Fq )\nEarlier on Monday Czech-based Arca Capital, which own 2.4 percent of total outstanding shares of AmTrust, said it plans to work with Carl Icahn and other minority shareholders in opposing the proposed privatization transaction.\nIcahn had disclosed a 9.38 percent stake in AmTrust on May 17. ( reut.rs/2rTg0sv )\nOn March 1, AmTrust said it would be acquired in a $2.7 billion deal by a group of shareholders including its founding family, chief executive officer and private equity funds - a move that Icahn has strongly opposed.\nReporting by Diptendu Lahiri in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr and Shailesh Kuber\n ",
