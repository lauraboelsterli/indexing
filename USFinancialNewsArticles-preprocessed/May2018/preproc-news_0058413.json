May 25, 2018; Bronx, NY, USA; New York Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres (25) hits a solo home run against the Los Angeles Angels during the seventh inning at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports\nTorres electrified a sellout crowd when he lifted a 3-1 fastball by Jim Johnson (2-2) into the right-center field seats. It was his fifth homer in six games and ninth since making his major league debut April 22. At 21 years, 163 days, Torres became the youngest player in American League history to homer in four straight games and fourth youngest in the majors to do so, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\nTorres drove in both runs for the Yankees, who won for the 23rd time in 29 games and for the 14th time in their last 16 home games.\nMike Trout homered for the Angels, who fell to 16-6 on the road. Shohei Ohtani, who spurned the Yankees to sign with the Angels in the offseason, heard boos before each plate appearance and went 0-for-3, though he narrowly missed hitting a go-ahead two-run homer off Aroldis Chapman in the eighth.\nPirates 8, Cardinals 1\nJoe Musgrove, making his Pittsburgh and 2018 debut, pitched seven shutout innings and Francisco Cervelli hit a three-run double in a win over visiting St. Louis.\nJosh Harrison was 2-for-5 with two RBIs for Pittsburgh, which had lost five of its previous six games. St. Louis fell to 4-8 in its past 12.\nMusgrove (1-0) had been on the disabled list because of a right shoulder strain dating to spring training. He was part of a trade that sent Gerrit Cole to Houston in the offseason. In his seven innings, Musgrove scattered five hits and needed just 67 pitches, 50 of them strikes.\nRed Sox 6, Braves 2\nMookie Betts hit a two-run blast for his major league-leading 17th home run and Eduardo Rodriguez struck out seven over 5 2/3 innings of two-run ball as host Boston beat Atlanta.\nJ.D. Martinez, Xander Bogaerts and Mitch Moreland added solo homers for Boston, which has won seven of its last nine games. Martinez’s fourth-inning homer tied him with Betts before he went deep in the seventh.\nNick Markakis drove in two runs for the Braves, who have lost two straight after dropping two of three games at Philadelphia. Atlanta’s three-game weekend series against Boston marks its first trip to Fenway Park since 2016.\nAstros 11, Indians 2\nWhat started as a matchup of recent Cy Young winners Corey Kluber and Dallas Keuchel was determined by the bullpens as Houston rallied in a big way to trounce host Cleveland at Progressive Field.\nHeld scoreless by Kluber and reliever Andrew Miller for seven innings, the Astros erupted for four runs in the eighth and seven more in the ninth.\nThe American League West-leading Astros won their fifth in a row and their 10th in 12 games. The Indians remained in first place in the AL Central, although they dropped one game below .500. The Astros also improved to 4-1 against the Indians this season, with two more games to play in this weekend’s series.\nNationals 9, Marlins 5\nMax Scherzer earned his major league-leading eighth win as Washington defeated Miami at Marlins Park.\nScherzer (8-1) allowed season highs with seven hits and four earned runs while striking out just four as his ERA rose from 1.78 to 2.13. Fortunately for the Nationals, their offense came through with two-run homers by Michael A. Taylor and Matt Adams. Bryce Harper hit a two-run double in Washington’s game-winning seventh-inning rally.\nMarlins starter Jose Urena earned a no-decision but continued his misery. After going 14-7 in a breakout 2017 season, Urena (0-7) leads the majors in losses, and the Marlins are 0-11 when he starts. May 25, 2018; Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Pittsburgh Pirates starting pitcher Joe Musgrove (59) singles for his first major league hit against the St. Louis Cardinals during the sixth inning at PNC Park. Pittsburgh won 8-1. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\nBrewers 4, Mets 3 (10 innings)\nTravis Shaw capped a big night by drawing a bases-loaded walk in the 10th inning as host Milwaukee earned a win over New York at Miller Park.\nShaw had three hits and reached base four times in five plate appearances for the Brewers. He hit a second-inning homer and a third-inning RBI single that scored Milwaukee’s final run until the 10th inning. The Brewers have won seven of nine.\nMichael Conforto and Amed Rosario hit solo homers for the Mets while Asdrubal Cabrera had three hits but was thrown out trying to extend his 10th-inning single into a double. The Mets lost for the third time in four games.\nRockies 5, Reds 4\nNolan Arenado homered, Noel Cuevas had a go-ahead pinch-hit triple and Colorado overcame an early deficit to beat visiting Cincinnati at Coors Field.\nJon Gray (5-6) survived a shaky start to get his first win in three outings and Wade Davis pitched the ninth for his 18th save, tied for tops in the majors. The Rockies rallied from three runs down early to take the lead in the sixth. Tony Wolters led off with a walk and Cuevas hit a one-out triple into the right field corner to give Colorado the lead.\nEugenio Suarez homered among his two hits for the Reds, who had won two of their last three.\nTigers 5, White Sox 4\nNicholas Castellanos had three hits and scored the go-ahead run during a three-run eighth as host Detroit edged Chicago.\nCastellanos scored two runs and knocked in another during his fifth consecutive multi-hit game. Leonys Martin had two hits, two runs scored and an RBI. Jose Iglesias added two hits, a walk and a run scored. Buck Farmer (1-3) pitched an inning of scoreless relief to get the win. Shane Greene pitched the ninth for his 12th save.\nTim Anderson had three hits, including a solo home run, and drove in two runs for Chicago. Jose Abreu supplied two hits, a run scored and an RBI. White Sox starter Reynaldo Lopez gave up two runs on five hits over seven innings.\nBlue Jays 6, Phillies 5\nSam Gaviglio pitched six strong innings, Justin Smoak hit a two-run homer and visiting Toronto held on to defeat host Philadelphia at Citizens Bank Park.\nGaviglio (2-0) allowed three runs, three hits (including two home runs), and two walks while striking out six in his second start since being recalled from Triple-A Buffalo. Ryan Tepera picked up his first save of the season despite allowing one run, a single, a double, two walks and a wild pitch in a hairy ninth inning.\nEflin (1-1) allowed six runs (five earned), nine hits and one walk in 4 2/3 innings. The right-hander struck out seven. The Phillies had home runs from Eflin and Carlos Santana in the opener of a three-game interleague series.\nOrioles 2, Rays 0\nJonathan Schoop hit a solo home run and David Hess threw 6 2/3 shutout innings in his third major league start as visiting Baltimore defeated Tampa Bay at Tropicana Field. Slideshow (13 Images)\nHess (2-1) allowed four hits with three strikeouts and three walks. He escaped a few jams, the worst coming in the fifth when Mallex Smith walked and moved to third with no outs thanks to a balk and Schoop’s error while trying to catch a pickoff throw. However, Hess retired the next three batters on groundouts and did not allow a run.\nThe Rays, experimenting with a new strategy the past week, started right-handed relief pitcher Sergio Romo for the third time in seven days with the expectation that he would last no more than an inning or two as Baltimore has several right-handed power hitters up top. But Romo couldn’t finish the first inning, giving up a run on two hits. Romo also is going to start Sunday, with reliever Ryne Stanek set to start on Saturday.\nRangers 8, Royals 4\nNomar Mazara homered and drove in three runs as host Texas knocked off Kansas City.\nThe Rangers evened the four-game series at Globe Life Park at a game apiece. Texas hit three home runs, all off Kansas City starter Eric Skoglund (1-5). Rangers starter Mike Minor (4-3) was the beneficiary of the power surge against his former team after working six innings and allowing four runs on seven hits.\nThe Royals had their season-high three-game winning streak, all coming on the road, snapped. Kansas City also lost for the ninth time in its last 10 games at Texas’ park.\nMariners 2, Twins 1\nJames Paxton continued his impressive month of May, allowing one run in seven innings as Seattle defeated visiting Minnesota at Safeco Field.\nPaxton (4-1) allowed three hits, didn’t walk a batter and struck out 11, the fourth time this season he has reached double digits. The left-hander improved to 3-0 this month, in which he’s had a career-high 16-strikeout game (May 2 vs. Oakland), pitched a no-hitter (May 8 at Toronto) and a three-hitter (May 19 vs. Detroit).\nMitch Haniger broke a 1-1 tie in the sixth inning with a run-scoring single. That helped give the Mariners their 14th one-run victory of the season, most in the major leagues.\nDodgers 4, Padres 1\nMatt Kemp and Enrique Hernandez each hit home runs as Los Angeles defeated visiting San Diego for its seventh victory in its past eight games.\nRoss Stripling (2-1), in just his fifth start of the season, gave up one run on six hits while striking out 10 over 6 2/3 innings. It was his career high in strikeouts, besting the nine he had while defeating Washington on Saturday in the opener of a doubleheader. Kemp had three hits to go along with his three RBIs, raising his batting average to .338.\nJose Pirela had three hits for the Padres, who went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position while falling to 11-11 in the month of May.\nDiamondbacks 7, Athletics 1\nNick Ahmed hit Sean Manaea’s seventh pitch of the game for a home run and later contributed an RBI single to a three-run fourth inning, sending Arizona on its way to victory over Oakland in the opener of a three-game interleague series in Oakland, Calif.\nLeft-hander Patrick Corbin (5-1) allowed two or fewer runs for the fourth time in five starts this month, limiting the A’s to four hits and one run in seven innings and helping the Diamondbacks snap a seven-game losing streak.\nMark Canha homered for Oakland’s only run. Manaea (5-5) was charged with six runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out two.\nCubs 6, Giants 2\nBen Zobrist broke a tie with a two-run double and Kris Bryant followed two batters later with a two-run single, powering a four-run seventh inning that sent Chicago to a victory over San Francisco in the opener of a three-game series at Wrigley Field.\nKyle Hendricks (4-3) limited the Giants to two hits and one run over seven innings for the Cubs, who busted out after having been held to one run in two games by Cleveland earlier in the week.\nGorkys Hernandez homered for the Giants, who have scored just five runs in three games on a trip that began with a pair of losses in Houston. San Francisco lost for the ninth time in its last 10 road games.\n—Field Level Media",
