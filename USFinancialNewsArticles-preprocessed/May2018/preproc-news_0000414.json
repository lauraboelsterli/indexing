I was pleased to see several businesses with solid performance, including high single-digit growth in travel allied and double-digit growth in both our education healthcare staffing and physician and executive search businesses. Advantage RN had another quarter of strong sequential growth of nurses on assignment at our Managed Services Programs,” said William J. Grubbs, President and Chief Executive Officer. “This positive start supports our full year financial goals although we still have some work to do to return our travel nurse business to run rates we experienced prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, which we expect to occur in the second half of 2018,” he continued.\nFirst quarter consolidated revenue was $210.3 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year and a decrease of 4% sequentially.

Though the Company does not provide full year guidance, organic growth for the full year and continued margin improvements are expected based on continued favorable market conditions and demand for its services. In addition to the normal operating leverage from anticipated revenue growth, the Company will be undertaking actions to further align its cost structure for improved profitability towards achieving its near-term goal of an 8% Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nQ2 2018 Range Year-over-Year Sequential Change Change Revenue $206 million - $211 million (2)% - 1% (2)% - -% Gross profit margin 25.7% - 26.2% (130) - (80) bps 10 - 60 bps Adjusted EBITDA $8.5 million - $9.5 million (22)% - (13)% 1% - 13% Adjusted EPS $0.04 - $0.06 $(0.12) - $(0.10) $(0.02) - $0.00 The estimates above are based on current management expectations and, as such, are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.

(b) Acquisition and integration costs are primarily related to integration-related costs for the Advantage RN, LLC acquisition that closed effective July 1, 2017. (c) Restructuring costs related to severance and lease consolidations incurred as part of separate and discrete cost savings initiatives. (d) Impairment charges (noncash) in the three months ended December 31, 2017 of $14.4 million ($12.1 million after taxes) related to goodwill and trade names of Physician Staffing. (e) Gain on derivative liability for the three months ended March 31, 2018 represents the change in the fair value of embedded features of the Convertible Notes up until their repayment. (f) Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is related to the Company's settlement of its convertible notes on March 17, 2017. (g) Income tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is primarily a result of a release of valuation allowances on the Company’s deferred tax assets totaling $42.5 million, offset by an $8.0 million reduction in the Company’s net deferred tax assets (relating to the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). (h) When applying the if-converted method to our Convertible Notes, 2,934,271 shares were included in diluted weighted average shares for the three months ended March 31, 2017. (i) Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measure, is defined as net income attributable to common shareholders before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges, gain on derivative liability, loss on early extinguishment of debt, other income, net, equity compensation, and includes net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiary. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Management presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes and as one performance measure in its incentive programs for certain members of its management team. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, closely matches the operating measure typically used in the Company's credit facilities in calculating various ratios. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by the Company's consolidated revenue. (j) Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders per diluted share before the diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges, gain on derivative liability, loss on early extinguishment of debt, and nonrecurring income tax adjustments. Adjusted EPS should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Management presents Adjusted EPS because it believes that Adjusted EPS is a useful supplement to its reported EPS as an indicator of operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EPS as one performance measure in its annual cash incentive program for certain members of its management team. Management believes it provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance from period to period and is more representative of the future earnings capacity of the Company. (k) Due to the Company previously maintaining a full valuation allowance, there was no tax impact on non-GAAP measures with the exception of the impact of impairment charges on goodwill. (l) Segment data provided is in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the FASB ASC. (m) Contribution income is defined as income or loss from operations before depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges, and corporate expenses not specifically identified to a reporting segment. Contribution income is a financial measure used by management when assessing segment performance. (n) Unallocated corporate overhead includes corporate compensation and benefits, and general and administrative expenses including rent and utilities, computer supplies and expenses, insurance, professional expenses, corporate-wide projects (initiatives), and public company expense. (o) Gross profit is defined as revenue from services less direct operating expenses. The Company's gross profit excludes allocated depreciation and amortization expense. Gross profit margin is calculated by dividing gross profit by revenue from services. (p) FTEs represent the average number of Nurse and Allied Staffing contract personnel on a full-time equivalent basis. (q) Average revenue per FTE per day is calculated by dividing the Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue per FTE by the number of days worked in the respective periods. Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue also includes revenue from the permanent placement of nurses. (r) Days filled is calculated by dividing the total hours invoiced during the period, including an estimate for the impact of accrued revenue, by 8 hours. Prior periods have been recalculated to include the impact of the accrued revenue. (s) Revenue per day filled is calculated by dividing revenue as reported by days filled for the period presented. Prior periods have been recalculated to include the impact of the accrued revenue and days.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006533/en/\nCross Country Healthcare, Inc.\nWilliam J.
