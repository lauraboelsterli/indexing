A man holds a candle outside the JSW mine where coal miners are missing underground after a strong quake hit the mine on Saturday in Jastrzebie Zdroj, Poland May 7, 2018. Agencja Gazeta/Dominik Gajda via REUTERS\nThe Zofiowka mine in southern Poland was hit by an earthquake on May 5, initially trapping seven miners. Two were rescued early last week.\n“The (last) miner’s body was trapped under one of many structures in the destroyed pit,” JSW, the European Union’s biggest coking coal producer, said in a statement.\nAbout 1,000 people were involved in the rescue effort.\nAbout 250 people were working underground at the time of the quake. The missing miners were in a team drilling a new tunnel.\nThe quake of magnitude ranging from 3.5 to 4.0 was the strongest recorded in the mine, officials said.\nAround 83,000 people work in Poland’s coal mining sector. Fifteen people died in mining-related accidents in 2017. Reporting by Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Clarence Fernandez",
