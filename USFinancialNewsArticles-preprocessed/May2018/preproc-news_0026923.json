    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass., May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:EYEG) (“EyeGate” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage, specialty pharmaceutical company with two proprietary platform technologies for treating diseases and disorders of the eye, today announced financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and provided an update on recent corporate and operational activities.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Business Highlights:\nAnnounced completion of an $11.25 Million Public Offering Granted new patent for Iontophoretic Contact Lens Technology Received milestone payment for Confirmatory Phase 3 Clinical Study of EGP-437 in Anterior Uveitis with the fulfillment of enrollment Completed submission of Investigation Device Exemption (IDE) Amendment and received feedback on Second Pilot Study of Ocular Bandage Gel (EyeGate OBG) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Participated in the 30 th Annual ROTH Conference, as well as the BIO CEO & Investor Conference\n“During the first quarter of 2018, we were able to reinforce our core platforms at EyeGate with several strategic accomplishments, as well as operational achievements that help solidify our direction moving forward,” said Stephen From, President and Chief Executive Officer of EyeGate Pharmaceuticals.\n“Regarding EyeGate’s clinical operations,” Mr. From continued, “Our clinical story has advanced with the submission of the investigation device exemption (IDE) amendment for the second pilot study of ocular bandage gel (EyeGate OBG), which summarized the company’s response to the original IDE. The clarity provided by the FDA’s response will help EyeGate move forward with an essential second pilot study for our lead product. This combined with our extensive patent profile will allow EyeGate to continue the development pathway that has already been outlined.”\nMr. From also commented, “We continue to advance our clinical programs, and with several significant upcoming milestones, we are striving towards our core objectives of improving patients’ lives and increasing shareholder value.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Review\nEyeGate’s revenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1.096 million, compared with $0.185 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase of revenue generated is attributable to the Valeant milestone payments earned during the first quarter of 2018.\nEyeGate’s net loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $2.38 million, compared with $2.92 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were $2.521 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $1.815 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase of $0.706 million was primarily due to increases in clinical and other activity related to EGP-437, including the Phase 3 trial for the treatment of anterior uveitis, as well as related work for Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC).\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $0.954 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $1.289 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease of $0.335 million was primarily due to decreases in personnel-related costs, as well as lower professional fees incurred during the first quarter of 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 totaled $3.65 million, compared with $7.81 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to cash outflows to fund the Company’s operations.\nAbout EyeGate\nEyeGate is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products using its two proprietary platform technologies for treating diseases and disorders of the eye.\nEyeGate’s CMHA-S platform is based on a cross-linked thiolated carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid (CMHA-S), a modified form of the natural polymer hyaluronic acid (HA), which is a gel that possesses unique physical and chemical properties such as hydrating and healing when applied to the ocular surface. The ability of CMHA-S to adhere longer to the ocular surface, resist degradation and protect the ocular surface makes it well-suited for treating various ocular surface injuries.\nEGP-437, EyeGate’s other product in clinical trials, incorporates a reformulated, topically active corticosteroid, Dexamethasone Phosphate, that is delivered into the ocular tissues through EyeGate’s proprietary innovative drug delivery system, the EyeGate II Delivery System.
