    "text": "SUMMIT, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) today announced that the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $3 billion of the Company's common stock. In addition, the Company plans to enter into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase an aggregate of $2 billion of the Company’s common stock.
