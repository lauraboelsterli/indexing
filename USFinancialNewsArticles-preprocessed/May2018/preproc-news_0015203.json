    "text": "May 4, 2018 / 10:05 PM / in 13 hours U.S. lawmakers set $717 billion defence bill with eye on China, Russia, Turkey Patricia Zengerle 3 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers released details on Friday of a $717 billion (£530.2 billion) annual defence policy bill, including efforts to compete with Russia and China and a measure to temporarily halt weapons sales to Turkey.

Turkey supported the U.S. fight against Islamic State, but has become increasingly worried about U.S. backing for Kurdish fighters in Syria.\nThe NDAA is several steps from becoming law. The final version of the legislation will be a compromise reached later this year by House and Senate negotiators between separate versions of the bill approved in the two chambers.
