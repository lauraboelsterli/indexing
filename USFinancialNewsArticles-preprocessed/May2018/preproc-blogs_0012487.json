Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. As businesses turn to artificial intelligence to drive cars and approve bank loans, it’s only a matter of time before firms, regulators and consumers begin to wonder how AI makes the decisions it does. Executives at companies such as Uber Technologies Inc . and the research and development arm of Xerox Corp . are investing in an area of AI research called “interpretability,” an effort to understand exactly how complex AI systems solve problems, CIO Journal’s Sara Castellanos writes .\n“It’s a really fruitful area of research, and it’s been massively neglected,” said Zoubin Ghahramani, chief scientist at Uber, during an AI conference this week. Uber and Xerox aren’t alone. The research arm of the U.S. Department of Defense is coordinating an effort to build “explainable AI” systems that can translate decisions into language humans can understand. Capital One Financial Corp. is also researching explainable AI, which could have far-reaching impacts in guarding against potential bias, or ethical and regulatory breaches.\nNot every problem will require a detailed level of explainability. Captioning images, for example, may require less clarification than an AI-driven medical diagnosis. Even so, the availability of explainable systems could influence the adoption of artificial intelligence in the enterprise. Regulations may lead the charge, but it’s likely that consumer demand for transparency could pressure firms to provide more explainability as well. “Self-driving cars will crash,” Michael Chui, a partner at McKinsey Global Institute, said on the sidelines of the MIT Digital Economy Conference last week. “Someone will ask why that happened, and ‘a million integers’ is unsatisfying.”\nPodcast: Blockchain as Lie Detector.
