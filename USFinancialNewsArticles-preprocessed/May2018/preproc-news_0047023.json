REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\nThe Belgian movie was warmly received, with Variety saluting “a stunning debut for both director Lukas Dhont and star Victor Polster”.\nPolster, a cisgender boy and trained ballet dancer, won the prize for best performance in the Un Certain Regard section of the festival, a separate competition from the main Palme d’Or race.\nThe jury for the Queer Palme — an unofficial prize that was set up in 2010 — makes its choice from a shortlist of all the films showing in the festival’s various categories that touch on LGBT themes.\nThis year there were 16 films in the running, twice the average, according to the competition’s founder, Franck Finance-Madureira, who said there was not just a large quantity of LGBT films, but also more sophisticated depictions of gay life than is often the case.\n“We’ve got a thriller, a love story, a teen portrait, but the LGBT content is not central, it’s one of the elements,” he told Reuters.\nAmong the Queer Palme contenders were Yann Gonzalez’s “Knife + Heart”, about a gay porn producer played by Vanessa Paradis, and “Rafiki”, a love story between two women and the festival’s first Kenyan entry, which has been banned at home.
