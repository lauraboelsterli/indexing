    "text": "TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices were little changed across the board on Wednesday, as a retreat by U.S. Treasuries neutralised support from the Bank of Japan’s regular debt-buying operation.\nThe five-year JGB yield rose half a basis point to minus 0.105 percent.\nThe 10-year and 20-year yields were unchanged at 0.045 percent and 0.525 percent, respectively.\nTreasury prices fell and the benchmark 10-year yield climbed towards the 3 percent threshold as crude oil prices rallied to a 3-1/2-year high after the U.S. abandoned an international nuclear deal with Iran, likely curbing the OPEC-member’s crude exports in an already tight market.\nThe BOJ on Wednesday offered to buy 1.03 trillion yen ($9.41 billion) of one- to 10-year JGBs as part of its regular debt-purchasing scheme. ($1 = 109.4700 yen) (Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sunil Nair)\n ",
