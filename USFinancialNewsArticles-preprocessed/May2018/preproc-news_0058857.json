    "text": "RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Access National Bank (“Access”) has promoted Tom Ciolkosz to Senior Vice President, Relationship Manager, to continue fostering the growth of the Bank’s nonprofit and trade association segment.\n“Access differentiates itself in the market by working as a ‘trusted business advisor’ for prospects, clients and business referral partners,” Ciolkosz said. “I invest time acquainting myself with my clients’ unique needs, offer referral sources and ultimately partner with them in helping to grow their business. It’s rewarding to work for a bank who values cultivating meaningful relationships within our communities.”\nCiolkosz joined Access in 2011 as Vice President, Client Services Manager. During his tenure, he expanded his relationship management skills to the nonprofit and trade association segment, eventually becoming the segment team leader. He routinely works in conjunction with other segments such as accounting firms, government contractors, and companies with $200 million+ in revenue. Additionally, he is further honing his banking industry knowledge by serving in his second year at the Virginia Bankers School of Bank Management.\nIn addition to his robust bank duties, Ciolkosz serves numerous local organizations in either a membership or directorial capacity. Some of his participation includes the Board of Directors for Greater Washington Society of CPAs (GWSCPA), Loudoun Hunger Relief, and Brain Injury Services; Town of Lovettsville Planning Commission Chairperson; and membership with the American Society of Association Executives and the FAR Network.\n“Tom’s promotion reflects the significant contributions he has made to the Bank’s strategic focus on better serving our nonprofit and trade association clients,” Michael Clarke, CEO of Access, said. “His industry knowledge has proven to be an invaluble asset to both the Bank and the clients who benefit from his expertise.”\n“Tom earned this title with his diligent work over the past seven years,” Cindy Caldwell, SVP, Client Services at Access said. “He works with all business lines to grow deposits, loans, and investments. I am looking forward to watching his contributions and leadership evolve as our Bank continues this next chapter of 2018 and beyond.”\nAccess National Bank was founded in 1999 by professional bankers and business people. It is an independent, nationally-chartered bank based in Reston, Virginia that serves the Greater Washington DC Metropolitan area. In April 2017, the merger with Middleburg Bank (founded in 1924) was completed, creating Virginia’s premier bank with enhanced scale, improved efficiency and a well-diversified business model. Access National Bank is a subsidiary of Access National Corporation and trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “ANCX.” Additional information is available at AccessNationalBank.com .
