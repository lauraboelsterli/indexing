View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530005842/en/\nHelios and Matheson Analytics Launches MoviePass Films™ (Photo: Business Wire)\nHelios also announced today that it has formed MoviePass Films LLC (“MoviePass Films”) with Emmett Furla Oasis Films (“EFO Films”). Helios owns 51% and EFO Films owns 49% of MoviePass Films. MoviePass Films will focus on studio-driven content and new film production for theatrical release and other distribution channels. Hollywood veterans Randall Emmett and George Furla will serve as Co-CEO’s of MoviePass Films; MoviePass Films’ Chairman of the Board will be Ted Farnsworth. Mitch Lowe will hold a Board seat as well, and Farnsworth and Lowe will work together day-to-day to execute the strategy between MoviePass and MoviePass Films. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, however both parties agreed on a payment in the form cash and stock.\nHelios plans to capitalize on the unique capabilities of its subsidiary, MoviePass Inc. (“MoviePass”), to market future MoviePass Films productions to millions of MoviePass subscribers and moviegoers everywhere. MoviePass Films will pay MoviePass for any marketing services provided to market MoviePass Films productions. MoviePass Films will own and control all revenue streams from theatrical release, domestic and foreign distribution rights, streaming, retail, DVD sales, transactional sales, etc.\n“To have such a well-known, quality production company join forces with the Helios/MoviePass group of companies is truly remarkable,” said Mitch Lowe, MoviePass’ CEO. “Since we began disrupting the movie industry with our unprecedented low-cost movie theater subscription service, MoviePass™, we have envisioned owning and developing our own studio content and using the power of our several million subscribers to bolster the success of the box office for our films. I believe MoviePass Films will accelerate those efforts and demonstrate the power of MoviePass to drive movie theater attendance and downstream sales, for the benefit of moviegoers, movie theaters, studios and the film entertainment ecosystem as a whole,” concluded Mr. Lowe.\nHelios believes its acquisition of the current production slate of EFO Films and the leadership of MoviePass Films by veteran producers Randall Emmett and George Furla will accelerate Helios’ plan to produce its own movies for theatrical release, create new revenue opportunities for MoviePass’ marketing services, fill theater seats throughout the United States for MoviePass Films productions to the benefit of exhibitors, and enable MoviePass Films to participate in box office and downstream revenues from its proprietary content.\n“To do a deal with Helios and MoviePass is epic for us,” said Randall Emmett of EFO Films. The MoviePass™ subscription service has totally disrupted the movie industry, for the better. When we worked with MoviePass Ventures on the movie Gotti, starring John Travolta, which premiered at Cannes and is set for release this coming June 15 – I immediately saw how revolutionary the MoviePass™ service is. I have never seen any player in our industry move so quickly and gain such a large following in such a short period of time. What impresses me the most is that MoviePass can guarantee box office attendance, which is a game changer. I don’t believe anybody else can do that,” concluded Mr. Emmett.\n“Ever since we co-acquired our first film with MoviePass Ventures, American Animals, which is set for release June 1, we’ve been looking for an opportunity to acquire and produce studio content on a larger scale and prove the power of the MoviePass™ service in the process. We believe we’ve found that opportunity with Emmett Furla Oasis Films. Along with MoviePass Films, MoviePass Ventures, our studio driven production company and our independent film investment division, will play an integral role in our business strategy,” said Ted Farnsworth, Chairman and CEO of Helios. “We believe the track record of Randall Emmett and George Furla over the last twenty years speaks for itself. For MoviePass to have the opportunity to jump in the middle of new high-caliber productions that are already underway, becoming a part of that, is more exciting for Helios and MoviePass than I ever could have imagined,” concluded Mr. Farnsworth.\nAbout MoviePass Inc.\nMoviePass Inc.
