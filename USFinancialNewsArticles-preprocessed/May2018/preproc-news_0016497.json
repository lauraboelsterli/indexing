    "text": "NEW YORK, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stemline Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:STML), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel oncology therapeutics, announced today financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company also reviewed recent clinical and regulatory events, and outlined key upcoming milestones:\nSL-401 in Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN)\nIn April, we announced initiation of a rolling Biologics License Application (BLA) submission for SL-401, and expect to complete the rolling submission in 2Q18. If our BLA is successful, we anticipate possible U.S. approval of SL-401 in the 4Q18/1Q19 timeframe. In preparation for possible approval, we continue to build out our pre-launch and commercial activities. At the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, we are sponsoring a BPDCN disease awareness booth designed to continue to build awareness around BPDCN and CD123. We anticipate feedback from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding a potential regulatory filing in Europe, later this year.\nAdditional Clinical Trials\nSL-401 is also being evaluated in clinical trials in additional indications including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) [focused on chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelofibrosis (MF)], acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and multiple myeloma. We are evaluating possible registration-directed trial designs in CMML and MF given the results observed to date. Updates relating to these programs are expected later this year. SL-801: the Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors is ongoing, and dose escalation continues. Data from the SL-801 trial were selected for presentation at the upcoming ASCO meeting in June. SL-701: the Phase 2 trial in patients with second-line glioblastoma has completed. Data from the SL-701 trial were selected for presentation at the upcoming ASCO meeting in June.\nIvan Bergstein, MD, CEO of Stemline, commented “The initiation of our rolling BLA submission advances us ever closer to potential approval and commercialization of SL-401. We continue to build out our commercial infrastructure, including accelerating efforts to raise awareness around BPDCN and CD123. In parallel, we continue to pursue SL-401 in other CD123 positive malignancies and look forward to forging additional registrational opportunities. We expect clinical updates from each of our pipeline candidates this year - all with an eye towards achieving our goal of improving the lives of patients with cancer and building a leading biopharmaceutical company.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results Review\nStemline ended with $106.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, as compared to $66.2 million as of December 31, 2017, which reflects a cash increase of $40.0 million for the quarter. The $40.0 million increase in cash represents the $55.7 million in net cash proceeds received from the Company’s follow-on public offering during January 2018 offset by $15.7 million of net cash expenditures during the first quarter 2018. The Company ended with 30.2 million shares outstanding.\nFor , Stemline had a net loss of $18.4 million, or $0.69 per share, compared with a net loss of $14.6 million, or $0.67 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and development expense was $12.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $9.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $3.1 million. The higher costs are primarily driven by an increase in regulatory and manufacturing expenses in support of our BLA filing and potential commercialization of SL-401.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $5.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $5.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $0.5 million. The increase in expense was due to $0.9 million in higher pre-launch expenses in support of preparing for a potential commercialization of SL-401 in BPDCN, if marketing approval from the FDA is received. Additionally, the higher costs also resulted from a $0.9 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and increased headcount. Partially offsetting the higher costs was a decrease in legal expenses of $1.3 million.\nAbout BPDCN\nPlease visit the BPDCN disease awareness booth (#4125) at ASCO 2018 and www.bpdcninfo.com .\nAbout Stemline Therapeutics\nStemline Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel oncology therapeutics. Stemline is developing three clinical stage product candidates, SL-401, SL-801, and SL-701. SL-401 is a targeted therapy directed to the interleukin-3 receptor (CD123) present on a range of malignancies. SL-401 has completed a pivotal trial in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), for which it was granted breakthrough therapy designation (BTD). The pivotal trial met its primary endpoint, and a rolling Biologics License Application (BLA) submission has been initiated. SL-401 is also being evaluated in clinical trials in additional indications including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelofibrosis (MF), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myeloma. SL-801 is a novel oral small molecule reversible inhibitor of XPO1 that is currently in a Phase 1 trial of patients with advanced solid tumors; dose escalation is ongoing. SL-701, an immunotherapeutic, has completed a Phase 2 trial in patients with second-line glioblastoma; data and next steps for the program are being evaluated.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the statements included in this press release may be forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
