    "text": "May 29, 2018 / 9:52 AM / Updated 38 minutes ago Swiss bank UBS hires Britain's former EU commissioner as Brexit adviser Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - UBS ( UBSG.S ) has hired Britain’s former representative to the European Commission, Jonathan Hill, to advise corporate customers about Brexit, the Swiss bank said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Swiss bank UBS is seen at the company's headquarters in Zurich, February 10, 2015. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\nHill was until July 2016 the European Commissioner for financial stability, financial services and the capital markets union, working on the project to integrate Europe’s financial markets more closely.\nHe resigned from that role after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and has since been involved in setting up Prosperity UK, which aims to bring together business leaders both opposed to and in favour of Brexit.\nUBS said that former Conservative politician Hill’s experience working in British government and in Brussels will mean he can advise corporate customers on the implications of Brexit for their business.
