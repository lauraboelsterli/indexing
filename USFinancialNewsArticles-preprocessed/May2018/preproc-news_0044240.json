    "text": "May 19, 2018 / 7:42 PM / Updated 38 minutes ago Rallying - Neuville on course for Portugal victory and overall lead Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLISBON (Reuters) - Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville is set to retake the lead from France’s Sebastian Ogier in the world rally championship on Sunday after building up a commanding advantage on the penultimate day of Rally Portugal.\nThe Belgian, who was last top of the standings in February, goes into the final day 39.8 seconds clear of M-Sport Ford’s Elfyn Evans, with only five timed stages totalling 51km left to complete.\nOgier, who started the event with a 10-point lead in the championship, crashed his M-Sport Ford into trees on Friday afternoon.\nOther leading drivers, including Estonian Ott Tanak, who won the previous round in Argentina for Toyota, have also been sidelined after hitting rocks on the rough dirt roads near the Spanish border.\nHyundai’s Spanish driver Dani Sordo ended Saturday’s leg in third place.\nNeuville, who has won five stages so far, said: “We’ve had a very positive day and can be extremely satisfied with our position. That’s not to say we can relax because we have some tricky stages on Sunday.\n“We will need to remain concentrated because there are still five stages to go, and we’ve seen just what can happen here.” Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Neville Dalton",
