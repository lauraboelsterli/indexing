    "text": "TOKYO, May 1 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices rose on Tuesday, with recent gains in U.S. Treasuries and the Bank of Japan’s regular debt buying operation supporting the market.\nThe five-year and 10-year JGB yields declined by one basis point to minus 0.115 percent and 0.040 percent , respectively.\nThe 30-year year yield fell 1.5 basis points to 0.725 percent.\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which had climbed to a four-year high above 3 percent late last week, pulled back to 2.956 percent as a slew of data that missed expectations rekindled concerns about signs of slowing growth in the world’s largest economy.\nThe BOJ on Tuesday offered to buy 450 billion yen ($4.11 billion) of five- to 10-year JGBs as part of its regular debt-buying scheme. ($1 = 109.3800 yen) (Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath)\n ",
