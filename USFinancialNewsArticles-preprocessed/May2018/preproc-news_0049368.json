    "text": "Earnings before income taxes increased 20.7 percent, finishing at $37.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $30.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This marks our 11 th consecutive quarter of profit growth. Earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share were $0.49 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $0.43 in the same quarter of the prior year. Total revenues increased 8.2 percent, which consisted of organic revenue growth of 3.2 percent and an increase of 5.0 percent from foreign currency translation. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth. Earnings per diluted Class A Common Share guidance for the full year ending July 31, 2018 was tightened to a range of $1.95 to $2.00 from a previous range of $1.90 to $2.00, exclusive of tax charges primarily related to the enactment of the U.S. tax legislation.\nMILWAUKEE, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brady Corporation (NYSE:BRC) (“Brady” or “Company”), a world leader in identification solutions, today reported its financial results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended April 30, 2018.\nQuarter Ended April 30, 2018 Financial Results:\nEarnings before income taxes increased 20.7 percent, finishing at $37.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $30.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNet earnings for the quarter ended April 30, 2018, were $26.0 million compared to $22.6 million in the same quarter last year.\nEarnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share were $0.49 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $0.43 in the same quarter last year.\nSales for the quarter ended April 30, 2018 increased 8.2 percent to $298.4 million compared to $275.9 million in the same quarter last year. By segment, sales increased 7.8 percent in Identification Solutions and 9.1 percent in Workplace Safety, which consisted of organic sales growth of 3.7 percent in Identification Solutions and 1.7 percent in Workplace Safety.\nNine-Month Period Ended April 30, 2018 Financial Results:\nEarnings before income taxes increased 17.7 percent, finishing at $106.8 million for the nine-month period ended April 30, 2018, compared to $90.7 million in the same period last year.\nNet earnings for the nine-month period ended April 30, 2018 were $56.1 million compared to $70.4 million in the same period last year. During the nine-month period ended April 30, 2018, net earnings were reduced by $21.1 million due to tax charges primarily related to the passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The prior nine-month period ended April 30, 2017 was impacted by a cash repatriation which resulted in a lower than normal income tax rate.\nEarnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share were $1.07 for the nine-month period ended April 30, 2018, compared to $1.36 in the same period last year. Income tax expense in the prior nine-month period ended April 30, 2017 was impacted by a cash repatriation which increased earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share by approximately $0.09, whereas the impact on income tax expense for the nine-month period ended April 30, 2018 from tax charges primarily related to the enactment of U.S. tax legislation was a reduction of approximately $0.40 of earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share.\nSales for the nine-month period ended April 30, 2018 increased 6.3 percent to $876.4 million compared to $824.1 million in the same period last year. By segment, sales increased 6.7 percent in Identification Solutions and 5.6 percent in Workplace Safety, which consisted of organic sales growth of 3.7 percent in Identification Solutions and an organic sales decline of 0.1 percent in Workplace Safety.\nCommentary:\n“Our continued focus on innovation and the development of high-quality products resulted in organic sales growth of 3.2 percent in the quarter, which was driven by both the Identification Solutions and Workplace Safety businesses. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of organic sales growth and our eleventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year pre-tax earnings growth. We take a consistent and balanced approach to driving organic sales growth while executing sustainable efficiency gains throughout our global operations and SG&A structure,” said Brady’s President and Chief Executive Officer, J. Michael Nauman. “We expect this positive organic sales trend to continue as we launch innovative new products in our Identification Solutions business, and as our Workplace Safety business returns to consistent quarterly organic sales growth and realizes benefits over the long-term due to its product innovation efforts.”\n“Our cash generation remains strong,” said Brady’s Chief Financial Officer, Aaron Pearce. “Even after significantly increasing our investments in research and development, we still increased our net cash provided by operating activities by 23.6% this quarter and significantly increased our investments in capital expenditures. We also repaid $11.7 million in debt and finished in a net cash position of $72.7 million as of April 30, 2018. Our strong balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility for investing in opportunities to drive long-term value for our shareholders.”\nFiscal 2018 Guidance:\nThe Company is tightening its full year fiscal 2018 earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share guidance from its previous range of $1.90 to $2.00 to a range of $1.95 to $2.00, exclusive of tax charges primarily related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Included in this guidance is low-single digit organic sales growth, depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $26 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $20 to $25 million during the year ending July 31, 2018. The Company expects its full-year income tax rate, exclusive of charges primarily related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, to range from approximately 27 percent to 29 percent. The full benefit of the enactment of U.S. tax legislation will not be realized until next fiscal year. This guidance is based upon foreign exchange rates as of April 30, 2018.\nA webcast regarding Brady’s fiscal 2018 third quarter financial results will be available at www.bradycorp.com/investors beginning at 9:30 a.m. Central Time today.\nBrady Corporation is an international manufacturer and marketer of complete solutions that identify and protect people, products and places.

These forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain and are subject to risks, assumptions, and other factors, some of which are beyond Brady’s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For Brady, uncertainties arise from: our ability to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy; Brady’s ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands; difficulties in protecting our websites, networks, and systems against security breaches; decreased demand for our products; Brady’s ability to retain large customers; extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities; Brady’s ability to execute facility consolidations and maintain acceptable operational service metrics; litigation, including product liability claims; risks associated with the loss of key employees; divestitures and contingent liabilities from divestitures; Brady’s ability to properly identify, integrate, and grow acquired companies; foreign currency fluctuations; the impact of the Tax Reform Act and any other changes in tax legislation and tax rates; potential write-offs of Brady’s substantial intangible assets; differing interests of voting and non-voting shareholders; Brady’s ability to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements; numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive, and regulatory nature contained from time to time in Brady’s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including, but not limited to, those factors listed in the “Risk Factors” section within Item 1A of Part I of Brady’s Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2017.\nThese uncertainties may cause Brady's actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in its forward-looking statements.
