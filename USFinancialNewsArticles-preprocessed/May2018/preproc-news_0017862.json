(NYSE:AQUA) today reported results for its second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nRevenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $333.7 million, an increase of $33.8 million or 11.3% as compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Revenue growth was led by increases in the Industrial segment related to capital projects in the power market, remediation projects and revenues from recently acquired businesses. Additionally, the Products segment contributed to year-over-year growth through volume increases across multiple divisions.\nNet income for the quarter was $13.0 million, an improvement of $8.1 million or 165.2% year-over-year. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.10 per share on 119.2 million weighted average shares outstanding.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $57.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of $13.8 million or 31.3% year-over-year. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by the increase in revenues and related profit as well as a decrease in operating expenses year-over-year.\n“Our businesses performed well in the second quarter, particularly within our Industrial and Products segments,” said Ron Keating, Evoqua CEO. “For the quarter, we reported strong Industrial segment capital sales and broad-based growth across much of the Products business. Solid cost controls along with volume leverage and margin improvement drove overall EBITDA expansion and improved cash flow. We are very pleased to have closed on the Pure Water Solutions and Pacific Ozone acquisitions during the quarter to supplement organic growth.”\nMr. Keating continued, “Our value proposition uniquely positions Evoqua to be the solutions provider of choice for capital, service and aftermarket opportunities. Key vertical markets continue to be trending positively and we are seeing more customers looking to outsource their water treatment systems to companies like Evoqua, providing additional growth opportunities.”\nSecond Quarter Segment Results\nThe Company has three reportable segments - Industrial, Municipal and Products.\nIndustrial\nThe Industrial segment combines equipment and services to improve operational reliability and environmental compliance for heavy and light industry, commercial and institutional markets. Their customers span industries including hydrocarbon processing, chemical processing, power, food and beverage, life sciences, health services and microelectronics.\nRevenues in the Industrial segment increased $20.8 million, or 13.0%, to $181.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $160.5 million in the same period in the prior year -\nCapital revenues increased $10.7 million, primarily in the power market and with remediation projects. Service revenues increased $0.6 million related to power, hydrocarbon processing and chemical processing. Acquisitions contributed $9.5 million of revenue from the additions of ADI, Noble and Pure Water.\nOperating profit in the Industrial segment increased $5.2 million, or 20.0%, to $31.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $25.8 million in the same period of the prior year -\n$3.5 million of benefits were experienced as a result of lower employment costs driven by restructuring and cost improvement initiatives implemented in the current and prior fiscal year. $2.3 million of profit was provided from the ADI, Noble and Pure Water acquisitions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Industrial segment profitability was tempered by the product mix of higher capital projects revenue growth as compared to higher margin services revenue growth. Additionally, profitability improvements were partially offset by $1.2 million related to higher depreciation and amortization driven by capital investment in service assets and the acquisitions mentioned above.\nEBITDA in the Industrial segment increased $6.3 million, or 17.9%, to $41.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $35.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in EBITDA resulted from the same factors which impacted operating profit, less the change in depreciation and amortization.\nMunicipal\nThe Municipal segment helps engineers and municipalities meet new demands for plant performance through market-leading equipment, solutions and services backed by trusted brands and over 100 years of applications experience. The segment’s customers include waste water and drinking water collection and distribution systems and utility operators.

Service revenue experienced growth of $0.2 million. Growth was partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $1.7 million related to timing of aftermarket product sales as compared to the same period of the prior year, and $0.6 million of lower revenue from our Italian operations as this portion of our business approached final wind down.\nOperating profit in the Municipal segment increased $1.5 million, or 23.2%, to $8.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $6.5 million for the same period in the prior year -\n$1.2 million improvement related primarily to lower employment expenses resulting from the shift to a customer focused organizational structure from administrative and back-office functions. $1.7 million associated with a reduction in warranty costs due to improved product quality and better project execution. Lower depreciation expense of $0.3 million. Operating profit decreased by $1.7 million as a result of the mix shift to higher capital projects revenue growth as compared to higher margin aftermarket revenue.\nEBITDA in the Municipal segment increased $1.3 million, or 14.4%, to $9.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $8.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. EBITDA performance was driven by the same factors which impacted operating profit, less the change from depreciation and amortization.\nProducts\nThe Products segment has distinct business operating units, each built on well-known brands and technologies that are sold globally through multiple sales and aftermarket channels. Additionally, the Products segment also offers industrial, municipal and recreational users improved operational reliability and environmental compliance. The segment’s customers include original equipment manufacturers, regional and global distributors, engineering, procurement and contracting customers, and end users in the industrial, municipal and commercial industries.\nProducts revenues increased $12.2 million, or 16.2%, to $88.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from $75.9 million in the comparable period of the prior year -\nGrowth of $7.2 million in revenues across the segment, comprised of contributions from four of the five divisions. Acquisitions contributed $1.3 million from the additions of Olson and Pacific Ozone. The positive impact of foreign currency was $3.8 million, primarily related to transactions denominated in euro and pound sterling.\nOperating profit in the Products segment increased $6.0 million, or 43.6%, to $19.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $13.9 million in the prior year period -\nOverall increased volume and mix of product offerings as well as operational efficiency delivered $2.8 million of operating profit. $2.5 million of benefits were experienced as a result of lower employment costs driven by restructuring and cost improvement initiatives implemented in the current and prior fiscal year as well as lower depreciation and amortization. The positive impact of foreign currency was $0.5 million; and The Olson and Pacific Ozone acquisitions contributed $0.2 million year over year.\nEBITDA in the Products segment increased $6.0 million, or 35.5%, to $23.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $17.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including restructuring and related business transformation costs, purchase accounting adjustment costs, non-cash stock based compensation, sponsor fees, transaction costs and other gains, losses and expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under GAAP, because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because it excludes, among other things, certain results of decisions that are outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance as follows:\nto assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance; in our management incentive compensation which is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA; in certain calculations under our senior secured credit facilities, which use components of Adjusted EBITDA. to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; to make budgeting decisions; and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nIn addition to the above, our chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. EBITDA of the reportable segments does not include certain unallocated charges that are presented within Corporate activities. These unallocated charges include certain restructuring and other business transformation charges that have been incurred to align and reposition the Company to the current reporting structure, acquisition related costs (including transaction costs, integration costs and recognition of backlog intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting) and stock-based compensation charges.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non- recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited, amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2017 2018 2017 2018 Net income (loss) $ 4,895 $ 12,980 $ (8,305 ) $ 9,975 Interest expense 11,898 10,810 26,651 28,053 Income tax (benefit) expense (4,812 ) 2,018 (11,907 ) (2,393\n)\nDepreciation and amortization 18,873 20,480 37,520 40,363 EBITDA 30,854 46,288 43,959 75,998 Restructuring and related business transformation costs (a) 9,875 8,228 23,033 16,343 Purchase accounting adjustment costs (b) 10 — 229\n— Share-based compensation (c) 554 4,250 1,020 6,862 Sponsor fees (d) 1,000 — 2,000 333 Transaction costs (e) 2,400 846 3,759 1,360 Other gains, losses and expenses (f) (764 ) (1,912 ) 7,171 (3,215 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 43,929 $ 57,700 $ 81,171 $ 97,681",
