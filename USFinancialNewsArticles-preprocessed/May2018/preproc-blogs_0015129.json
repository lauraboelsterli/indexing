    "text": "CNBC.com Hemant Mishra | Mint | Getty Images\nThe board of Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart has approved a deal to sell a roughly 75 percent stake in the company to a group led by Walmart for $15 billion, according to a report.\nJapan's SoftBank will sell its entire 20-plus percent stake in Flipkart, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing unnamed sources, and Google's parent company Alphabet is likely to participate in the investment with Walmart.\nA final close to the deal is expected within 10 days, the report said, but the terms could still change and a deal is not certain.\nWalmart, Flipkart and Amazon were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. SoftBank declined to comment. show chapters 9:23 PM ET Thu, 5 April 2018 | 03:51\nCNBC's India affiliate CNBC TV-18 reported earlier this week that Amazon had made a formal offer to buy a 60 percent stake in Flipkart, citing unnamed sources.\nA majority stake in Flipkart would see Walmart gain significant ground against Amazon in India. It would also increase the company's presence overseas. Earlier this week, Walmart-owned supermarket Asda joined forces with competitor Sainsbury's in a deal worth Â£7.3 billion ($10 billion).\nYou can read the full report by Bloomberg here .",
