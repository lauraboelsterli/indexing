    "text": "MISSISSAUGA, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MedX Health Corp. (“MedX” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: MDX) announced its results , which are also available on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ).\nThe Company reported revenue of $226,122 , compared with revenue of $239,810 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Revenues from SIAscopy of $39,236 were 18% higher than the 2017 three-month period, while sales from the Company's therapeutic laser line of $186,886 were lower than in the prior year. The Company reported a loss of $672,154 or $0.01 per share compared with a loss of $347,859, or $0.00 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\n“Our revenue for the first quarter was lower than we had been anticipating, as the shipment of a $120,000 order that we received mid-quarter ended up being shipped just after quarter end due to delays by our customer,” noted Rob von der Porten, CEO of MedX. “We are adding to our marketing efforts to build the laser sales and preparing for the launch of our new telemedicine platform that will be ready for marketing this summer. Through the collaborations with our well respected Advisory board members, such as U.S. based Dr. Dan Siegel and UK based Dr. Joe Walls and Dr. Per Hall, we are increasingly encouraged that our SIAscopy technology integrated into a telemedicine platform will move the company into the forefront of remote scanning and analysis of potentially dangerous moles and lesions. The investment in our technology and business development efforts have increased costs for the quarter, however non-recurring expenses represent approximately half of the increase in the loss for the quarter over last year.”\nAbout MedX\nMedX, headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, is a leading medical device company focused on skin cancer with its SIAscopy technology that is imbedded in its products SIAMETRICS™, SIMSYS™, and MoleMate™, which MedX manufactures in its ISO 13485 certified facility.
