    "text": "(Reuters) - Asmodee Group, the French maker of board game Catan and distributor of Pokemon cards in parts of Europe, is exploring a sale that could value it at more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion), according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe Guyancourt, France-based company, owned by private equity firm Eurazeo SE ( EURA.PA ), has hired investment bankers to run a sale process, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.\nThe company generates about 100 million euros in 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to one of the sources.\nA spokesman for Eurazeo declined to comment, while Asmodee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nSince Eurazeo took over Asmodee in 2013 in a 143 million euro deal, Asmodee has been aggressively expanding beyond Europe and into the United States.\nThe best-known titles the company publishes or distributes include Catan, Ticket to Ride, Splendor, and the Star Wars: X-Wing board games.\nReporting by Harry Brumpton in New York and Pamela Barbaglia in London; Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ",
