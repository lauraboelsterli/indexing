    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla., May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) today announced that James Schwichtenberg, a recognized leader in rail safety, is joining CSX as vice president and chief safety officer.\nSchwichtenberg will lead the company’s intensified focus on safety to re-establish CSX as the safety leader among North American railroads. He will report to Ed Harris, executive vice president of operations. Schwichtenberg joins CSX with 20 years of railroad experience, including 15 directly leading rail safety and regulatory initiatives.\n“We firmly believe that the predictability of CSX’s scheduled railroad operating model will result in a safer and more efficient railroad,” said Harris. “Jim is a proven leader that will help drive safety performance and operational improvements as CSX advances on our goal of becoming the best railroad in North America. This goal cannot be attained unless we have the best safety record, which we are relentlessly pursuing.”\nSchwichtenberg will also be responsible for overseeing coordination efforts with CSX’s safety consulting firm, DEKRA, which was selected to perform a comprehensive safety assessment of the company’s operations. DEKRA’s safety assessment of CSX will begin in June and is expected to be complete this fall.\nSchwichtenberg most recently served as senior director of regulatory and operating practices at Canadian National Railway, where he worked for six years. In 2003, Schwichtenberg joined the Federal Railroad Administration, rising to the level of deputy administrator for Region 4 in Chicago before his departure in 2012. Schwichtenberg began his career with the Union Pacific in 1998, where he held various engineering positions, including track inspector and section foreman. He holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Strayer University.\nSchwichtenberg’s appointment is effective immediately.\nAbout CSX\nCSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company. It provides rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services and solutions to customers across a broad array of markets, including energy, industrial, construction, agricultural, and consumer products. For over 190 years, CSX has played a critical role in the nation's economic expansion and industrial development. Its network connects every major metropolitan area in the eastern United States, where nearly two-thirds of the nation's population resides. It also links more than 230 short-line railroads and more than 70 ocean, river and lake ports with major population centers and farming towns alike.\nMore information about CSX Corporation and its subsidiaries is available at www.csx.com and on Facebook ( http://www.facebook.com/OfficialCSX ).\nContacts :\nBryan Tucker, Corporate Communications\n855-955-6397\nSource:CSX Corporation",
