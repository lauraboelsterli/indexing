    "text": "Second Quarter 2018 Highlights (Versus Second Quarter 2017)\nRevenue growth of 13%, driven by improved economic environment, strong price execution and specialty growth Net income for the quarter was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, which includes the negative impact of contingent consideration items. Adjusted net income was $11 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, excluding the contingent consideration items Adjusted EBITDA of $54 million increased 18% from prior year Net leverage of 4.1x, a decrease from 4.8x last year and 4.4x last quarter\nTHE WOODLANDS, Texas, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nexeo Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXEO) (the \"Company\" or \"Nexeo Solutions\"), today announced its consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nDavid Bradley, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nexeo Solutions stated, \"Our proprietary operating platform and go-to-market strategy were designed to enable differential performance in volatile environments. This, combined with the focus of our talented team and the unique value proposition we offer to suppliers and customers, continues to deliver above-market performance for all of our stakeholders.\"\nSales and operating revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $1,041.0 million, including $19.8 million in revenues from Ultra Chem, and $917.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Excluding revenues from Ultra Chem, the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling prices of 11.7% across all segments in all regions. Approximately $25.0 million of the increase was a result of strengthening exchange rates of various currencies versus the U.S. Dollar (\"USD\") as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nGross profit was $115.7 million and $102.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The Company's centralized platform allowed it to effectively manage supply constraints affecting various product lines. Additionally, specialty mix increased in both the Chemicals and Plastics lines of business. Approximately $2.2 million of the increase in gross profit was due to strengthening exchange rates of various currencies versus the USD compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nThe Company reported net income of $0.4 million and a net loss of $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $53.7 million and $45.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. For a description of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most comparable GAAP financial measure, please read \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nSecond Quarter 2018 Performance\nThe results of the Company's operating performance are described below and, unless otherwise indicated, are a comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2018 with the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended March 31, Period Over Period 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Chemicals Sales and operating revenues $ 487.8 $ 415.0 $ 72.8 17.5 % Gross profit 62.0 50.6 11.4 22.5 % Plastics Sales and operating revenues 516.9 471.7 45.2 9.6 % Gross profit 47.0 45.8 1.2 2.6 % Other Sales and operating revenues 36.3 31.0 5.3 17.1 % Gross profit 6.7 5.8 0.9 15.5 % Consolidated Sales and operating revenues 1,041.0 917.7 123.3 13.4 % Gross profit 115.7 102.2 13.5 13.2 % Segment Highlights\nChemicals - Sales and operating revenues for the Chemicals line of business for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $487.8 million, including $19.8 million in revenues from Ultra Chem, and $415.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Excluding the impact from Ultra Chem, the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a 10.2% increase in average selling prices and an increase in volumes of 2.3% across multiple product lines. Volume and average selling price performance was a result of continued expansion of our specialty business and recovery in the oil and gas industry, partially offset by volume decreases in Asia.\nGross profit was $62.0 million and $50.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Gross profit increased due to our strong commercial execution strengthened by leveraging our centralized technology platform to effectively manage supply shortages for certain specialty products globally as well as supply constraints in North America predominately caused by adverse weather conditions during the quarter.\nPlastics - Sales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business were $516.9 million and $471.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to a 14.1% increase in average selling prices resulting from improved product mix in North America and continued market share gain in EMEA. Overall, volumes were down 4.0% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 resulting from the commercial decision to terminate low margin and unprofitable business in North America and Asia. Approximately $23.5 million of the increase was a result of strengthening exchange rates of various currencies versus the USD compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nGross profit was $47.0 million and $45.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Our centralized platform allowed us to effectively manage supply constraints affecting various product lines. Additionally, our specialty mix increased in both the Chemicals and Plastics lines of business. Approximately $2.1 million of the increase in gross profit was due to strengthening exchange rates of various currencies versus the USD compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nOther - Sales and operating revenues for the Other segment were $36.3 million and $31.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in revenues was primarily due to growth in service offerings to existing customers.\nGross profit was $6.7 million and $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily due to certain management cost savings initiatives.\nNexeo Solutions to Hold Earnings Conference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. CT (10:00 a.m. ET).

The Company’s management has included this measure because they believe it is indicative of the Company’s operating performance, is used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company and can facilitate comparisons across periods. As presented by the Company’s management, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, certain non-GAAP financial measures as presented for financial reporting purposes herein may differ from similarly titled measures in the applicable covenants in our credit facilities.\nThe Company evaluates performance on the basis of adjusted EBITDA, which it defines as its consolidated net income (loss), plus the sum of interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization, other operating expenses, net (which primarily consists of acquisition and integration-related expenses, employee stock-based compensation expense, and other restructuring and transformational expenses), impairment charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and other income (expense), net, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, debt refinancing costs and other non-operating activity. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA is indicative of the Company’s operating performance and that it is used by investors and analysts to evaluate companies with similar capital structures. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of operating performance because:\nadjusted EBITDA excludes the effects of income taxes, as well as the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization;\nthe Company uses adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets;\nthe Company considers gains (losses) on the acquisition, disposal and impairment of assets as resulting from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations; and\nother significant one-time items, while periodically affecting the Company's results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of its results.\nThe Company evaluates performance on the basis of adjusted net income, which it defines as its consolidated net income (loss), plus the change in fair value of contingent consideration obligation net of tax impact. Contingent consideration is comprised of two components, the Deferred Cash Consideration and the Tax Receivable Agreement (\"TRA\"), which have a non-cash impact and can change significantly quarter to quarter dependent on key valuation inputs. In order to estimate the fair value of the Deferred Cash Consideration, the Company estimates the value of the Excess Shares using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the market price of the Company’s common stock at each valuation date being a significant input to this model. Unobservable inputs to the valuation are the expected volatility during the applicable period as well as a marketability discount to reflect the illiquidity of the Excess Shares given their terms. The Company estimates the fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration related to the TRA based on a discounted cash flow model which incorporates assumptions of projected taxable income, projected income tax liabilities and an estimate of tax benefits expected to be realized as a result of the Business Combination. Key inputs to the valuation are prevailing tax rates and market interest rates impacting the discount rate. Management believes that adjusted net income is indicative of the Company’s operating performance and that it is used by investors and analysts to evaluate companies with similar capital structures. The Company believes that adjusted net income is an important indicator of operating performance because:\nadjusted net income excludes the effects of the change in fair value of contingent consideration obligation net of tax impact, which have a non-cash impact and can change significantly quarter to quarter dependent on key valuation inputs.\nA reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to net income (loss) from continuing operations for Nexeo Solutions, Inc. and Subsidiaries, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is included at the end of this release.\nAbout Nexeo Solutions, Inc.\nNexeo Solutions is a leading global chemicals and plastics distributor, representing products from world-class producers to a diverse customer base.
