    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday the country’s monarch had indicated he was willing to grant a full pardon to jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim.\nMalaysian political leader Anwar Ibrahim watches a live broadcast of the swearing in ceremony of newly-elected Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in Kuala Lumpur, in this still image taken from video, May 10, 2018, obtained from social media. Dr Ariff Bahardin/via REUTERS Speaking at a news conference, Mahathir also said he would announce a 10-member cabinet on Saturday, including ministers for finance, defense and home affairs.\nAnwar and Mahathir, former allies and then implacable foes, joined hands to contest this week’s election and oust the administration of Najib Razak. Anwar is in custody on charges of sodomy and corruption and cannot take any office until he is pardoned and released.\nMahathir has said he will step aside and hand over the prime minister’s post to Anwar once he is pardoned.\nReporting by Praveen Menon; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\n ",
