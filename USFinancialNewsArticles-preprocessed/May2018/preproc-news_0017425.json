(NYSE:BKI), a leading provider of software, data and analytics solutions to the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals, today announced unaudited the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 5% to $270.3 million from $258.1 million in the prior year quarter. Net earnings attributable to Black Knight for the first quarter of 2018 were $42.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $12.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 5% to $271.2 million from $259.5 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted Net Earnings for the first quarter of 2018 increased 42% to $64.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to $45.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 increased 9% to $129.9 million from $119.4 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 47.9%, an increase of 190 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.\nBlack Knight Executive Chairman Bill Foley said, “We had a solid start to 2018, as we delivered Adjusted Revenues growth of 5% and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 9%, which drove margin expansion of 190 basis points. Our first quarter results reflect our continued focus on driving organic growth through cross-sell, adding new clients and the delivery of innovative solutions. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we are on course to achieve the financial targets we have set for 2018.”\nFoley continued, “On behalf of the board of directors, we are excited to welcome Anthony Jabbour to Black Knight as Chief Executive Officer. I am confident that the extensive experience and skills he brings to the company will drive our future success, and we look forward to his leadership.”\nBlack Knight Chief Executive Officer Anthony Jabbour added, “It is a privilege to join the Black Knight team and I am excited about where this company is today and where I believe it can be in the years to come. The unique blend of industry leading solutions, exceptional client partnerships and an employee base with deep industry knowledge lead me to believe that Black Knight is well positioned to continue its successes on all fronts.\"\nDefinitions of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to related GAAP measures are provided in subsequent sections of the press release narrative and supplemental schedules. Black Knight has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, due primarily to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of non-operating matters that may arise, as not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation is available to Black Knight without unreasonable effort.\nSegment Information\nSoftware Solutions\nAdjusted Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 5% to $233.6 million from $223.1 million in the prior year quarter. Our servicing software business had Adjusted Revenues growth of 7%, primarily driven by strong loan growth on our core servicing software solution from new and existing clients, price increases and new client wins. In our origination software business, Adjusted Revenues declined 4% as increased professional services and new client wins were more than offset by lower Exchange volumes as a result of the 14% decline in refinancing originations as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association and client contract termination fees in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $136.8 million from $125.4 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 58.6%, an increase of 240 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.\nData and Analytics\nAdjusted Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 3% to $37.6 million from $36.4 million in the prior year quarter primarily driven by growth in our multiple listing service business and increased volumes in our tax and title data businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.6 million compared to $6.9 million in the prior year quarter, with an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 22.9%, an increase of 390 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we repurchased 3.0 million shares of common stock for $141.5 million, or an average price of $47.15 per share. As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately 3.8 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nSegment Realignment\nOn January 1, 2018, we realigned the composition of our two reportable segments. Certain enterprise business intelligence offerings in our Data and Analytics segment were moved to our Software Solutions segment (the \"Segment Realignment\"). This change aligns with our go-to-market strategy and with the internal management of our business operations, including the allocation of resources and assessment of performance. Prior period results have been reclassified to reflect the Segment Realignment.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.9 million and debt of $1,502.6 million. As of March 31, 2018, we had available capacity of $363.5 million on our revolving credit facility.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following reflect Black Knight’s expectations as of today's date. Given the number of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions discussed below, actual results may differ materially. Black Knight does not intend to update its until its next quarterly results announcement, other than in publicly available statements.\nBlack Knight’s full year 2018 outlook is as follows:\nRevenues are expected to be in the range of $1,102 million to $1,122 million.

These are important financial performance measures for us, but are not financial measures as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial performance measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making, including determining a portion of executive compensation. We also present these non-GAAP financial performance measures because we believe investors, analysts and rating agencies consider them useful in measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations. By disclosing these non-GAAP financial performance measures, we believe we offer investors a greater understanding of, and an enhanced level of transparency into, the means by which our management operates the company. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and our use of these terms may vary from that of others in our industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, operating income, net earnings, cash provided by operating activities or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or liquidity. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the attached schedules.\nAdjusted Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for the Software Solutions and Data and Analytics segments are presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting . These measures are reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For these reasons, these measures are excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's (\"SEC'\") Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.\nAdjusted Revenues - We define Adjusted Revenues as Revenues adjusted to include the revenues that were not recorded by Black Knight during the periods presented due to the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment recorded in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments are reflected in Corporate and Other. This adjustment for the full year 2018 is expected to be approximately $2.5 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA - We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net earnings, with adjustments to reflect the addition or elimination of certain statement of earnings items including, but not limited to:\nDepreciation and amortization; Interest expense; Income tax expense; Other expense, net; deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment; equity-based compensation, including related payroll taxes; costs associated with debt and/or equity offerings, including the spin-off of Black Knight from Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (\"FNF\") (the \"Distribution\"); and spin-off related transition costs.\nThese adjustments are reflected in Corporate and Other.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin - Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Adjusted Revenues.\nAdjusted Net Earnings - We define Adjusted Net Earnings as Net earnings with adjustments to reflect the addition or elimination of certain statement of earnings items including, but not limited to:\nthe net incremental depreciation and amortization adjustments associated with the application of purchase accounting; deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment; equity-based compensation, including related payroll taxes; costs associated with debt and/or equity offerings, including the Distribution; spin-off related transition costs; significant legal and regulatory matters; and adjustment for income tax expense assuming the conversion of all the shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock prior to the Distribution and the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.6% and 37.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAdjusted Net Earnings Per Share - For the periods prior to the Distribution, we calculate per share amounts assuming the exchange of all shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the respective period. We also include the dilutive effect of any unvested restricted shares of common stock.\nASC 606\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"), using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, we recognized the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue recognition standard to existing revenue contracts that were active as of the adoption date as an adjustment to the opening balance of Retained earnings. The reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606, while the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the related accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements regarding expectations, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the future are . Forward-looking statements are based on Black Knight management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, them.

The shares of Class B common stock did not share in the earnings or losses of Black Knight and were, therefore, not participating securities. Accordingly, basic and diluted net earnings per share of Class B common stock have not been presented. Prior to the Distribution, the numerator in the diluted net earnings per share calculation was adjusted to reflect our income tax expense at an expected effective tax rate assuming the conversion of the shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 32.8%.
