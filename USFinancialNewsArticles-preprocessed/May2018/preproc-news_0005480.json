(NASDAQ:MRLN) (“Marlin” or the “Company”) today reported first quarter 2018 net income of $6.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared with net income of $1.5 million, or $0.12 per share a year ago. First quarter net income on an adjusted basis was $6.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared with $4.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share a year ago.\nCommenting on the Company’s results, Jeffrey A. Hilzinger, Marlin’s President and CEO, said, “Marlin is off to a good start in 2018 as strong execution continued to drive solid origination volume, stable credit performance and excellent earnings growth. Excluding referral volume, total origination volume was $159.7 million for the quarter compared with $146.5 million last year, resulting in a year-over-year increase of 9%. Growth in the quarter was driven by solid demand for both our Equipment Finance product and Funding Stream, our working capital loan product. During the quarter, yield on our origination volume was 12.44% compared to 11.86% a year ago with Equipment Finance increasing to 9.99% from 9.67% and Funding Stream decreasing from 33.0% to 31.7%. We also continued to gain traction in our Direct origination initiative that identifies additional financing opportunities with existing customers. During the quarter, Direct origination volume was $30.9 million compared with $16.6 million last year, resulting in a year-over-year increase of 86%. As part of Marlin’s developing capital markets activities, we referred or sold $27.2 million of leases and loans. As a result of these origination and capital markets activities, our Net Investment in Leases and Loans grew to $930.6 million, up 12.3% from a year ago. Also, for the first time our Managed Assets exceeded $1 billion growing to $1.02 billion compared with $855.3 million a year ago, resulting in a year-over-year increase of 19.4%. Importantly, our focus on maintaining disciplined underwriting standards continues to be a top priority and credit quality remained stable and within expectations during the quarter.”\nMr. Hilzinger concluded, “Our momentum continues to build and puts us on track to achieve our strategic, operational and financial objectives for the year. I look forward to continued strong execution of our strategy, further enhancing our financial performance and driving shareholder value as we move forward.”\nResults of Operations\nTotal origination volume (excluding referral volume) for the first quarter of $159.7 million was up 9.0% from a year ago. Direct origination volume of $30.9 million in the first quarter was up 86.3% from $16.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Indirect origination volume in the first quarter of 2018 was $128.8 million, down slightly from $129.9 million in the same period a year ago. Referral volume totaled $4.2 million, down from $22.3 million in the first quarter last year, largely due to the transition of leases originated by Horizon Keystone Financial to Marlin’s balance sheet over the past year.\nNet interest and fee margin as a percentage of average finance receivables was 10.43% for the first quarter, down 14 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and down 48 basis points from a year ago. The decrease in margin percentage was primarily a result of a decline in interest income and an increase in interest expense. The Company’s interest expense as a percent of average finance receivables increased to 149 basis points compared with 145 basis points for the previous quarter and 117 basis points for the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of the rising interest rate environment.\nOn an absolute basis, net interest and fee income was $23.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $21.7 million for the first quarter last year. The increase continues to reflect the strong growth in the portfolio and the underlying earnings power of the business.\nNon-interest income was $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $5.3 million in the prior quarter and $3.8 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in non-interest income is primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in gains-on-sale, $0.3 million increase in Insurance related income and a $0.4 million increase in servicing fee income, partially offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in referral income.\nNon-interest expense was $16.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $15.4 million in the prior quarter and $19.6 million in the first quarter last year. The increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million increase in payroll taxes and a $0.2 million increase in marketing expense. The overall increase from prior quarter was actually less than anticipated due to the timing of approximately $0.4 million of employee related expenses that were expected to be recognized in the first quarter but will ultimately be recognized in the second and third quarters. The decrease from a year ago was primarily due to a $4.4 million charge recorded in the first quarter last year in connection with a regulatory matter. This was partially offset by increases in expenses in the first quarter of 2018 related to the Horizon Keystone acquisition, including intangibles amortization expense, higher salaries and benefits and higher sales commissions. Expenses also increased due to investments in the Direct origination initiative and expenses associated with building-out Marlin’s senior leadership team.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 57.1% compared with 76.8% in the first quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2017 efficiency ratio was 59.5%. Excluding acquisition related sales commissions, the efficiency ratio in the first quarter of 2018 was 55.8%. Marlin expects its efficiency ratio to continue to improve as the Company leverages its fixed costs through continued portfolio growth and from continued operational efficiencies generated by its various process renewal initiatives.\nMarlin recorded an income tax expense of $1.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of 21.4% for the first quarter of 2018, compared with an income tax expense of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nPortfolio Performance\nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of total finance receivables was 1.68% at March 31, 2018 compared with 1.63% at December 31, 2017 and 1.42% at March 31, 2017, with the year-over-year increase driven by generally higher portfolio delinquency and net charge-offs. Coverage of total 60+ day delinquencies was 231.9% at March 31, 2018 compared with 262.99% at December 31, 2017 and 247.1% at March 31, 2017.\nFinance receivables over 30 days delinquent were 1.05% of the Company’s total finance receivables portfolio as of March 31, 2018, up 3 basis points from December 31, 2017 and up 17 basis points from March 31, 2017. Finance receivables over 60 days delinquent were 0.64% of the Company’s total finance receivables portfolio as of March 31, 2018, up 9 basis points from December 31, 2017 and up 13 basis point from March 31, 2017. Annualized first quarter net charge-offs were 1.68% of average total finance receivables versus 1.87% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1.57% a year ago. The overall increase in delinquency and charge-offs year-over-year is attributed to a return to a more normal credit environment.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s consolidated equity to assets ratio was 17.17%. This compares to 17.27% and 17.22%, in the prior quarter and year ago quarter, respectively.\nCorporate Developments\nMarlin’s Board of Directors today declared a $0.14 per share quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable May 24, 2018, to shareholders of record on May 14, 2018. Based on the closing stock price on May 2, 2018, the annualized dividend yield on the Company’s common stock is 1.94%.\nAt the end of the first quarter, the Company entered into a forward flow sale agreement with Varadero Capital, L.P., a leading alternative asset management firm, to sell up to $300 million in equipment leases and loans to be originated by Marlin. This arrangement expands Marlin’s ability to provide equipment financing to small businesses that are not currently served by the Company’s existing finance programs, diversifies its funding sources and provides substantial new lending capacity.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company is maintaining guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2018 as follows:\nTotal origination volume (including referral volume) is expected to finish approximately 20% above 2017 levels Portfolio performance is expected to remain within the targeted range Net interest margin, as a percentage, is expected to between 10.0% and 10.25% ROE is expected to improve in 2018 as the Company continues to improve operating scale EPS is expected to be between $1.95 and $2.10 per share\nConference Call and Webcast\nMarlin will host a conference call on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 results.

The Company defines net income on an adjusted basis as net income excluding an after-tax charge related to a reserve for restitution in connection with certain payment processing practices in effect prior to February 2016 and charges for associated legal and consulting fees, the after-tax hurricane credit and insurance loss reserves, the after-tax executive severance (Chief Operating Officer), and the net tax benefit from the tax cut and jobs act, as applicable. The Company defines diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis, return on average assets on an adjusted basis and return on average equity on an adjusted basis as the calculation used for the “as reported” number substituting net income as reported with net income on an adjusted basis while using the same denominator in the “as reported” number, where appropriate. The Company defines efficiency ratio on an adjusted basis as the calculation used for the “as reported” ratio adjusting the numerator for the reserve for restitution in connection with certain payment processing practices in effect prior to February 2016, hurricane insurance loss reserves, and executive severance, as applicable. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful performance metrics for management, investors and lenders, because it means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of the Company's financial performance without the effects of certain adjustments in accordance with GAAP that may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP financial measures. They may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestor Contacts:\nTaylor Kamp\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n856-505-4108\nLasse Glassen\nAddo Investor Relations\nlglassen@addoir.com\n424-238-6249\nMARLIN BUSINESS SERVICES CORP.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands,\nexcept per-share data) ASSETS Cash and due from banks $ 4,394 $ 3,544 Interest-earning deposits with banks 80,497 63,602 Total cash and cash equivalents 84,891 67,146 Time deposits with banks 7,664 8,110 Investment securities (amortized cost of $11.2 million and $11.7 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively) 10,946 11,533 Net investment in leases and loans: Net investment in leases and loans, excluding allowance for credit losses 946,247 929,271 Allowance for credit losses (15,620 ) (14,851 ) Total net investment in leases and loans 930,627 914,420 Intangible assets 1,075 1,128 Goodwill 1,160 1,160 Property and equipment, net 4,035 4,204 Property tax receivables 11,740 6,292 Other assets 19,087 26,167 Total assets $ 1,071,225 $ 1,040,160 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Deposits $ 833,145 $ 809,315 Other liabilities: Sales and property taxes payable 7,790 2,963 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 27,774 31,492 Net deferred income tax liability 18,589 16,741 Total liabilities 887,298 860,511 Stockholders’ equity: Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value; 5,000,000 shares authorized; none issued — — Common Stock, $0.01 par value; 75,000,000 shares authorized; 12,418,497 and 12,449,458 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 124 124 December 31, 2016, respectively Additional paid-in capital 82,509 82,588 Stock subscription receivable (2 ) (2 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (98 ) (96 ) Retained earnings 101,394 97,035 Total stockholders’ equity 183,927 179,649 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 1,071,225 $ 1,040,160 MARLIN BUSINESS SERVICES CORP.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands,\nexcept per-share data) Interest income $ 23,279 $ 20,531 Fee income 3,959 3,530 Interest and fee income 27,238 24,061 Interest expense 3,399 2,340 Net interest and fee income 23,839 21,721 Provision for credit losses 4,612 3,884 Net interest and fee income after provision for credit losses 19,227 17,837 Non-interest income: Insurance premiums written and earned 1,939 1,706 Other income 3,295 2,047 Non-interest income 5,234 3,753 Non-interest expense: Salaries and benefits 10,023 9,391 General and administrative 6,571 10,170 Non-interest expense 16,594 19,561 Income before income taxes 7,867 2,029 Income tax expense 1,682 489 Net income $ 6,185 $ 1,540 Basic earnings per share $ 0.50 $ 0.12 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.50 $ 0.12 Cash dividends declared per share $ 0.14 $ 0.14 MARLIN BUSINESS SERVICES CORP.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands,\nexcept per-share data) (Unaudited)\nNet income as reported $ 6,185 $ 1,540 Deduct: Charge in connection with regulatory matters - (4,411 ) Tax effect - 1,694 Charge in connection with regulatory matters, net of tax - (2,717 ) Net Income on an adjusted basis $ 6,185 $ 4,257 Diluted earnings per share as reported $0.50 $0.12 Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis $0.50 $0.34 Return on Average Assets as reported 2.37% 0.67% Return on Average Assets on an adjusted basis 2.37% 1.86% Return on Average Equity as reported 13.69% 3.78% Return on Average Equity on an adjusted basis 13.69% 10.44% Efficiency Ratio as reported 57.08% 76.79% Efficiency Ratio on an adjusted basis 57.08% 59.47% First quarter 2017 Net Income on an adjusted basis is defined as net income excluding a first quarter 2017 $4.2 million charge associated with recent regulatory matters and a $0.3 million first quarter 2017 charge for associated legal and consulting fees.
