What we have in front of us is simply an opportunity.\n“(It is an) opportunity to really reverse The FA’s reputational decline.”\nGlenn also said there was no guarantee that Khan would be the buyer, leaving the door open to other bidders.\n“The reason we went public with the offer is that we want this to be transparent. Wembley Stadium has public money tied into it, and any potential sale needs to be open and competitive,” Glenn added.\n“We have had no other offers to date, but are ready to work with other buyers.”\nDue to the structure of the FA, a final decision on a sale can only be made by its 10-member executive board, but Chairman Clarke said on Tuesday that the governing body was a “long way” from any decision on a potential sale.
