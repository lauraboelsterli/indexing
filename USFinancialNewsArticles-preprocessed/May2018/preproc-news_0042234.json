    "text": "EditorsNote: Stat tweak in 4th graf\nRafael Devers, Mookie Betts and Andrew Benintendi all homered for Boston as the Red Sox defeated the Baltimore Orioles 6-3 on Saturday night at Fenway Park.\nRick Porcello (6-1) earned the victory for Boston after suffering his first loss of the season in his last start. He gave up three runs and six hits in six innings, striking out nine while walking three.\nDylan Bundy (2-6) ran into trouble with homers once more and took the loss. He gave up four runs on five hits in six innings and struck out eight.\nHowever, three of the hits were home runs and accounted for all four of the runs the right-hander allowed. Bundy allowed four homers in the first inning and did not retire a batter in a May 8 loss to Kansas City and now has given up 13 homers in 53 2/3 innings this season.\nThe Orioles took a 1-0 lead in the third. Chance Sisco led off with a ground-rule double, moved to third one out later when Adam Jones singled and scored on a Jonathan Schoop sacrifice fly.\nBundy needed to escape trouble a few times in the early innings but couldn’t avoid problems in the fourth and fifth. Devers tied the game with a solo shot in the fourth before two more homers gave the Red Sox a 4-1 lead in the fifth.\nSandy Leon doubled to start the fifth, and one out later, Betts hit a two-run homer. Benintendi followed with a solo shot, and the back-to-back blasts gave Boston that three-run lead.\nBetts’ homer was his 15th this season, making him the current major league leader.\nThe Orioles cut the deficit to one in the top of the sixth when Pedro Alvarez hit a two-run homer off of Porcello.\nBenintendi then added a two-run single in the seventh to give Boston a 6-3 lead, giving him three RBIs on the night.\nCraig Kimbrel closed it in the ninth for his 13th save.\nMLB.com reported that Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia (knee surgery) is coming closer to returning and could be back by the end of next week.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
