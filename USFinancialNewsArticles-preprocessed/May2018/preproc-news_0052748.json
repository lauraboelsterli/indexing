    "text": "(Reuters) - Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said on Monday the U.S. economy is close to meeting the Fed’s employment and inflation goals, with growth of around 2.5 percent expected this year.\nFILE PHOTO: Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President, Raphael Bostic speaks with Reuters in an interview at Stanford UniversityÕs Hoover Institution in Stanford, California, U.S., May 4, 2018. REUTERS/Ann Saphir/File Photo In prepared remarks to an economic group in Atlanta he did not update his views on interest rates, but has recently said he has a base case for two additional rate increases this year.\nHe also said that as the Fed debates possible changes to its inflation framework, he is “drawn to” systems that offset years of below- or above-target inflation with “misses” in the opposite direction.\nReporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ",
