    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turnaround and Finance professionals from the Bay Area and southern California were recently treated to brilliant insights on business leadership and success delivered by Hap Klopp, founder and longtime CEO of The North Face, a pioneer in corporate social and environmental responsibility, and innovator in product quality and branding. Widely recognized for growing The North Face from a two location, fledgling company into an iconic global apparel business that he ran for 20 years, Mr. Klopp continues to be involved in a number of entrepreneurial business ventures, has authored two business books and is in high demand as a public speaker.\nHap Klopp - entrepreneur, author and founder of The North Face\nWith often a fine line between success and failure, Klopp defined key differentiators as the ability to always execute, pivot and take your team with you, and to live and lead consistently. \"Success requires the ability to embrace and learn from failure,” said Klopp. Businesses today are competing on a global stage, creating and running “world class” companies, making it more challenging than ever to take risks, stand out, and yet keep the same basic values that define a successful organization. On a more promising note, Klopp claims, “if you keep working hard, something good is going to happen!”\nThe panel was hosted by the Turnaround Management Association’s Northern California Chapter and moderated by Chuck Doyle , Managing Director of Business Capital and longtime friend of Mr. Klopp.\nBusiness Capital is a leading commercial finance and debt restructuring firm specializing in securing customized debt based solutions for rapidly growing as well as challenged small and middle market companies nationwide who require a unique, timely and tailored financing structure to address their particular needs, especially in situations where conventional capital sources are not an option.\n*For additional information\nContact:\nChuck Doyle, Business Capital\n415-989-0970 or cdoyle@bizcap.com\nFollow us:\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nFacebook\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/31496ce4-8703-49ac-9f3f-978e838dbd5f\nSource:Business Capital",
