REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\nIcahn said in a regulatory filing that he sold 10.5 million shares back to the company, for $52.50 a share, after having announced last week that he was ready to part with 11.4 million shares.\nThe 82-year-old investor remains the nutrition and supplements company’s biggest owner after cutting his stake to 35.2 million shares from 45.7 million, which represented a 26.2 percent stake.\nHerbalife shares were trading at $50.72, up 2.3 percent, on Thursday shortly before the market close.\nIcahn said he was selling because the position had become too large within his portfolio. The sale comes roughly three months after Ackman ended his campaign against the company.\nIn late 2012, Ackman unveiled a $1 billion short position and predicted Herbalife’s share price would eventually fall to zero. Icahn, however, was convinced that the company’s future was bright and began buying. In February 2013 Icahn said in a filing that he paid an average $21.03 for his shares. He continued to buy Herbalife shares after that.\nSince January, Herbalife’s shares have climbed 46.4 percent. Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Leslie Adler",
