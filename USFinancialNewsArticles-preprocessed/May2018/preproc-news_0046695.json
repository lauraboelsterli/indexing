    "text": "May 21, 2018 / 1:24 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago China considers scrapping birth limits by 2019: Bloomberg Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - China is considering ending the limits it sets on the number of children a family can have, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. FILE PHOTO: A nurse takes care of newborn babies at a hospital in Hefei, Anhui province April 2011. REUTERS/Stringer\nChina’s population is aging rapidly, with the number of births falling by 3.5 percent to 17.23 million last year despite the country’s decision in late 2015 to relax the controversial “one-child” policy and allow couples to have a second child.\nThe State Council, or cabinet, has commissioned research on ending the country’s birth limits on a nationwide basis, the Bloomberg report said.\nA decision could be made in the last quarter of this year or in 2019, the report said.\nChina implemented its one-child policy in the 1970s to limit population growth, but authorities are concerned that a dwindling workforce will not be able to support an increasingly aging population.\nThe one-child policy also contributed to a sharp gender imbalance, with 32.66 million more males than females at the end of 2017.
