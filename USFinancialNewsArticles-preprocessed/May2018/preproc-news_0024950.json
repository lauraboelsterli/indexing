    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 8:10 PM / in 8 minutes Report: Hawks zeroing in on Pierce as coach Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nPhiladelphia 76ers assistant Lloyd Pierce interviewed with the Atlanta Hawks for a third time on Friday and is expected to be offered their vacant head coaching job, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. Downtown Atlanta is seen from the SkyView Atlanta, a 200-foot (61-meter) tall Ferris wheel with 42 gondolas, in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, July 18, 2013. The Ferris wheel, which was previously located in Paris, Switzerland, and Pensacola, Florida, opened to the public in Atlanta on July 16. Picture taken on July 18, 2013. REUTERS/Chris Aluka Berry\nPierce met with Hawks GM Travis Schlenk last Friday and with majority owner Tony Ressler earlier this week, per the report.\nHis third meeting is with Schlenk and other team officials and an offer could come by day’s end.\nPierce, whose focus is on the defense with Philadelphia, has been with the Sixers since 2013 following stints with Golden State, Memphis and Cleveland.\nThe 76ers ranked third in defensive rating this season.\nAtlanta is looking for a new coach after mutually parting ways with Mike Budenholzer in late April. They have three first-round picks in the upcoming NBA draft.\nThe Hawks also interviewed Golden State assistant Jarron Collins, Portland’s Nate Tibbetts and former Memphis Grizzlies coach David Fizdale, who wound up taking the New York Knicks job.\n—Field Level Media",
