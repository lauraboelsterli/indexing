As well as that, he’s one of our fan favourites.”\nRibery has scored 80 goals in 247 league appearances for Bayern since moving from Olympique de Marseille in 2007.\n“I’m very happy that I’ll get to play for this great club for another year,” he said.\n“Munich has long since become home for me and my family and I’m therefore very proud that I’ll be able to wear the FC Bayern shirt again next season.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond",
