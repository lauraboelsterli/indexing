    "text": "Severe weather in the Northeast impacted Total Net Revenue (“Revenue”) by an estimated $5.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA (1) by $5.8 million in the first quarter, significantly decreasing profitability Despite same center volume declines, Revenue increased 1.0% to $­­231.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $229.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of strong west coast operations Adjusted EBITDA (1) decreased 26.6% to $21.0 in the first quarter of 2018 from $28.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 Diluted loss per share was $(0.15) per share in the first quarter of 2018 as compared with diluted loss per share of $(0.03) from the prior year’s first quarter Full-year 2018 guidance adjusted to incorporate the first quarter’s weather impact\nLOS ANGELES, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RadNet, Inc. (NASDAQ:RDNT) , a national leader in providing high-quality, cost-effective, fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging services through a network of 300 owned and/or operated outpatient imaging centers, today reported financial results for its first quarter of 2018.\nDr. Howard Berger, President and Chief Executive Officer of RadNet, commented, “During the quarter, we faced unusually severe winter weather conditions in our northeastern and mid-Atlantic operations, which represent slightly over 50% of our total Revenue. Not only were we unable to see patients when our sites were forced to close, our referring physicians had their businesses similarly negatively affected which further impacted patient flow. We estimate that we lost almost $6 million of Revenue during the quarter, representing approximately 45,000 unperformed procedures. And because most of our costs are fixed, we lost the majority percentage of this Revenue in EBITDA. Further, our EBITDA was impacted from receiving decreased management fees from our joint venture partners, which are calculated as a percentage of Revenue, and from lower EBITDA-flow-through resulting from the significantly depressed profitability of our non-consolidated joint ventures. The weather impact was further highlighted when comparing our results to last year’s first quarter results, which were produced in one of the mildest winters in recent history. Also negatively impacting the EBITDA comparison between last year’s and this year’s quarters were the sales of non-controlling interests in four of our centers to Cedars Sinai and 24 centers to MemorialCare, for which we received almost $30 million in transactions that closed subsequent to the end of last year’s first quarter.”\nDr. Berger continued, “Had it not been for the loss of Revenue from bad weather in the quarter, we would have been on target with our initial 2018 projections and internal budgets. From past experience, the lost scanning slots in our schedules are not made-up during the same quarter or in subsequent ones. As a result, we’ve adjusted our 2018 guidance for the lost Revenue and EBITDA in the first quarter, while leaving our projections for the next three quarters intact.”\n“Despite the difficult weather, we had continued strong performance from west coast operations, whose aggregate procedural volumes increased by 2.8%. We also benefited from the contribution from some acquired and newly opened centers. During the quarter, we commenced operations of our joint venture with MemorialCare in Southern California. We are in the process of making operational improvements to the facilities MemorialCare contributed to the venture and have completed integrating these 10 sites onto the eRAD information technology platform. We begin a capitation arrangement with MemorialCare managed lives on June 1 st and expect a second capitation contract to commence later this summer,” added Dr. Berger.\nFinancial Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, RadNet reported Revenue of $231.4 million, Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $21.0 million and Net Loss of $7.3 million. Revenue increased $2.4 million (or 1.0%), Adjusted EBITDA (1) decreased $7.6 million (or 26.6%) and Net Loss increased $6.1 million, over the first quarter of 2017. Per share Net Loss for the first quarter was $(0.15), compared to $(0.03) in the first quarter of 2017, based upon a weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding of 47.8 million shares in 2018 and 46.6 million shares in 2017.\nAffecting Net Loss in the first quarter of 2018 were certain non-cash expenses and non-recurring items including: $3.7 million of non-cash employee stock compensation expense resulting from the vesting of certain options and restricted stock; $726,000 of severance paid in connection with headcount reductions related to cost savings initiatives; and $974,000 of combined non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs and loan discounts related to financing fees paid as part of our existing credit facilities.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the prior year’s first quarter, MRI volume increased 3.5%, CT volume increased 6.5% and PET/CT volume increased 10.9%. Overall volume, taking into account routine imaging exams, inclusive of x-ray, ultrasound, mammography and other exams, increased 2.1% over the prior year’s first quarter. On a same-center basis, including only those centers which were part of RadNet for both the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, MRI volume decreased 1.7%, CT volume increased 3.3% and PET/CT volume increased 8.7%. Overall same-center volume, taking into account routine imaging exams, inclusive of x-ray, ultrasound, mammography and other exams, decreased 1.0% over the prior year’s same quarter.\n2018 Guidance Update\nIncorporating the negative impact on our financial results in the first quarter of 2018 from the adverse weather conditions, RadNet amends its previously announced 2018 guidance ranges as follows:\nOriginal Guidance Range Revised Guidance Range Total Net Revenue $950 million - $975 million $945 million - $970 million Adjusted EBITDA (1) $145 million - $155 million $140 million - $150 million Free Cash Flow Generation (a) $50 million - $60 million $45 million - $55 million Capital Expenditures (b) $50 million - $55 million Unchanged Cash Interest Expense $33 million - $38 million Unchanged (a) Defined by the Company as Adjusted EBITDA (1) less total capital expenditures and cash paid for interest.\n(b) Net of proceeds from the sale of equipment, imaging centers and joint venture interests.\nDr. Berger highlighted, “While the changes we made to our guidance incorporates the negative impact we faced in the first quarter, our revised guidance levels leave our original projections unchanged for the remainder of the year. We are looking forward to continuing to execute on our strategies of regional concentration, multimodality offerings, health system partnerships and creative contracting opportunities.”\nConference Call for Today\nDr. Howard Berger, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Stolper, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results on Wednesday, May 9th, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. Pacific Time (10:30 a.m. Eastern Time).\nConference Call Details:\nDate: Wednesday, May 9, 2018\nTime: 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time\nDial In-Number: 800-239-9838\nInternational Dial-In Number: 323-794-2551\nIt is recommended that participants dial in approximately 5 to 10 minutes prior to the start of the 10:30 a.m. call.

Footnotes\n(1) The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, each from continuing operations and adjusted for losses or gains on the sale of equipment, other income or loss, debt extinguishments and non-cash equity compensation. Adjusted EBITDA includes equity earnings in unconsolidated operations and subtracts allocations of earnings to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, and is adjusted for non-cash or extraordinary and one-time events taken place during the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used as analytical indicator by RadNet management and the healthcare industry to assess business performance, and is a measure of leverage capacity and ability to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity. As Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is therefore susceptible to varying methods of calculation, this metric, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n(2) As noted above, the Company defines Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less total Capital Expenditures (whether completed with cash or financed) and Cash Interest paid. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company uses Free Cash Flow because the Company believes it provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating activities. Free Cash Flow does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.\nFree Cash Flow should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity. As Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is therefore susceptible to varying methods of calculation, this metric, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSource:RadNet, Inc.",
