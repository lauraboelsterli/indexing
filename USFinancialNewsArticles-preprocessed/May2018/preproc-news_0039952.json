    "text": "May 19, 2018 / 2:21 PM / Updated an hour ago Rugby-Saracens swat aside Wasps in thrilling Premiership semi-final Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMay 19 (Reuters) - Owen Farrell kicked 27 points as Saracens swatted aside Wasps 57-33 in an enthralling English Premiership playoff semi-final on Saturday to book their place at Twickenham on May 26.\nThe England flyhalf set his team on their way early in the first half, bursting through from halfway before laying off for Alex Lozowski to go over under the posts with less then three minutes gone.\nMario Itoje then powered to within inches of the line before prop Vincent Koch dived over to double Saracensâ€™ lead as they swarmed all over their opponents.\nFarrell added two first-half penalties to put Saracens 20-0 up before Wasps replied with a Willie Le Roux try, but a third penalty by Farrell sent his team into the halftime break with a comfortable lead.\nSaracens began the second half like they did the first, with an early try, as Chris Wyles crossed in the corner to leave Wasps needing a miracle.\nProp Jake Cooper-Woolley kept Wasps alive by bullying his way over after a lineout and Jimmy Gopperth converted to cut the deficit to 18 points.\nDanny Cipriani and Christian Wade then combined for Thomas Young to score under the posts as Wasps threatened an unlikely comeback, but Farrell struck another timely penalty with nearly an hour gone to give Saracens some breathing room.\nThe 26-year-old was at it again three minutes later, and though Le Roux kept Wasps in touch with another try just after the hour mark, Juan Figallo and Itoje crossed for Saracens to put the result beyond doubt.\nThere was still time for records to fall, with Christian Wade scoring for Wasps and Ben Spencer adding another for Saracens late on to bring the curtain down on the highest-ever scoring Premiership semi-final.\nExeter Chiefs play Newcastle Falcons in the other semi later on Saturday.
