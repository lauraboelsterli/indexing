REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nBurberry, famed for its trench coats and trademark check in camel, red and black, recently parted company with Christopher Bailey, the designer who turned it into a global brand and later became CEO, and last year appointed Marco Gobbetti as its new CEO as the group seeks to kick-start sales growth.\nFrere’s stake is owned by GBL subsidiary GBL Energy, which also has investments in French drinks company Pernod Ricard ( PERP.PA ) and oil major Total ( TOTF.PA ).\nGBL and GBL Energy said they would sell their Burberry stake of about 6.6 percent through a private placement, with Goldman Sachs acting as the bookrunner.\nBurberry shares closed at almost 18.85 pence on Tuesday, up about 0.5 percent.
