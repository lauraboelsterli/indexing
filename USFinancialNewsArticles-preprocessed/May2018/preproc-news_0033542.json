These results also reflect post-acquisition activity of TCA, including customer net buy activity of $0.6 billion.\n(2) Represents margin receivables held on the balance sheet and customer margin balances held by a third party clearing firm. The balances held by a third party were transferred to E*TRADE Securities during August 2017 in connection with the OptionsHouse integration. (3) Customer cash held by third parties is held outside E*TRADE and includes money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions. During August 2017, customer cash held by a third party clearing firm was transferred to E*TRADE Securities in connection with the OptionsHouse integration. Customer cash held by third parties is not reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and is not immediately available for liquidity purposes. (4) Net new brokerage assets are total inflows to all new and existing brokerage customer accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing brokerage customer accounts, excluding the effects of market movements in the value of brokerage customer assets. Net new banking assets are total inflows to all new and existing banking customer accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing banking customer accounts. The net new banking assets and net new brokerage assets metrics treat asset flows between E*TRADE entities in the same manner as unrelated third party accounts.
