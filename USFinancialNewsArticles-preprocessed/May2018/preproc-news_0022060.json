    "text": "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced its operating and financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nRecent Highlights\nDuring the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company sold two Senhance Systems In January of 2018, the Company filed a FDA 510(k) submission to expand the indications for use of the Senhance System, potentially doubling the Senhance System’s total addressable procedures Thus far in the second quarter ending June 30, 2018, the Company has sold three Senhance Systems, including one in the U.S.\n“We continued to generate momentum in the first quarter of 2018, including delivering the second consecutive quarter with multiple Senhance system sales and progressing our U.S. indication expansion strategy,” said Todd M. Pope, President and CEO at TransEnterix. “Looking to the balance of 2018, we will continue to leverage the momentum we have generated to drive the global commercial adoption of Senhance.”\nCommercial and Clinical Update\nIn the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company sold two Senhance Systems. Both of these sales have come from sales to end user hospitals by distributors in the Company's EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region.\nIn January of 2018, the Company filed a 510(k) submission with the FDA to expand the indications for use of the Senhance System to include laparoscopic inguinal hernia and gallbladder surgery. The Senhance System is currently cleared for use in the U.S. for laparoscopic colorectal and laparoscopic gynecologic surgery, accounting for approximately 1.5 million procedures in the U.S. annually. Upon clearance, we anticipate these additional indications would bring the Senhance System’s total addressable procedures in the U.S. to approximately 3 million.\nThus far in the quarter ending June 30, 2018, the Company has sold three Senhance Systems. One of the system sales was in the U.S., driven by the Company’s direct sales force, the remaining two system sales came from sales to end user hospitals by distributors in the Company’s EMEA region.\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported revenue of $4.8 million as compared to revenue of $1.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Revenue in the first quarter of 2018 included $3.5 million in system sales, $1.1 million in instruments and accessories, and $200 thousand in services.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, total net operating income and expenses were $5.4 million, as compared to $16.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, net loss was $0.9 million, or $0.00 per share, as compared to a net loss of $15.4 million, or $0.13 per share, in the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, adjusted net loss was $11.3 million, or $0.06 per share, as compared to an adjusted net loss of $12.6 million, or $0.11 per share in the three months ended March 31, 2017, after adjusting for the gain from the sale of SurgiBot assets and non-cash charges for amortization of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and change in fair value of warrant liabilities.\nConference Call\nTransEnterix, Inc. will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 4:30 PM ET to discuss its first quarter 2018 operating and financial results.

For more information, visit www.transenterix.com .\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share presented in this press release are non-GAAP measures. The adjustments relate to the gain on the sale of SurgiBot assets, amortization of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent consideration and change in fair value of warrant liabilities. These financial measures are presented on a basis other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"Non-GAAP Measures\"). In the tables that follow under \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures,” we present adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share, reconciled to their comparable GAAP measures. These items are adjusted because they are not operational or because these charges are non-cash or non-recurring and management believes these adjustments are meaningful to understanding the Company's performance during the periods presented. These Non-GAAP Measures should be considered a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes statements relating to the 2018 first quarter results and plans for 2018 and beyond.

Contingent consideration is measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model utilizing significant unobservable inputs including the probability of achieving each of the potential milestones and an estimated discount rate associated with the risks of the expected cash flows attributable to the various milestones. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success or changes in expected timelines for achievement of any of these milestones would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of these milestones, respectively, and commensurate changes to the associated liability. The contingent consideration is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nd) The Company’s Series B Warrants are measured at fair value using a simulation model which takes into account, as of the valuation date, factors including the current exercise price, the expected life of the warrant, the current price of the underlying stock, its expected volatility, holding cost and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the warrant. The warrant liability is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006531/en/\nFor TransEnterix, Inc.\nInvestors:\nMark Klausner, +1 443-213-0501\ninvest@transenterix.com\nor\nMedia:\nJoanna Rice, +1 951-751-1858\njoanna@greymattermarketing.com\nSource: TransEnterix, Inc.",
