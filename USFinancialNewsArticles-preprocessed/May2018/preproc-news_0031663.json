    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Appulse Corporation (“Appulse”) (TSX VENTURE:APL) today reported a net income of $16,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 with revenues of $2,389,000, compared to a net income of $14,000 and revenues of $2,159,000 for the same three-month period of the previous year. Operating cash flow (net income for the period adjusted for items not involving cash) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $84,000 compares to operating cash flow of $85,000 for the same three-month period of 2017.\nWhile parts and service sales to the Company’s traditional food and beverage customers increased during the period, overall parts and service revenues decreased compared to the first quarter of the prior year. The Corporation expects growth in revenues during the current year through its exclusive Canadian service representative arrangement with United States based Flottweg Separation Technology. Machine sales increased during the quarter resulting in the growth in total revenue for the 2018 three month period. First quarter machine sales combined with purchase orders now in hand for 2018 delivery total approximately $1,250,000, compared to machine sales of only $1,333,000 for the entire 2017 fiscal year. The Corporation continues to expand its market coverage and diversify the range of applications for its products.\nAbout Appulse\nThrough its subsidiaries, Centrifuges Unlimited Inc., Rolyn Oilfield Services Inc., and Design Machining Unlimited Inc., Appulse specializes in the sales, servicing and refurbishing of centrifuge equipment, serving both domestic and international markets, and offers full service industrial machining.
