    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 6:38 AM / Updated 37 minutes ago UK financial watchdog to consider capping rent-to-own prices Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nLONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - Britain’s financial watchdog is considering capping “rent-to-own” prices and fundamentally reforming how banks charge for unarranged overdrafts to crack down on high cost credit, it said on Thursday\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published findings from its review into high cost credit, which includes unarranged bank overdrafts, home-collected credit, and a form of hire purchase known as rent-to-own.\n“High cost credit is used by over three million consumers in the UK, some of who are the most vulnerable in society,” FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said in a statement.\n“Today we have proposed a significant package of reforms to ensure they are better protected, including the possibility of a cap on rent-to-own lending.”\nThe FCA has come under pressure from Britain’s lawmakers to cap the cost of rent-to-own credit, as it already has done for interest charged on payday loans.\nThe watchdog said costs for the 400,000 customers that use rent-to-own, a form of hire purchase for obtaining goods like fridges and washing machines, can be exceptionally high.\nIn some cases, customers have paid over 1,500 pounds ($2,000) for an electric cooker that can be bought in the shops for less than 300 pounds, it said.\nThe FCA said it would now carry out a detailed assessment of the impact that a cap could have on the sector and how it might be structured - and that it was also open to other options.\nAny changes to the sector would be introduced by April 2019.\nThe watchdog said it was also consulting on mandatory rules to make it easier for customers to manage their bank accounts and avoid punitive charges for unarranged overdrafts.\nThe way banks operate and charge for overdrafts needs fundamental reform, the FCA said.\n“The FCA is putting forward some immediate proposals today for overdrafts that it believes will save customers up to 140 million pounds a year,” the watchdog said.\n“Beyond that, the FCA will consider more radical options to ban fixed fees and end the distinctions around unarranged overdraft prices.”\nIf appropriate, these options will be consulted on later this year as part of the watchdog’s separate ongoing review of retail banking. $1 = 0.7509 pounds Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Mark Potter",
