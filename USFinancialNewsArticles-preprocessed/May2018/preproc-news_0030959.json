(NASDAQ:LOOP) (the “Company” or “Loop”), an innovative technology company leading the sustainable plastic revolution, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2018.\n“We continue to make meaningful progress towards the expected commercialization of our revolutionary technology,” said Daniel Solomita, Loop’s Founder and CEO. “We announced our partnership with evian®, and we were honored to demonstrate with them our technology for media outlets at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

The increase in net loss of $2.0 million is primarily due to increased research and development expenses of $1.1 million as well as increased general and administrative expenses of $0.9 million.\nResearch and development expenses amounted to $1.3 million, compared to $0.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher employee related expenses of $0.6 million, including $0.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and $0.5 million of design, planning and engineering costs costs related to the expansion of the Company’s pilot plant.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million to $2.1 million, compared to $1.2 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher employee related expenses of $0.9 million associated with the increased number of employees, including $0.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, offset by a non-recurring stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as higher legal, consulting and accounting fees of $0.7 million related to the Company’s next phase of its commercialization.\nNet cash used in operating activities amounted to $2.2 million for the three-month period as compared to $0.8 million for the same period last year. The increase is due primarily to higher operating expenses as mentioned above.\nFiscal Year Ended February 28, 2018 Financial Results\nLoop reported a net loss of $14.0 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 compared to a net loss of $4.1 million for fiscal year 2017. The increase in net loss of $9.9 million is primarily the result of higher research and development costs of $5.3 million and increased general and administrative expenses of $4.6 million.\nResearch and development expenses amounted to $6.7 million compared to $1.5 million for the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher employee related expenses of $3.9 million, including $3.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, as well as $1.2 million of design, planning and engineering costs related to the expansion of the Company’s pilot plant.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $6.9 million compared to $2.3 million for the same period in fiscal 2017. The $4.6 million increase was primarily attributable to higher employee related expenses of $2.9 million, including $2.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a non-recurring stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as higher legal, consulting and accounting fees of $1.6 million related to the Company’s next phase of its commercialization.\nNet cash used in operating activities amounted to $6.4 million compared to $2.8 million for the prior year. The increase is mainly due to higher operating expenses as mentioned above.\nStrategic Initiative with evian ®\nIn January 2018, the Company announced a strategic initiative with evian® to enable evian’s 100% “circular approach” to plastic usage by 2025. This initiative is in line with Loop’s mission to help global consumer brands achieve their stated goals for sustainability.\nCash Position and Liquidity\nIn January 2018, the Company issued 687,667 common shares and warrants to purchase up to 171,916 common shares with 31,250 warrants exercised for gross proceeds of $8.6 million.\nThe Company ended the year with $8.1 million of cash and continues to evaluate options to raise capital to finance its growth strategy and commercialization of its disruptive technology for sustainable plastic.\nPurchase of the Company’s Corporate Offices and Demonstration Facility\nIn January, the Company purchased the land and building housing its pilot plant in Terrebonne, Québec, which is the site of its Innovation Hub and corporate office, for a total consideration of $2.2 million, partially funded with a $1.1 million debt facility. The pilot plant was expanded and upgraded to optimize Loop’s disruptive technology with continuous operations.\nAbout Loop Industries, Inc.\nLoop’s mission is to accelerate the world’s shift toward sustainable plastic and away from our dependence on fossil fuels. Loop has created a revolutionary technology poised to disrupt the plastics industry. This ground-breaking technology decouples plastic from fossil fuels by depolymerizing waste polyester plastic to its base building blocks (monomers). The monomers are then repolymerized to create virgin-quality polyester plastic that meets FDA requirements for use in food-grade packaging. Loop™ branded polyester resin enables consumer goods companies to meet and exceed their stated sustainability goals and circular ambitions.\nFor more information, please visit www.loopindustries.com .\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements.\" Such statements may be preceded by the words \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"projects,\" \"predicts,\" \"estimates,\" \"aims,\" \"believes,\" \"hopes,\" \"potential\" or similar words.
