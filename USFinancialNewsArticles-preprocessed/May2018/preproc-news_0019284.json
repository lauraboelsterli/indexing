    "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla., May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: HRTG) (\"Heritage\" or the \"Company\"), a property and casualty insurance holding company, today reported its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nBook value per share increased 19.1% quarter-over-quarter to $15.09 as of March 31, 2018 Operating income of $24.8 million $1.6 million of dividends paid in Q1 2018 Q1 2018 net income of $14.8 million and earnings per share of $0.58 Net combined ratio declined to 82.2% in Q1 2018 from 94.8% in Q1 2017 Stockholders' equity of $388.9 million at March 31, 2018 Premiums in force increased by 48% to $923.3 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $622.4 million at March 31, 2017 Repurchased 115,200 shares of our common stock in Q1 for an aggregate purchase price of $2 million Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.06 per share Hurricane Irma Closed 92% of approximately 32,000 Irma Claims Vertically integrated repair division continues to perform services related to Hurricane Irma claims\nBruce Lucas, the Company's Chairman and CEO, said, \"We believe our diversified business plan is paying off, as evidenced by our results. Year-over-year, our consolidated gross loss ratio declined 6.8 points to 23.4%. Our vertically integrated claims model and diversification away from AOB prone areas are favorably impacting our consolidated loss ratio, and were key factors in lowering our net combined ratio from 94.8% to 82.2% year-over-year. We are taking active steps to expand Contractors Alliance Network to all states, which we believe will positively impact future consolidated loss ratios. Additionally, we began an initiative in 2015 to diversify our business, which has been highly successful. We are no longer a Florida-only insurer and have transformed the company into a Super Regional Insurer, which is evident when looking at our consolidated total insured value by region, especially Florida, where the percentage of Florida TIV declined from 70.1% to 31.8% year-over-year. Finally, we have completed our 2018-2019 reinsurance program with favorable results. Year-over-year, our reinsurance costs only increased less than 1% on a risk adjusted basis, substantially better than our initial projections.\"\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nRevenue\nGross premiums written\n$\n204,366\n$\n142,235\n44%\nGross premiums earned\n$\n227,163\n$\n154,608\n47%\nCeded premiums\n$\n(121,055)\n$\n(62,432)\n94%\nNet premiums earned\n$\n106,108\n$\n92,176\n15%\nTotal revenues\n$\n112,026\n$\n99,293\n13%\nOperating income\n$\n24,817\n$\n11,890\n109%\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n19,997\n$\n9,709\n106%\nNet income\n$\n14,829\n$\n5,983\n148%\nPer Share Data:\nBook value per share\n$\n15.09\n$\n12.67\n19%\nEarnings per diluted share\n$\n0.55\n$\n0.21\n162%\nReturn on average equity - Net Income\n15.4%\n6.7%\n8.7\npts\nRatios to Gross Premiums Earned:\nCeded premium ratio\n53.3%\n40.3%\n13.0\npts\nGross loss ratio\n23.4%\n30.2%\n(6.8)\npts\nGross expense ratio\n15.0%\n26.4%\n(11.4)\npts\nCombined expense ratio - Gross\n91.7%\n96.9%\n(5.2)\npts\nRatios to Net Premiums Earned:\nNet loss ratio\n50.0%\n50.6%\n(0.6)\npts\nNet expense ratio\n32.2%\n44.2%\n(12.0)\npts\nCombined expense ratio - Net\n82.2%\n94.8%\n(12.6)\npts\nRatios\nCeded premium ratio. Our ceded premium ratio represents ceded premiums as a percentage of gross premiums earned.\nGross loss ratio. Our gross loss ratio represents losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoveries as a percentage of gross premiums earned.\nNet loss ratio. Our net loss ratio represents losses and loss adjustment expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned.\nGross expense ratio. Our gross expense ratio represents policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross premiums earned. Ceding commission income is reported as a reduction of policy acquisition and general and administrative costs.\nNet expense ratio. Our net expense ratio represents policy acquisition costs plus general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned. Ceding commission income is reported as a reduction of policy acquisition and general and administrative costs.\nCombined ratios. Our combined ratio on a gross basis represents the sum of ceded premiums, losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross premiums earned. Our combined ratio on a net basis represents the sum of losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned.\nThe combined ratio is the key measure of underwriting performance traditionally used in the property and casualty industry. A combined ratio under 100% generally reflects profitable underwriting results.\nQuarterly Financial Results\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $14.8 million compared to $6.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is attributable to inclusion of Narragansett Bay Insurance Company (\"NBIC\"), which we acquired on November 30, 2017, coupled with an increase in net income from our legacy Heritage companies.\nGross premiums written were $204.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $142.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is due to inclusion of NBIC premiums, partially offset by the impact of selective underwriting and exposure management at Heritage P&C aimed at improving Florida underwriting results.\nGross premiums earned were $227.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $154.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of NBIC gross premiums earned, partially offset by selective underwriting and exposure management aimed at improving underwriting results in Florida.\nCeded premiums as a percentage of gross premiums earned were 53.3% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 40.3% for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is a result of the quota share reinsurance agreements that NBIC has in place. Excluding the results of NBIC, the Company's ceded premium ratio would have been 38.3% for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe loss ratio on a net basis was 50.0% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 50.6% for the first quarter of 2017. While the net loss ratio was relatively consistent, we did experience higher loss ratios at Heritage P&C and NBIC, which was mitigated by profitability arising from utilization of our vertically integrated affiliate, Contractors Alliance Network.\nThe Company's expense ratio on a net basis was 32.2% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 44.2% for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 expense ratio benefited from ceding commission income earned by NBIC. We have included NBIC's first quarter ceding commission earned of approximately $19.0 million from its quota share agreements as a reduction to policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. Excluding the impact of NBIC, the expense ratio increased slightly to 45.5% in the first quarter of 2018 from 44.2% for the first quarter of 2017.\nOur combined ratio on a gross and net basis for the first quarter of 2018 was 91.7% and 82.2%, respectively. Our combined ratio on a gross and net basis for the first quarter of 2017 was 96.9% and 94.8%, respectively. The decrease in the gross and net combined ratios relates primarily to a lower loss ratio and a lower expense ratio driven by the favorable impact of ceding commission income on operating expenses.\nBook Value Analysis\nBook value per share increased 19.1% to $15.09 at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017.\nAs of\nBook Value Per Share\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nNumerator:\nCommon stockholders' equity\n$\n388,893\n$\n379,816\n$\n360,831\nDenominator:\nTotal Shares Outstanding\n25,769,806\n25,885,006\n28,479,232\nBook Value Per Common Share\n$\n15.09\n$\n14.67\n$\n12.67\nConference Call Details:\nTuesday, May 8, 2018 â€“ 8:30 a.m. EDT\nParticipant Dial-in Numbers Toll Free: 1-888-346-3095\nParticipant International Dial In: 1-412-902-4258\nCanada Toll Free: 1-855-669-9657\nWebcast:\nTo listen to the live webcast, please go to http://investors.heritagepci.com/ .
