    "text": "May 21, 2018 / 1:34 AM / Updated 13 hours ago Golf-Wise clinches first PGA Tour win in Texas Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMay 20 (Reuters) - South African-born American Aaron Wise clinched his first PGA Tour title in only his 26th start on Sunday, an empathic three-shot win at the AT&T Byron Nelson in Texas.\nTwo weeks after finishing equal second in Charlotte, Wise went one better when he carded a closing six-under 65 at Trinity Forest in Dallas.\nWatched by a gallery including former U.S. president George W. Bush, 21-year-old Wise pulled away from the field after starting the final round tied with Marc Leishman.\nHe notched six birdies in a seven-hole stretch from the fourth and was never challenged thereafter, finishing at 23-under 261.\nAustralian Leishman shot a final-round 68 for second place on 20-under.\nPGA Tour rookie Wise, who moved with his parents to the U.S. at the age of three, had an outstanding amateur career and won the American collegiate championship in 2016 before turning pro.
