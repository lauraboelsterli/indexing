(“ Red Rocks ”). The sale, which closed on May 9, 2018, consisted primarily of Titanium’s interests in conventional operated and non-operated wells and certain unit rights in associated shallow and deep conventional horizons. Red Rocks also acquired all right, title and interest in the McLemore and Maddux units in the SCOOP. Following the closing, Titanium will retain a significant core SCOOP position consisting of (a) all of its interests in operated and non-operated horizontal wells, and (b) all rights from the top of the Springer shale to the base of the Hunton formation, including approximately 9,200 net acres in the Mississippian formation and 10,600 net acres in the Woodford formation, and will retain all of its STACK play assets that were not impacted by the Red Rocks transaction.
