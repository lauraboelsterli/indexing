    "text": "May 18 (Reuters) - The lead June 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures contract slipped on Friday, pressured by a rise in Tokyo shares to 3-1/2-month highs, as well as weakness in U.S. Treasuries.\nThe Bank of Japan’s offer on Friday to buy medium- and long-term bonds helped limit losses in JGB futures, market participants said.\nJune 10-year JGB futures eased 0.02 point to 150.67 .\nShort-term players were cited as selling long-term and super-long JGBs, with the benchmark 10-year JGB yield inching up 0.5 basis point to 0.060 percent.\nPrices of U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell in Friday’s Asian trading, pushing their yields to seven-year highs. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.128 percent at one point, the highest since July 2011, and last stood near 3.122 percent .\nJapan’s Nikkei share average rose to a 3-1/2-month high after a weaker yen lifted exporters.
