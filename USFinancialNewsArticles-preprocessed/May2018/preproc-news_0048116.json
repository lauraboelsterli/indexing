    "text": "May 22 (Reuters) - U.S. department store chain Kohl’s Corp reported a 13.6 percent increase in quarterly profit on Tuesday, as efforts to cut back on discounts and maintain a leaner inventory paid off.\nKohl’s said net income rose to $75 million or 45 cents per share in the first quarter ended May 5, from $66 million or 39 cents per share a year earlier.\nSales at Kohl’s stores open for at least 12 months climbed 3.6 percent, compared with the 2.7 percent increase expected by analysts on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ",
