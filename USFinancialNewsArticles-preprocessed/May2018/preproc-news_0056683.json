    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments about Iran “untrue” and based on “old illusions” on Wednesday and said Washington had become a hostage to pressure groups.\nIran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif arrives at the EU council in Brussels, Belgium May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Two days earlier, Pompeo had said Washington would impose sanctions on Iran if it did not curb its regional and military influence and accused Tehran of supporting armed groups in countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.\nZarif said Pompeo had repeated old allegations against Tehran “only with a stronger and more indecent tone”.\n“Pompeo and other U.S. officials are trapped in old illusions ... They are taken hostage by corrupt pressure groups,” Zarif said in a live interview on state television.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin\n ",
