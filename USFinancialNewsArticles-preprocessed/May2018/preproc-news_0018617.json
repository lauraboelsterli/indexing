    "text": "4 COMMENTS For many students, repaying college loans is an uphill battle that continues to steepen.\nSome 44.7 million Americans were carrying student debt as of the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 22.5 million people in 2004, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel, which analyzes credit records from Equifax, the consumer-credit reporting firm. In total, student-loan debt stood at $1.4 trillion nationwide as of the fourth quarter of 2017, according to the New York Fed’s quarterly report on household debt and credit.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/FundsETFs More in Investing in Funds & ETFs How Midterm Elections Hurt Stocks Coin-Roll Hunting Is a Tough Hobby Author David Bach on His Best and Worst Investments How to Navigate ‘529’ Transfers Investors Trip in the ‘Return Gap’ While the ability to repay loans depends on many factors, experts say there are ways for students to pay down their debt ahead of schedule—and achieve significant savings.\n1. Borrow only what you need Many students think once they have taken a federal or private loan it is theirs for the duration, but, in reality, they may be able to return some or all of the funds if they realize in a timely manner that they don’t need them. This could be the case if the student receives an unexpected scholarship or has significantly lower-than-expected expenses.\nFor federal loans, students can ask their school’s financial-aid office to return a portion or all of the loan within 120 days of disbursement at no penalty, says Justin Draeger, president and chief executive of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. Most private student loans will also allow students to return or cancel a portion of the funds, but terms may vary, he says.\nAlthough students may feel tempted to keep unneeded loan money as a safety cushion, it isn’t advisable. “The fact is you’re going to be paying interest on whatever you’ve borrowed, so if you don’t need it, return it,” Mr. Draeger says.\n2. Choose your repayment plan carefully Loans have different repayment plans depending on factors such as the type of loan and whether it is a federal loan or private loan, so it is especially important to understand the various repayment options. The longer it takes to pay off the loan, the longer a borrower will continue to accrue interest, so in most cases, the sooner a student can pay off the loan the better. Many lenders have calculators on their websites so students can understand the impact of the repayment options.\nWith federal loans, students who can afford to pay their loans off quickly should select the “Standard Repayment Plan.” Under this plan, a student’s loans will be paid off after 10 years of payments, unless he or she decides to consolidate them. Otherwise, students should select an income-driven repayment plan. These plans set payment at a percentage of income and typically have a lower monthly payment than other plans. Students can switch to a different plan at any time.\nPrivate student loans, meanwhile, offer various repayment options. These may include interest-only payments while a student is in school, a set monthly payment for students in school or deferred payment until after a student graduates.\n3. Make payments while in school, if you are able With most loans, students will have a six-month grace period—or nine months for Federal Perkins Loans—after graduating, leaving school or dropping below half-time enrollment before they must begin making their loan payments.\nExperts recommend students chip away at some of the debt before the grace period ends—even while they are in school and even if it is only a few dollars a month. Paying some money before it is due doesn’t alter the grace period, and it can make a significant difference in the total amount due.\nHere’s an example courtesy of Sallie Mae, a private student-loan company. Assume a student has a loan with a current balance of $10,000, at an interest rate of 8.0% and a repayment term of 10 years.\nIf the student pays the amount due every month, he or she will make 119 monthly payments of $121.32, with a final payment of $119.89, for a total payment of $14,556.97. However, by paying an extra $20 a month, it becomes 96 monthly payments of $141.32 with a final payment of $7.10. The student would pay off the loan in eight years and one month—about two years earlier than with the standard repayment term—and save $983.15 in the process.\n“Just because you are allowed to hold off on making payments doesn’t mean it is necessarily in your best interest,” says Ellen Roberts, a spokeswoman for Sallie Mae.\nSome private lenders even offer perks to students who choose to pay off some debt while they are in school. College Ave Student Loans, for instance, will lower the interest rate for making payments early, says Joe DePaulo, the company’s chief executive. “The bigger the payment, the more we lower the rate,” he says.\n4. Make extra payments when you can Student loan recipients always have the option to pay more than the minimum required amount at no penalty. They don’t need to make an extra payment every single month; they can do it as their budget allows. “Once you graduate, even if you add a little more to your payment, it will help chip away at the interest,” Mr. DePaulo says.\nThe Education Department recommends that students tell their loan servicer explicitly that any extra payments are to be applied immediately and aren’t intended to be put toward future payments.\nOne caveat: For students planning on using a loan-forgiveness program in the future based on their chosen field of employment, making payments while still in school or paying more than the required minimum after the grace period ends won’t likely be in their best interest, so it is important to plan appropriately, says Mr. Draeger.\n5. Enroll in automatic debit Students may also be able to save money by having payments automatically taken from their bank account each month. Federal loans and several private lenders offer an interest-rate deduction for enrolling in this service.\nMs. Winokur Munk is a writer in West Orange, N.J. She can be reached at reports@wsj.com .",
