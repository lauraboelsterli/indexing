    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 4:23 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Russian foreign minister Lavrov plans to visit North Korea - agencies Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov plans to visit North Korea, Russian news agencies quoted a foreign ministry spokeswoman as saying on Wednesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attends a meeting with Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano in Moscow, Russia May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\nDates for the trip have yet to be agreed, she said. Earlier, the RBC news portal wrote that Lavrov would travel to North Korea on May 31.\nThat would mean him visiting before a proposed summit in Singapore between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nOn Tuesday, Trump cast doubt on plans for that meeting, which has been scheduled for June 12.\nRussia is considered an ally of North Korea, but has supported United Nations sanctions against it over Pyongyangâ€™s nuclear programme.\nLavrov accepted an invitation to visit North Korea last month.
