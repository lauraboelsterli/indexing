Markle also wanted to highlight the success of a leading British talent and the two worked closely together, according to the statement.\nWINDSOR, UNITED KINGDOM - MAY 19: Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and The Duchess of Sussex depart following their wedding in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England.
