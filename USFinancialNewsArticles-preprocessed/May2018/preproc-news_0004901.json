    "text": "SAN ANTONIO, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pioneer Energy Services (NYSE: PES) today reported financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. First quarter notable items include:\nDomestic drilling services utilization was 100%, with an average margin per day of $10,436, up 11% from the prior quarter, and up for the fourth consecutive quarter. International drilling services average margin per day was $8,455, up 28% from the prior quarter, with seven of the eight rigs working at quarter end. Production services business revenue increased 20% from the prior quarter and generated a gross margin of 24%.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $144.5 million, up 14% from revenues of $126.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (\"the prior quarter\") and up 51% from revenues of $95.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 (\"the year-earlier quarter\"). The increase from the prior quarter is primarily attributable to increased demand in wireline and well servicing, as well as increased utilization in Colombia where three additional rigs were put to work since the beginning of the prior quarter.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.1 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with net loss of $12.6 million, or $0.16 per share, in the prior quarter and net loss of $25.1 million, or $0.33 per share, in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted net loss (1) for the first quarter was $6.9 million, and adjusted EPS (2) was a loss of $0.09 per share as compared to adjusted net loss of $11.1 million, or an adjusted EPS loss of $0.14 per share, in the prior quarter.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA (3) was $23.4 million, up from $17.0 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by increased demand for our wireline services, improved dayrates for our domestic drilling services, and higher utilization in Colombia, and up from $6.0 million in the year-earlier quarter. The increase from the year-earlier quarter was due to higher demand for all of our service offerings as the market steadily improved with increasing commodity prices throughout 2017 and 2018.\nOperating Results\nProduction Services Business\nRevenue from our production services business was $90.9 million in the first quarter, up 20% from the prior quarter and up 60% from the year-earlier quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue from our production services business was 24% in the first quarter, up from 22% in the prior quarter and up from 20% in the year-earlier quarter.\nThe increase in revenues from the prior quarter was driven by increased demand and revenue rates for all businesses, led by wireline which was up 25% sequentially. Well servicing and coiled tubing revenues were up 15% and 7%, respectively. As compared to the year-earlier quarter, demand has improved for all of our production services business segments, resulting in increased revenues of 60%.\nThe number of wireline jobs completed in the first quarter increased by 9% sequentially and decreased by 1% as compared to the year-earlier quarter, and continue to be weighted to more completion-related jobs. Well servicing average revenue per hour was $518 in the first quarter, flat as compared to the prior quarter and up from $497 in the year-earlier quarter. Well servicing rig utilization was 47% in the first quarter, up from 40% in the prior quarter and 43% in the year-earlier quarter. Coiled tubing revenue days totaled 414 in the first quarter, compared to 423 in the prior quarter and 338 in the year-earlier quarter.\nDrilling Services Business\nRevenue from our drilling services business was $53.5 million in the first quarter, a 6% increase from the prior quarter and a 37% increase from the year-earlier quarter.\nDomestic drilling services rig utilization was 100% for both the first quarter and the prior quarter, and up from 86% in the year-earlier quarter. Domestic drilling average revenues per day were $24,949 in the first quarter, up from $23,993 in the prior quarter and up from $22,951 in the year-earlier quarter. Domestic drilling average margin per day was $10,436 in the first quarter, up from $9,411 in the prior quarter and up from $7,154 in the year-earlier quarter, driven by increasing dayrates and minimal operational downtime.\nInternational rig utilization was 76% for the first quarter, up from 65% in the prior quarter and up from 44% in the year-earlier quarter. International drilling average revenues per day were $32,020, up from $31,188 in the prior quarter and down from $33,347 in the year-earlier quarter. International drilling average margin per day for the first quarter was $8,455, up from $6,582 in the prior quarter and down from $9,603 in the year-earlier quarter. We mobilized a seventh rig in Colombia that began operations in mid-March.\nCurrently, all 16 of our domestic drilling rigs are earning revenues, 14 of which are under term contracts, and seven of our eight rigs in Colombia are earning revenue, resulting in current utilization of 96%.\nComments from our President and CEO\n\"We had an exceptionally good start to 2018,\" said Wm. Stacy Locke, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Revenue in the first quarter was up 14% sequentially and adjusted EBITDA increased by 38%. Domestic drilling, international drilling and wireline services all outperformed our expectations, while well servicing and coiled tubing services experienced solid improvement.\n\"Our domestic drilling operations achieved an 11% increase in average margins per day by controlling daily costs and improving daily revenues to yield the highest margins in our peer group. Similarly, our international drilling operations recorded a notable improvement in revenue and a 28% increase in average margin per day as a seventh rig was put to work in mid-March. Colombia has become a bright spot for the Company, and now that start up costs and initial mobilizations are behind us, the outlook for our international drilling operations for the remainder of the year is positive with improving profitability.\n\"In production services, demand for our businesses continued to strengthen in the first quarter. Given the current commodity price levels and indications from clients on anticipated activity levels, we expect to continue to reactivate idled equipment and improve pricing in all three businesses throughout the year.\n\"While the market continues to improve and present opportunities for targeted organic growth, we will maintain our focus on generating positive cash flow in 2018,\" Mr. Locke said.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance\nIn the second quarter of 2018, revenue from our production services business segments is estimated to be up approximately 7% to 10% as compared to the first quarter of 2018. Margin from our production services business is estimated to be 25% to 27% of revenue. Domestic drilling services rig utilization is estimated to be 100% and generate average margins per day of approximately $10,000 to $10,500. International drilling services rig utilization is estimated to average 83% to 86%, and generate average margins per day of approximately $8,000 to $9,000.\nLiquidity\nWorking capital at March 31, 2018 was $132.2 million, up from $130.6 million at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, were $70.7 million, down from $75.6 million at year-end 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we used $11.7 million of cash for the purchase of property and equipment, and our cash provided by operations was $5.1 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nCash capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2018 were $11.7 million. We estimate total cash capital expenditures for 2018 to be approximately $60 million, which includes approximately $40 million of routine capital expenditures and $20 million for the purchase of two large-diameter coiled tubing units, remaining payments on three wireline units, two of which were delivered in January, and additional drilling and production services equipment. As the year progresses, we will continue to evaluate additional discretionary spending provided that it can be funded by cash from operations or proceeds from sales of non-strategic assets.\nConference Call\nPioneer Energy Services' management team will hold a conference call today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central Time) to discuss these results.

Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including general economic and business conditions and industry trends, levels and volatility of oil and gas prices, the continued demand for drilling services or production services in the geographic areas where we operate, decisions about exploration and development projects to be made by oil and gas exploration and production companies, the highly competitive nature of our business, technological advancements and trends in our industry and improvements in our competitors' equipment, the loss of one or more of our major clients or a decrease in their demand for our services, future compliance with covenants under debt agreements, including our senior secured term loan, our senior secured revolving asset-based credit facility, and our senior notes, operating hazards inherent in our operations, the supply of marketable drilling rigs, well servicing rigs, coiled tubing units and wireline units within the industry, the continued availability of new components for drilling rigs, well servicing rigs, coiled tubing units and wireline units, the continued availability of qualified personnel, the success or failure of our acquisition strategy, including our ability to finance acquisitions, manage growth and effectively integrate acquisitions, the political, economic, regulatory and other uncertainties encountered by our operations, and changes in, or our failure or inability to comply with, governmental regulations, including those relating to the environment. We have discussed many of these factors in more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, including under the headings \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in the Introductory Note to Part I and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A. These factors are not necessarily all the important factors that could affect us. Other unpredictable or unknown factors could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We advise our shareholders that they should (1) recognize that important factors not referred to above could affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and (2) use caution and common sense when considering our forward-looking statements.\nThis news release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. A reconciliation of each such measure to its most directly comparable U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measure, together with an explanation of why management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, is provided in the following tables.\n(1)\nAdjusted net loss represents net loss as reported adjusted to exclude impairments and loss on extinguishment of debt and the related tax benefit, valuation allowance adjustments on deferred tax assets and effect of change in tax rates. We believe that adjusted net loss is a useful measure to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance and to evaluate our long-term financial performance against that of our peers, although it is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted net loss may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net loss as reported to adjusted net loss is included in the tables to this news release.\n(2)\nAdjusted (diluted) EPS represents adjusted net loss divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period, including the effect of dilutive securities, if any. We believe that adjusted (diluted) EPS is a useful measure to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance and to evaluate our long-term financial performance against that of our peers, although it is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted (diluted) EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of diluted EPS as reported to adjusted (diluted) EPS is included in the tables to this news release.\n(3)\nAdjusted EBITDA represents income (loss) before interest expense, income tax (expense) benefit, depreciation and amortization, and any loss on extinguishment of debt or impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that our management uses to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance and to evaluate our long-term financial performance against that of our peers. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and analysts in allowing for greater transparency of our core operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with those of other companies within our industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered (a) in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income (loss), (b) as an indication of cash flows from operating activities or (c) as a measure of liquidity. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary use. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net loss as reported to adjusted EBITDA is included in the tables to this news release.\nContacts:\nDan Petro, CFA, Treasurer and\nDirector of Investor Relations\nPioneer Energy Services Corp.\n(210) 828-7689\nLisa Elliott / lelliott@dennardlascar.com\nAnne Pearson / apearson@dennardlascar.com\nDennard Lascar Investor Relations / (713) 529-6600\n- Financial Statements and Operating Information Follow -\nPIONEER ENERGY SERVICES CORP.

We believe that adjusted net loss is a useful measure to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance and to evaluate our long-term financial performance against that of our peers, although it is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted net loss may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net loss as reported to adjusted net loss is included in the table above.\n(3) Adjusted (diluted) EPS represents adjusted net loss divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period, including the effect of dilutive securities, if any. We believe that adjusted (diluted) EPS is a useful measure to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance and to evaluate our long-term financial performance against that of our peers, although it is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted (diluted) EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
