REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo\nThe euro rose for a second day as the greenback retreated further from a 2018 peak reached earlier this week. The single currency, however, was still on track for a loss for a fourth straight week against the dollar.\n“People are taking profits. The move is losing some steam,” Chuck Tomes, senior investment analyst at Manulife Asset Management in Boston, said of the dollar’s rise that started in mid-April and Friday’s profit-taking.\nAt 11:22 a.m. (1522 GMT), an index that tracks the dollar versus six currencies .DXY was down 0.05 percent at 92.603. It hit its strongest level of the year at 93.416 on Wednesday.\nThe dollar index was poised to end flat on the week, snapping three straight weeks of gains.\nThe euro scored a 0.2 percent gain at $1.1935 EUR= and a 0.25 percent rise against the Japanese currency at 130.59 yen EURJPY=.\nOn the week, the common currency was set to fall 0.15 percent against the greenback and to eke out about a 0.08 percent gain versus the yen.\nA loss of economic momentum in Europe has made policymakers in Europe and Britain more cautious about ending 2008 financial crisis-era policies.\nOn Friday, ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone needs a new “fiscal instrument” to help weaker member nations if they are being overly penalized by investors during a debt crisis.\nTraders pushed out expectations of a U.K. rate hike to end-2018 and the European Central Bank boosting interest rates in the second half of 2019.\nU.S. interest rates futures implied traders expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise key borrowing costs at least twice more in 2018 FFM8 FFN8.\n“We are finally starting to see the dollar rise meaningfully and I think this move has further legs to run given the divergence in monetary policy trends between U.S. and Europe,” said SEB senior currency strategist Richard Falkenhall, who expects the euro to weaken to about $1.15.\nNot all European central bankers seemed willing to keep policy loose.\nEarlier this week, several policymakers at Riksbank signaled the possibility of higher interest rates in the fall amid a surging economy, helping to spark a rally in the Swedish crown.\nThe Swedish currency SEK= gained 0.6 percent at 9.5968 crowns per dollar, putting on track for the best weekly gain versus the greenback since late June 2017. It was on course for its strongest weekly increase versus the euro EURSEK= since February 2010, Reuters data showed.
