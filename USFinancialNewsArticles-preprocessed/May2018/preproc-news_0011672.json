    "text": "(Reuters) - Mexico’s Supreme Court set an important precedent in February that should make it easier for securities and banking regulator CNBV to overturn gag orders that prevent it from naming violators.\nAt least 13 Mexican executives and companies have filed suits to block the CNBV from using powers given to it in 2014 to publish sanctions, according to officials, court documents and the CNBV’s database.\nHere are some of the biggest cases in which the CNBV won the right in lower courts to publish limited details of the charges:\n($1 = 19.0850 Mexican pesos)\nReporting by Michael O'Boyle, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ",
