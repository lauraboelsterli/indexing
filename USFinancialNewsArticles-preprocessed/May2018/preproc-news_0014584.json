It also described Ganapathy as leading a team managing “covert operations” for its clients. It did not elaborate.\nPhil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said the deal was a “disaster for media freedom”, telling Reuters that “the only plausible rationale for this acquisition is to blunt the Post’s critical coverage of the government.”\nReuters called Asia PR’s headquarters seeking comment, and was told that Ganapathy was not available. In response to an email, his assistant, Krishna Kumaar, said Ganapathy was expected to return in two weeks.\nCalls to Asia PR’s Phnom Penh office were unanswered.\n“They fired me,” the newspaper’s editor-in-chief, Kay Kimsong, told Reuters, adding the reason was a report the newspaper published about the sale.\n“They said that as editor-in-chief I allowed the story about the sale of the Phnom Penh Post to be published.”\nFour other staff members said on Twitter on Monday they had resigned including Brendan O’Byrne, who said the new management had ordered him to remove the online version of the report about the sale of the newspaper.\n“I refused and offered my resignation, which was accepted,” O’Byrne wrote on Twitter.\nThe Overseas Press Club of Cambodia (OPCC) voiced its concerns about the sale “to a Malaysian investor whose PR company is connected to Prime Minister Hun Sen”.\nHuy Vannak, undersecretary of state at the Interior Ministry, told Reuters the government welcomed “all investors” to Cambodia.\nHe did not specifically address links between the newspaper’s new owner and the government.\nAbout 30 radio stations were shut last year and the Cambodia Daily, an English-language newspaper, shut down after it was ordered to pay millions of dollars in back taxes by the government or face closure.\nIn a 2018 press freedom index published by Reporters Without Borders, Cambodia dropped 10 places from 132 to 142.\nFounded in 1992, the Phnom Penh Post was reportedly slapped with a $5 million tax bill last year, according to reports by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\nIn a statement on Saturday, former owner Clough said the tax issue had been resolved, and that the sale was prompted by a “worldwide decline in market share for newspaper advertising” which had also been felt in Cambodia.\nAdditional reporting by Phnom Penh bureau and Prak Chan Thul Writing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\nOur ",
