    "text": "NEW YORK, May 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL), the New York-based specialty athletic retailer, reported today financial results for its first quarter ended May 5, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Results\nNet income for the Company's first quarter ended May 5, 2018 was $165 million, or $1.38 per share, compared to net income of $180 million, or $1.36 per share in the same period of fiscal 2017. This result included an incremental $12 million charge related to the Company's pension litigation. Excluding this charge, which reduced after-tax earnings by 7 cents per share, non-GAAP earnings were $1.45 per share.\nFirst quarter comparable-store sales decreased 2.8 percent. Total first quarter sales increased 1.2 percent, to $2,025 million this year, compared to sales of $2,001 million for the corresponding prior-year period. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, total sales for the first quarter decreased 1.5 percent.\nThe Company's gross margin rate decreased to 32.9 percent from 34 percent a year ago, while the SG&A expense rate increased to 19 percent from 18.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting the significant investments the Company is making in its digital operations.\n\"The flow of premium product continues to improve, with increasing breadth and depth in the most sought after styles from our key vendors,\" said Richard Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"This led to first quarter results which were above our expectations. With the strength of our strategic vendor partnerships and our central position in youth culture, we continue to believe that we are poised to inflect to positive comparable-store sales growth as we progress through the year.\"\nFinancial Position\nAs of May 5, 2018, the Company's merchandise inventories were $1,210 million, 5.4 percent lower than at the end of the first quarter last year. Using constant currencies, inventory decreased 7.1 percent.\n\"The team did an excellent job in managing our inventories and helping to clear slow moving product in a promotional environment, giving us the flexibility to flow in fresh and exciting product,\" said Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"This disciplined approach positions our inventory to drive improved top and bottom line results over the balance of the year.\"\nThe Company's cash totaled $1,029 million, while the debt on its balance sheet was $125 million. The Company spent $112 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares during the quarter and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.345 per share, spending $41 million.\nStore Base Update\nDuring the first quarter, the Company opened 11 new stores, remodeled or relocated 43 stores, and closed 37 stores. As of May 5, 2018, the Company operated 3,284 stores in 24 countries in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In addition, 105 franchised Foot Locker stores were operating in the Middle East, as well as 11 franchised Runners Point stores in Germany.\nThe Company is hosting a live conference call at 9:00 a.m. (EDT) today, May 25, 2018, to review these results and discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2018.

In the following table, we have presented certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or which affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives. Also, we present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our businesses that are not related to currency movements.\nThe non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results:\nFirst Quarter\n2018\n2017\nSales\n$\n2,025\n$\n2,001\nPre-tax income:\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n229\n$\n269\nPre-tax adjustments excluded from GAAP:\nLitigation charge (1)\n12\n—\nAdjusted income before income taxes (non-GAAP)\n$\n241\n$\n269\nAfter-tax income:\nNet income\n$\n165\n$\n180\nAfter-tax adjustments excluded from GAAP:\nLitigation charge, net of income tax benefit of $3 and $- million, respectively (1)\n9\n—\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP)\n$\n174\n$\n180\nEarnings per share:\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.38\n$\n1.36\nDiluted EPS amounts excluded from GAAP:\nLitigation charge (1)\n0.07\n—\nAdjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP)\n$\n1.45\n$\n1.36\nNotes on Non-GAAP Adjustments:\n(1)\nThe Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $12 million in connection with its U.S. retirement plan litigation during the first quarter of 2018. As disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company must reform the pension plan and the amount accrued will continue to increase with interest until paid, as required by the provisions of the required plan reformation. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $4 million representing this increase. Additionally, the amount accrued was increased by $7 million reflecting updated estimates of the cost of reformation. Finally, we incurred $1 million in administrative costs associated with the reformation.\nThe Company applied a marginal tax rate on the non-GAAP adjustment.\nFoot Locker, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(unaudited)\n(In millions)\nMay 5,\nApril 29,\n2018\n2017\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,029\n$\n1,049\nMerchandise inventories\n1,210\n1,279\nOther current assets\n301\n294\n2,540\n2,622\nProperty and equipment, net\n843\n792\nDeferred taxes\n104\n162\nOther assets\n476\n301\n$\n3,963\n$\n3,877\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n344\n$\n208\nAccrued and other liabilities\n309\n327\n653\n535\nLong-term debt\n125\n127\nOther liabilities\n642\n393\nTotal liabilities\n1,420\n1,055\nTotal shareholders' equity\n2,543\n2,822\n$\n3,963\n$\n3,877\nFoot Locker, Inc.\nStore and Square Footage\n(unaudited)\nStore activity is as follows:\nFebruary 3,\nMay 5,\nRelocations/\n2018\nOpened\nClosed\n2018\nRemodels\nFoot Locker US\n910\n—\n7\n903\n14\nFoot Locker Europe\n636\n5\n2\n639\n14\nFoot Locker Canada\n111\n—\n3\n108\n2\nFoot Locker Asia Pacific\n98\n2\n1\n99\n4\nKids Foot Locker\n436\n1\n4\n433\n1\nLady Foot Locker\n85\n—\n5\n80\n—\nChamps Sports\n541\n1\n5\n537\n5\nFootaction\n260\n—\n5\n255\n3\nRunners Point\n118\n2\n3\n117\n—\nSidestep\n83\n—\n1\n82\n—\nSIX:02\n32\n—\n1\n31\n—\nTotal\n3,310\n11\n37\n3,284\n43\nSelling and gross square footage are as follows:\nFebruary 3, 2018\nMay 5, 2018\n(in thousands)\nSelling\nGross\nSelling\nGross\nFoot Locker US\n2,430\n4,225\n2,425\n4,216\nFoot Locker Europe\n957\n2,071\n963\n2,084\nFoot Locker Canada\n264\n431\n262\n426\nFoot Locker Asia Pacific\n140\n230\n144\n236\nKids Foot Locker\n747\n1,285\n745\n1,281\nLady Foot Locker\n115\n195\n108\n185\nChamps Sports\n1,934\n2,994\n1,926\n2,982\nFootaction\n829\n1,374\n818\n1,359\nRunners Point\n150\n258\n148\n256\nSidestep\n76\n131\n76\n129\nSIX:02\n65\n109\n63\n106\nTotal\n7,707\n13,303\n7,678\n13,260\nContact:\nJames R.
