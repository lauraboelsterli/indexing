    "text": "Reblog Co. is resuming production of F-150 and Super Duty trucks ahead of schedule at three assembly plants after a fire earlier this month at one of its supplierâ€™s facilities created a parts shortage. By Monday, the company expects to restart production on Super Duty trucks at a plant in Louisville, Ky., and F-150s at its Kansas City, Mo., assembly plant. Ford expects the production stoppage to dent second-quarter per-share earnings by 12 cents to 14 cents.",
