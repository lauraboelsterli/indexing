    "text": "ST PETERSBURG, May 26 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Marubeni Corporation has signed a deal to help build a methanol production plant and create a chemical cluster in the Russian city of Volgograd, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Saturday.\nThe project involves the construction of a plant with an annual capacity of 0.6-1.0 million tonnes of methanol. The plant has secured access to gas supplies of 1 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, rising potentially to 2-2.5 bcm, RDIF said.\nAEON Infrastructure Corporation, a private international investment and industrial group, is also party to the agreement which was signed at an economic forum in St Petersburg.
