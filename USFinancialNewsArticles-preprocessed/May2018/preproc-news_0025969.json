    "text": "LAS VEGAS, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Via OTC PR Wire – Adama Technologies Corp. (OTCPINK:ADAC) Corp. announced today an update to their customer acquisition strategy. The Company stated that they would implement new upgrades to their software and customer relationship management applications to enable them to bid jobs online, automate commercial customer acquisition, and also to track job progress and create automated customer updates within a newly designed online portal.\nHarold Tanner, President of Adama Technologies, commented, “We have been making a strong push for new government contracts and we are bidding and winning contracts within that sector at a record pace. We do, however, also want to continue to develop our private sector jobs and this new initiative will enable us to do that in a more efficient, competitive and customer-focused manner.”\nThe Company stated earlier in the year that a diversified customer portfolio was one of their key objectives for the new year, the intent was to allow a more balanced approach to revenue. Mr. Tanner continued, “Our plan is not to slow down on the government contracts, we are actually expanding and growing in that area. We do, however, plan to be much more aggressive on the private commercial contracts. We have already made great strides by adding a private lighting company to our customer base and have numerous other contracts we are working on adding as well. The key to this strategy is to add several new software upgrades that will make winning these private contracts much easier and create a more seamless and efficient customer experience. The initiative we are announcing today will make a dramatic difference in our ability to interact with our customers and to generate new customer leads, bids and revenue.”\nThe Company stated that they will continue to keep investors updated through continued press updates as well as through their social media outlets. The Company also remarked that work on a new corporate website had begun in earnest.\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AdamaTech\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/adamatech/\nAbout Adama Technologies Military Defense Operations\nAdama Technologies completed the acquisition of Alpine Industries in November of 2016.
