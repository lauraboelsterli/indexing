    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reliam LLC (Reliam), a consulting and managed services provider for public cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services (AWS), today announced a significant investment into recruiting efforts focused on building out the sales and marketing teams that support its managed AWS offerings. As part of this initiative to expand Reliam’s talent base and capabilities as a world-class platform sales and marketing organization, the public cloud services provider will be actively hiring sales staff, solution architects, customer success personnel, and other key positions essential to supporting Reliam’s business growth.\nKicking off this recruiting initiative, Reliam is announcing that Ted Stuart has joined as Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). Stuart comes to Reliam from DAZ Systems, where he served as Senior Vice President of Sales and helped steer the company’s growth from a leading regional Oracle services provider to an established national firm. Prior to DAZ, Stuart was Senior VP, Sales & Field Operations at Deem. Previously, as Area VP at Oracle, he managed the corporation’s applications business for the Central U.S. region – responsible for $120 million dollars in net new business annually and more than 200 sales resources – and led that business unit’s successful transition from on-premise to the cloud. In his new role as Reliam CRO, Stuart’s responsibilities will include overseeing all sales and customer success strategy and personnel, as well as driving revenue growth.\nThis quick ramping up of sales and marketing staffing directly follows the recent additions of Stratalux and G2 Tech Group . The united organization has merged three AWS Advanced Consulting Partners with similar cultures and a shared vision of what the AWS cloud can achieve for businesses. These companies now form a single team capable of delivering a significantly greater breadth of technical expertise and support, and serve a nation-wide client base from offices on both coasts. The sizeable sales and marketing investments will introduce new customers to the many operational, efficiency, and cost benefits that expertly-managed AWS can provide.\n“Our newly combined company offers highly regarded expertise in AWS management, consulting, and support – and we’re quickly building up our sales and marketing teams to support growth,” said Simon Anderson, CEO, Reliam. “As we begin investing and recruiting around this need, I’m proud to introduce Ted Stuart as our CRO, knowing that his talent and industry knowledge ensure he’s the first of many great hires we’ll be making.”\n“Being familiar with his track record of success as a driver of sales growth and revenue in the managed cloud space, we offer Ted a warm welcome to Reliam,” said David Pichardo, Partner Sales Manager at Amazon Web Services. “At the same time, we’re excited to see the sales and marketing investments that Reliam is making to promote its respected capabilities as an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, as well as the rapid pace of growth that the company has set following its mergers with Stratalux and G2 Tech Group.”\n“Reliam, now in combination with Stratalux and G2 Tech Group, is in an excellent position as a distinguished provider of cloud managed services that’s posed for expansive growth on the national stage,” said Ted Stuart, CRO, Reliam. “I’m eager to scale the business and help Reliam reach more customers seeking to fully optimize their public cloud initiatives.”\nAbout Reliam\nReliam is a trusted consulting and managed services provider for public cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Businesses across industries depend on Reliam to expertly and securely architect, migrate, manage, and optimize their cloud environments. A certified partner of both AWS and Azure and backed by 16 years of experience, Reliam enables customers to focus on business and product development – and not on actively managing cloud infrastructure. Because of its proven cloud optimization strategies, Reliam consistently reduces customers’ IT spend while maintaining industry-leading SLAs.\nPress Contact Kyle Peterson kyle@clementpeterson.com\nSource: Reliam",
