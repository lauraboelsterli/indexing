    "text": "Brazilian farmer losses from truckers' strike reach 6.6 bln reais -CNA Published 5 Hours Ago Reuters\nSAO PAULO, May 29 (Reuters) - Brazil's CNA farm lobby said on Tuesday that producers have lost 6.6 billion reais ($1.76 billion) so far during a nationwide truckers protest over diesel prices that is now in its ninth day.\nCNA said in a statement that its estimate reflected only primary production losses and did not take into consideration losses for agriculture processors, industries and makers of inputs. CNA said it estimates it will take producers six months to a year to recover from the protest, which has paralyzed vast swaths of Brazil's economy.\n($1 = 3.7493 reais) (Reporting by Jose Roberto Gomes Writing by Brad Brooks Editing by Leslie Adler)",
