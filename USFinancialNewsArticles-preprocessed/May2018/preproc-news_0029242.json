    "text": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALSK) today reported financial results for 2018.\n“Our first quarter performance met our expectations and creates the foundation to achieve our annual goals. Our revenue decline for the quarter is attributable to compression in our health care vertical. The cost control measures we proactively put in place mitigated the impacts of this revenue compression resulting in stable Adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter.\nDemand drivers like small cell backhaul, opening up of Arctic markets with the recent fiber turn up by one of our partners and increased investments by companies in the energy sector will create opportunities powering our Enterprise & Carrier segment and driving growth for the next couple of years.\nAdditionally, we continue to make progress in Mass Market with our investments in fiber fed WiFi and fiber fed fixed wireless technologies. We are tracking to our CAF II deliverables, which will add to our performance in this segment over the next several years as well.\nWe look forward to reporting progress over the upcoming quarters,” said Anand Vadapalli, president and CEO of Alaska Communications.\nRevenue Highlights: First Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017\nTotal revenue: Revenue was $56.0 million, compared to $56.7 million.

We remain in compliance with our debt covenants despite delays in rural health care cash receipts, and retain the ability to create additional headroom through rigorous cash management and, if needed, by working with our lenders. Subsequent to quarter end, we retired our convertible debt on schedule and are pleased to have further simplified our balance sheet. We see great opportunity in the market and continue to invest for long term growth.”\nThe company provides guidance as follows:\nTotal Revenue between $225 million and $230 million Adjusted EBITDA between $55 million and $58 million Capital Expenditures between $33 million and $35 million Adjusted Free Cash Flow between $5 million and $8 million\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the results.

The company operates a highly reliable, advanced statewide data network with the latest technology and the most diverse undersea fiber optic system connecting Alaska to the contiguous U.S. For more information, visit www.alaskacommunications.com or www.alsk.com .\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Net Debt. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the effects of period to period changes in costs that are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company’s business operations and is used by Management and the Company’s Board of Directors to evaluate current operating financial performance, analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions and better evaluate comparability between periods. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measured used by Management and the Company’s Board of Directors to assess the Company’s ability to generate cash and plan for future operating and capital actions. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are common measures utilized by our peers (other telecommunications companies) and we believe they provide useful information to investors and analysts about the Company’s operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Net Debt provides Management and the Company’s Board of Directors with a measure of the Company’s current leverage position. The definition of these non-GAAP measures is provided on Schedules 4, 6 and 9 to this press release. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered a substitute for Net Income, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities and other measures of financial performance recorded in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to our nearest GAAP measures can be found in the tables in this release and on our website in the investment data section. Other companies may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner as Alaska Communications. The Company does not provide reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to Net Cash from Operating Activities, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company does not forecast certain items required to develop the comparable GAAP financial measures. These items are charges and benefits for uncollectible accounts, certain other non-cash expenses, unusual items typically excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, and changes in operating assets and liabilities (generally the most significant of these items, representing cash outflows of $2.4 million in the three-month period of 2018).\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events made using information currently available to management. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on statements, which are not a guarantee of performance and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the Company’s control. Such factors include, without limitation, Federal and Alaska Universal Service Fund changes, funding through the rural health care universal service support mechanism and our ability to comply with the regulatory requirements to receive those support payments, adverse economic conditions, the effects of competition in our markets, our relatively small size compared with our competitors, the Company’s ability to compete, manage, integrate, market, maintain, and attract sufficient customers for its products and services, adverse changes in labor matters, including workforce levels, our ability to service our debt and refinance as required, labor negotiations, employee benefit costs, our ability to control other operating costs, disruption of our supplier’s provisioning of critical products or services, the actions of activist shareholders, the impact of natural or man-made disasters, changes in Company's relationships with large customers, unforeseen changes in public policies, regulatory changes, changes in technology and standards, our internal control over financial reporting, and changes in accounting standards or policies, which could affect reported financial results. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s business, please refer to the Company's SEC filings, including, but not limited to, the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Adjusted EBITDA as computed above is not consistent with the definition of Consolidated EBITDA referenced in our 2017 Senior Credit Agreement and 2015 Senior Credit Agreements, and other companies may not calculate Non-GAAP measures in the same manner we do.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, loss on extinguishment of debt, depreciation and amortization, other (income) expense, gain or loss on asset purchases or disposals, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest.\nSchedule 5 ALASKA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS GROUP, INC.

Onetime events, seasonality of capital spend and the timing of interest payments may result in negative Adjusted Free Cash Flow in one or more quarters.\nNonGAAP Measures:\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure and is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, less recurring operating cash requirements which include capital expenditures, cash income taxes refunded or paid, cash interest paid, and amortization of GCI capacity revenue. Amortization of deferred revenue associated with our interconnection agreement with GCI is excluded from Adjusted Free Cash Flow because no cash was received by the Company in connection with this agreement. Amortization of all other deferred revenue, including that associated with other IRU capacity arrangements, is included in Adjusted Free Cash Flow because cash was received by the Company, typically at contract inception, and is being amortized to revenue over the term of the relevant agreement.\nSee Schedule 3 for Net cash provided by operating activities, Net cash used by investing activities, and Net cash (used) provided by financing activities.\nSee Schedule 5 for the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow.\nSchedule 7 ALASKA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS GROUP, INC.
