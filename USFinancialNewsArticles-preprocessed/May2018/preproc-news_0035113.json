This dividend was paid out on April 16, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\nNet income was $3.2 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 Pre-tax income increased 17.23% to $3.8 million, compared to $3.3 million in the preceding quarter Net interest margin was 4.03% compared to 4.01% in the preceding quarter and 4.34% in the first quarter of 2017 Annualized return on average assets was 1.00%, compared to 0.96% in the first quarter of 2017 Annualized return on average equity was 11.64%, compared to 11.28% in the first quarter of 2017 Total assets increased 11.19% to $1.30 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.17 billion at March 31, 2017 Total deposits increased 15.08% to $1.11 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $966.9 million at March 31, 2017 Total loans increased 9.40% to $1.05 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $961.0 million at March 31, 2017 Book value per share increased 7.63% to $16.78 per share compared to $15.59 per share at March 31, 2017 Tangible book value per share increased 9.12% to $15.27 per share compared to $13.99 per share at March 31, 2017\nBalance Sheet Review\nLevel One's total assets were $1.30 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $662 thousand, or 0.05%, from December 31, 2017, and up $130.9 million, or 11.19%, from $1.17 billion at March 31, 2017.\nThe investment securities portfolio was $160.3 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $9.4 million or 6.21%, from $151.0 million at December 31, 2017, and up $51.9 million, or 47.8%, from $108.5 million at March 31, 2017. The portfolio is mainly comprised of securities issued by state and political subdivisions, collaterized mortgage obligations, mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities.\nTotal loans were $1.05 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $16.4 million, or 1.59%, from $1.03 billion at December 31, 2017, and up $90.4 million, or 9.40%, from $961.0 million at March 31, 2017. The growth in total loans compared to December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 was primarily due to growth in our commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios.\nTotal deposits were $1.11 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $145.8 million, or 15.08%, compared to $966.9 million at March 31, 2017. Total deposits decreased $7.7 million, or 0.69%, compared to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2017. Total deposit composition at March 31, 2018 consisted of 33% of demand deposit accounts, 25% of savings and money market accounts and 42% of time deposits.\nOperating Results\nLevel One's net interest income before the provision for loan loss increased $123 thousand, or 1.02%, to $12.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $12.0 million in the preceding quarter, and increased $383 thousand, or 3.26%, compared to $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nLevel One’s net interest margin was 4.03% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.01% in the preceding quarter and 4.34% in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal revenues (net interest income before provision for loan losses, plus noninterest income) increased $101 thousand, or 0.75%, to $13.5 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to $13.4 million in the preceding quarter, and increased $375 thousand, or 2.86%, compared to $13.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nLevel One’s first quarter noninterest expenses were $9.1 million, compared to $9.2 million in the preceding quarter and $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The efficiency ratio, which is a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income, for the first quarter of 2018 was 67.7%, compared to 68.6% for the preceding quarter and 66.1% in the first quarter of 2017.\nLevel One's income tax provision was $642 thousand, or 16.9% of pretax income, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $2.3 million, or 71.3% of pretax income, in the preceding quarter and $1.5 million, or 35.2% of pretax income, in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in tax expense during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to first quarter 2017 and fourth quarter of 2017, is a result of the change in tax rates due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). The increase in tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to first quarter 2017, was a result of the Company recognizing a $1.3 million tax expense as a result of the TCJA, of which the expense recorded is primarily attributable to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets.\nAsset Quality\nLevel One's asset quality remained solid during the first quarter of 2018. Total nonperforming assets, consisting of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (OREO), were $13.0 million, or 1.23% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.7 million from nonperforming assets of $14.7 million, or 1.42% of total loans at December 31, 2017, and a decrease of $3.4 million from nonperforming assets of $16.3 million, or 1.70% of total loans at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 1.00% at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.13% at December 31, 2017, and 1.40% at March 31, 2017.\nNonaccrual loans decreased by $1.0 million, or 7.63%, to $13.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $14.0 million at December 31, 2017. In addition, we had $263 thousand in loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at March 31, 2018, compared to $440 thousand at December 31, 2017.\nPerforming troubled debt restructured loans that were not included in nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2018 were $2.4 million, compared to $1.2 million in the preceding quarter. Borrowers who are in financial difficulty and who have been granted concessions that may include interest rate reductions, forbearance agreements, and principal deferral or reduction, are categorized as troubled debt restructured loans.\nNet charge offs in the first quarter of 2018 were $755 thousand, or 0.29% of average loans on an annualized basis, compared to $873 thousand, or 0.35% of average loans on an annualized basis for the preceding quarter and $48 thousand, or 0.02% of average loans on an annualized basis at March 31, 2017.\nLevel One's first quarter provision for loan losses was $554 thousand, compared to $956 thousand in the preceding quarter and $198 thousand in the first quarter of 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $11.5 million, or 1.09% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $11.7 million, or 1.13% of total loans at December 31, 2017, and $11.2 million, or 1.17% of total loans at March 31, 2017.

These non-GAAP financial measures include tangible shareholders' equity, tangible book value per share and the ratio of tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of our performance, and we believe financial analysts and others frequently use these measures, and other similar measures, to evaluate capital adequacy. We calculate: (i) tangible shareholders' equity as total shareholders' equity less core deposit intangibles and goodwill; (ii) tangible book value per share as tangible shareholders' equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding; and (iii) tangible assets as total assets, less core deposit intangibles, less goodwill.\nThe following presents these non-GAAP financial measures along with their most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nLevel One Bancorp, Inc.
