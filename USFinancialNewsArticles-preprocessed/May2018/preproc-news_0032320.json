    "text": "33 COMMENTS Should sodas and sugary drinks be subjected to a special tax?\nPhiladelphia has become ground zero in the national debate over whether to tax sodas and other sugar-sweetened beverages. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania’s highest state court is set to hear a challenge by the American Beverage Association and others to the city’s soda tax, which went into effect in January 2017.\nThe outcome of the legal fight could have implications for other cities that have adopted or may consider similar measures, which like cigarette taxes, seek to curb unhealthy behavior through taxation.\nTax proponents say that sugary drinks contribute to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay and that the tax receipts can be directed to health programs or budget shortfalls. Beverage companies say that their products are being singled out unfairly and that the special tax is regressive and increases grocery bills.\nWhat beverages are subject to Philadelphia’s tax?\nPhiladelphia imposes a 1.5-cent-an-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened drinks that distributors sell to restaurants and grocery stores, for example. The tax applies to an array of beverages beyond sugary sodas like Coca-Cola or Pepsi .\nThe tax applies to enhanced waters like VitaminWater and sports drinks like Gatorade, as well as juices like Ocean’s Spray Cranberry Juice Cocktail that aren’t 100% juice or have added sweeteners. It also applies to cashew and almond milk.\nBaby formula and beverages for medical use are exempt. So are powdered mixes like Kool-Aid or Nesquik that are sold directly to a consumer or are added to a beverage directly by a consumer.\nWhat is the purpose of Philadelphia’s tax?\nOverconsumption of sugar is a leading contributor to obesity, diabetes, tooth decay and other health ailments, according to the World Health Organization, which recommends taxing the beverages as an “effective intervention.”\nThe Food and Drug Administration recommends that Americans get no more than 10% of their daily calories from added sugars. That would be about 50 grams, or about 12.5 teaspoons, for a 2,000-calorie diet.\nA can of sugar-sweetened soda contains up to 40 grams (or roughly 10 teaspoons) of free sugars or added sugar.\nPhiladelphia says it will use most of the tax proceeds to help fund pre-K and community schools, parks, recreation centers and libraries.\nWho else charges a tax on soda consumption?\nPhiladelphia was the first large U.S. city to adopt a soda tax. Berkeley, Calif., passed a similar measure in 2014 and has filed a so-called friend-of-the-court brief in the Philadelphia legal challenge.\nSan Francisco and Seattle started collecting taxes on sugary beverages this year. Oakland, Calif., and Boulder, Colo. also have similar measures.\nLawmakers in Cook County, Ill., which includes Chicago, repealed their penny-an-ounce sweetened-beverage tax last year, delivering a big win for the soda industry.\nFrance started taxing sodas in 2012, and a number of countries have followed suit, including Mexico , South Africa and the U.K. last month, and Ireland this month.\nBut not every tax works the same way. Philadelphia’s tax is based on the drink’s volume, while the U.K.’s is based on sugar levels. The U.K.’s tax is generally seen as more friendly to the industry, since companies have already been adjusting their “formulas” to reduce sugar content.\nWhat is the legal question in the Philadelphia case?\nThe legal argument focuses on whether the city tax duplicates the state sales tax and, essentially, taxes sugary drinks twice.\nOpponents argue the city violates the Sterling Act, a state law that bars municipalities from taxing subjects already taxed by the state.\nThe city argues, and the lower courts agreed, that it taxes a different aspect of the business: nonretail distribution transactions, rather than retail sales to a consumer, which is subject to the state sales tax.\nWhat’s next?\nThe food-and-beverage industry, including labor unions, has been stepping up lobbying efforts at the state level.\nA ballot initiative, for example, is under way in Washington state to bar cities and counties from taxing certain foods and beverages, including sugary drinks. Seattle’s soda tax went into effect on Jan. 1.\nAnother initiative, funded by the beverage industry, is under way in California that would require a supermajority vote to pass new taxes. (Soda taxes in San Francisco and Oakland were passed by majority vote in 2016.)\nMeanwhile, Michigan and Arizona have enacted laws essentially banning new local taxes on sugary drinks. Pennsylvania has introduced a similar bill.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com",
