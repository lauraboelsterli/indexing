New Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad speaks during a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia May 10, 2018. REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin\nSpeaking at a news conference, Mahathir also said he would announce a 10-member cabinet on Saturday, including ministers for finance, defence and home affairs.\nAnwar and Mahathir, former allies and then implacable foes, joined hands to contest this week’s election and oust the administration of Najib Razak. Anwar is in custody on charges of sodomy and corruption and cannot take any office until he is pardoned and released.\nMahathir has said he will step aside and hand over the prime minister’s post to Anwar once he is pardoned.
