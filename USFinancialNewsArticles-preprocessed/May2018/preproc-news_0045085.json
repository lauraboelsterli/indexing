Motorcycling - MotoGP - French Grand Prix - Bugatti Circuit, Le Mans, France - May 20, 2018 Repsol Honda Team's Marc Marquez in action REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\nThe Repsol Honda rider took the lead with 18 laps remaining in Le Mans and held off Italians Danilo Petrucci (Ducati) and Valentino Rossi (Yamaha), who were second and third respectively.\nWith his third victory in three races, which put him on 95 points, four-time MotoGP world champion Marquez stretched his lead to 36 points over his compatriot Maverick Vinales.\nFrenchman Johann Zarco dropped from second to third on 58 points.\nZarco, who started from pole position and was chasing a first French victory in the French GP in the top class since Christian Sarron in 1988, crashed out of contention in the eighth lap. Motorcycling - MotoGP - French Grand Prix - Bugatti Circuit, Le Mans, France - May 20, 2018 Alma Pramac Racing's Danilo Petrucci celebrates with a trophy on the podium after the race REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\nItalian Andrea Dovizioso also crashed as he was leading the race.\nIn Moto3, Fabio Di Giannantonio (Honda) thought he had won but he was handed a three-second penalty for riding outside the track in the ninth curve and therefore lost his victory.\nThe win eventually went to Spainâ€™s Albert Arenas (KTM), whose previous best result this season was 15th.\nIn Moto2, Italian Francesco Bagnaia (Kalex) led from start to finish.
