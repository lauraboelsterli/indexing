    "text": "SAINT JOSEPH, Mich., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edgewater Bancorp, Inc . (OTC PINK:EGDW) announced first quarter 2018 net income of $230,905, or $0.36 per share, compared to net income of $59,600, or $0.10 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nReturn on Average Assets (annualized) was 6.67% at March 31, 2018 compared to 3.52% for December 31, 2017. Dyer indicated, “We are pleased to report solid net income results for the first quarter of 2018, and a continuation of improved quarterly financial performance for the organization. The first quarter 2018 net income, following solid net income growth for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflects a very positive trend for Edgewater.”\nNet interest income increased $180,965, or 16.3%, to $1.3 million for the quarter, compared to $1.1 million during the first quarter of 2017. Total provision expense of $20,000 for the first quarter of 2018 exceeded provision expense of $10,000 for the first quarter of 2017 due to loan portfolio growth, not a deterioration of asset quality.\nTotal non-interest expense was flat at $1.3 million from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 as the organization continues to monitor and manage expenses.\nTotal consolidated assets at March 31, 2018 were $154.7 million, down from $156.4 million at December 31, 2017. Total gross loans, however, increased to $120.7 million from $120.2 million while bank securities increased from $11.2 million to $16.2 million. The increase in available-for-sale securities was funded through a reduction in Fed Funds and other deposits from $20.1 million to $13.1 million, as funds were redeployed into higher-yielding investments.\nTotal deposits were flat at $137.6 million while borrowings from Federal Home Loan Bank decreased $2.0 million from $4.0 million at December 31, 2017 to $2.0 million at March 31, 2018.\nTotal equity increased to $14.1 million as of March 31, 2018, with Edgewater’s Tier 1 capital ratio improving from 8.67% at March 31, 2017 and 9.01% at December 31, 2017, to 9.18% at March 31, 2018.\nBased in Saint Joseph, Michigan, Edgewater Bancorp is the bank holding company for Edgewater Bank. Edgewater provides commercial, mortgage, and consumer loan and deposit banking services from 5 banking offices in St. Joseph, Bridgman, Buchanan, Coloma, and Royalton Township. Edgewater Bancorp’s common stock is listed under the symbol \"EGDW.\"\nThis news release contains comments or information that constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
