    "text": "LAKE FOREST, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Liquidmetal® Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: LQMT), the leading developer of amorphous alloys and composites, reported results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\nRegarding the Company’s results for the first quarter of 2018, Paul Hauck, the Company’s Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing noted “The Liquidmetal sales and marketing team increased it’s go-to-market and sales intensity during the first quarter of 2018, stimulating customer interest. The Company’s successful biocompatibility testing results have helped generate medical device manufacturer interests and new prototype orders during the first quarter. Several key prototype programs from the medical and automotive markets are in testing with customers, and some are anticipated to yield production tooling orders before the end of 2018. Additionally, changes in pricing strategies have helped generate the largest number of key opportunities the Company has observed in the past two years.”\nMr. Hauck went on to note that “The Company received production orders from Zyris/Isolite and C.F. Martin during the first quarter. Both customer orders provide the Company with the opportunity to demonstrate ongoing production capabilities to new customers. Liquidmetal also passed its first detailed customer quality audit recently, which increases the Company’s confidence in meeting demanding customer requirements.”\nQ1 2018 Financial Summary\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company generated $80 thousand in revenue as it continued to focus on the development and manufacturing of prototype and commercial parts for its customers and partnering with licensees on the development of the Company’s technology and production processes.\nSelling, marketing, general and administrative expense was $1.6 million in Q1 2018, as compared to $1.7 million in Q1 2017. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in overall headcount, and associated salary expense.\nResearch and development expense was $0.6 million in Q1 2018, as compared to $0.4 million in Q1 2017. The increase from the prior year was mainly due to additional expenses associated with alloy and application development.\nCash and restricted cash totaled $39.9 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $41.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nFor a more detailed and complete analysis of the Company’s financial results, please refer to the Company’s March 31, 2018 Form 10Q, which was filed earlier today.\nAbout Liquidmetal Technologies\nLake Forest, California-based Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc. is the leading producer of parts made with amorphous alloys, also known scientifically as Bulk Metallic Glasses or BMGs.
