Soccer Football - AFC Bournemouth vs Valencia - Pre Season Friendly - Bournemouth, Britain - July 30, 2017 Bournemouth's Connor Mahoney in action Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs\nThe south coast team signed Mahoney from third-tier League One side Blackburn last July after the 21-year-old’s contract at Ewood Park ended but the clubs failed to reach an agreement over the transfer fee.\nThe clubs referred the player’s valuation to a tribunal and the PFCC, appointed under EFL and Premier League regulations, met earlier this month to decide the fee.\n\"AFC Bournemouth must pay Blackburn Rovers an initial compensation fee of 425,000 pounds,\" the Premier League side said on their website www.afcb.co.uk .\n“In addition to the initial payment, AFC Bournemouth are to pay a further sum of 100,000 pounds on the player making 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 first team appearances - a potential further payment of 500,000 pounds.”\nBournemouth will pay an extra 250,000 pounds if Mahoney makes a senior England appearance.\nBlackburn will also receive 20 percent of any profits made by Bournemouth should the top-flight club sell Mahoney in the future.\nThe PFCC is appointed to determine the fee for players under the age of 24 when both clubs involved in the transfer fail to reach an agreement regarding compensation for training and development.
