    "text": "IRVING, Texas, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CEC Entertainment, Inc. (the \"Company\") today announced financial results for its first quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nFirst quarter Results (1)\nTotal revenues were $254.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $264.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Company venue sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $10.8 million from the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by a 5.1% decline in comparable venue sales. Also, deferred amusement revenue was $1.8 million less than the first quarter of 2017, resulting in cash revenue from our Company-operated venues decreasing $12.7 million from the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company reported net income of $12.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $17.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 net income reflects the decline in revenue and a decrease in Company-operated venue cost margins, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses, lower depreciation and a lower effective tax rate related to the tax law changes enacted in December 2017.\n\"While we continued to feel the impact of several challenges to our business in the first quarter, we were encouraged by the early results of the measures we put in place to address the issues, including launching new advertising campaigns addressing moms and kids, as well as a revitalized approach to birthdays,\" said Tom Leverton, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our comparable venue sales performance improved each month during the quarter and we have seen that trend continue recently. Looking at March and April together, which removes the impact of calendar shifts with spring breaks and Easter, our comparable venue sales improved approximately 1% over the same nine-week period in 2017. Comparable venue sales for the first five weeks of our second quarter have increased in the mid-single digit percent range. While this is encouraging, we continue to push forward with the previously mentioned initiatives, as well as some others.\"\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $14.0 million to $69.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nOn May 8, 2018, the Company entered into an incremental assumption agreement with certain of the revolving credit facility lenders in its senior credit facility to extend the maturity of $95.0 million of its revolving credit facility through November 16, 2020. Other revolving credit facility lenders have until 5:00 pm New York time on May 11, 2018 to elect to extend the maturity of their revolving credit facility commitments. The maturity date of any amount of the revolving credit facility that is not extended will remain February 14, 2019.\nAs of April 1, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $98.7 million and $984.6 million principal outstanding on its debt, with net availability of $140.1 million on the undrawn revolving credit facility. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company made $18.6 million of capital expenditures, of which $5.3 million related to growth initiatives, $1.1 million related to IT initiatives, and $12.1 million related to maintenance capital expenditures, primarily consisting of game enhancements and general venue capital expenditures.\n(1)\nFor our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, see the financial table \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included within this press release.\nAs of April 1, 2018, the Company's system-wide portfolio consisted of:\nChuck E.

The Company's management believes that the presentation of these measures is appropriate to provide useful information to investors regarding its operating performance and its capacity to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Further, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is used by many investors, analysts and rating agencies as a measure of performance. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA because it is substantially similar to Credit Agreement EBITDA, a measure used in calculating financial ratios and other calculations under our debt agreements, except for (i) adding back the change in deferred amusement revenue, and (ii) excluding the annualized full year effect of Company-operated and franchised venues that were opened and closed during the year. By reporting Adjusted EBITDA, the Company provides a basis for comparison of its business operations between current, past and future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.\nThe Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA allows for the exclusion of certain non-cash and other income and expense items that are used in calculating net income from continuing operations. However, these are items that may recur, vary greatly and can be difficult to predict. They can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, certain of these items can represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other corporate purposes. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance, or cash flows as measures of liquidity. These measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and users should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, the Company relies primarily on its GAAP results and uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin only supplementally.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the periods shown:\nThree Months Ended\nApril 1,\n2018\nApril 2,\n2017\nTotal revenues\n$\n254,904\n$\n264,959\nNet income as reported\n$\n12,223\n$\n17,220\nInterest expense\n18,557\n17,061\nIncome tax expense\n3,933\n10,378\nDepreciation and amortization\n26,572\n28,305\nLoss on disposals, net\n1,237\n1,755\nUnrealized loss on foreign exchange\n356\n—\nNon-cash stock-based compensation\n64\n151\nRent expense book to cash\n2,174\n980\nFranchise revenue, net cash received\n421\n(90)\nImpact of purchase accounting\n—\n215\nVenue pre-opening costs\n23\n239\nOne-time and unusual items\n762\n2,267\nChange in deferred amusement revenue\n3,231\n5,044\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n69,553\n$\n83,525\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n27.3%\n31.5%\nCEC ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nVENUE COUNT INFORMATION\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nApril 1,\n2018\nApril 2,\n2017\nNumber of Company-owned venues:\nBeginning of period\n562\n559\nNew\n‒‒\n1\nClosed\n(1)\n‒‒\nEnd of period\n561\n560\nNumber of franchised venues:\nBeginning of period\n192\n188\nNew\n4\n3\nClosed\n(1)\n—\nEnd of period\n195\n191\nTotal number of venues:\nBeginning of period\n754\n747\nNew\n4\n4\nClosed\n(2)\n—\nEnd of period\n756\n751\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cec-entertainment-inc-reports-financial-results-for-the-2018-first-quarter-300645366.html\nSOURCE CEC Entertainment, Inc.",
