    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 10:09 PM / Updated 10 hours ago Vatican treasurer to face trial in Australia on historical sexual offence charges Sonali Paul 3 Min Read\nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Vatican Treasurer George Pell must face trial on charges of historical sexual offences, an Australian court ruled on Tuesday, making him the most senior Catholic official to be tried on such allegations. He pleaded not guilty.\nMagistrate Belinda Wallington handed down her decision that Pell’s case will proceed to trial in a Melbourne court, following a month-long pre-trial hearing.\nPell did not comment when he left the court, surrounded by police and flanked by his legal team.\nPope Francis has said he would not comment on the case involving his economy minister until it was over.\nThe Vatican said in a statement that it had “taken note” of the court’s decision and that the leave of absence the pope granted Pell last year so he can defend himself “is still in place”.\nA statement issued by Pell’s lawyers and distributed by the Sydney Archdiocese, his last employer before his Vatican posting in 2014, said Pell had fully cooperated with police investigators and “always and steadfastly maintained his innocence”.\n“He would like to thank all those who have supported him from both here in Australia and overseas during this exacting time and is grateful for their continuing support and prayers,” the statement said.\nIn her ruling, Wallington dismissed what Pell’s lawyer has called “the worst of the charges” levelled against his client, but said allegations of offences at a pool and at a church in Victoria state will be heard.

REUTERS/Mark Dadswell\nOn another charge that was dismissed, Wallington said Pell’s accuser was “so cavalier” with his evidence that a jury would not have been able to put any weight on it.\nPell was called back from Rome to his home country last year to face the charges. He has handed over his passports, Gibson told the court. Reporting By Sonali Paul and Will Ziebell; Editing by Rob Birsel, Neil Fullick and Raissa Kasolowsky",
