Yearley, Jr., Toll Brothers’ chief executive officer, stated: “Our double-digit dollar growth in revenues, contracts and backlog reflects the health of the luxury new home market. We had another solid spring selling season. The value of signed contracts, the highest quarter in our history, rose 18% in dollars on a 6% increase in units. On a same-store-basis, signed contracts of 9.04 per community were up 16% from last year and the highest for a second quarter since FY 2005. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year same-store contract growth.\n“Revenues rose 17% this quarter with increases in every region. California revenues rose 17% and was our largest region, producing 27% of total revenues. The North was up 19%, the Mid-Atlantic was up 13%, the South was up 23%, the West was up 15% and City Living was up 17%. California and the Western region, combined, produced nearly 50% of total revenues, reflecting the strategic diversification of the Company’s operations over the past decade. With our $6.36 billion backlog, our highest second-quarter backlog ever, we believe FY 2018 will be a year of significant revenue growth.\n“We project third-quarter end community count to be approximately 290, down from 312 at last year’s third-quarter end, but up from 283 at FY 2018 second quarter-end. With 75 planned new community openings in the back half of FY 2018, we project a FYE 2018 community count of approximately 315, compared to 305 at FYE 2017.\n“Based on this projected increase in community count, our record second-quarter backlog, the quality of our brand and land portfolio, the financial strength of the affluent home buyer and the breadth of demographic segments we serve, we believe FY 2019 will be another year of growth as well.”\nMartin P. Connor, Toll Brothers’ chief financial officer, stated: “We continue to focus on improving our Return on Equity (ROE) and driving value for shareholders, while maintaining our profit margins and balance sheet flexibility. In April, we increased our dividend 38% from $0.08 per quarter to $0.11 per quarter. We have also repurchased $291.5 million of stock to-date in FY 2018.\n“Our rental apartment business continues to grow. We now control a pipeline of approximately 16,000 units in projects completed, in construction, under development or in approvals. We are expanding this operation beyond our metro Boston to Washington, D.C. base and now have teams in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas and Phoenix.”\nRobert I. Toll, executive chairman, stated: “Jobs are plentiful, unemployment is low, wages are rising and existing home price appreciation is providing the equity for customers to buy new homes. Home ownership and household formation rates are increasing, while supply remains constrained. With our solid land positions and the capital to expand, we are gaining market share and look forward to continued growth.\n“Just yesterday, we were included once again in the Fortune 500. I am so proud of the tremendous effort of the entire Toll Brothers team. This recognition reflects their dedication to building our brand, and their focus on providing the highest quality, value and service to our customers.”\nToll Brothers’ financial highlights for the FY 2018 second quarter and six months ended April 30, 2018 (unaudited):\nFY 2018’s second-quarter net income was $111.8 million, or $0.72 per share diluted, compared to FY 2017’s second-quarter net income of $124.6 million, or $0.73 per share diluted.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies in the homebuilding business.\nThe Company’s management considers these non-GAAP financial measures as we make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance, including against other homebuilders that may use similar non-GAAP financial measures. The Company’s management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding our operations and leverage and may be helpful in comparing the Company to other homebuilders to the extent they provide similar information.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s gross margin as a percentage of revenues (calculated in accordance with GAAP) to the Company’s Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP financial measure). Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated as (i) gross margin plus interest recognized in cost of sales plus inventory write-downs divided by (ii) revenues.\nAdjusted Gross Margin Reconciliation\n(Amounts in thousands, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended\nApril 30, 2018 2017 Revenues $ 1,599,199 $ 1,363,512 Cost of revenues 1,298,157 1,077,441 Gross margin 301,042 286,071 Add: Interest recognized in cost of sales 45,027 40,558 Inventory write-downs 13,832 4,256 Adjusted gross margin $ 359,901 $ 330,885 Gross margin as a percentage of revenues 18.8 % 21.0 % Adjusted Gross Margin 22.5 % 24.3 % The Company’s management believes Adjusted Gross Margin is a useful financial measure to investors because it allows them to evaluate the performance of our homebuilding operations without the often varying effects of capitalized interest costs and inventory impairments. The use of Adjusted Gross Margin also assists the Company’s management in assessing the profitability of our homebuilding operations and making strategic decisions regarding community location and product mix.\nForward-looking Adjusted Gross Margin\nThe Company has not provided projected third quarter and full year fiscal 2018 gross margin or a GAAP reconciliation for forward-looking Adjusted Gross Margin because such measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis, since inventory write-downs are based on future activity and observation and therefore cannot be projected for the third quarter or the full fiscal year. The variability of these charges may have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our third quarter and full year fiscal 2018 gross margin.\nNet Debt-to-Capital Ratio\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s ratio of debt to capital (calculated in accordance with GAAP) to the Company’s net debt-to-capital ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure). The net debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as (i) total debt minus mortgage warehouse loans minus cash and cash equivalents divided by (ii) total debt minus mortgage warehouse loans minus cash and cash equivalents plus stockholders’ equity.\nNet Debt-to-Capital Ratio Reconciliation\n(Amounts in thousands, except percentages)\nApril 30,\n2018 April 30,\n2017 January 31,\n2018 Loans payable $ 649,299 $ 637,931 $ 631,791 Senior notes 2,860,290 2,993,882 2,859,689 Mortgage company loan facility 103,550 61,129 38,344 Total debt 3,613,139 3,692,942 3,529,824 Total stockholders' equity 4,480,703 4,448,088 4,458,994 Total capital $ 8,093,842 $ 8,141,030 $ 7,988,818 Ratio of debt-to-capital 44.6 % 45.4 % 44.2 % Total debt $ 3,613,139 $ 3,692,942 $ 3,529,824 Less: Mortgage company loan facility (103,550 ) (61,129 ) (38,344 ) Cash and cash equivalents (475,113 ) (691,266 ) (508,277 ) Total net debt 3,034,476 2,940,547 2,983,203 Total stockholders' equity 4,480,703 4,448,088 4,458,994 Total net capital $ 7,515,179 $ 7,388,635 $ 7,442,197 Net debt-to-capital ratio 40.4 % 39.8 % 40.1 % The Company’s management uses the net debt-to-capital ratio as an indicator of its overall leverage and believes it is a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in the Company’s operations.\nCONTACT: Frederick N.
