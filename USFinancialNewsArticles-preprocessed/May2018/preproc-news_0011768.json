(NYSE: MSI) today reported its earnings results for the first quarter of 2018. Click here for a printable news release and financial tables.\n“Q1 was outstanding,” said Greg Brown, chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions. “Our record Q1 backlog position and acquisition of Avigilon provide a strong foundation for continued revenue and earnings growth.”\nKEY FINANCIAL RESULTS (presented in millions, except per share data and percentages)\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 % Change Sales $1,468 $1,281 15% GAAP Operating Earnings $171 $173 (1)% % of Sales 11.6% 13.5% EPS $0.69 $0.45 53% Non-GAAP Operating Earnings $260 $212 23% % of Sales 17.7% 16.5% EPS $1.10 $0.71 55% Product Segment Sales $801 $703 14% GAAP Operating Earnings $89 $88 1% % of Sales 11.1% 12.5% Non-GAAP Operating Earnings $127 $94 35% % of Sales 15.9% 13.4% Services Segment Sales $667 $578 15% GAAP Operating Earnings $82 $85 (4)% % of Sales 12.3% 14.7% Non-GAAP Operating Earnings $133 $118 13% % of Sales 19.9% 20.4% *Non-GAAP financial information excludes the after-tax impact of approximately $0.41 per diluted share related to share-based compensation, intangible assets amortization expense and highlighted items. Details on these non-GAAP adjustments and the use of non-GAAP measures are included later in this news release.\nOTHER SELECTED FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenue – Sales increased 15 percent from the year-ago quarter driven by growth in all regions. Approximately $49 million of revenue growth was related to acquisitions, including $22 million from the acquisitions of Airbus DS Communications and Avigilon. In addition, $15 million was related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Products segment sales grew 14 percent with growth in every region. The Services segment grew 15 percent with growth in every region led by Managed & Support Services. Operating margin – GAAP operating margin was 11.6 percent of sales, compared with 13.5 percent in the year-ago quarter. The decline reflects higher transaction costs related to acquisitions and a $52 million collection of a legal judgement in the prior year, offset by higher sales volume and higher gross margin. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.7 percent of sales, compared with 16.5 percent in the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher sales and higher gross margin. Cash flow – Operating cash flow was negative $500 million, versus $142 million of operating cash generated in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow 2 was negative $541 million, versus $74 million of free cash flow generated in the year-ago quarter. Cash flow for the quarter was down due to a $500 million debt-funded U.S. pension contribution, higher cash tax payments, higher incentive payments and a $52 million collection of a legal judgement in the prior year offset by lower capital expenditures associated with the company's ERP implementation in the prior year. Capital allocation – The company paid $1.1 billion for acquisitions, repurchased $66 million of its common stock and paid $84 million in cash dividends. Backlog – The company ended the quarter with backlog of $9.6 billion, up $1.1 billion from the year-ago quarter. Products segment backlog was up 11 percent or $166 million, and Services was up 14 percent or $973 million. Land mobile radio demand led by the Americas continues to drive backlog growth.\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\nStrategic wins\nSelected by the state of Florida to build and manage a new statewide public safety network $20 million for additional Managed & Support Services for the state of Indiana $15 million for a P25 system in Miami-Dade County, Florida $15 million for a four-year Managed & Support Services contract for the state of Maryland $6 million for a two-year Managed & Support Services contract for Petrobras, a large petroleum company in Latin America\nInnovation and investments in growth\nAnnounced the LEX L11 Mission Critical LTE handheld device for global broadband networks, including FirstNet in the U.S. Announced the Capture mobile camera app, which allows first responders to capture image, video and audio evidence on any Android or iOS-based smartphone Completed the acquisitions of Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics, and Airbus DS Communications (Plant Holdings, Inc.), a leading provider in North America of command center software for emergency call-handling\nBUSINESS OUTLOOK\nSecond-quarter 2018 - Motorola Solutions expects revenue growth of approximately 15 percent, with organic growth of approximately 4 percent, compared with the second quarter of 2017. The company expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.34 to $1.39 per share. Full-year 2018 - The company now expects revenue growth of approximately 14 percent, up from the prior outlook of 10 to 11 percent provided at the Financial Analyst Meeting on Feb. 27. The company now expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $6.70 to $6.85, up from the prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.65. This assumes current foreign exchange rates, approximately 172 million fully diluted shares and a 25 percent effective tax rate.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nMotorola Solutions will host its quarterly conference call beginning at 4 p.m. U.S. Central Daylight Time (5 p.m. U.S. Eastern Daylight Time) on Thursday, May 3. The conference call will be webcast live at www.motorolasolutions.com/investor .\nCONSOLIDATED GAAP RESULTS (presented in millions, except per share data)\nA comparison of results from operations is as follows:\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 Net sales $1,468 $1,281 Gross margin 669 570 Operating earnings 171 173 Amounts attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. common stockholders Net earnings 117 77 Diluted EPS $0.69 $0.45 Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 170.6 169.9 HIGHLIGHTED ITEMS AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nThe table below includes highlighted items, share-based compensation expense and intangible amortization for the first quarter of 2018.\n(per diluted common share) Q1 2018 GAAP Earnings $0.69 Highlighted Items: Share-based compensation expense 0.08 Reorganization of business charges 0.06 Intangibles amortization expense 0.19 Loss on legal settlements 0.01 Loss on Avigilon derivative instruments 0.06 Release of FIN 48 reserve (0.01 ) Sale of investments (0.05 ) Acquisition-related transaction fees 0.07 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS $1.10 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nIn addition to the GAAP results included in this presentation, Motorola Solutions also has included non-GAAP measurements of results. The company has provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period to period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to its competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate performance of the businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes this measurement enables it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nOrganic revenue: Reflects net sales calculated under GAAP excluding net sales from acquired business owned for less than four full quarters, and excludes the affects of ASC 606. Management believes organic revenue helps it and investors better identify the underlying trends of established and ongoing operations by excluding the effects of acquisitions and accounting adjustments which can obscure period to period comparisons.\nHighlighted items: The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items including, but not limited to, acquisition-related transaction costs, tangible and intangible asset impairments, restructuring charges, non-cash pension adjustments, significant litigation and other contingencies, significant gains and losses on investments, and the income tax effects of significant tax matters, from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. For the purposes of management's internal analysis over operating performance, the company uses financial statements that exclude highlighted items, as these charges do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance.\nShare-based compensation expense: The company has excluded share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the company’s employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expense primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expense will recur in future periods.\nIntangible assets amortization expense: The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net earnings measurements, primarily because it represents a non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company’s acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company’s future period revenues as well. Intangible assets amortization expense will recur in future periods.\nDetails of the above items and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this press release.\nBUSINESS RISKS\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable federal securities law.
