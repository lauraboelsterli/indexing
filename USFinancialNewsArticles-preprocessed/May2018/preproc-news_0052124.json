Shanghai stocks have risen 1.94 percent this month. ** As of 07:00 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 20.54 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day and 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 13.55 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 2.3 percent. ** So far this week, the market capitalisation of the Shanghai stock index has fallen by -0.92 percent to 32.64 trillion yuan.
