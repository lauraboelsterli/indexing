Ambien is used to treat insomnia.\nSanofi tweet.\nEarlier, Barr had written on Twitter: \"guys I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me. It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting -- it was memorial day too -- i went 2 far & do not want it defended -- it was egregious Indefensible. I made a mistake I wish I hadn't but...don't defend it please.\"\nThe tweet has since been removed.\nABC canceled Barr's hit show \"Roseanne\" on Tuesday following her tweet about Jarrett.\nThe actress apologized and asked her followers not to defend her, though she continued to retweet posts from fans who did so , including one user who said her \"apology is not sincere.\"\nRoseanne tweet.",
