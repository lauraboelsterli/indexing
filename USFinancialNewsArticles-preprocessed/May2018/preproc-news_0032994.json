    "text": "Eric Hosmer doubled home pinch runner Jordan Lyles from second with no one out in the bottom of the 13th inning Saturday night to give the Padres a 2-1, walk-off victory over the St. Louis Cardinals at Petco Park in San Diego.\nThe game-winning double into the right field corner — on the first pitch from Cardinals reliever Mike Mayers — was the ninth walk-off hit of Hosmer’s career.\nA.J. Ellis and Travis Jankowski drew back-to-back walks to open the 13th from reliever John Brebbia, who was then replaced by Mayers as the eighth Cardinals pitcher.\nRight-hander Adam Cimber (2-1), the Padres’ sixth pitcher, earned the win with a perfect inning of relief in the top of the 13th. Brebbia (0-1) suffered the loss.\nBoth starting pitchers departed after six innings with the score tied 1-1.\nPadres right-hander Tyson Ross allowed one run on three hits, two walks and a hit batter with seven strikeouts. Cardinals right-handed starter Michael Wacha allowed a run on three hits and a walk with five strikeouts.\nRaffy Lopez hustled the Padres to a 1-0 lead in the second.\nWith one out and the infield shifted to the right against the left-handed Lopez, the catcher rolled a bunt single down the third base line. Freddy Galvis followed with a grounder to the right side — the Cardinals second baseman Greg Garcia made a diving stop to his left.\nLopez advanced to second and kept running to third. And when first baseman Jose Martinez bounced his throw past third, Lopez scored.\nThe batter Ross hit was Paul DeJong leading off the sixth. DeJong scored from first on Martinez’s double inside the third base bag to tie the game.\nThe Padres blew two golden opportunities in the ninth and 10th. In the ninth, Jose Pirela opened the inning with a single and moved to second when St. Louis reliever Bud Norris walked Franchy Cordero. But Norris struck out the next three Padres. In the 10th, pinch hitter Carlos Asuaje and Jankowski hit back-to-back, one-out singles. But Hosmer bounced into a double play.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
