    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Exponent, Inc. (Nasdaq:EXPO) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split of its common stock and a change in the number of authorized shares of common stock to 120 million, each subject to stockholder approval of both the split and the change in authorized shares at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders on May 31, 2018. If Exponent’s stockholders approve the stock split and the change in authorized shares, each stockholder of record at the close of business on May 31, 2018 will receive one additional share of common stock for every outstanding share of common stock held on the record date.
