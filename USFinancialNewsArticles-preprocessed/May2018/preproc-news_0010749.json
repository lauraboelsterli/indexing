    "text": "Overview\nTotal Revenues of $134.0 million for first quarter 2018, up 11% from $121.0 million in the prior year\nAdvisory Revenues of $103.5 million, up 4% from $99.3 million in the prior year Placement Revenues of $26.1 million, up 34% from $19.5 million in the prior year Strong balance sheet at quarter-end with $81.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments; no funded debt Intend to repurchase approximately 128,000 Partnership Units for cash in May 2018\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PJT Partners Inc. (the “Company” or “PJT Partners”) (NYSE: PJT) today reported Total Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $134.0 million compared with $121.0 million for 2017. GAAP Pretax Income and Adjusted Pretax Income were $2.6 million and $21.8 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $2.1 million and $22.6 million, respectively, for 2017.\nPaul J. Taubman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are confident that the power we see in our firm is being increasingly recognized by clients and prospective clients around the globe. Importantly, the progress we have made and the momentum we have in our businesses along with the strong partnership culture we have created, give us great conviction about our future growth prospects.”\nRevenues\nThe following table sets forth revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change (Dollars in Millions) Revenues Advisory $ 103.5 $ 99.3 4 % Placement 26.1 19.5 34 % Interest Income & Other 4.5 2.1 110 % Total Revenues $ 134.0 $ 121.0 11 % Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 vs. 2017\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Total Revenues were $134.0 million compared with $121.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 11%.\nAdvisory Revenues were $103.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $99.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 4%. The increase in Advisory Revenues was driven by increased revenues in both our strategic advisory and secondary advisory businesses, which more than offset a decrease in restructuring activity.\nPlacement Revenues were $26.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $19.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 34%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in private equity fund placements during the first quarter of 2018.\nInterest Income & Other was $4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The balance for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes $2.3 million of reimbursable expenses that are now presented on a gross basis due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).”\nExpenses\nThe following table sets forth information relating to the Company’s expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP As Adjusted GAAP As Adjusted (Dollars in Millions) Expenses Compensation and Benefits $ 103.6 $ 85.8 $ 95.7 $ 77.4 % of Revenues 77.3 % 64.0 % 79.1 % 64.0 % Non-Compensation $ 27.8 $ 26.4 $ 23.2 $ 20.9 % of Revenues 20.7 % 19.7 % 19.2 % 17.3 % Total Expenses $ 131.4 $ 112.2 $ 118.9 $ 98.4 % of Revenues 98.0 % 83.7 % 98.3 % 81.3 % Pretax Income $ 2.6 $ 21.8 $ 2.1 $ 22.6 % of Revenues 2.0 % 16.3 % 1.7 % 18.7 % Compensation and Benefits Expense\nGAAP Compensation and Benefits Expense was $103.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $95.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted Compensation and Benefits Expense was $85.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $77.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in Compensation and Benefits Expense was primarily due to higher revenues and increased headcount.\nNon-Compensation Expense\nGAAP Non-Compensation Expense was $27.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $23.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense was $26.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $20.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nGAAP Non-Compensation Expense increased during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in Travel and Related, Communications and Information Services and Professional Fees. The increases in Travel and Related and Professional Services were primarily related to the adoption of new revenue guidance on January 1, 2018. Travel and Related also increased due to increased headcount and business activity. The increase in Communications and Information Services was primarily driven by first quarter investments in our technology and data management infrastructure.\nAdjusted Non-Compensation Expense increased during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in Travel and Related, Communications and Information Services and Professional Fees for the same reasons noted above.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, GAAP and Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense includes $2.7 million of expenses reimbursable by clients that prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard were reported on a net basis.\nProvision for Taxes\nAs of March 31, 2018, PJT Partners Inc. owned 59.3% of PJT Partners Holdings LP. PJT Partners Inc. is subject to corporate U.S. federal and state income tax while PJT Partners Holdings LP is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax and other entity-level taxes imposed by certain state and foreign jurisdictions. Please refer to Note 11. “Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)” in the “Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements” in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further information about the corporate ownership structure.\nIn calculating Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted, the Company has assumed that all outstanding Class A partnership units in PJT Partners Holdings LP (“Partnership Units”) (excluding the unvested partnership units that have yet to satisfy certain market conditions) have been exchanged into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, subjecting all of the Company’s income to corporate-level tax.\nThe effective tax rate for Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 22.3% compared with 36.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This tax rate excludes the tax benefits of the adjustments for transaction-related equity-based compensation expense, amortization expense and spin-off-related payables due to The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”). The decrease in tax rate from the three months ended March 31, 2017 is due primarily to the decrease in U.S. corporate income tax rate related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 1 as well as an increased tax benefit related to the deliveries of vested shares during the first quarter of 2018 at values in excess of their amortized cost. For purposes of calculating the Adjusted, If Converted tax rate, the first quarter 2018 benefit related to the deliveries of vested shares has been annualized.\nCapital Management and Balance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $81.7 million and there was no funded debt.\nPartnership Units may be presented to the Company for exchange on a quarterly basis and repurchased for cash or, at the Company’s election, for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 533,799 Partnership Units for cash. An additional 128,347 Partnership Units have been presented to be exchanged, which the Company intends to repurchase for cash on May 9, 2018 at a price to be determined by the per share volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock on May 4, 2018.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn October 26, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in an amount up to $100 million. Under this repurchase program, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 81,810 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to this share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2018, the available amount remaining for repurchases under this program was $93.8 million.\nIn addition to the Company settling exchanges of 533,799 Partnership Units and repurchasing 81,810 shares of Class A common stock mentioned above, the Company also net share settled 400,821 shares, resulting in a total of 1,016,430 shares repurchased at an average price of $46.89 per share.\nDividend\nThe Board of Directors of PJT Partners Inc. has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share of Class A common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 20, 2018 to Class A common stockholders of record on June 6, 2018.\nQuarterly Investor Call Details\nPJT Partners will host a conference call on May 2, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.

These measures should not be considered substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes the following non-GAAP measures, when presented together with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to investors in understanding the Company’s operating results: Adjusted Pretax Income; Adjusted Net Income; Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted, in total and on a per-share basis; Adjusted Compensation and Benefits Expense and Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense. These non-GAAP measures, presented and discussed in this earnings release, remove the significant accounting impact of: (a) transaction-related equity-based compensation expense, including expense related to Partnership Units with both time-based vesting and market conditions as well as equity-based retention awards granted in connection with the spin-off; (b) intangible asset amortization associated with Blackstone’s initial public offering (“IPO”) and the acquisition of PJT Capital LP; and (c) the amount the Company has agreed to pay Blackstone related to the net realized cash benefit from certain compensation-related tax deductions. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and further detail regarding the adjustments are provided in the Appendix.\nTo help investors understand the effect of the Company’s ownership structure on its Adjusted Net Income, the Company has presented Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted. This measure illustrates the impact of taxes on Adjusted Pretax Income, assuming all Partnership Units (excluding the unvested partnership units that have yet to satisfy certain market conditions) were exchanged for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, resulting in all of the Company’s income becoming subject to corporate-level tax, considering both current and deferred income tax effects and the annualization of discrete permanent differences.\nAppendix\nGAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited)\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Data (unaudited)\nSummary of Shares Outstanding (unaudited)\nFootnotes\nPJT Partners Inc.\nGAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited)\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues Advisory $ 103,463 $ 99,339 Placement 26,120 19,502 Interest Income and Other 4,459 2,128 Total Revenues 134,042 120,969 Expenses Compensation and Benefits 103,632 95,676 Occupancy and Related 6,803 6,206 Travel and Related 5,470 2,883 Professional Fees 5,199 4,189 Communications and Information Services 3,480 2,413 Depreciation and Amortization 2,007 2,092 Other Expenses 4,832 5,422 Total Expenses 131,423 118,881 Income Before Benefit for Taxes 2,619 2,088 Benefit for Taxes (4,110 ) (871 ) Net Income 6,729 2,959 Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests 1,493 1,626 Net Income Attributable to PJT Partners Inc. $ 5,236 $ 1,333 Net Income Per Share of Class A Common Stock Basic $ 0.27 $ 0.07 Diluted $ 0.24 $ 0.07 Weighted-Average Shares of Class A Common Stock Outstanding Basic 19,356,876 18,479,025 Diluted 23,887,322 18,479,025 PJT Partners Inc.\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Data (unaudited)\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP Net Income $ 6,729 $ 2,959 Less: GAAP Benefit for Taxes (4,110 ) (871 ) GAAP Pretax Income 2,619 2,088 Adjustments to GAAP Pretax Income Transaction-Related Compensation Expense (2) 17,845 18,250 Amortization of Intangible Assets (3) 584 666 Spin-Off-Related Payable Due to Blackstone (4) 775 1,599 Adjusted Pretax Income 21,823 22,603 Adjusted Taxes (5) 1,685 3,590 Adjusted Net Income 20,138 19,013 If-Converted Adjustments Less: Adjusted Taxes (5) (1,685 ) (3,590 ) Add: If-Converted Taxes (6) 4,864 8,219 Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted $ 16,959 $ 14,384 GAAP Net Income Per Share of Class A Common Stock Basic $ 0.27 $ 0.07 Diluted $ 0.24 $ 0.07 GAAP Weighted-Average Shares of Class A Common Stock Outstanding Basic 19,356,876 18,479,025 Diluted 23,887,322 18,479,025 Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted Per Share $ 0.44 $ 0.38 Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding, If-Converted 38,558,715 37,821,944 PJT Partners Inc.\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Data – continued (unaudited)\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP Compensation and Benefits Expense $ 103,632 $ 95,676 Transaction-Related Compensation Expense (2) (17,845 ) (18,250 ) Adjusted Compensation and Benefits Expense $ 85,787 $ 77,426 Non-Compensation Expenses Occupancy and Related $ 6,803 $ 6,206 Travel and Related 5,470 2,883 Professional Fees 5,199 4,189 Communications and Information Services 3,480 2,413 Depreciation and Amortization 2,007 2,092 Other Expenses 4,832 5,422 GAAP Non-Compensation Expense 27,791 23,205 Amortization of Intangible Assets (3) (584 ) (666 ) Spin-Off-Related Payable Due to Blackstone (4) (775 ) (1,599 ) Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense $ 26,432 $ 20,940 The following table provides a summary of adjustments made to Interest Income & Other and Non-Compensation Expense as it pertains to the presentation of reimbursable expenses upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 As Reported Adjustments Without\nAdoption of\nRevenue\nStandard\nInterest Income & Other $ 4,459 $ (2,268 ) $ 2,191 Non-Compensation Expenses Occupancy and Related $ 6,803 $ (38 ) $ 6,765 Travel and Related 5,470 (1,899 ) 3,571 Professional Fees 5,199 (638 ) 4,561 Communications and Information Services 3,480 (68 ) 3,412 Depreciation and Amortization 2,007 — 2,007 Other Expenses 4,832 (49 ) 4,783 GAAP Non-Compensation Expense 27,791 (2,692 ) 25,099 Amortization of Intangible Assets (3) (584 ) — (584 ) Spin-Off-Related Payable Due to Blackstone (4) (775 ) — (775 ) Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense $ 26,432 $ (2,692 ) $ 23,740 PJT Partners Inc.\nSummary of Shares Outstanding (unaudited)\nThe following table provides a summary of weighted-average shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 for both basic and diluted shares.

As of March 31, 2018, there were 5.0 million Partnership Units subject to market conditions that are not included in fully-diluted shares outstanding.\nFootnotes\n(1) The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Legislation”) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and lowers the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The Company recorded the estimated impact during the three months ended December 31, 2017. The impact of Tax Legislation may differ from the estimated amounts recorded, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of the Company’s calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of Tax Legislation.\n(2) This adjustment adds back to GAAP Pretax Income transaction-related equity-based compensation expense for Partnership Units with both time-based vesting and market conditions as well as equity-based retention awards granted in connection with the spin-off. (3) This adjustment adds back to GAAP Pretax Income amounts for the amortization of intangible assets that are associated with Blackstone’s IPO and amounts for the amortization of intangible assets identified in connection with the acquisition of PJT Capital LP on October 1, 2015. (4) This adjustment adds back to GAAP Pretax Income the amount the Company has agreed to pay Blackstone related to the net realized cash benefit from certain compensation-related tax deductions. Such expense is reflected in Other Expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (5) Represents taxes on Adjusted Pretax Income, considering both current and deferred income tax effects for the current ownership structure. (6) Represents taxes on Adjusted Pretax Income, assuming all Partnership Units (excluding the unvested partnership units that have yet to satisfy market conditions) were exchanged for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, resulting in all of the Company’s income becoming subject to corporate-level tax, considering both current and deferred income tax effects and the annualization of discrete permanent differences. (7) Represents number of dilutive shares calculated under the treasury method for the unvested, non-participating RSUs that have a remaining service requirement. (8) Excludes 5.0 million unvested Partnership Units as of March 31, 2018 that have yet to satisfy certain market conditions. (9) Assumes all Partnership Units and unvested participating RSUs have been converted to shares of the Company’s Class A common stock.
