    "text": "0 Share\n(Reuters) – Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O ) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk defended the snub of two Wall Street analysts on a convention name, proclaiming in a tweet on Friday that they “were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis.” SpaceX founder Elon Musk pauses at a press convention following the primary launch of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., February 6, 2018. REUTERS/Joe Skipper\nMusk’s antics on the weird name pushed the electrical car maker’s shares down on Thursday, with a number of analysts making scathing feedback and not less than three brokerages chopping value targets on the inventory.\n“The ‘dry’ questions weren’t requested by buyers, however moderately by two sell-side analysts who had been making an attempt to justify their Tesla quick thesis. They are literally on the *reverse* facet of buyers,” Musk tweeted. (bit.ly/2jrfYDr)\n“(the questions) were neither valid nor pertinent,” he mentioned.\nIn the decision, Musk devoted 23 minutes in taking questions from a 25-year-old Tesla investor, Galileo Russell, who owns an YouTube funding channel known as HyperChange TV.\n“HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them,” Musk wrote in one other tweet.
