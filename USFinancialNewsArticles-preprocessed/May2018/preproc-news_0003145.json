U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any or all of the indicated or inferred resources are economically or legally mineable or that these resources will ever be converted into reserves. “Inferred mineral resources” have a high degree of uncertainty as to their existence and it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of a feasibility study or pre-feasibility study, except in rare cases. The SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant “reserves” as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit amounts.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and applicable Canadian securities legislation, including statements relating to anticipated receipts from the oxide plant lease and the farm-out agreement with Santacruz Silver Mining, projected cash balances, and anticipated spending during the twelve months ended March 31, 2019. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including: lower than anticipated revenue from the oxide plant lease as a result of delays or problems at the third party’s mine or the oxide plant, earlier than expected termination of the lease or other causes, potential non-payment of the required farm-out payments by Santacruz, changes in interpretations of geological, geostatistical, metallurgical, mining or processing information and interpretations of the information resulting from future exploration, analysis or mining and processing experience; new information from drilling programs or other exploration or analysis; unexpected variations in mineral grades, types and metallurgy; fluctuations in silver and gold metal prices; failure of mined material or veins mined to meet expectations; increases in costs and declines in general economic conditions; and changes in political conditions, in tax, royalty, environmental and other laws in Mexico, and financial market conditions. Golden Minerals assumes no obligation to update this information. Additional risks relating to Golden Minerals may be found in the periodic and current reports filed with the SEC by Golden Minerals, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor additional information please visit http://www.goldenminerals.com/ or contact:\nGolden Minerals Company\nKaren Winkler\nDirector of Investor Relations\n(303) 839-5060\nInvestor.relations@goldenminerals.com\nSOURCE: Golden Minerals Company\nGOLDEN MINERALS COMPANY\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands, except share data) Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,711 $ 3,250 Short-term investments 233 238 Lease receivables 402 314 Inventories, net 259 242 Value added tax receivable, net 13 148 Prepaid expenses and other assets 850 745 Total current assets 4,468 4,937 Property, plant and equipment, net 7,866 8,140 Total assets $ 12,334 $ 13,077 Liabilities and Equity Current liabilities Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities $ 1,400 $ 1,556 Deferred revenue, current 293 293 Other current liabilities 193 9 Total current liabilities 1,886 1,858 Asset retirement and reclamation liabilities 2,544 2,495 Deferred revenue, non-current 528 600 Other long term liabilities 35 43 Total liabilities 4,993 4,996 Commitments and contingencies Equity Common stock, $.01 par value, 200,000,000 shares\nauthorized; 91,929,709 and 89,020,041 shares issued and\noutstanding, respectively 919 919 Additional paid in capital 516,329 516,284 Accumulated deficit (509,907 ) (509,082 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss — (40 ) Shareholders' equity 7,341 8,081 Total liabilities and equity $ 12,334 $ 13,077\nGOLDEN MINERALS COMPANY\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(Expressed in United States dollars) (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands, except per share data) Revenue: Oxide plant lease $ 1,637 $ 1,644 Total revenue 1,637 1,644 Costs and expenses: Oxide plant lease costs (503 ) (537 ) Exploration expense (899 ) (534 ) El Quevar project expense (272 ) (149 ) Velardeña shutdown and care and maintenance costs (489 ) (350 ) Administrative expense (1,061 ) (1,026 ) Stock based compensation (15 ) (65 ) Reclamation expense (51 ) (49 ) Other operating income, net 1,226 157 Depreciation and amortization (296 ) (188 ) Total costs and expenses (2,360 ) (2,741 ) Loss from operations (723 ) (1,097 ) Other income and (expense): Interest and other income, net 3 18 (Loss) gain on foreign currency (15 ) 6 Loss from operations before income taxes (735 ) (1,073 ) Income tax — — Net loss $ (735 ) $ (1,073 ) Comprehensive loss, net of tax: Unrealized loss on securities — (52 ) Comprehensive loss $ (735 ) $ (1,125 ) Net loss per common share — basic Loss $ (0.01 ) $ (0.01 ) Weighted average Common Stock outstanding - basic (1) 91,726,375 89,350,286 (1) Potentially dilutive shares have not been included because to do so would be anti-dilutive.\nSource:Golden Minerals Company",
