    "text": "ValueAct Capital Management LP made its first foray in Japan by taking a 5% stake in medical-device maker Olympus Corp., the latest example of U.S.-based activist shareholders playing a bigger role in Asia.\nThe ValueAct investment represents a bet that Olympus OCPNY, +1.68% 7733, +2.80% has room to increase its profit and win a higher valuation from investors. Though best known among consumers for its cameras, the company gets nearly 80% of its revenue from endoscopes and other medical-imaging technology.\nActivism has been soaring in Asia, and Japan has introduced changes in corporate governance. That gave ValueAct hope it would find an open door for its style of activism, according to people familiar with the fund.\nThe San Francisco firm typically eschews board fights and public letters prescribing fixes to a company. Instead, it usually points out where it sees value increasing and what management is doing right or is on the way to fixing. It does often seek board seats in its private talks, however.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nEffects of E.coli in lettuce upend food-supply chain\nHow Trumpâ€™s pressure influenced the NFL to change anthem rules\nWe Want to Hear from You Join the conversation\nComment ",
