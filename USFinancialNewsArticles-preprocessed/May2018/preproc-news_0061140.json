    "text": "The addition of Menard will support BlueSnap as it continues triple digit growth in the payment industry\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BlueSnap , an online payments technology company, announced today that Chris Menard has joined the executive leadership team as the company’s chief financial officer. Menard joins BlueSnap with a strong legacy of financial leadership at some of Boston’s most prominent financial technology companies, and his experience overseeing multiple organizations through the initial public offering process will be invaluable as BlueSnap continues to grow year-over-year.\nIn his role with BlueSnap, Menard oversees the finance and legal teams. With a long and successful track record of growing organizations, he is positioned to guide BlueSnap as it continues to establish itself as a leader in the payments industry.\n“As the payment industry continues to thrive, I couldn’t be more excited to join such a well-established and respected executive team,” said Menard. “BlueSnap has invested heavily in its product and has already seen an amazing level of growth, and I look forward to building upon the company’s existing success.”\n“Chris’ financial expertise and reputation in the Boston tech community certainly precedes him,” said Ralph Dangelmaier, BlueSnap CEO. “As we continue to grow our payment offering to meet the needs of the middle market, Chris’ leadership and knowledge of the industry will be an invaluable addition to our team.”\nBefore joining BlueSnap, Menard served as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Cayan LLC where he was responsible for overseeing the payment technology provider’s general and administrative functions before the company was acquired by TSYS earlier this year. Prior to that, he held multiple chief financial officer positions at Brightcove, where he played an integral role in the company’s successful initial public offering in 2012, and Phase Forward, a publicly traded company that completed an IPO and 6 acquisitions during Menard’s tenure before being sold to Oracle in 2010. He also serves on the board of directors of Globoforce and the board of overseers at Babson College.\nMenard holds a BS in Finance from Babson College and an MBA in Finance from the Boston College Carroll School of Management.\nAbout BlueSnap\nBlueSnap provides an All-in-one Payment Platform designed to accelerate commerce for B2B and B2C businesses.
