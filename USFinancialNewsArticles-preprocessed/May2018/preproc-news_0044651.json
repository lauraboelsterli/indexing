    "text": "WICHITA, Kan., May 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. [NYSE: SPR] (the \"Company\") announced today that Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (\"Spirit\"), its wholly-owned subsidiary, has commenced an offer to purchase for cash any and all of the $300 million outstanding principal amount of its 5¼% Senior Notes due 2022 (CUSIP No. 85205TAF7) (the \"Notes\"). The tender offer is being made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated May 22, 2018, and a related Letter of Transmittal and Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, which set forth the terms and conditions of the tender offer in full detail. The tender offer is open to all registered holders of the Notes. The purpose of the tender offer is to retire debt associated with the Notes.\nHolders must validly tender their Notes or deliver to the information agent a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery in accordance with the instructions described in the Offer to Purchase at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 29, 2018 (such date and time, as they may be extended, the \"Expiration Time\"). Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Time will be eligible to receive the purchase price of $1,028.50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered. Tendering holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest from the last applicable interest payment date to, but not including, the settlement date of the tender offer.\nTendered Notes can only be withdrawn before the Expiration Time (the \"Withdrawal Deadline\"). Following the Withdrawal Deadline, holders who have tendered their Notes may not withdraw such Notes unless Spirit is required to extend withdrawal rights under applicable law.\nSpirit expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law, to terminate the tender offer at any time prior to the Expiration Time. The tender offer is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including the receipt by Spirit of proceeds from a proposed debt financing on terms reasonably satisfactory to Spirit. The tender offer is not contingent upon the tender of any minimum principal amount of Notes. Spirit reserves the right to waive any one or more of the conditions at any time.\nBofA Merrill Lynch is acting as the sole dealer manager for the tender offer. The depositary and information agent for the tender offer is Global Bondholder Services Corporation. Questions regarding the tender offer may be directed to BofA Merrill Lynch at (888) 292-0070 (toll-free) or (980) 387-2113 (collect).

The tender offer is being made solely by means of the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal. In any jurisdiction where the laws require a tender offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the tender offer will be deemed to be made on behalf of Spirit by the dealer manager, or one or more registered brokers or dealers under the laws of such jurisdiction.\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 : This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
