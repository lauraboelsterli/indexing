    "text": "Adam Jeffery | CNBC Michael Lewis, author of Flash Boys.\nNetflix has snagged a project based on Michael Lewis' 2014 non-fiction book, \"Flash Boys,\" according to Deadline .\nThe story revolves around a group of people that tries to expose \"the insidious new ways that Wall Street generates profits.\"\nThe adaptation comes just a couple years after the 2015 film, \"The Big Short,\" also based on a Michael Lewis book. Lewis is also known for books like \"Liar's Poker\" and \"Moneyball.\"\n\"The world clings to its old mental picture of the stock market because it's comforting; because it's so hard to draw a picture of what has replaced it; and because the few people able to draw it for you have no interest in doing so,\" Lewis writes in the introduction of \"Flash Boys.\" \"This book is an attempt to draw that picture.\" show chapters",
