    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Urban One, Inc. (NASDAQ: UONEK and UONE) today reported its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net revenue was approximately $99.6 million, a decrease of 1.6% from the same period in 2017. Broadcast and digital operating income 1 was approximately $32.5 million, a decrease of 7.0% from the same period in 2017. The Company reported operating income of approximately $7.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $16.5 million for the same period in 2017. Net loss was approximately $22.6 million or $0.48 per share (basic) compared to net loss of approximately $2.3 million or $0.05 per share (basic) for the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA 2 was approximately $28.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $27.7 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of 2.7%.\nAlfred C. Liggins, III, Urban One's CEO and President stated, \"I was pleased that we were able to grow our Adjusted EBITDA, despite some softness in the radio markets and ratings challenges at TV One. According to Miller Kaplan, our radio clusters outperformed their markets by 190 Bps. TV One ratings for primetime in the P25-54 demographic were down 9% vs Q1 2017, and sequentially flat vs. Q4 2017. Digital revenues continue to perform well, driven by our 2017 acquisition of the Bossip and Madame Noire brands and websites. Our cash generation for the quarter was strong; we added approximately $6.3 million of cash to the balance sheet while repurchasing $11.0 million of our 9.25% 2020 Notes, which re-affirms our commitment to reducing the Company's leverage. Finally, we recently entered into a binding agreement to sell WPZR in Detroit for $12.7 million, which represents a high double-digit seller's multiple and will further help to reduce our net leverage. Pro-forma for the asset sale, our net leverage ratio at March 31, 2018 was approximately 6.68x.\"\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands, except share data)\nNET REVENUE\n$ 99,621\n$ 101,289\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nProgramming and technical, excluding stock-based compensation\n32,147\n31,897\nSelling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation\n34,977\n34,455\nCorporate selling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation\n8,962\n10,039\nStock-based compensation\n1,376\n133\nDepreciation and amortization\n8,288\n8,312\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n6,556\n-\nTotal operating expenses\n92,306\n84,836\nOperating income\n7,315\n16,453\nINTEREST INCOME\n144\n103\nINTEREST EXPENSE\n19,281\n20,346\nGAIN ON RETIREMENT OF DEBT\n(239)\n-\nOTHER INCOME, net\n(1,901)\n(1,321)\nLoss before provision for (benefit from) income taxes and\nnoncontrolling interest in income (loss) of subsidiaries\n(9,682)\n(2,469)\nPROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES\n12,840\n(112)\nCONSOLIDATED NET LOSS\n(22,522)\n(2,357)\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n33\n(44)\nCONSOLIDATED NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS\n$ (22,555)\n$ (2,313)\nAMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS\nCONSOLIDATED NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS\n$ (22,555)\n$ (2,313)\nWeighted average shares outstanding -

Net revenues from our radio broadcasting segment decreased 0.6% compared to the same period in 2017. We experienced net revenue declines most significantly in our Atlanta, Raleigh and St. Louis markets, with our Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia and Richmond markets experiencing growth for the quarter. We recognized approximately $46.2 million of revenue from our cable television segment during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to approximately $48.6 million for the same period in 2017, with a decrease primarily in advertising sales. Net revenue from our Reach Media segment decreased approximately $1.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily to weaker demand. Finally, net revenues for our digital segment increased 47.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in direct revenues and due to performance from our digital acquisition.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and impairment of long-lived assets, decreased to approximately $76.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, down 0.4% from the approximately $76.4 million incurred for the comparable quarter in 2017. The overall operating expense decrease was driven by lower corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, which were partially offset by an increase of programming and technical expenses and an increase of selling, general and administrative expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased 0.3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the mix of assets approaching or near the end of their useful lives.\nInterest expense decreased to approximately $19.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to approximately $20.3 million for the same period in 2017. The Company made cash interest payments of approximately $18.4 million on its outstanding debt for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to cash interest payments of approximately $19.9 million on all outstanding instruments for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. On April 18, 2017, the Company closed on a new senior secured credit facility (the \"2017 Credit Facility\"). The proceeds from the 2017 Credit Facility were used to prepay in full the Company's previously existing senior secured credit facility and the agreement governing such credit facility was terminated on April 18, 2017.\nThe gain on retirement of debt of $239,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was due to the redemption of approximately $11 million of our 2020 Notes at a discount.\nThe impairment of long-lived assets for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was related to a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million recorded to reduce the carrying value of our Charlotte goodwill balance and a charge of approximately $3.8 million associated with our Detroit market radio broadcasting licenses.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $12.8 million on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of approximately $9.7 million, which results in a tax rate of (132.6)%. This tax rate is based on an estimated annual effective rate of (141.1)%, primarily attributable to the limitation of interest expense that results in a deferred tax benefit which is expected to be recognizable at the end of the year, and a discrete tax benefit of $823,000. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $112,000 on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of approximately $2.5 million, which results in a tax rate of 4.5%. This tax rate is based on an estimated annual effective rate of 18.6%, and a discrete tax provision adjustment for $346,000. The Company paid $748,000 and $167,000 in taxes 2017, respectively.\nOther income, net increased to approximately $1.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to approximately $1.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nThe increase in noncontrolling interests in income (loss) of subsidiaries was due primarily to net income recognized by Reach Media during the three months ended March 31, 2018, versus a net loss during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nOther pertinent financial information includes capital expenditures of $914,000 and approximately $1.5 million 2017, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company did not repurchase any Class A common stock and repurchased 1,000,455 shares of Class D common stock in the amount of approximately $1.9 million. There were no open market stock repurchases made during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company, in connection with its 2009 stock plan, is authorized to purchase shares of Class D common stock to satisfy employee tax obligations in connection with the vesting of share grants under the plan. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company executed a Stock Vest Tax Repurchase of 567,791 shares of Class D Common Stock in the amount of approximately $1.0 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company executed a Stock Vest Tax Repurchase of 317,103 shares of Class D Common Stock in the amount of $915,000.\nOn May 1, 2018, the Company announced it signed a definitive agreement to sell the assets of one of its Detroit, Michigan, radio stations, WPZR-FM (102.7 FM), to Educational Media Foundation, of California, for total consideration of approximately $12.7 million. As part of the deal, the Company will receive 3 FM translators that service the Detroit metropolitan area, and these signals will be combined with its existing FM translator to multicast the Detroit Praise Network. The closing on the sale of WPZR-FM is subject to customary conditions, prorations and adjustments, including approval from the FCC. Urban One expects the transaction to close shortly after final consent from the FCC.\nSupplemental Financial Information:\nFor comparative purposes, the following more detailed, unaudited statements of operations for the three are included.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\n(in thousands, unaudited)\nRadio\nReach\nCable\nCorporate/\nConsolidated\nBroadcasting\nMedia\nDigital\nTelevision\nEliminations\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS:\nNET REVENUE\n$\n99,621\n$\n39,513\n$\n6,520\n$\n8,146\n$\n46,186\n$\n(744)\nOPERATING EXPENSES:\nProgramming and technical\n32,147\n9,643\n4,286\n3,479\n14,811\n(72)\nSelling, general and administrative\n34,977\n17,420\n1,440\n6,906\n9,883\n(672)\nCorporate selling, general and administrative\n8,962\n-\n757\n1\n1,969\n6,235\nStock-based compensation\n1,376\n178\n18\n59\n3\n1,118\nDepreciation and amortization\n8,288\n870\n63\n476\n6,557\n322\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n6,556\n6,556\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal operating expenses\n92,306\n34,667\n6,564\n10,921\n33,223\n6,931\nOperating income (loss)\n7,315\n4,846\n(44)\n(2,775)\n12,963\n(7,675)\nINTEREST INCOME\n144\n-\n-\n-\n-\n144\nINTEREST EXPENSE\n19,281\n338\n-\n-\n1,919\n17,024\nGAIN ON RETIREMENT OF DEBT\n(239)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(239)\nOTHER INCOME, net\n(1,901)\n(219)\n-\n-\n-\n(1,682)\n(Loss) income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes\nand noncontrolling interest in income of subsidiaries\n(9,682)\n4,727\n(44)\n(2,775)\n11,044\n(22,634)\nPROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES\n12,840\n1,116\n50\n(509)\n2,705\n9,478\nCONSOLIDATED NET (LOSS) INCOME\n(22,522)\n3,611\n(94)\n(2,266)\n8,339\n(32,112)\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n33\n-\n-\n-\n-\n33\nNET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS\n$\n(22,555)\n$\n3,611\n$\n(94)\n$\n(2,266)\n$\n8,339\n$\n(32,145)\nAdjusted EBITDA 2\n$\n28,489\n$\n12,605\n$\n37\n$\n(696)\n$\n19,920\n$\n(3,377)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\n(in thousands, unaudited)\nRadio\nReach\nCable\nCorporate/\nConsolidated\nBroadcasting\nMedia\nDigital\nTelevision\nEliminations\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS:\nNET REVENUE\n$\n101,289\n$\n39,737\n$\n7,663\n$\n5,506\n$\n48,554\n$\n(171)\nOPERATING EXPENSES:\nProgramming and technical\n31,897\n7,917\n5,194\n2,603\n16,191\n(8)\nSelling, general and administrative\n34,455\n18,336\n1,497\n4,041\n10,685\n(104)\nCorporate selling, general and administrative\n10,039\n-\n1,224\n-\n2,311\n6,504\nStock-based compensation\n133\n64\n-\n-\n-\n69\nDepreciation and amortization\n8,312\n957\n54\n341\n6,561\n399\nTotal operating expenses\n84,836\n27,274\n7,969\n6,985\n35,748\n6,860\nOperating income (loss)\n16,453\n12,463\n(306)\n(1,479)\n12,806\n(7,031)\nINTEREST INCOME\n103\n-\n-\n-\n-\n103\nINTEREST EXPENSE\n20,346\n337\n-\n-\n1,919\n18,090\nOTHER INCOME, net\n(1,321)\n(25)\n-\n-\n-\n(1,296)\n(Loss) income before (benefit from) provision for income taxes and\nnoncontrolling interest in loss of subsidiaries\n(2,469)\n12,151\n(306)\n(1,479)\n10,887\n(23,722)\n(BENEFIT FROM) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n(112)\n4,661\n(122)\n22\n4,225\n(8,898)\nCONSOLIDATED NET (LOSS) INCOME\n(2,357)\n7,490\n(184)\n(1,501)\n6,662\n(14,824)\nNET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n(44)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(44)\nNET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS\n$\n(2,313)\n$\n7,490\n$\n(184)\n$\n(1,501)\n$\n6,662\n$\n(14,780)\nAdjusted EBITDA 2\n$\n27,745\n$\n13,748\n$\n(211)\n$\n(1,132)\n$\n19,394\n$\n(4,054)\nUrban One, Inc. will hold a conference call to discuss its results for the first fiscal quarter of 2018.

( urban1.com ), formerly known as Radio One, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is the largest diversified media company that primarily targets Black Americans and urban consumers in the United States. The Company owns TV One, LLC (tvone.tv), a television network serving more than 59 million households, offering a broad range of original programming, classic series and movies designed to entertain, inform and inspire a diverse audience of adult Black viewers. As one of the nation's largest radio broadcasting companies, Urban One currently owns and/or operates 56 broadcast stations in 15 urban markets in the United States. Through its controlling interest in Reach Media, Inc. ( blackamericaweb.com ), the Company also operates syndicated programming including the Tom Joyner Morning Show, Russ Parr Morning Show, Rickey Smiley Morning Show, Get up Morning! with Erica Campbell, DL Hughley Show, Willie Moore Jr Show, Nightly Spirit with Darlene McCoy, Reverend Al Sharpton Show. In addition to its radio and television broadcast assets, Urban One owns Interactive One, LLC ( ionedigital.com ), the largest digital resource for urban enthusiasts and Blacks, reaching millions each month through its Cassius and BHM Digital platforms. Additionally, One Solution , the Company's branded content agency and studio combines the dynamics of Urban One's holdings to provide brands with an integrated and effectively engaging marketing approach that reaches 82% of Black Americans throughout the country.\nNotes:\n1 \"Broadcast and digital operating income\" consists of net (loss) income before depreciation and amortization, corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation, income taxes, noncontrolling interest in income (loss) of subsidiaries, interest expense, impairment of long-lived assets, other (income) expense, loss (gain) on retirement of debt, gain on sale-leaseback and interest income. Broadcast and digital operating income is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles. Nevertheless, broadcast and digital operating income is a significant measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our core operating segments because broadcast and digital operating income provides helpful information about our results of operations apart from expenses associated with our fixed assets and long-lived intangible assets, income taxes, investments, debt financings and retirements, overhead, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, and asset sales. Our measure of broadcast and digital operating income is similar to industry use of station operating income; however, it reflects our more diverse business and therefore is not completely analogous to \"station operating income\" or other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Broadcast and digital operating income does not purport to represent operating income or cash flow from operating activities, as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles, and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to broadcast and digital operating income has been provided in this release.\n2 \"Adjusted EBITDA\" consists of net loss plus (1) depreciation, amortization, income taxes, interest expense, noncontrolling interest in (loss) income of subsidiaries, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, (gain) loss on retirement of debt, gain on sale-leaseback , Employment Agreement and incentive plan award expenses and other compensation, contingent consideration from acquisition, severance-related costs, cost investment income, less (2) other income and interest income. Net income before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as \"EBITDA.\" Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles. However, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is often a useful measure of a company's operating performance and is a significant measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our business because Adjusted EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our acquisitions and debt financing, our taxes, impairment charges, and gain on retirements of debt. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from the expenses associated with our fixed assets and long-lived intangible assets or capital structure. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the measures for comparing businesses in the broadcasting industry, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including, but not limited to the fact that our definition includes the results of all four segments (radio broadcasting, Reach Media, digital and cable television). Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA do not purport to represent operating income or cash flow from operating activities, as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles, and should not be considered as alternatives to those measurements as an indicator of our performance. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided in this release.\n3 For the three Urban One had 46,757,386 and 47,965,189 shares of common stock outstanding on a weighted average basis (basic), respectively.\n4 For the three Urban One had 46,757,386 and 47,965,189 shares of common stock outstanding on a weighted average basis (fully diluted for outstanding stock awards), respectively.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/urban-one-inc-reports-first-quarter-results-300640564.html\nSOURCE Urban One, Inc.",
