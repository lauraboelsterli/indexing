    "text": "1 COMMENTS Twitter Inc., TWTR -2.04% which recently posted its second profitable quarter as a public company, has more work to do to sustain its financial turnaround, said Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal.\nTwitter invested in monitoring and removing more objectionable content, and is rolling out tweaks to its social network more frequently. Those changes bolstered user engagement and Twitter’s standing with advertisers. The company’s improving reputation had a direct impact on lifting the share of marketing budgets advertisers earmark for the platform, said Mr. Segal in an interview to the CFO Journal\n“We’ve made a lot of progress in the last couple of quarters,” Mr. Segal said. “We have a lot more work to do.”\nMr. Segal, who became CFO last August, brought stability and a firm hand at the social media company. He advanced the turnaround efforts started by his predecessor Anthony Noto, who was juggling two roles as heads of finance and operations. Twitter, which went public in 2013, has reported its first two profitable quarters after posting 16 straight quarters of losses.\nBut the social-media platform has a bumpy road ahead. While existing users might be returning, advertisers question whether the company can add enough new users to catch up to juggernauts like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google or stay ahead of the increasingly crowded field of competitors.\nTwitter posted a net income of $61 million on revenue of $664.9 million in the first three months of 2018. The company projected adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of between $245 million and $265 million for the current quarter and expects to be profitable for the full year for the first time.\nNewsletter Sign-up The question revolving around Twitter now is whether its financial turnaround is sustainable, said Brent Thill, analyst with Jefferies Group LLC. The recent profitable quarters are less than impressive because the bar wasn’t that high to begin with, he said.\n“I think they went through their growing pains, they had a lot of management changes, they went through some hard times,” Mr. Thill said. Now, however, “Twitter is a good company that’s just up against better companies.”\nMr. Segal said that higher ad engagement boosted revenue in the recent quarter. Ad buyers have noticed Twitter’s improved audience numbers, more sophisticated use of video on the site and the company’s efforts to weed out spam, hate speech and suspicious account, he added. “The sentiment with advertisers is so much better than it was a year or two ago,” Mr. Segal said. “We’re no longer losing share.”\nAccording to Mr. Segal, Twitter’s daily active users—a mix of existing and new users—have grown 10% or more, year-over-year, over the past six quarters. Monthly users inched up a more modest 1.8% over the past quarter to 336 million, according to company filings.\n“Everyday, 2 million or more people get on Twitter who haven’t on the service for a month or more and a third of them have never been on twitter before,” Mr. Segal said.\nMore\nFormer CFO Centered Clorox’s Business on the Domestic Market May 7, 2018 Caterpillar Names National Grid Executive as New CFO May 4, 2018 U.K.’s Whitbread to Spin Off Costa Coffee Chain April 25, 2018 Twitter, while among the major digital ad players in the U.S., is in danger of being overtaken by other platforms such as Snapchat, said Monica Peart, senior forecasting director for research firm eMarketer.\n“They’re growing in daily active users, that’s a bright spot for the platform, that means that users that are already on there are becoming more engaged,” Ms. Peart said. “But when we talk about completely new users, that’s where Twitter has had some trouble.”\nTwitter’s share of global digital ad revenue will remain flat at 0.8% this year and next, after declining between 2016 and 2017 from 1.2% to 0.9%, according to the latest estimates from eMarketer. Global digital ad revenue itself is set to grow 16% in 2019, the firm forecasts. Google and Facebook dominate those rankings, accounting for roughly a third and 18%, respectively, of the global share.\nMr. Segal said he is focused on the continued improvement of Twitter.\n“One of the great things about Twitter, we are very self-aware internally at what we’re really good at and what we can get better,” he said.\nLaura Chavoen, executive strategy director at New York-based ad agency McGarryBowen, said she has noticed improvements in Twitter’s timeline. But, she added, the site still has much work to do in cleaning up its rough-and-tumble reputation.\n“Twitter is an incredibly noisy place,” she said. “Brands are becoming increasingly accountable for when and where their ads show up.”\nTwitter will continue to embrace its role as a center for events and topics, Mr. Segal said.\nFor instance, President Donald Trump uses it as a way to communicate to the public. Recently, the site has 30 content deals with new and existing partners including NBCUniversal and Walt Disney Co.\n“In my career I hadn’t seen as big a disconnect between a company’s opportunity set and the impact that they have on the world and their financial profile,” Mr. Segal said.\n—Georgia Wells contributed to this article.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com",
