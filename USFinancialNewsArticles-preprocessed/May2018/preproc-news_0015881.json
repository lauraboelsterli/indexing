Nuts are sold at a market, ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in Cairo, Egypt, May 6, 2018. REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany\nVolunteers have been busy preparing half a million staple food boxes for the poor. Others are preparing to set up 60 massive tents across the country to serve the iftar meals that follow dawn-to-dusk fasting during Ramadan.\n“We are giving out the largest box in Egypt,” said Sherif Azzouz, head of the volunteer network at Misr El Kheir, one of the charities involved.\nEach box weighs 25 kg (55 lbs) and contains 16 products, including rice, pasta, ghee, sugar, flour, orzo, wheat and tea. Traditional Ramadan lanterns called \"fanous\" are displayed for sale at a stall, ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in Cairo, Egypt, May 6, 2018. REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany\n“This goes to all those who have been deemed eligible by Misr El Kheir and any of our partner charities, and are distributed in Upper Egypt, starting from Fayoum to Aswan, and also in some parts of the Delta,” he told Reuters.\nAzzouz said Misr El Kheir, working with other smaller charities, hoped to feed a total of 10 million fasting people across the country’s 22 provinces. Slideshow (6 Images)\nEgypt has imposed tough economic reforms under a $12 billion IMF loan program, including deep cuts to energy subsidies and new taxes that have brought hardship for many.\nA currency float in late 2016 caused Egypt’s pound to roughly halve in value, pushing prices sharply higher in the import-dependent country.\nFood demand soars during Ramadan as families stock up on supplies, causing further price rises.\nAhead of Ramadan, Egypt’s Ministry of Supply said it was storing essential goods at state outlets and selling subsidized products to keep prices under control.\n“One of our larger contributions is around 3.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($198 million) worth of subsidized products that are available to 70 million citizens,” said Mohamed Sweed, a ministry spokesman. They include sugar, oil, rice and pasta.\nRamadan is expected to start in Egypt on May 17 this year. The first day of the holy month often varies from country to country, depending on lunar sightings. Reporting by Mohamed Zaki; writing Sami Aboudi; editing by Andrew Roche",
