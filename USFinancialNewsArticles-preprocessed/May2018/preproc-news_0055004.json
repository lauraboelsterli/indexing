    "text": "16 Hours Ago | 00:59\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon University and ASU Tech have come up with an idea for a projector watch that turns your arm into a touchscreen. The LumiWatch prototype uses a built-in, 15-lumen laser projector to display a smartphone-sized interface on the user's arm. It can be swiped and tapped like a traditional touchscreen. The watch has custom software that removes image distortion and calibrates the screen for each user. The battery will run for an entire day and can run a continuous projection for around an hour.\nIf it were to eventually go on sale, the researchers estimate it would cost around $600. ",
