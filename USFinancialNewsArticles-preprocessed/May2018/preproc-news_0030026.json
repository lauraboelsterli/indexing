    "text": "ADDISON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Daseke Inc. (NASDAQ: DSKE), the largest flatbed and specialized trucking company in North America, today announced the formation of Daseke Fleet Services.\nThe new department will support Daseke’s growing scale by leveraging areas such as purchasing, equipment optimization, and maintenance. Daseke now has a revenue run rate in excess of $1 billion annually and has a fleet of more than 5,200 trucks and 11,000 flatbed and specialized trailers.\nEffective May 14, Daseke Fleet Services will focus on supporting the Daseke family of operating companies through lifecycle management of revenue equipment—including maximization of national purchasing power, enhanced maintenance programs, strategic disposition of assets, and high-level warranty management. The fleet services team members will bring to Daseke their years of industry experience and knowledge to secure stronger economics involving tractors, trailers, fuel, tires, parts, and service.\nDaseke’s strategy of building the premier flatbed and specialized logistics company attracted three veteran executives with large truckload carrier experience to join the Daseke family: Brett Thompson , vice president of purchasing; Erek Starnes , vice president of equipment operations; and Gloria Pliler , director of purchasing. Daseke Fleet Services will be based in Phoenix and will report directly to Daseke president Scott Wheeler. The three new executives each have more than 30 years of trucking industry experience and will be joined by existing Daseke director of procurement Ken Snyder .\n“The creation of Daseke Fleet Services is a significant milestone for Daseke, as we have reached a scale where we can improve our cost efficiencies in ways that support both our operating companies and our overall organic growth,” Wheeler said. “We’re especially pleased that three of the trucking industry’s top equipment and maintenance executives from one of the industry’s leading trucking companies have joined us to make Daseke Fleet Services a reality – another indication that our philosophy of investing in people is working.”\nAbout Daseke, Inc.\nDaseke is a leading consolidator and the largest owner of flatbed and specialized transportation solutions in North America. Daseke offers comprehensive, best-in-class services to some of the world’s most respected industrial shippers through its experienced people, its approximately 5,200 trucks and 11,000 flatbed and specialized trailers, and a million-plus square feet of industrial warehousing space.
