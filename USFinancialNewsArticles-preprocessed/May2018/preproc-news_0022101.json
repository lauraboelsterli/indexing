    "text": "LIMA, Peru, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Camposol S.A. (the \"Company\" or \"we\") announced today that in connection with its offer to purchase for cash (\"Tender Offer\") any and all its outstanding 10.50% Notes due 2021 (the \"Notes\"), it has extended the Expiration Date (as such term is defined in the Statement (as defined below)) of the Tender Offer until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on May 14, 2018.\nAs of 5:00 p.m. on May 9, 2018, $113,843,000 principal amount of the Notes have been validly tendered in the Tender Offer, representing approximately 77.19% of the principal amount outstanding of the Notes. Holders who have validly tendered their Notes do not have to re-tender their Notes or take any other action as a result of the extension of the Expiration Date of the Tender Offer.\nThe other terms and conditions of the Tender Offer set forth in the Offer to Purchase for Cash Statement dated April 27, 2018 (the \"Statement\") still apply.\nThe Company has retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to serve as the dealer managers for the Tender Offer. Questions regarding the tender offer may be directed to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at +1 (212) 834-7279 (collect) or (866) 846-2874 (toll-free) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated at +1 (646) 855-8988 (collect) or (888) 292-0070 (toll-free).

Holders must make their own decisions as to whether to tender their Notes, and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender.\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and is not a recommendation and is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. The Tender Offer is being made solely pursuant to the Tender Offer documents.\nThe Tender Offer does not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not permitted by law or in which the person making such offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation.\nIn any jurisdiction where the securities, blue sky or other laws require tender offers to be made by a licensed broker or dealer and in which the dealer managers, or any affiliates thereof, are so licensed, the Tender Offer will be deemed to have been made by any such dealer managers, or such affiliates, on behalf of the Company.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release and the Statement contain statements which may constitute \"forward-looking statements\". These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but instead represent only our belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. Words such as \"expect,\" \"may,\" \"intend,\" \"should\" and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements after the date on which they are made in light of new information, future events and other factors.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/camposol-sa-extends-the-expiration-date-of-its-tender-offer-for-any-and-all-of-its-10-50-notes-due-2021--300646298.html\nSOURCE Camposol S.A.",
