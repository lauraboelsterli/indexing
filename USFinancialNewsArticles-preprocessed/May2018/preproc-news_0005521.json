    "text": "Pro Forma including Zenium, Signed $45 Million in Annualized GAAP Revenue\nYear-over-Year Revenue Growth of 32% and Adjusted EBITDA Growth of 36%\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CyrusOne Inc. (NASDAQ: CONE), a premier global data center REIT, today announced first quarter 2018 earnings.\nHighlights\nCategory\n1Q’18\n% Change\nvs. 1Q’17\nRevenue $196.6 million 32% Net income $43.5 million n/m Adjusted EBITDA $109.5 million 36% Normalized FFO $82.2 million 34% Net income per share $0.45 n/m Normalized FFO per share $0.85 18% •\nPro forma including Zenium, leased 32 megawatts (“MW”) and 240,000 colocation square feet (“CSF”) in the first quarter, totaling $45 million in annualized GAAP revenue\n-- Includes 29 MW and 226,000 CSF totaling $40.4 million in annualized revenue signed by CyrusOne and 3 MW and 14,000 CSF totaling $4.2 million in annualized GAAP revenue signed by Zenium •\nBacklog of $39 million in annualized GAAP revenue as of the end of the first quarter, representing more than $230 million in total contract value\n•\nAdded three Fortune 1000 companies as new customers, increasing the total number of Fortune 1000 customers to 200 as of the end of the quarter\n•\nEntered into a new senior unsecured credit agreement, increasing the size of the credit facility by $1.0 billion, or 50%, to a total of $3.0 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion revolving credit facility and $1.3 billion in term loan commitments\n-- Agreement also provides for an extension of maturity dates, reductions in interest rate margins, and enhanced flexibility in support of the Company’s international expansion plans, including the ability to borrow in non-USD currencies •\nRaised approximately $152 million in net proceeds through the sale of 3.0 million shares of common stock under the at-the-market (“ATM”) equity program\n•\nAcquisition of Zenium, a leading hyperscale data center provider in Europe with four properties in London and Frankfurt, the continent’s two largest data center markets, expected to close in May, pending final regulatory approval\n“We had one of the highest quarterly leasing totals in the Company’s history and continued strong financial performance, with Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA each growing over 30%” said Gary Wojtaszek, president and chief executive officer of CyrusOne. “We are excited to begin our global expansion by establishing a presence in the two largest markets in Europe, London and Frankfurt, at a time when demand across the continent has accelerated and our customers are increasingly asking us to support their international growth objectives.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue was $196.6 million for the first quarter, compared to $149.3 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of 32%. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by a 29% increase in occupied CSF, lease termination fees totaling $5.0 million, and additional interconnection services. The lease termination fees related primarily to a reimbursement for capital expenditures made in connection with the delivery of an initial deployment for a customer that subsequently migrated from that location to another CyrusOne facility.\nNet income was $43.5 million for the first quarter, compared to net loss of $30.4 million in the same period in 2017. Net income for the first quarter included a $40.5 million unrealized gain on the Company’s equity investment in GDS due to an increase in GDS’s share price during the quarter. Net income per basic and diluted common share 1 was $0.45 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net loss of $(0.36) per basic and diluted common share in the same period in 2017.\nNet operating income (NOI) 2 was $128.8 million for the first quarter, compared to $97.0 million in the same period in 2017, an increase of 33%. Adjusted EBITDA 3 was $109.5 million for the first quarter, compared to $80.7 million in the same period in 2017, an increase of 36%.\nNormalized Funds From Operations (Normalized FFO) 4 was $82.2 million for the first quarter, compared to $61.2 million in the same period in 2017, an increase of 34%. Normalized FFO per basic and diluted common share was $0.85 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 18% over first quarter 2017.\nLeasing Activity\nCyrusOne leased approximately 29 MW of power and 226,000 CSF in the first quarter, representing $3.4 million in monthly recurring rent, inclusive of the monthly impact of installation charges, or approximately $40.4 million in annualized GAAP revenue 5 , excluding estimates for pass-through power. This excludes the impact of leases signed by Zenium in the first quarter. The weighted average lease term of the new leases, based on square footage, is 77 months (6.4 years), and the weighted average remaining lease term of CyrusOne’s portfolio is 53 months (taking into account the impact of the backlog). Recurring rent churn 6 for the first quarter was 0.5%, compared to 1.4% for the same period in 2017.\nPortfolio Development and CSF Leased\nIn the first quarter, the Company completed construction on 82,000 CSF and 27 MW of power capacity across four projects in Dallas, Northern Virginia, Phoenix and Austin, increasing total CSF across 45 data centers to approximately 3.35 million CSF. CSF leased 7 as of the end of the first quarter was 92% for stabilized properties 8 and 86% overall. In addition, the Company has development projects underway in Dallas, Northern Virginia, San Antonio, Phoenix, the New York Metro area, and Chicago that are expected to add approximately 132,000 CSF and 36 MW of power capacity.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had gross assets 9 totaling approximately $5.3 billion, an increase of approximately 28% over gross assets as of March 31, 2017. CyrusOne had $2.20 billion of long-term debt 10 , cash and cash equivalents of $228.7 million, and $1.7 billion available under its unsecured revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2018. Net debt 10 was $1.99 billion as of March 31, 2018, representing approximately 28% of the Company's total enterprise value as of March 31, 2018 of $7.1 billion, or 4.5x Adjusted EBITDA for the last quarter annualized. Available liquidity 11 was $2.22 billion as of March 31, 2018.\nAs previously announced, CyrusOne entered into a new senior unsecured credit agreement in the first quarter, increasing the size of the credit facility by $1.0 billion, or 50%, to a total of $3.0 billion. The new agreement also provides for an extension of maturity dates, reductions in interest rate margins, and enhanced flexibility in support of the Company’s international expansion plans, including the ability to borrow in non-USD currencies.\nThe agreement consists of a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, which includes a $750 million multicurrency borrowing sublimit, and term loan commitments totaling $1.3 billion. The term loan commitments consist of a $1.0 billion five-year term loan, which includes a delayed draw feature allowing the Company to draw $300 million in up to three tranches over a six-month period in multiple currencies, and a new $300 million seven-year term loan. The interest rate margins applicable to the revolving credit facility and the five-year term loan based on the Company’s current leverage level have been decreased by 10 basis points to LIBOR plus 1.45% and LIBOR plus 1.40%, respectively, while the interest rate margin applicable to the seven-year term loan based on the Company’s current leverage level is LIBOR plus 1.70%. The maturity of the revolving credit facility is March 2022, and the facility includes a one-year extension option which, if exercised by the Company, would extend the final maturity to March 2023. The maturity of the five-year term loan is March 2023, and the seven-year term loan matures in March 2025. The credit agreement also contains an accordion that allows the Company to obtain up to $1 billion in additional revolving or term loan commitments.\nAlso in the first quarter, CyrusOne sold approximately 3.0 million shares of its common stock through its ATM equity program at an average price of $51.24, raising approximately $152 million in net equity proceeds. As of March 31, 2018, there was approximately $346 million in remaining availability under the current ATM program.\nDividend\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company announced a dividend of $0.46 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018. The dividend was paid on April 13, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 29, 2018.\nAdditionally, today the Company is announcing a dividend of $0.46 per share of common stock for the second quarter of 2018. The dividend will be paid on July 13, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 29, 2018.\nGuidance\nCyrusOne is reaffirming guidance for full year 2018.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"predicts,\" \"projects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" \"continues,\" \"endeavors,\" \"strives,\" \"may,\" variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned these forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this release and those discussed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). More information on potential risks and uncertainties is available in our recent filings with the SEC, including CyrusOne's Form 10-K report, Form 10-Q reports, and Form 8-K reports. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard with respect to revenue recognition, see “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our financial statements included on Form 10-Q for additional information. We have adopted the new standard using the modified retroactive transition method, where financial statement presentations prior to the date of adoption are not adjusted. Accordingly, all information related to periods prior to 2018 have not been adjusted, including non-GAAP measurements.\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are helpful in understanding the Company's business, as further discussed within this press release. These financial measures, which include Funds From Operations, Normalized Funds From Operations, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Operating Income, Adjusted Net Operating Income, and Net Debt should not be construed as being more important than comparable GAAP measures. Detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures have been included in the tables that accompany this release and are available in the Investor Relations section of www.cyrusone.com .\nManagement uses FFO, Normalized FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, and Adjusted NOI as supplemental performance measures because they provide performance measures that, when compared year over year, capture trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The Company also believes that, as widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other companies, these measures will be used by investors as a basis to compare its operating performance with that of other companies. Other companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner, and, as presented, they may not be comparable to others. Therefore, FFO, Normalized FFO, NOI, Adjusted NOI, and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income as measures of our performance. FFO, Normalized FFO, NOI, Adjusted NOI, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be used as measures of liquidity or as indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including the ability to pay dividends. These measures also should not be used as substitutes for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n1 Net income / (loss) per common share is defined as net income / (loss) divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period, which were 96.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 (basic and diluted). The difference between basic and diluted net income per share was less than one cent.\n2 We use Net Operating Income (\"NOI\"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the REIT industry, as a supplemental performance measure. We use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, when compared period over period, it captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, NOI is used by investors as a basis to evaluate REITs.\nWe calculate NOI as revenue less property operating expenses, each of which are presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Amortization of deferred leasing costs is presented in depreciation and amortization, which is excluded from NOI. Marketing and advertising costs are not property-specific, rather these costs support our entire portfolio. As a result, we have excluded these marketing and advertising costs from our NOI calculation, consistent with the treatment of general and administrative costs, which also support our entire portfolio. However, the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate NOI in the same manner. Accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to others. Therefore, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to revenue and to net income (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity or as indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. NOI also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\n3 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) as defined by U.S. GAAP plus interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, asset impairments and (gain) loss on disposals, stock-based compensation, transaction and integration costs, severance and management transition costs, new accounting standards and systems implementation costs, lease exit costs, legal claim costs, loss on early extinguishment of debt, unrealized (gain) on marketable equity investments and other special items. Other companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. Accordingly, the Company's Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to others.\n4 We use funds from operations (\"FFO\") and normalized funds from operations (\"Normalized FFO\"), which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry, as supplemental performance measures. We use FFO and Normalized FFO as supplemental performance measures because, when compared period over period, they capture trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs, FFO and Normalized FFO are used by investors as a basis to evaluate REITs. We calculate FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP before real estate depreciation and amortization and asset impairments and gain or loss on disposal. While it is consistent with the definition of FFO promulgated by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), our computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other REITs. Accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to others.\nWe calculate Normalized FFO as FFO plus amortization of customer relationship intangibles, transaction acquisition and other integration costs, legal claim costs and lease exit costs, and other special items including loss on early extinguishment of debt, new accounting standards and system implementation costs, and severance and management transition costs, as appropriate. Because the value of the customer relationship intangibles is inextricably connected to the real estate acquired, the Company believes the amortization of such intangibles and impairments of such intangibles is analogous to real estate depreciation and impairments; therefore, the Company adds the customer relationship intangible amortization and impairments back for similar treatment with real estate depreciation and impairments. The Company believes its Normalized FFO calculation provides a comparable measure to that used by others in the industry. Other REITs may not calculate Normalized FFO in the same manner. Accordingly, our Normalized FFO may not be comparable to others.\nIn addition, because FFO and Normalized FFO exclude real estate depreciation and amortization and real estate impairments, and capture neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or from market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO and Normalized FFO as measures of our performance is limited. Therefore, FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered only as supplements to net income (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our performance. FFO and Normalized FFO should not be used as measures of our liquidity or as indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. FFO and Normalized FFO also should not be used as supplements to or substitutes for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\n5 Annualized GAAP revenue is equal to monthly recurring rent, defined as average monthly contractual rent during the term of the lease plus the monthly impact of installation charges, multiplied by 12. It can be shown both inclusive and exclusive of the Company’s estimate of customer reimbursements for metered power.\n6 Recurring rent churn is calculated as any reduction in recurring rent due to customer terminations, service reductions or net pricing decreases as a percentage of rent at the beginning of the period, excluding any impact from metered power reimbursements or other usage-based billing.\n7 CSF leased is calculated by dividing CSF under signed leases for available space (whether or not the contract has commenced billing) by total CSF. CSF Leased differs from CSF Occupied presented in the Data Center Portfolio table because the leased rate includes CSF for signed leases that have not commenced billing.\n8 Stabilized properties include data halls that have been in service for at least 24 months or are at least 85% leased.\n9 Gross asset value is defined as total assets plus accumulated depreciation.\n10 Long-term debt and net debt exclude adjustments for deferred financing costs and bond premiums. Net debt provides a useful measure of liquidity and financial health. The Company defines net debt as long-term debt and capital lease obligations, offset by cash and cash equivalents.\n11 Liquidity is calculated as cash, cash equivalents, and temporary cash investments on hand, plus the undrawn capacity on CyrusOne's revolving credit facility and the delayed draw term loan.\nAbout CyrusOne\nCyrusOne (NASDAQ: CONE) is a high-growth real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in highly reliable enterprise-class, carrier-neutral data center properties.

Lease agreements typically include payments that escalate over the term of the contract or, to a lesser extent, a ramp period. (b) Deferred revenue, primarily installation revenue:\nRepresents payments received from customers in excess of revenue recognized under U.S. GAAP. This primarily relates to specific customer-requested buildouts that CyrusOne does not include in its basic data center design. The company charges customers up front for these buildouts rather than incorporating into rent and billing them over time. The cash payments for these buildouts are non-recurring, and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, but revenue is amortized over the life of the lease.

Pre-stabilized properties include data halls that have been in service for less than 24 months and are less than 85% leased. (c) Represents monthly contractual rent (defined as cash rent including customer reimbursements for metered power) under existing customer leases as of March 31, 2018, multiplied by 12. For the month of March 2018, customer reimbursements were $80.6 million annualized and consisted of reimbursements by customers across all facilities with separately metered power. Customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power vary from month-to-month based on factors such as our customers' utilization of power and the suppliers' pricing of power. From April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2018, customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power constituted between 10.2% and 12.6% of annualized rent. After giving effect to abatements, free rent and other straight-line adjustments, our annualized effective rent as of March 31, 2018 was $707.7 million. Our annualized effective rent was greater than our annualized rent as of March 31, 2018 because our positive straight-line and other adjustments and amortization of deferred revenue exceeded our negative straight-line adjustments due to factors such as the timing of contractual rent escalations and customer prepayments for services. (d) CSF represents the NRSF at an operating facility that is currently leased or readily available for lease as colocation space, where customers locate their servers and other IT equipment. (e) Percent occupied is determined based on CSF billed to customers under signed leases as of March 31, 2018 divided by total CSF. Leases signed but that have not commenced billing as of March 31, 2018 are not included. (f) Percent leased is calculated by dividing CSF under signed leases for colocation space (whether or not the lease has commenced billing) by total CSF. (g) Represents the NRSF at an operating facility that is currently leased or readily available for lease as space other than CSF, which is typically office and other space. (h) Percent occupied is determined based on Office & Other space being billed to customers under signed leases as of March 31, 2018 divided by total Office & Other space. Leases signed but not commenced as of March 31, 2018 are not included.

(l) Critical load capacity represents the aggregate power available for lease and exclusive use by customers expressed in terms of megawatts. The capacity reported is for non-redundant megawatts, as we can develop flexible solutions to our customers at multiple resiliency levels. Does not sum to total due to rounding.

(b) Represents the number of customers occupying data center, office and other space as of March 31, 2018. This may vary from total customer count as some customers may be under contract, but have yet to occupy space. (c) Represents the total square feet at a facility under lease and that has commenced billing, excluding space held for development or space used by CyrusOne. A customer’s leased NRSF is estimated based on such customer’s direct CSF or office and light-industrial space plus management’s estimate of infrastructure support space, including mechanical, telecommunications and utility rooms, as well as building common areas. (d) Represents monthly contractual rent (defined as cash rent including customer reimbursements for metered power) under existing customer leases as of March 31, 2018, multiplied by 12. For the month of March 2018, customer reimbursements were $80.6 million annualized and consisted of reimbursements by customers across all facilities with separately metered power. Customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power vary from month-to-month based on factors such as our customers' utilization of power and the suppliers' pricing of power. From April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2018, customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power constituted between 10.2% and 12.6% of annualized rent. After giving effect to abatements, free rent and other straight-line adjustments, our annualized effective rent as of March 31, 2018 was $707.7 million. Our annualized effective rent was greater than our annualized rent as of March 31, 2018 because our positive straight-line and other adjustments and amortization of deferred revenue exceeded our negative straight-line adjustments due to factors such as the timing of contractual rent escalations and customer prepayments for services.
