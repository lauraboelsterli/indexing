    "text": "May 25 (Reuters) - ICICI Bank Ltd said on Friday the lender and its chief executive, Chanda Kochhar, had received a notice from India’s capital markets regulator seeking responses over alleged non-compliance with certain rules.\nThe bank said it would respond to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, adding that the notice received on Thursday was based on information given by the bank and its CEO on earlier queries over their dealings with the Videocon conglomerate.\nICICI, India’s third-biggest lender by assets, is battling allegations that Kochhar allegedly favoured Videocon Group in its lending practices. Videocon’s founders had an investment in a renewable energy company founded by Kochhar’s husband.\nThe bank has backed Kochhar, calling the rumours “malicious and unfounded”.
