Photo: Reuters\nFifth-generation wireless technology , known as 5G, could significantly decrease reliance on physical networking hardware and give companies quicker and easier access to applications in the cloud, the head of an enterprise networking community said Monday.\n“5G plays into (companies’) hybrid and multi-cloud strategies,” said Nick Lippis, co-founder and co-chairman of ONUG, a group of IT leaders that advocate for creating open networking standards. “It’s a much more streamlined way to access information and IT.”\nWidespread deployment of 5G, the expected next step after today’s 4G LTE wireless technology, could cut corporate spending on physical infrastructure as firms connect wirelessly to cloud services, Mr. Lippis said. The technology would speed access to cloud applications and free up IT departments to focus on orchestration, application development, network monitoring and security, he said.\nA handful of companies in the U.S. and Asia are expected to start offering commercial 5G service as soon as this year, the Journal has reported . But firms won’t realize the benefit overnight. 5G technology will need millions of new cellular radio antennae that have yet to be installed, the Journal notes, and companies such as Apple Inc. will have to develop devices that can take advantage of the technology.\nProponents say 5G could enable self-driving cars to communicate seamlessly with one another on the road, or allow consumers to stream virtual or augmented reality experiences on their phones with no interruptions. High-speed, low-latency connections could help companies implement their real-time analytics and Internet of Things strategies.\nIt’s still too early for enterprise deployments, Mr. Lippis said, but some firms have begun listing 5G requirements inside requests for proposals. Today, many IT departments serve as systems integrators, stitching together cloud, security, 5G and other technologies to create new products and services.\nNaming 5G as a digital “building block” alongside cloud and mobile, he recommended CIOs communicate to vendors the need for service-level APIs so they can customize the technology to fit their needs.\nWrite to steven.norton@wsj.com\nShare this: 5G NICK LIPPIS ONUG Previous The Morning Download: CIOs Say Blockchain Adoption Barely Registers",
