At the latest, it should be in next year’s white paper,” he added.\n“It could be as part of the (current) green investments mandate but if so the sum needs to increase sufficiently.”\nThose investments amounted to 75 billion crowns ($9.30 billion) at end-2017, a government white paper said in April. $1 = 8.0602 Norwegian crowns Reporting by Gwladys Fouche, editing by Terje Solsvik",
