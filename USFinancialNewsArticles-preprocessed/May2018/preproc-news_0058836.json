REUTERS/Neil Hall\nOverall shop prices fell by 1.1 percent in year-on-year terms, making May the 61st month of prices declining, data from the British Retail Consortium (BSC) showed.\nThe BRC’s survey highlighted a widening gap between rising prices for food and falling prices for other goods.\nPrices of non-food items fell by the most since August 2016, down 2.5 percent in year-on-year terms in May, while food inflation picked up to 1.2 percent from 1.0 percent in April.\n“While food inflation has increased this month as the weather, oil price and other geo-political factors have influenced global agricultural markets, we expect overall prices to fall in the coming months,” BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.\nLast week, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said inflation would probably rise slightly in the coming months before resuming a decline.

REUTERS/Phil Noble\nThe BoE has said it expects to raise interest rates gradually over the next three years.\nBritish inflation rose sharply after the 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union which pushed down the value of the pound, but the impact of the weaker currency was diminishing, the BRC said.\nConsumer spending has been squeezed for more than a year by above-target inflation.\nThe Confederation of British Industry said consumer-focused businesses like hotels and restaurants had reported a fall in sales over the past three months in its latest survey, also published on Tuesday. But business and professional services enjoyed the fastest growth since August 2015.\n“For all services, rising costs are exerting pressure on margins, but in business and professional services, sales volumes are helping profitability to kick in,” CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
