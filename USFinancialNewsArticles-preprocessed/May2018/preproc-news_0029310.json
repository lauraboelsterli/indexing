    "text": "LINDON, Utah, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Profire Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFIE), a technology company (the “Company”) which creates, installs and services burner and chemical management solutions in the oil and gas industry, today reported financial results for its fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. A conference call will be held on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. EDT to discuss the results.\nFiscal Q1 2018 Highlights\nRevenues Increased to $12.1 million or an Increase of 55% Compared to Same Year-Ago Quarter Net Income of $1.8 Million or $0.04 Per Share, a 213% Increase From the Same Quarter Last Year Gross Profit Increased to roughly $6.1 Million Cash and Liquid Investments at Period End totaled over $25 Million Remained Debt-Free\nFiscal Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenues increased to just over $12 million in the quarter which is a 55% increase from the same quarter a year ago and an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Profire has now had seven consecutive quarters of significant revenue growth.\nWith a 55% increase in revenues, total operating expenses only increased 18% to $3.9 million, over the same quarter last year.\nGross profit increased to roughly $6.1 million or 50% of total revenues, as compared to $4.3 million or 56% of total revenues in the year-ago quarter.\nCompared with the same year ago quarter, operating expenses for general and administrative increased 13%, R&D increased 103%, and depreciation decreased 14%.\nNet income was $1.8 million or a gain of $0.04 per share, compared to a net income of $600,000 or $0.01 per share in the same year-ago quarter.\nCash and liquid investments totaled over $25 million at the end of the quarter and the Company continues to operate debt-free.\nManagement Commentary\n“The increases we experienced in the quarter are largely attributed to our ability to leverage our larger customer base while the macro environment continues to improve,” stated Ryan Oviatt, CFO of Profire. “While focusing on increasing revenues we’ve worked to create a solid foundation that can support future growth. In the quarter we continued to manage costs while recognizing growth in both our legacy products and newer product lines. This strategy ensured that our revenue growth significantly outpaced our increase in costs.”\n“Our performance is a direct result of our strategic planning and execution. The success we are experiencing is partially enabled by Profire’s standard of remaining debt free. At quarter end, Profire had zero debt and cash and liquid investments in excess of $25 million,” said Brenton Hatch, President and CEO of Profire Energy. “We plan to build on our momentum from 2017, through 2018, as evidenced here in our first quarter. We believe we are well positioned through the groundwork we have laid, and plan to continue with our growth strategy while evaluating new opportunities.”\nConference Call\nProfire Energy President and CEO Brenton Hatch and CFO Ryan Oviatt will host the presentation, followed by a question and answer period.
