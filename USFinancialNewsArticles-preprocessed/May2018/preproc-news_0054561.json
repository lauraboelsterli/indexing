With Bill, John Folsom and Dave Dietzler retiring next year, our Board has been highly engaged in succession planning to ensure a seamless transition. Recently we have added new members with great credentials and fresh perspectives. I am excited to work with our dedicated and talented Board and leadership team in the continued pursuit of our long-term strategic vision.\"\nMr. Eerkes has served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Sun Pacific Energy, Inc., a Tri-Cities based retail and wholesale petroleum company with locations throughout Washington since 1981.
