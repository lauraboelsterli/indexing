    "text": "May 19, 2018 / 6:18 PM / Updated 43 minutes ago Soccer: Chelsea edge Man United in Cup final with Hazard penalty Martyn Herman 1 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Eden Hazard’s first-half penalty proved decisive as Chelsea salvaged their season by beating Manchester United 1-0 in the FA Cup final in what is widely-expected to be manager Antonio Conte’s swansong on Saturday. Soccer Football - FA Cup Final - Chelsea vs Manchester United - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - May 19, 2018 Chelsea's Eden Hazard in action with Manchester United's Chris Smalling Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge\nThe Belgian’s searing pace earned the spot-kick in the 21st minute after forcing Phil Jones into a desperate lunging tackle and he coolly tucked it away for what proved to be the winner.\nJose Mourinho’s United were dismal in a scrappy first half and although they improved significantly after the break they were denied a record-equalling 13th FA Cup triumph and ended the season without a trophy.\nChelsea, whose Premier League title defence fizzled out into a fifth-placed finish, survived several scares but they defended superbly as Conte celebrated his first domestic cup honour as a manager having seen his side beaten by Arsenal a year ago.\nIt was only Mourinho’s third defeat in 15 Cup finals as a manager.
