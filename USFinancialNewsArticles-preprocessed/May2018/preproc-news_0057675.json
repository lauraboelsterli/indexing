The firm has more than USD 15 billion in assets under management and advisement.\nThe firm was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland.

The firm established a clean energy infrastructure platform in 2010 for direct investments in real assets within the renewable energy sector. In 2017, a private credit business was launched that leverages the firm's extensive general partner relationship network to originate and invest in private credit transactions for middle-market companies owned by private equity sponsors. In 2018, the company expanded its energy infrastructure business to include energy infrastructure credit.\nThe investment management teams' Managing Directors and Directors average over 20 years of investing experience.
