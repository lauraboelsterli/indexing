    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Integrated Medical Health Solutions (IMCS) has named Lori Daugherty as its Chief Executive Officer. Effective May 14, Daugherty leads the Florida-based organization that provides solutions to injured workers with delayed recoveries in all 50 states.\nA pioneering executive in pharmacy benefits and complex claims management, Daugherty brings decades of infrastructure development, financial management and marketing/sales experience to one of the fastest growing behavioral health services companies in the country. She has served in senior leadership positions for a number of prominent industry organizations; including One Call Comprehensive Care, Working/Rx, Inc., Pharmerica, Inc., Care Service, LLC, and Tampa, Florida-based PMSI, where she successfully addressed the unique challenges of preparing early-stage health care ventures to achieve their inherent potential.\n“Lori’s arrival is a turning point for our company,” said Michael Coupland, RPsych, AB, IMCS’ founder and Network Medical Director. “It puts a company with proven outcomes and enormous potential in the hands of an experienced industry veteran who has successfully managed that process before. She will be a tremendous force in our company’s next chapter.”\nIMCS provides specialized, short-term therapy in conjunction with usual medical care to help injured workers with chronic pain, trauma-related conditions, and withdrawal from opioids. Its network of 750 psychologists and psychiatrists works with more than 150 corporate employers, insurance companies and third-party administrators nationwide,\n“Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to successfully help long-term injured workers return to function and work. We believe it should and can be made available to a far broader patient population through the integration of the payer’s case finding predictive technologies with IMCS assessment and treatment methodologies,” Daugherty said. “I am excited to be working with an organization that provides these proven, cutting-edge solutions.”\nAbout IMCS\nIMCS provides cognitive behavioral therapy to injured workers through its COPE with Pain, COPE with Trauma and COPE with Opioid Dependence programs in all 50 states.
