    "text": "BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Thousands of Argentines on Friday protested the government’s bid to secure a credit line from the International Monetary Fund, which they blame for hardship during a past financial crisis.\nDemonstrators march towards the obelisk during a protest against the government's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over economic measures taken by Argentine President Mauricio Macri's government in Buenos Aires, Argentina, May 25, 2018. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian Opposition parties, unions, human rights organizations and artists took part in the march near the capital Buenos Aires’ emblematic obelisk, under the banner “the country is in danger.”\nThe protest is the latest of several organized since President Mauricio Macri announced on May 8 that he had started financing negotiations with the IMF after weeks of market volatility.\nThe unexpected move surprised investors and stoked Argentines’ fears of a repeat of the nation’s devastating 2001-2002 economic collapse.\nMany Argentines blame IMF-imposed austerity measures for worsening the crisis, which impoverished millions and turned Argentina into a global pariah after the government defaulted on a record $100 billion in debt.\nSlideshow (7 Images) Reporting By Nicolas Misculin, Writing By Mitra Taj; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ",
