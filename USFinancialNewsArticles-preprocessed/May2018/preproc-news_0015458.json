    "text": "28 COMMENTS New cracks broke through a residential area of Hawaii’s Big Island, spewing more lava and spreading toxic gases in the air as officials raised warnings about an unpredictable situation and ordered residents who have ignored a mandatory evacuation to leave.\nAuthorities said Saturday there could still be more tremors and volcanic activity.\n“The situation is very fast-moving,” said Janet Snyder, a spokeswoman for the county of Hawaii Mayor’s Office. “Our first-responders have not been able to get in because its so dangerous.”\nHawaii’s Kilauea volcano first erupted Thursday, sending fountains of lava toward the sky, damaging at least two buildings, and scattering residents from their homes. Hundreds of quakes had shaken the island for days when a magnitude-6.9 earthquake hit on Friday , Hawaii’s largest in more than four decades.\nBy Saturday morning, two new fissures had opened up in the Leilani Estates subdivision in the island’s east—the area hit by lava flows and fire—bringing the total of massive fissures in the ground there to eight, according to government spokespeople.\nThere is no official estimate yet of how many people evacuated and how many stayed. Ms. Snyder said the number of people in Red Cross-run shelters likely wasn’t an accurate reflection because many who fled the lava flows were staying with friends or family, or sleeping in cars.\nAbout 1,500 residents lived in the two rural areas ordered for evacuation—Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens—communities at the eastern base of the volcano. At least 164 people were in three shelters as of Saturday morning, Ms. Snyder said.\nHawaii Gov. David Ige, who visited two evacuation shelters on Friday, called it a “frightening and unpredictable time” in a statement and said, “I met many people who are frightened and deeply concerned about losing everything they’ve worked for all their lives. I’ve heard from people who have already lost their home.”\nThe Hawaii Emergency Management Agency said the fissures in Leilani Estates have resulted in “dangerously high concentrations” of sulfur dioxide, and warned people in the area of the threat to their health. Asthma patients, infants, seniors, and expectant mothers are particularly vulnerable, the agency said.\nA 2,000-foot-long fissure erupts Saturday in the Leilani Estates on Hawaii’s Big Island.

Video from the neighborhood shared on social media showed smoke and lava bubbling through a giant crack on a paved road.\nGary Hoffeld, a resident who lives in a subdivision about 8 miles downwind of Leilani Estates, said parts of that neighborhood were safe from slow-moving lava flows and many make calculated choices to stay home and monitor the situation because they feel they are safe for now.\n“The lava doesn’t chase you down the road like in the movies,” said Mr. Hoffeld. “It moves slow. You can see where the real threat is.”\nMr. Hoffeld said a friend who lives in Leilani Estates had remained in her home despite the evacuation order because she felt she wasn’t in any danger. The smell of sulfur has drifted far, though, piercing Mr. Hoffeld’s own neighborhood miles away after “nonstop earthquakes” for two days.\nThe largest tremor on Friday shook up his home, and with officials warning of more to come, Mr. Hoffeld and his family are following alerts by phone and television, he said. He has picked up knocked-over picture frames and vases around his house, wrapped them in blankets and left them on the floor. “We’re not putting them back up yet,” he said. “Better safe than sorry.”\nWrite to Nour Malas at nour.malas@wsj.com",
