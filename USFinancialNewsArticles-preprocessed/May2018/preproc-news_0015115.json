    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s government is taking its time to make sure it comes to the right decision on a future customs arrangement with the European Union and is working on its two proposals, business minister Greg Clark said on Sunday.\nBritain's Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark arrives for a Brexit subcommittee meeting at Downing Street in London, Britain, May 2, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, Clark said: “As part of the work over the next few weeks I think it would be a mistake to move from one situation and to another and to a third.”\n“If we can make progress ... as to what the right arrangement is in the long-term, it might be possible to bring that in over that period of time (of a two-year transition period).”\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ",
