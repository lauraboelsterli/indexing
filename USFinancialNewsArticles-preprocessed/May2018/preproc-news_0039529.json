    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PolarityTE, Inc. (Nasdaq:COOL) today announced the appointment of Rich Haerle as Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Mr. Haerle will lead the Company’s investor relations and corporate engagement with the investor community based in New York City. Mr. Haerle will also work with Executive Management to develop and execute the Company’s business strategy and corporate messaging. Mr. Haerle has nearly 15 years of financial industry experience, most recently as Director of Healthcare Specialty Sales at Deutsche Bank. Previously, he was Executive Director of Healthcare Specialty Sales at Morgan Stanley. Mr. Haerle began his career at Pfizer and graduated from UCLA with multiple degrees, including a Bachelor of Science in Biology, Master of Public Health, and a Master of Business Administration.\n“We are excited to name Rich to this new role as we start to build our relationships with the Institutional investment community. We believe this is a pivotal time to educate the investment community on the developments and early success of PolarityTE. Rich’s industry knowledge, strong relationships in the financial community, and presence in New York City will give PolarityTE the exposure it needs as the Company continues to roll out our platform technology,” said Denver M. Lough, MD, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PolarityTE.\nRich Haerle said, “I am excited to join PolarityTE, a company committed to enhancing patient quality of life through innovation. Regenerative medicine is evolving, and I’m pleased to be part of a company that I believe can pave the way for the future. I look forward to engaging with the investment community and utilizing my financial background and healthcare industry experience to further broaden PolarityTE’s shareholder base and execute on this exciting, and potentially life-transforming technology.”\nAbout PolarityTE™\nPolarityTE is a commercial-stage biotechnology and regenerative biomaterials company focused on transforming the lives of patients by discovering, designing and developing a range of regenerative tissue products and biomaterials for the fields of medicine, biomedical engineering and material sciences. The PolarityTE platform technology begins with a small piece of the patient’s own, or autologous, healthy tissue, rather than artificially manipulated individual cells. From this small piece of healthy autologous tissue, the company creates an easily deployable, dynamic and self-propagating product designed to enhance and stimulate the patient’s own cells to regenerate the target tissues. Rather than manufacturing with synthetic and foreign materials within artificially engineered environments, PolarityTE manufactures with the patient’s own tissue and uses the patient’s own body to support the regenerative process to create the same tissue from which it was derived. PolarityTE’s innovative method is intended to promote and accelerate growth of the patient’s tissues to undergo a form of effective regenerative healing.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
