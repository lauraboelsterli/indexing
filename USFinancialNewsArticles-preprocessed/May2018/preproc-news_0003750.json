    "text": "Reaffirms Commitment to its All-Cash Proposal to Combine with SJW Group\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- California Water Service Group (NYSE:CWT) today announced it has filed preliminary proxy materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to urge stockholders of SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) to vote against the proposed merger of SJW and Connecticut Water (NYSE:CTWS).\n“We strongly believe our $68.25 per share all-cash proposal delivers superior value to SJW stockholders and is in the best interest of both companies’ stockholders,” said Martin A. Kropelnicki, President and CEO of California Water. “In our view, SJW’s stock merger with Connecticut Water forces SJW stockholders to forego substantial and immediate value for the promise of long-term accretion that may never materialize, due to the significant risk of operating a larger company with two separate systems that are 3,000 miles apart in different regulatory environments.”\nMr. Kropelnicki continued, “We believe the SJW Board would better serve its stockholders by immediately meeting with us to discuss our proposal, instead of continuing its emerging pattern of communication and governance practices that hurt their stockholders, employees, customers, and local communities. We stand ready to address directly with the SJW Board any legitimate issue it may have with our all-cash proposal.”\nAbsent engagement by the SJW Board, California Water will ensure that SJW stockholders have all of the facts and resources necessary to determine the best path forward for SJW. California Water is communicating closely with employees, customers, and local communities to outline the significant benefits the Company believes this common sense combination with California Water would provide. For more information on the many benefits of California Water’s proposal, please visit http://www.SJWValue.com .\nIn its preliminary proxy materials, California Water highlighted the benefits of its proposal for SJW stockholders, including the following:\nSJW stockholders would receive in our view superior and immediate economic value with California Water’s all-cash proposal, which exceeds SJW’s all-time high closing share price, represents a 30% premium to SJW’s closing stock price at the time of California Water’s April 4, 2018 proposal, and represents a 20% premium to SJW’s closing stock price on April 25, 2018, the day before the California Water proposal was announced. In our view, California Water offers a clear path to completing the transaction in a timely manner. California Water’s proposal is not subject to any financing contingency and the Company is confident it can move quickly to conduct due diligence, reach a definitive agreement, and obtain regulatory approvals.\nCalifornia Water strongly believes that the SJW all-stock merger with Connecticut Water is clearly inferior for SJW stockholders. For example, in California Water’s opinion:\nIf the Connecticut Water merger is completed, SJW stockholders would be forced to wait for uncertain benefits that, by SJW’s own admission, would not fully accrue until the long term, while bearing the substantial execution risks associated with operating two separate systems located 3,000 miles apart in different regulatory environments. In contrast, California Water’s proposed transaction offers substantial and certain value to SJW stockholders. SJW would be led by a Board and CEO who are largely unfamiliar with the San Jose community and the unique challenges of running a California-based water utility. Six out of 12 directors for the new SJW/Connecticut Water Board would come from Connecticut Water – five are current Connecticut Water directors and the sixth is SJW’s brand new Chairman and CEO, Eric Thornburg, who ran Connecticut Water for more than 11 years, until late last year. The completion of the Connecticut Water transaction is uncertain given Eversource Energy’s pending bid for Connecticut Water and the need for a 2/3 vote of Connecticut Water shareholders. The SJW/Connecticut Water transaction faces regulatory approval in the same number of jurisdictions as the California Water proposal. SJW has cited regulatory approval as a reason for rejecting the California Water proposal; however, it then acknowledges the Connecticut Water transaction also requires regulatory approval in two different states – Connecticut and Maine. Regulators in these states have no existing relationships with SJW and may well have concerns approving a transaction in which the acquiring company is located in California 3,000 miles away.\nIn its preliminary proxy materials, California Water urges SJW stockholders to vote against the Connecticut Water merger by:\nVoting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of SJW common stock to Connecticut Water shareholders pursuant to the merger; Voting “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the SJW certificate of incorporation amendment; and Voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve any motion to adjourn the SJW special meeting.\nCalifornia Water remains fully committed to its proposed combination with SJW, with the goal of working collaboratively with SJW to reach an agreement.\nMorgan Stanley is serving as financial advisor to California Water and Gibson Dunn is serving as its legal advisor.\nAbout California Water Service Group\nCalifornia Water Service Group is the parent company of California Water Service, Washington Water Service, New Mexico Water Service, Hawaii Water Service, CWS Utility Services, and HWS Utility Services.
