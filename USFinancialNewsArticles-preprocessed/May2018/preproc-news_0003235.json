REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo\n“Oerlikon has the first evidence from some financial institutions resulting in additional alignment requirements to secure current and future financial transactions,” Chief Executive Roland Fischer told Reuters on Wednesday.\n“We are closely monitoring the situation and are in continuous dialogue with our commercial banks,” he added.\nOerlikon itself is not directly affected by the sanctions on Vekselberg, one of the oligarchs targeted by the United States as punishment for alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\nOerlikon, where Vekselberg has a 43 percent stake, said customers were still placing orders.
