    "text": "LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Italian government bond yields jumped to a seven-week high on Thursday on an increased possibility that a government of anti-establishment parties comes into power in the euro zone’s third largest economy.\nItaly’s anti-system 5-Star Movement and the far-right League are looking to end nine weeks of political deadlock following inconclusive elections and form a government.\nA crucial obstacle was removed late on Wednesday when former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the League’s main ally, gave his green light to the talks, accepting a demand from 5-Star that his Forza Italia party take no part in the next government.\nBenchmark 10-year Italian yields jumped 6 basis points to 1.94 percent in early trading and the spread between Italian debt and its German counterpart stretched to its widest levels in six weeks at 138 basis points.
