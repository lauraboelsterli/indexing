The tariff reduction is seen especially helping premium brands such as Germany’s BMW , electric car maker Tesla Inc and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz close a price gap on local rivals.\nBy Trefor Moss\nChina will reduce its tariff on imported autos to 15% from 25% starting July 1, the Chinese government said Tuesday.\nChina’s import tariff on auto parts will also be cut to 6%, down from between 8% and 25%, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council said. The moves would “promote the transformation and upgrading of the auto industry, and meet the demands of consumers,” the commission said.\nThe announcement comes during high-level trade negotiations between the U.S. and China that aim to avert a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.\nThe auto sector has been an important focus of the talks. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer reported in his Section 301 investigation in March that China doesn’t provide a level playing field for foreign auto makers.\nIn an apparent attempt to defuse trade tensions, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in April to cut tariffs on autos and to ease foreign-investment restrictions in the sector.\nForeign auto makers primarily sell locally produced vehicles in China, but for some—especially makers of premium cars BMW, +1.85% TSLA, +2.77% —imports are a lucrative niche. China imported 1.2 million cars last year, according to the China Automobile Dealers Association, accounting for roughly 4% of vehicles sold. ",
