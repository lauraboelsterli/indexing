Net cash provided by operating activities was $463 million in the first quarter of 2017, which included cash distributions from StoneRiver of $31 million.\n\"Our first quarter performance is consistent with our expectations for the full year,\" said Jeffery Yabuki, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fiserv. \"Results in the quarter were punctuated by a 23 percent increase in adjusted earnings per share and double-digit sales growth.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Non-GAAP Results and Additional Information\nAdjusted revenue increased 4 percent to $1.37 billion in the quarter compared to the prior year period. Internal revenue growth for the company was 3 percent, with 5 percent growth in the Payments segment and 1 percent growth in the Financial segment, for the quarter.

For more information, visit Fiserv.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this earnings release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with GAAP, such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share from continuing operations, earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, with \"adjusted revenue,\" \"internal revenue growth,\" \"adjusted operating income,\" \"adjusted operating margin,\" \"adjusted net income,\" \"adjusted earnings per share,\" \"adjusted earnings per share, as adjusted for the Lending Transaction,\" and \"free cash flow.\" Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses should enhance shareholders' ability to evaluate the company's performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from GAAP revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share from continuing operations, earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities to calculate these non-GAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this earnings release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the non-cash and other items described below that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. See page 11 for additional information regarding the company's forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.\nExamples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, severance costs, merger and integration costs, certain costs associated with the achievement of the company's operational effectiveness objectives, gains or losses from dispositions and unconsolidated affiliates, and certain discrete tax benefits. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to its operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the company's various businesses.\nInternal revenue growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and are described on page 10. Management believes internal revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of postage reimbursements in the company's Output Solutions business, and including deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. Management believes free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders' ability to evaluate and understand the company's core business performance.\nThese non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share from continuing operations, earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding anticipated internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share growth.

These adjustments are subject to variability and are anticipated to lower 2018 GAAP revenue growth by approximately 2.5 percentage points as compared to the internal revenue growth rate, primarily due to the Lending Transaction.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share - The company's adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2018 excludes certain non-cash or other items which should enhance shareholders' ability to evaluate the company's performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Non-cash or other items may be significant and include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, severance costs, merger and integration costs, certain costs associated with the achievement of the company's operational effectiveness objectives, gains or losses from dispositions and unconsolidated affiliates, and certain discrete tax benefits. The company estimates that the amortization expense with respect to acquired intangible assets as of March 31, 2018 will be approximately $160 million in 2018. Other adjustments to earnings per share that have been incurred to date are presented on page 6. Estimates of these other adjustments on a forward-looking basis are not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of these items.\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share growth outlook for 2018 reflects 2017 performance as adjusted for the Lending Transaction.
