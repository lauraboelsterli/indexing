FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion v Liverpool - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - April 21, 2018 Liverpool's Joe Gomez in action Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers\nThe 20-year-old, who made his England debut last year, will also not be fit for the World Cup in June.\nGomez injured his ankle while on international duty with England in March, and his recent Premier League games against West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City aggravated the problem.\nHe was not part of Liverpool’s squad for their Champions League semi-final second leg against AS Roma last week and also missed their weekend league defeat at Chelsea.\n“Liverpool can confirm Joe Gomez has undergone an operation on an ankle injury,” the club said in a statement.\nGomez should be ready for the start of Liverpool’s pre-season training schedule in July, it added.\nGomez has played regularly under England manager Gareth Southgate since making his international debut against Germany last November.\nHis absence will be a blow for his country, given Southgate’s preferred tactic of employing a three-man central defence.\n“Gutted to confirm that my season for both club and country is over having undergone successful ankle surgery,” Gomez wrote on his Instagram account.\n“Been a tough few weeks trying everything possible to be available on the pitch to help the team.\n“I’m going to do all I can to get back and be in the best possible shape for pre season. The focus now is to support the team in the two biggest games of the season!”\nThird-placed Liverpool host Brighton and Hove Albion in their last match of the Premier League season on Sunday. They then play Real Madrid in the Champions League final on May 26. Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Keith Weir",
