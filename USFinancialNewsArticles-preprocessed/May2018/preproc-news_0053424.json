    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will assess the new Italian government, now being formed by Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte, on the basis of its actions rather than words, spokesman Margaritis Schinas said on Thursday.\nNewly appointed Italy Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte arrives to speak with media after the consultation with the Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy, May 23, 2018. REUTERS/Remo Casilli “We assess governments based on their actions, not on their words,” Schinas told a regular daily news briefing.\nEuro zone governments and financial markets have been alarmed at the impending arrival of a new coalition in Rome under Conte comprising two eurosceptic, anti-establishment parties, who won votes in a March election by calling for an easing of euro zone budget discipline and public debt rules.\nReporting by Jan Strupczewski\n ",
