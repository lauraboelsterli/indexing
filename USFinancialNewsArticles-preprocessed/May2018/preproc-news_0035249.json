    "text": "Product and Service Revenue Grew 7.4%\nAdjusted EBITDA Loss Narrowed\nContinuing Cost Reduction\nEnters into $4.4 Million Secured Convertible Notes\nExtends Maturity of Existing Debt to December 31, 2019\nNEW YORK, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XpresSpa Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:XSPA), a health and wellness holding company, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Following the sale of Group Mobile on March 22, 2018, the Company determined that it only had one operating segment, and first quarter 2018 and 2017 results are presented accordingly.\nEd Jankowski, XpresSpa Group CEO, said, “In the first quarter of 2018, XpresSpa’s revenue increased 7.4% from first quarter last year as new stores contributed to our top-line growth, even as we absorbed the effects of 69 days of weather related incidents, including 17 airport closures, as well as a strong first quarter 2017 comparison. During the quarter, as part of our evolution to a pure play health and wellness services company, we further streamlined our operations to reduce costs and redundancies, which helped narrow our Adjusted EBITDA loss from last year.”\n“As the leading on-the-go spa provider, XpresSpa enjoys a phenomenal growth opportunity as airports seek to capture travelers’ waiting time and the increasing portion of their discretionary spending that is being devoted to health and wellness. In addition to spas opened in first quarter, we have opened new locations in Houston’s Terminal A and a smaller store in LaGuardia’s Terminal B. We have refined our capex schedule to concentrate on high-priority new company-owned spa openings this year, including Atlanta (two locations), Austin (two locations), and third locations in Las Vegas and Philadelphia. We are also evaluating certain of these locations as potential opportunities for our franchising model, for which we have seen a high level of interest, and are in conversations with airports and franchisees for additional locations. Recently, we won an RFP for SFO Terminal 2 and are currently competing in 17 RFPs for locations in existing as well as future airport spaces. Last, we continue to work with leading health and wellness brands to develop strategic partnerships to offer additional services and products at XpresSpa that should support gross margin expansion.”\n“Our immediate focus is on corporate expense reduction and store-level performance improvement to strengthen our foundation and accelerate 2018 growth. On the cost line, we eliminated over $7 million of overhead expenses and construction costs in 2017 compared to 2016, and expect to further reduce our expenses as we right size our corporate structure. We also expect to generate further efficiencies from our new point-of-sale system’s ability to provide greater depth of view and real-time information, which greatly enhances many aspects of our operational control. On the top line, we are working to drive same store sales through: training to support add-on sales of our enhanced, higher-margin retail product; increasing our focus on our loyalty program to incentivize repeat client visits; and refining our staffing through our new scheduling tool to increase revenue generation as well as optimize labor cost. Our objective is to deliver improved profitability throughout the year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Consolidated Results Highlights\nTotal revenue from continuing operations increased 13.7% to $12.6 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $11.1 million in first quarter 2017. Product and service revenue increased 7.4% to $11.8 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $11.0 million in first quarter 2017\n- Same store sales decreased 1.6% as XpresSpa’s comparisons reflected strong growth in first quarter 2017 and as 69 days in first quarter 2018 were impacted by inclement weather, including 17 instances where airports in which XpresSpa operates were closed\n- Opened 3 new locations and closed 2 stores during first quarter 2018. New store openings included XpresSpa’s first off-airport location in the Westfield World Trade Center, a second location at Raleigh-Durham International Airport which replaced an existing location, and a second location at Pittsburgh International Airport. Product and service gross profit was $2.1 million, or 17.7% margin, in first quarter 2018 compared to $2.1 million, or 19.6% margin, in first quarter 2017\n- Cost of sales increased year over year primarily due to the cost of labor and occupancy associated with new store openings.\n- Gross margin compression resulted from higher than normal labor costs, partially associated with new store openings, weather-related store closings, and from the temporary decline in product sales associated with an adjustment period as sourcing was fully transitioned to XpresSpa’s strategic partner; this was normalized by the end of the quarter. General and administrative expenses decreased 8.0% due primarily to the Company’s streamlining of processes at the corporate level, as well as a reduction in stock-based compensation of $0.2 million from $0.5 million as of March 31, 2017 to $0.3 million as of March 31, 2018. Other operating revenue increased to $0.8 million in first quarter 2018 from $0.1 million in first quarter 2017 as the Company sold certain patents in January 2018 for net proceeds of $0.3 million and shares of common stock in Marathon Patent Group, Inc. that were valued at $0.5 million. Other operating revenues are generally nonrecurring and carry minimal operating expense. Net operating loss increased to $23.1 million from $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2017\n- Included in first quarter 2018 net loss is a $19.6 million goodwill impairment charge. The impairment to goodwill was a result of the structural changes to the Company, including completion of transition from a holding company to a pure play health and wellness company and change in CEO.\n- Excluding this charge, the net loss of $3.5 million for first quarter 2018 decreased $1.1 million from first quarter 2017 due to incremental revenue attributable to new store openings and continued reductions in general and administrative costs. EBITDA* loss of $1.5 million for first quarter 2018 improved $0.3 million from $1.8 million in first quarter 2017 through reduced store-level product and general and administrative expenses. Comprehensive loss, after discontinued operations, was $23.9 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $6.4 million in first quarter 2017.\n*EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are a non-GAAP financial measures; see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. See tables below for abbreviated financial XpresSpa segment results for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017.\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flows\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had:\nCurrent assets of $6.3 million Cash of $3.6 million Assets held for disposal of $0.7 million Long-term debt of $6.5 million with a related party.\nSubsequent Event\nOn May 15, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) with certain institutional investors (the “Investors”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell up to (i) an aggregate principal amount of approximately $4.4 million in 5% Secured Convertible Notes (the “Convertible Notes”), which includes approximately $0.1 million to be issues to Palladium Capital as Placement Agent in the offering, convertible into shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”) at a conversion price of $0.62 per share, (ii) Class A Warrants (the “Class A Warrants”) to purchase approximately 7.2 million shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.62 per share and (iii) Class B Warrants (the “Class B Warrants,” and together with the Class A Warrants, the “Warrants”) to purchase approximately 3.6 million shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.62 per share. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum. The Convertible Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and are secured by certain of its personal property. Unless earlier converted or redeemed, the Convertible Notes will mature in November 2019. The Company intends to use the proceeds of this financing primarily for working capital and new store openings. The Company expects to close the transaction as soon as possible following the filing of the first quarter 2018 results.\nOn May 14, 2018, we extended maturity of the debt from May 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.\n“XpresSpa is close to generating sufficient cash to fund operations through the combination of operating the spas and our cost reduction initiatives particularly as we approach the seasonally stronger second and third quarters of the year,” said Mr. Jankowski. “While we consider our operating and growth needs to be fully funded through the end of 2019, as we move forward, we will continue to review our capital structure and our options to increase our financial flexibility, including the refinancing of our existing debt, and the reduction of our cost of capital.”\nAbout XpresSpa Group, Inc.\nXpresSpa Group, Inc.
