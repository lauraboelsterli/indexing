Benoit Coeure, board member of the European Central Bank (ECB), is photographed during an interview with Reuters journalists at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, May 17, 2017. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nWhen asked if the ECB could forgive Italian debt held by the ECB, Coeure said this would not be legal, adding that it is too early to comment on an incoming governmentâ€™s still not fully-defined plans.\nItalian bonds have come under pressure in recent days after its incoming government proposed major spending increases, setting up a potential clash with Brussels over fiscal rules.
