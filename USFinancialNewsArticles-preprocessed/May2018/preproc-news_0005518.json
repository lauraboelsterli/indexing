You’ll have gridlock, you’ll have subpoenas, you’ll have just the system shutting down…I don’t think we’re going to lose control, but I think that’s what would happen.”\nJONATHAN SOKOLOFF, MANAGING PARTNER OF $25 BILLION LEONARD GREEN & PARTNERS, DEFENDING THE ROLE OF PRIVATE EQUITY:\nPrivate equity was a “very, very important part of the economy” and offered a “better model” for companies versus public markets.\n“We believe our form of governance and running our businesses is superior.”\nReporting By Lawrence Delevingne, Anna Irrera and Liana Baker; editing by Diane Craft\n ",
