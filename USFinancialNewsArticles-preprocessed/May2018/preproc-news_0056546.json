    "text": "Zug, Switzerland , May 25, 2018 - WISeKey International Holding Ltd (SIX: WIHN) (OTCQX: WIKYY), a leading Swiss cybersecurity and IoT company, whose Class B Shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, announced today that it has completed the full acquisition of the remaining 15% of QuoVadis Holdings Ltd (\" QuoVadis \"), a leading cybersecurity company with strong focus in next generation Public Key Infrastructure (\" PKI \"), Certification Authority (\" CA \") and electronic signature services (\" eID \"), with operating activities in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Bermuda.\nIn April 2017, WISeKey paid (for the acquisition of 85%-stake in QuoVadis) ABRY and One Communications Ltd. (formerly known as KeyTech) USD13,000,000 cash plus 1,110,000 newly issued Class B Shares of WISeKey issued from existing authorized share capital, and paid off the indebtedness of QuoVadis in the amount of USD2,000,000.\nFollowing its acquisition of 85% of the Company in April 2017, WISeKey concluded the negotiations with QuoVadis management to acquire the remaining 15% stake of QuoVadis in May 2018, based on QuoVadis' performance in financial year 2017 of USD 20 million revenue for the Digital certification and Managed PKI business.

IoT PKI is defined as the provision of a complete X.509 digital certificate and cryptographic key and life-cycle capabilities, including public/private key generation, distribution, management, and revocation which when combined with WISeKey Semiconductors product offerings provide a full Chip to Certificate IOT Solution.\nIn addition to technology and clients, QuoVadis brings to WISeKey its strength serving enterprise customers, with more than 300 large cap and 3,000 overall customers worldwide, including Europe, the United States and Australia.
