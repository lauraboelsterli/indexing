    "text": "LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Anglo American is likely to sell up to 30 percent of the multi-billion dollar Peruvian copper project Quellaveco to Japanese entities, including Mitsubishi, which already own part of it, three sources familiar with the matter said.\nThe London-listed miner said in its 2017 financial results it is seeking to cut its 82 percent interest in Quellaveco, which could produce 225,000 tonnes of copper annually, to between 50 and 70 percent.\nThe sources said it has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to help with the sale, which could be announced within the next two months.\nGoldman Sachs did not respond to a request for comment and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\nJapanese trading house Mitsubishi owns 18.1 percent of Quellaveco, but is looking to increase the stake to just above 30 percent, one of the sources said.\nMitsubishi was not immediately available to comment.\nOther Japanese trading houses including Sumitomo, Mitsui, JX Nippon Mining & Metals and Itochu are considering making final offers for a minority stake, the sources said.\nSumitomo, Mitsui, JX Nippon and Itochu were not immediately available to comment.\nAnglo American declined to comment on details of the sale or the value of the project, which has been estimated by analysts at between $5 billion and $6 billion.\nAt an investor conference in Miami this week, however, Chief Executive Mark Cutifani said Anglo expected to hold 70 percent or “a little bit less” as it sought partners to offset the risks.\n“We, like everyone else have learnt some lessons, hence our desire to syndicate this project,” he said.\nMining executives say there is widespread interest in new copper assets following a lack of investment in exploration because of the 2015-16 commodity price crash and as the expansion of electricity grids and the take up of electric vehicles spurs demand.\nBenchmark copper prices on the London Metal Exchange have rebounded to nearly $7,000 a tonne from lows of around $4,300 a tonne hit in early 2016, which was their weakest for seven years.
