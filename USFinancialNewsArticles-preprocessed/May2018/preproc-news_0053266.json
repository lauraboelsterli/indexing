    "text": "MADRID, May 23 (Reuters) - The Spanish government secured parliamentary backing on Wednesday for its 2018 budget after the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) lent its support, avoiding delays some had feared as a consequence of the political stand-off in Catalonia.\nThe ruling centre-right People’s Party needed backing from the PNV to get the much-delayed budget through parliament because it does not have a parliamentary majority.\n“The PNV has adopted this decision (...) putting the interests of the citizens of Euskadi (the Basque region) over those of the Basque Nationalist Party,” it said in a statement.\nReporting Sonya Dowsett and Jesús Aguado; editing Catherine Evans\n ",
