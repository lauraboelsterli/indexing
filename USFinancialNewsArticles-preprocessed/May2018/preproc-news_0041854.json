    "text": "EditorsNote: adds makeup date\nThe series finale between the visiting Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves was postponed Thursday because of inclement weather. The game will be made up Aug. 30 at 7:35 p.m. ET.\nThe Braves and Cubs had split the first two games of the series in Atlanta. The teams had played on Monday in Chicago to make up a game originally scheduled for April 15.\nEarlier Thursday, the Braves placed rookie Mike Soroka on the 10-day disabled list retroactive to May 14 due to a right shoulder strain. Left-hander Max Fried was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett and will take Soroka’s next start.\nThe Cubs also made a move, recalling left-handed reliever Randy Rosario from Triple-A Iowa and optioning infielder David Bote to the same club.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
