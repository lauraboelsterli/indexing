    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 1:06 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago Tesla settles class action lawsuit over 'dangerous' Autopilot system Tina Bellon 2 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla ( TSLA.O ) on Thursday reached an agreement to settle a class action lawsuit with buyers of its Model S and Model X cars who alleged that the company’s assisted-driving Autopilot system was “essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous.” FILE PHOTO: A Tesla dealership is seen in West Drayton, just outside London, Britain, February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\nNo further details of the agreement, announced in a filing in San Jose federal court late Thursday, were available. The deal still has to be approved by U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman.\nTesla and Steve Berman, a lawyer for the car owners, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe case was closely watched in the automotive and legal communities, as it was the only known court challenge Tesla faced with regard to its assisted-driving technology.\nThe company has come under increased scrutiny over its Autopilot system in recent months after two Tesla drivers died in crashes in which Autopilot was engaged. The most recent crash, in March, is being investigated by safety regulators. Reporting by Tina Bellon; Editing by Bernadette Baum",
