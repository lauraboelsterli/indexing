REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo\n“We have serious concerns about the announced settlement and we intend to file our objections with the Court shortly,” Fujifilm said in a statement on Wednesday.\n“We believe the combination of Xerox and Fuji Xerox is the best option to provide exceptional value to shareholders of both companies.”\nFujifilm also said in its statement that it would appeal an April 27 U.S. court ruling temporarily blocking the Xerox deal.
