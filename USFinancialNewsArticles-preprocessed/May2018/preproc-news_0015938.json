    "text": "TYSONS, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DXC Technology (NYSE: DXC) today announced that its Board of Directors has set a record date of May 25, 2018 for the previously announced spin-off of its U.S. public sector business into a new, publicly traded company named Perspecta Inc.\nSubject to satisfaction of applicable conditions, the distribution of shares of common stock of Perspecta is expected to occur on May 31, 2018, after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In the distribution, DXC stockholders will receive one share of Perspecta common stock for every two shares of DXC common stock held on May 25, 2018, the record date for the distribution.\nFollowing its separation from DXC, Perspecta is expected to complete its previously announced combination with Vencore and KeyPoint Government Solutions on May 31, 2018 immediately following the spin-off, subject to satisfaction of the conditions to the merger.\nNYSE Trading Details\nPerspecta will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol “PRSP.”\nBeginning on or about May 24, 2018 and continuing up to and through the distribution date, it is expected that there will be two markets in DXC common stock. Shares that trade in the “regular-way” market will be entitled to receive the shares of Perspecta common stock while shares that trade in the “ex-distribution” market will trade without the entitlements to shares of Perspecta common stock. Shares of DXC in the “ex-distribution” market will trade under the ticker symbol “DXC WI.”\nDXC anticipates that “when-issued” trading in Perspecta shares will also begin on or about May 24, 2018, and will continue up to and through the distribution date. Shares of Perspecta in the “when-issued” market will trade under the symbol “PRSP WI.” Subject to satisfaction of relevant conditions, “regular-way” trading in Perspecta’s common stock is expected to begin on June 1, 2018, the first trading day following completion of the separation.\nDXC stockholders who hold common stock on the record date and decide to sell any of their common stock before May 31, 2018 should consult with their stockbroker, bank or other nominee to understand whether the shares of DXC common stock will be sold with or without the entitlements to Perspecta common stock.\nPerspecta Investor Day\nPerspecta will host its 2018 Investor Day on Monday, May 14, 2018 in New York City, with presentations beginning at approximately 9:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).\nA webcast of the Investor Day and any presentation slides will be available on DXC’s Investor Relations website. The webcast will begin on Monday, May 14, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. EDT at http://www.dxc.technology/investorrelations .\nOther Information\nNo action or payment is required by DXC stockholders to receive the shares of Perspecta common stock. An Information Statement containing details regarding the distribution of the Perspecta common stock, including the method for settling fractional shares, and Perspecta’s business and management following the separation and the merger with Vencore and KeyPoint Government Solutions will be mailed to DXC stockholders prior to the distribution date. The Information Statement is also attached to Perspecta’s Registration Statement on Form 10 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2018 (the Form 10).\nThe distribution of Perspecta shares and the merger with Vencore and KeyPoint Government Solutions remain subject to certain conditions described in the Information Statement filed with Perspecta’s Form 10.\nAbout DXC Technology\nDXC Technology (NYSE: DXC) is the world's leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, serving nearly 6,000 private and public-sector clients from a diverse array of industries across 70 countries.
