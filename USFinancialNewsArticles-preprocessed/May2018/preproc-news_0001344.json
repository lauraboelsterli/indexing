    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EZCORP, Inc. (NASDAQ: EZPW), a leading provider of pawn loans in the United States and Latin America, today announced strong results for its second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAll amounts in this release are from EZCORP continuing operations and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") unless otherwise noted. Comparisons shown in this release are to the same period in the prior year unless otherwise noted.\nHIGHLIGHTS FOR SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to EZCORP increased 47% to $12.3 million, and basic earnings per share increased 53% to $0.23 - Ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year (YOY) earnings growth in both measures. U.S. Pawn extends its significant earnings and cash flow contribution with industry leading returns - Industry-high Pawn Loans Outstanding (PLO) of $243,000 per store combined with market leading pawn loan yield to drive 28% higher Pawn Service Charges (PSC) per store compared to the primary competitor. Improved store metrics include a 3% increase in sales gross profit and excellent margins up 100bps to an industry leading 38%. With its scale and operating leverage, the segment generates significant cash flow as well as 80% of the company’s pawn profit before tax, even as it continues recovery from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Latin America Pawn accelerates company's earnings growth - Latin America Pawn segment contribution increased 119% to $7.1 million on a 98% increase in PLO YOY to $35.3 million. This includes a robust contribution from the 133 stores acquired in Q1, along with outstanding organic growth. Latin America Pawn comprises 43% of our total consolidated pawn stores. Consolidated PLO increased 11% - Total consolidated PLO grew 11%, including acquired stores. Latin America Pawn same store PLO expanded 10%, or 9% on a constant currency basis 1 . This represents the segment's 16 th consecutive quarter of same store PLO growth YOY on a constant currency basis. While U.S. Pawn same store PLO was flat, it was up 2% 2 in stores unaffected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Liquidity continues to strengthen - Cash and cash equivalents increased 33% YOY and 41% in the current quarter, to $159.9 million.\nCEO COMMENTARY AND OUTLOOK\nChief Executive Officer Stuart Grimshaw said, “We had an excellent second quarter, delivering 47% higher net income year-over-year, and continued strengthening of the balance sheet. These results extended the positive momentum we saw in Q1, with three key drivers: we maintained our intense focus on meeting the needs of customers and enhancing their experience; we continued to experience solid growth in U.S. Pawn, which produces the majority of our earnings and cash flow; and we further expanded our revenue base in the high-growth Latin America market.\n“The biggest growth contributor was our outstanding results in Latin America,” Mr. Grimshaw explained. “The segment's PLO increased 98% year-over-year to $35 million, and profit before tax more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter. We have added 141 stores through acquisition and store openings so far this year, including four de novo openings in the second quarter. That represents a 57% increase in our Latin America store count since the beginning of the fiscal year to 387 stores, and provides a strategic beachhead for further expansion in existing and adjacent geographical areas. These new stores are adding to the outstanding earnings performance of our existing pawn stores, and we see plenty of opportunities to open and acquire more stores to accentuate the outsized growth.\n“In the U.S., we are focused on business execution and pawn fundamentals as this larger, more mature market is our largest earnings and cash flow generator,” Mr. Grimshaw added. “As a result, of that focus, the segment produced market leading returns, and for the 10 th consecutive quarter, we outperformed the U.S. market in same store PLO growth, with a 100 basis point improvement in gross margins to 38%. Included in the quarter’s results was the hurricanes’ impact on PLO and resulting pawn service charges, resulting in 1% higher net revenue and 5% lower segment contribution. Excluding the hurricane impact and other discrete items 2 , U.S. Pawn performance reflected continued growth, with estimated net revenue and segment contribution up 4% and 5%, respectively.\n“We are very optimistic about the growth potential of the company, given the hard work undertaken to reestablish strong operational fundamentals in the U.S., coupled with outstanding compound growth achieved in Latin America driven by terrific execution at the local level on organic and inorganic opportunities.”\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nNet income increased 47% to $12.3 million. The growth and expansion in Latin America drove the improvement in earnings, with a robust base of earnings provided by U.S. Pawn. Consolidated PLO, the most influential driver of revenue and profitability, increased 11%. Higher PLO led to an 11% increase in PSC, driving a 10% improvement in net revenues to $120.6 million (up 9% to $119.4 million on a constant currency basis). Sales gross profit increased 7% to $42.7 million on a 4% rise in merchandise sales and a 100bps improvement in consolidated sales margins to 37%. On a constant currency basis, PSC improved 10% and merchandise sales increased 3%. Business expansion in Latin America caused consolidated operations expenses to rise 10% to $82.2 million (up 9% to $81.3 million on a constant currency basis). As a percentage of net revenues, operations expenses were consistent at 68% in the second quarter and improved 100bps to 68% year-to-date. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $159.9 million, up 33% YOY and 41% in the quarter. Year-to-date, the company has collected $12.3 million in principal and interest, as scheduled, on the notes receivable related to the sale of Grupo Finmart in September 2016. Basic earnings per share increased 53% to $0.23 and diluted earnings per share rose 40% to $0.21. The calculation of fully diluted shares includes the hypothetical conversion of our convertible notes to the extent our average share price in the quarter exceeds their conversion price. However, the 2019 convertible notes must be settled in cash and the company may choose to satisfy all or some of its 2024 convertible notes with cash rather than shares to minimize actual share dilution.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nU.S. Pawn\nSegment contribution was down 5% to $28.2 million in the second quarter and down 1% to $56.0 million year-to-date. Included in the quarter is the PSC impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and technology change related costs. Adjusting for those discrete items, we estimate that our U.S. Pawn segment contribution would have been up 5% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date. The segment delivered market leading returns from the loan portfolio with industry highest PLO, PLO yield and PSC per store, driven by disciplined lending practices and a focus on meeting the customers’ need for cash. Same store PLO in the U.S. was flat to the prior year including stores affected by the hurricanes. In unaffected stores, same store PLO increased 2%. This was the second full quarter that operations were affected by the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on PLO, PSC and sales. Net revenues were up 1%. A 1% decrease in PSC was offset by a 3% increase in sales gross profit with margin improving 100bps to 38%. Industry leading sales per store and sales margins combined to drive sales gross profit per store 16% higher than the competition. After adjustment for the estimated impact of hurricanes and other discrete items 2 , net revenues increased 4%.\nLatin America Pawn\nThis segment again delivered outstanding growth. Segment contribution increased 119% to $7.1 million (up 109% to $6.7 million on a constant currency basis). Year-to-date contribution increased 116% to $16.1 million (up 107% to $15.4 million on a constant currency basis). Pawn store count has expanded 57% from the beginning of FY18, with 133 pawn stores acquired in the first quarter, and four stores opened during each of the first and second quarters. PLO rose 98% to $35.3 million (up 96% to $34.9 million on a constant currency basis). Same store PLO increased 10% (up 9% on a constant currency basis). Net revenues expanded 78% to $22.2 million (up 69% to $21.1 million on a constant currency basis), and PSC increased 105% to $15.3 million (up 96% to $14.6 million on a constant currency basis). Merchandise sales improved 37% in total and 9% on a same store basis (up 28% in total and 8% in same stores on a constant currency basis). Merchandise sales margin of 32% remained stable. Latin America operations expenses improved to 67% of net revenues from 71% in the prior-year quarter.\nCONFERENCE CALL & WEBCAST INFORMATION\nEZCORP will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 7:30am Central Time to discuss first quarter results.

We use constant currency results to evaluate our Latin America Pawn operations, which are denominated primarily in Mexican pesos and other Latin American currencies. As GPMX was not acquired until fiscal 2018, such results included on a constant currency basis reflect the actual exchange rates in effect during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 without adjustment. We believe that presentation of constant currency results is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our Latin America Pawn operations and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe that presentation of results on an adjusted basis is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of our GAAP consolidated financial statements. We use this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate and compare operating results across accounting periods. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nConstant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations items denominated in Mexican pesos to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We used the end-of-period rate for balance sheet items and the average closing daily exchange rate on a monthly basis during the appropriate period for statement of operations items. The end-of-period Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 was 18.3 to 1 and 18.7 to 1, respectively. The approximate average Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was 18.7 to 1 and 20.4 to 1, respectively. The approximate average Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was 18.8 to 1 and 20.1 to 1, respectively.\nOur statement of operations constant currency results reflect the monthly exchange rate fluctuations and so are not directly calculable from the above rates. Constant currency results, where presented, also exclude the foreign currency gain or loss. We have experienced a prolonged weakening of the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar and may continue to experience further weakening in future reporting periods, which may adversely impact our future operating results when stated on a GAAP basis.\nThe following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as of and for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018.\nMiscellaneous Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThree Months Ended March 31, Change 2018 2017 (in thousands) U.S. Pawn GAAP net revenue $ 97.1 $ 95.9 1 % Estimated PSC impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma 2.0 — Estimated discrete technology change related costs 0.7 — U.S. Pawn adjusted net revenue $ 99.8 $ 95.9 4 % U.S. Pawn GAAP segment contribution $ 28.2 $ 29.7 (5 )% Estimated PSC impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma 2.0 — Change in expense estimate from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma (0.2 ) — Loss on assets from store closures 0.1 — Estimated discrete technology change related costs 0.7 — Accelerated depreciation from retirement of certain assets 0.5 — U.S. Pawn adjusted segment contribution $ 31.3 $ 29.7 5 % Six Months Ended March 31, Change 2018 2017 (in thousands) U.S. Pawn GAAP segment contribution $ 56.0 $ 56.8 (1 )% Estimated PSC impact from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma 5.2 — Loss on assets from store closures 0.1 — Estimated discrete technology change related costs 0.7 — Accelerated depreciation from retirement of certain assets 0.5 — U.S. Pawn adjusted segment contribution $ 62.5 $ 56.8 10 % U.S. Dollar\nAmount\nPercentage\nChange YOY\n(in millions) Latin America Pawn same store PLO $ 19.7 10 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (0.3 ) Constant currency Latin America Pawn same store PLO $ 19.4 9 % Consolidated net revenue (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 120.6 10 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (1.2 ) Constant currency consolidated net revenue (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 119.4 9 % Consolidated PSC revenue (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 74.4 11 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (0.7 ) Constant currency consolidated PSC revenue (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 73.7 10 % Consolidated merchandise sales (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 114.9 4 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (1.3 ) Constant currency consolidated merchandise sales (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 113.6 3 % Consolidated operations expenses (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 82.2 10 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (0.9 ) Constant currency consolidated operations expenses (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 81.3 9 % Latin America Pawn PLO $ 35.3 98 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (0.4 ) Constant currency Latin America Pawn PLO $ 34.9 96 % Latin America Pawn PSC revenue (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 15.3 105 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (0.7 ) Constant currency Latin America Pawn PSC revenue (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 14.6 96 % Latin America Pawn merchandise sales (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 20.2 37 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (1.4 ) Constant currency Latin America Pawn merchandise sales (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 18.8 28 % Latin America Pawn same store merchandise sales (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 16.0 9 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (0.2 ) Constant currency Latin America Pawn same store merchandise sales (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 15.8 8 % Latin America Pawn segment profit before tax (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 7.1 119 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (0.4 ) Constant currency Latin America Pawn segment profit before tax (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 6.7 109 % Latin America Pawn segment profit before tax (six months ended March 31, 2018) $ 16.1 116 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (0.7 ) Constant currency Latin America Pawn segment profit before tax (six months ended March 31, 2018) $ 15.4 107 % Latin America Pawn net revenue (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 22.2 78 % Currency exchange rate fluctuations (1.1 ) Constant currency Latin America Pawn net revenue (three months ended March 31, 2018) $ 21.1 69 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006786/en/\nEZCORP, Inc.\nJeff Christensen, 512-437-3545\nVice President, Investor Relations\njeff_christensen@ezcorp.com\nSource: EZCORP, Inc.",
