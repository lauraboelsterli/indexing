French President Emmanuel Macron walks past Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and German Chancellor Angela Merkel before an informal dinner ahead of a summit with leaders of the six Western Balkans countries in Sofia, Bulgaria, May 16, 2018.

Slideshow (6 Images) TIMING IN DOUBT\nTwo ex-Yugoslav republics, Slovenia and Croatia, have already joined the EU. But lawlessness and crime flourished in the Balkans during the wars of the 1990s, leaving the region awash with weapons and a transit route for drug and human traffickers.\n“The direction of travel is very clear - the European perspective,” a senior EU official said. “What really matters is the determination of applicants in implementing reforms. And patience because also on the EU side you need to have the right window of opportunity to take the decision.”\nThe EU and Balkan six will sign a declaration on improving infrastructure including electricity and gas connections, as well as countering radicalism, improving security and controlling migration.\nBrussels also sees building good neighbourly relations as vital to a region where wartime hostilities still burden relations and threaten the fragile peace.\nTo join the EU, Serbia - the biggest market among the six - must settle its borders with Kosovo and with Bosnia, where tensions between rival communities often paralyse decision-making.\nMacedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev warned that a clear perspective was needed to prevent the region from sliding back into conflict.\n“We saw that the status quo brings an erosion of democracy, a lack of economic opportunity,” he told a meeting in Sofia. “Negative influence from third parties is increasing.” Editing by Gabriela Baczynska and David Stamp",
