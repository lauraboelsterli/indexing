    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Synacor, Inc. (“Synacor” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: SYNC) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of New York, and docketed under 18-cv-02979, is on behalf of a class consisting of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Synacor securities between May 4, 2016 and March 15, 2018, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.\nIf you are a shareholder who purchased Synacor securities between May 4, 2016, and March 15, 2018, both dates inclusive, you have until June 4, 2018, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com . To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 9980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased.\n[Click here to join this class action]\nSynacor operates as a technology development, multiplatform services, and revenue partner for video, Internet, and communications providers, as well as device manufacturers, governments, and enterprises.\nOn May 4, 2016, Synacor announced that it had secured a three-year contract to host web and mobile services for AT&T Inc. (“AT&T” and the “AT&T Contract”, respectively).\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Synacor was unlikely to receive significant revenues from the AT&T Contract until 2018; (ii) as such, the Company’s revenue forecasts issued during the Class Period were materially false and misleading; and (iii) as a result of the foregoing, Synacor shares traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period, and class members suffered significant losses and damages.\nOn August 9, 2017, post-market, Synacor issued a press release entitled “Synacor Exceeds Second-Quarter 2017 Financial Guidance; Remains on Path to ‘3/30/300,’” announcing its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. The press release stated in relevant part: “[T]he joint AT&T-Synacor team has made the strategic decision to prioritize portal engagement right now over monetization. We are seeing the results of this focus in deeper engagement metrics. We are already generating revenue from this new consumer experience, but we expect that additional monetization tactics will be turned on at a more deliberate pace, which will result in a longer ramp to full monetization. As a result, a significant portion of the revenue that we were expecting in Q3 and Q4 this year is delayed to 2018, and we are adjusting our financial guidance for 2017 accordingly. We believe that this engagement-focused strategy ultimately leads to a stronger, more sustainable business,” concluded Bhise.\nOn this news, Synacor’s share price fell $1.15, or 32.39%, to close at $2.40 on August 10, 2017.\nOn March 15, 2018, post-market, Synacor held a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss the Company’s fourth-quarter earnings. During the call, Defendant Bhise discussed the shortcomings of the AT&T contract.\nOn this news, Synacor’s share price fell $0.30, or 14.63%, to close at $1.75 on March 16, 2018.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members.
