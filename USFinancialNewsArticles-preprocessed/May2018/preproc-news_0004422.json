    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 3:55 PM / Updated 44 minutes ago Penn. regulators allow ETP Mariner East 1 liquids pipe to restart Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) said on Thursday that all five commissioners voted to allow Energy Transfer Partners LP to restart its Sunoco Mariner East 1 natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline.\nThe PUC suspended operations on the Mariner East 1 pipeline on March 7 after sinkholes were discovered near the project.\nAfter testing the integrity of the pipeline, ETP filed with the PUC on April 27 to restart the pipe. The PUC’s Bureau of Investigations and Enforcement, which recommended the pipe be shut in March, concurred with ETP’s April 27 request.\nETP had said on Monday that it hoped to restart Mariner East 1 this week.\nThe shutdown forced shippers, including U.S. gas producers Range Resources Corp and Antero Resources Corp, to find another route for their liquids and is likely causing more ethane to be injected into the region’s natural gas pipelines, according to analysts.
