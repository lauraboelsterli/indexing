On Friday, the euro was down 0.1 percent at 1.1601 francs.\nBroader currencies remained in a range with investors digesting news this week including minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting which were perceived to be dovish, and mixed European data with the dollar index holding below a December 2017 high of 94.19 hit this week.\n“The euro continues to be under pressure especially against the franc as Italian/German spreads are widening but markets are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach for now,” said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London.\nThe single currency was down a fifth of a percent against the dollar at around $1.17. For the week it is down 0.6 percent and on track for six consecutive weeks of losses.\nData this week showed the German PMI fell to a 20-month low in May indicating that momentum in Europe’s biggest economy was faltering. Minutes of the European Central Bank’s April meeting showed policymakers were worried about a more pronounced slowdown in the euro zone and political uncertainty in Italy. and\nSWEDISH SURPRISE The crown has been one of the currencies most heavily sold in recent months by speculators betting that monetary authorities in Sweden would significantly lag behind their peers in Europe in removing policy support.\nThe currency therefore jumped on the news from the Swedish National Debt Office (SNDO).\n“The fact that the SNDO is taking a position for a stronger SEK vs EUR is a very good sign for crown bulls,” Richard Falkhenhall, a Stockholm-based senior FX strategist at SEB said on Twitter.\nThe crown rallied 1 percent to 10.16 per euro and by a similar margin against the dollar at 8.6750.\nThe yen and the safe-haven Swiss franc are set to notch up big weekly gains in response to heightened worries over global politics. However, traders were quick to lock in gains before long weekends in the United States and Britain.\nThe dollar had been rising for weeks on its widening yield advantage but lost some of its momentum after the Fed minutes on Wednesday were seen as more dovish than markets had expected.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Keith Weir/David Stamp\n ",
