Postpaid gross additions grew 38% over the prior year to 23.5 thousand.\nStrong subscriber gains in Bolivia: 54.7 thousand prepaid net additions in the first quarter, representing significant growth. Continued LTE adoption in Bolivia: LTE customer base increased 56% over the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.4 million in the first quarter: Over 50% growth when compared to Q1 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by investment in customer acquisition , and timing of advertising production costs in New Zealand, coupled with a decline in prepaid revenues in Bolivia.\nBELLEVUE, Wash., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trilogy International Partners Inc. (“TIP Inc.”) (TSX:TRL), an international wireless and fixed broadband telecommunications operator, today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Both our operating markets are off to a solid start in 2018,” said Brad Horwitz, President and CEO. “We continue to make progress on our objectives to shift our subscriber mix to higher value postpaid subscribers, as well as leverage the significant investments we’ve made in our LTE networks over the last two years by driving data consumption across our consolidated customer base.”\n“Our consolidated postpaid net additions increased 18% compared to a year ago, and 78% sequentially. In New Zealand, our postpaid base is 6% larger than a year ago and we have improved churn sequentially. In Bolivia, our subscriber activations were robust for the second quarter in a row as we leveraged our enhanced LTE footprint, which is 45% larger than a year ago. We grew our Bolivian postpaid and prepaid subscriber base by over 55 thousand this quarter, compared to a net loss of over seven thousand a year ago.”\n“Our strong growth came with a corresponding increase in activation costs in both markets. As a result, EBITDA was reduced year-on-year. We expect the benefits from expanding our subscriber base to increase our revenue and EBITDA in the quarters ahead.”\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nThree Months Ended March 31 (US dollars in millions unless otherwise noted, unaudited) 2018 2017 % Chg Total revenues 202.1 190.7 6% Service revenues 148.3 151.7 (2%) Net loss (1) (7.3 ) (11.3) 35% Adjusted EBITDA (2) 32.2 40.1 (20%) Adjusted EBITDA margin (2) 21.7 % 26.5% (18%) Notes: (1) There was no gain or loss from discontinued operations in the periods presented.

(3) Includes deactivations of 48 thousand prepaid wireless subscribers relating to the 2G network shutdown. On an adjusted basis, prepaid net additions would have been 6 thousand and blended wireless churn would have been 2.65%. Revenues\nOur total revenues in New Zealand increased $17.4 million, or 14% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was driven primarily by promotional activity which drove higher handset sales volumes and a mix shift to higher priced new handset models. Service revenues increased by $2.5 million, or 3%, primarily as a result of the following:\nPostpaid revenues increased by $1.5 million, or 4%, attributable to a 6% increase in the postpaid subscriber base due to more competitive consumer plans and promotional offers, partially offset by the impact of a decline in postpaid ARPU due primarily to increased value offered for price; Prepaid revenues decreased by $1.6 million, or 6%, primarily as a result of enhanced value in service offerings in response to competitive changes; and Wireline service revenues increased by $1.8 million, or 13%, due primarily to 18% growth in the wireline customer base, partially offset a 5% reduction of wireline ARPU.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur Adjusted EBITDA in New Zealand decreased 18% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily resulting from an increase in operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA changes were primarily the result of the following:\nSales and marketing increased $4.1 million, or 28%, primarily due to $2.6 million of higher advertising and promotion costs, of which $1.8 million related to production costs associated with a new brand campaign. Additionally, there was $1.4 million of increased commissions driven by subscriber acquisition growth; Cost of service increased by $1.4 million, or 5%, primarily due to higher broadband transmission expenses associated with the growth of the broadband business, partially offset by a decrease in national roaming expenses and third party site maintenance costs; and General and administrative expense increased $1.1 million, or 6%, driven by an increase in bad debt expense of $1.1 million. Additionally, computer hardware and software maintenance costs associated with the implementation of the business support system in 2017 increased by $0.5 million and customer care costs increased by $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by the timing of audit and consulting fees.\nFirst quarter results in New Zealand, when compared to the same period of the prior year, were also affected by a 3% strengthening of the New Zealand Dollar as compared to the U.S. Dollar.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe $2.8 million, or 27%, increase in our capital expenditures in 2018, compared to 2017, was the result of the timing of continued investment relating to network expansion and IT system projects. At March 31, 2018, 94% of our New Zealand network was overlaid with LTE and our network covered 97% of New Zealand’s population.\nBolivia\nFinancial Results\nThree Months Ended March 31 (US dollars in millions unless otherwise noted, unaudited) 2018 2017 % Chg Revenues Wireless service revenue 59.1 64.8 (9%) Non-subscriber ILD and other revenues 0.5 0.8 (32%) Service revenue 59.6 65.6 (9%) Equipment sales 0.8 0.9 (18%) Total revenues 60.4 66.5 (9%) Adjusted EBITDA 17.0 20.7 (18%) Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) 28.4 % 31.6% (10%) Capital expenditures (2) 4.2 2.5 67% Capital Intensity 7 % 4% 84% Subscriber Results Three Months Ended March 31 (Thousands unless otherwise noted) 2018 2017 % Chg Postpaid Gross additions 13.4 14.7 (8%) Net additions 0.9 0.5 88% Total postpaid subscribers 341.8 345.1 (1%) Prepaid Net additions (losses) 54.7 (8.3) n.m Total prepaid subscribers 1,853.4 1,800.6 3% Total Wireless Subscribers (3) 2,255.5 2,209.1 2% Monthly blended wireless ARPU ($, not rounded) 8.84 9.76 (9%) Monthly postpaid wireless ARPU ($, not rounded) 21.91 22.75 (4%) Monthly prepaid wireless ARPU ($, not rounded) 6.04 6.90 (12%) Blended wireless churn 7.0 % 5.7% 22% Postpaid Churn 1.9 % 1.8% 7% n.m - not meaningful Notes: (1) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service revenues. (2) Represents purchases of property and equipment excluding capital expenditures acquired through vendor-backed financing and capital lease arrangements. (3) Includes public telephony and other wireless subscribers of 60 thousand and 63 thousand as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues\nOur total revenues in Bolivia for the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased $6.1 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily the result of changes in the following:\nVoice revenues declined $3.6 million, or 11%, due to the continued shift from voice to data usage; and Data revenues declined $1.8 million, or 6%, primarily due to promotional activity which drove continued customer acquisition and resulted in reduced billable data. Although there was a year over year decline in data revenues, total mobile data consumption increased by 9% during the same period. This increase was driven by primarily by continued LTE adoption: 28.0 thousand LTE users added during the quarter, an increase of 56% compared to the same period in 2017. LTE subscribers represented 20% of the customer base at March 31, 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur Adjusted EBITDA in Bolivia decreased 18% in the first quarter compared to 2017, primarily due to a decrease of $6.1 million in total revenues, partially offset by $2.8 million of lower operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA changes were also impacted by the following:\nCost of Services decreased by $1.2 million, or 5%, primarily due to reduced interconnection costs as voice traffic has declined offset by an increase in data consumption; and Sales and Marketing decreased by $0.7 million, or 7%, due to a reduction in expenses related to changes to our customer loyalty program during the quarter, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in expenses related to customer acquisition efforts.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures increased $1.7 million, or 67%, in the first quarter compared to 2017, primarily due to the timing of the investment in LTE coverage and network expansion projects. At March 31, 2018, 72% of our network was overlaid with LTE, an increase of 45% of LTE sites from the prior year.\nReview of Consolidated Performance\nThree Months Ended March 31 (US dollars in millions unless otherwise noted, unaudited) 2018 2017 % Chg Consolidated adjusted EBITDA (1) 32.2 40.1 (20%) Consolidated adjusted EBITDA Margin (1) 21.7 % 26.5% (18%) (Deduct) add: Finance costs (2) (11.1 ) (19.0) (42%) Change in fair value of warrant liability 2.3 - n.m Depreciation, amortization and accretion (27.9 ) (27.2) 2% Income tax expense (1.8 ) (2.7) (33%) Other (3) (0.9 ) (2.5) (63%) Net loss (4) (7.3 ) (11.3) 35% n.m - not meaningful Notes: (1) These are Non-GAAP measures and do not have standardized meanings under GAAP.

Earnings per share\nThree Months Ended Period February 7, 2017 (US dollars in millions except per share data, unaudited) March 31, 2018 through March 31, 2017 (1) Net loss attributable to Trilogy International Partners Inc. ($4.5) ($5.9) Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding: Basic 52,270,844 42,501,813 Diluted 81,852,741 42,501,813 Loss Per Share: Basic ($0.09) ($0.14) Diluted ($0.09) ($0.14) (1) Represents partial period results due to the timing of the closing of the arrangement with Alignvest. Finance costs\nThree Months Ended March 31 (US dollars in millions, unaudited) 2018 2017 % Chg Interest on borrowings, net of capitalized interest New Zealand 2.7 2.6 3% Bolivia 0.3 0.2 56% Corporate 8.1 16.2 (50%) Total Interest on borrowings 11.1 19.0 (42%) Total finance costs 11.1 19.0 (42%) Interest expense\nInterest expense decreased $7.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the refinancing and repayment of the 13.375% Trilogy LLC senior secured notes due 2019 (the “Trilogy 2019 Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of $450 million. In May 2017, Trilogy LLC issued its 8.875% senior secured notes due 2022 in the aggregate principal amount of $350 million and used the proceeds thereof, together with cash on hand, to repay the Trilogy 2019 Notes. This refinancing and repayment had the effect of reducing annualized interest costs from approximately $60 million to approximately $31 million.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nAs of February 7, 2017, TIP Inc.’s issued and outstanding warrants were reclassified from equity to liability, as the warrants are written options that are not indexed to the TIP Inc. Common Shares. The warrant liability is marked-to-market each reporting period with the changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The change in fair value of the warrant liability due to changes in the trading price of warrants resulted in a non-cash gain of $2.3 million for the three months March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion\nThree Months Ended March 31 (US dollars in millions, unaudited) 2018 2017 % Chg New Zealand 16.5 15.6 6% Bolivia 11.3 11.6 (3%) Corporate 0.1 0.0 505% Total depreciation, amortization and accretion 27.9 27.2 2% Depreciation, amortization and accretion increased by $0.7 million, or 2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to the depreciation of the business support system placed into service in New Zealand in February 2017.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense decreased by $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to lower pre-tax earnings in Bolivia.\nManaging our Liquidity and Financial Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $55.2 million in cash and cash equivalents of which $3.2 million was held by 2degrees, $32.0 million was held by NuevaTel, and $20.1 million was held primarily at headquarters. The Company also had approximately $7.5 million in short-term investments at corporate headquarters and $1.4 million of available capacity under the line of credit facility in New Zealand as of March 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents increased $8.1 million since December 31, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, cash inflows were primarily provided by the maturities and sales of short-term investments.\nOperating, investing and financing activities\nThree Months Ended March 31 (US dollars in millions) 2018 2017 % Chg Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 7.0 4.6 51% Investing Activities (1.0 ) (12.0) 92% Financing Activities 2.1 173.1 (99%) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 8.1 165.7 (95%) Operating activities\nCash flow provided by operating activities increased by $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This change was mainly due to favorable changes in certain working capital accounts, including a decrease in cash used to settle accounts payable due to timing and decreased inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in cash received relating to the Equipment Installment Plan.\nInvesting activities\nCash flow used in investing activities decreased by $11.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments. These changes were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures in Bolivia and New Zealand as network expansion and LTE buildout were more significant during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancing activities\nCash flow provided by financing activities decreased by $171.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This decrease is primarily due to the proceeds from the equity issuance that occurred on February 7, 2017, partially offset by the repurchase of $18.2 million of the Trilogy 2019 Notes in 2017.\nNon-GAAP Measures and Other Financial Measures; Basis of Presentation\nIn managing our business and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP with several customer-focused performance metrics and non-GAAP financial measures which are utilized by our management to evaluate our performance. Although we believe these measures are widely used in the wireless industry, some may not be defined by us in precisely the same way as by other companies in the wireless industry, so there may not be reliable ways to compare us to other companies. Adjusted EBITDA represents Net loss (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) excluding amounts for: income tax expense; interest expense; depreciation, amortization and accretion; equity-based compensation (recorded as a component of General and administrative expense); (gain) loss on disposal and abandonment of assets; and all other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service Revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are common measures of operating performance in the telecommunications industry. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are helpful measures because they allow us to evaluate our performance by removing from our operating results items that do not relate to our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies unless the definition is the same.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA Margin\nThree Months Ended March 31 (US dollars in millions, unaudited) 2018 2017 % Chg Net loss (1) (7.3 ) (11.3) 35% Add: Interest expense 11.1 19.0 (42%) Depreciation, amortization and accretion 27.9 27.2 2% Change in fair value of warrant liability (2.3 ) - n.m Income tax expense 1.8 2.7 (33%) Other, net (1.6 ) 0.8 (304%) Equity-based compensation 1.7 0.5 206% (Gain) loss on disposal and abandonment of assets (0.1 ) 0.1 n.m Acquisition and other nonrecurring costs (2) 0.9 1.1 (13%) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (3) 32.2 40.1 (20%) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin 21.7 % 26.5% (18%) n.m - not meaningful Notes: (1) There was no gain or loss from discontinued operations in the periods presented. Thus, Loss from continuing operations presented in prior releases has been replaced with Net loss. (2) Includes costs related to the Company’s initial compliance and preparation expenses incurred in connection with the Arrangement and becoming a publically traded entity, as well as costs related to the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard of approximately $0.5 million in 2018 and other nonrecurring costs. (3) In July 2013, Trilogy LLC sold to Salamanca Holding Company, a Delaware limited liability company, 80% of its interest in its wholly owned subsidiary Salamanca Solutions International LLC (“SSI”). Although Trilogy LLC holds a 20% equity interest in SSI, due to the fact that NuevaTel is SSI’s primary customer, Trilogy LLC is considered SSI’s primary beneficiary, and as such, the Company consolidates 100% of SSI’s net losses. The impact on the Company's consolidated results of the 80% Trilogy LLC does not own was an increase to Adjusted EBITDA of $0.05 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other Information\nConsolidated financial results – quarterly summary\nTIP Inc.’s operating results may vary from quarter to quarter because of changes in general economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations, among other things, in each of TIP Inc.’s operations and business segments. Different products and subscribers have unique seasonal and behavioral features. Accordingly, one quarter’s results are not predictive of future performance.\nFluctuations in net income (loss) from quarter to quarter can result from events that are unique or that occur irregularly, such as losses or gains on the refinance of debt, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, impairment of assets, and changes in income taxes.\nThe following table shows selected quarterly financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(US dollars in millions unless otherwise noted, unaudited) 2018 2017 2016 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Service revenues 148.3 143.0 152.5 150.8 151.7 154.1 150.3 143.0 Equipment sales 53.8 58.9 38.8 42.1 39.0 58.8 41.2 40.2 Total revenues 202.1 201.9 191.3 192.9 190.7 213.0 191.5 183.2 Operating expenses (200.4 ) (198.8 ) (184.1 ) (182.3 ) (179.5 ) (197.4 ) (179.8 ) (175.1 ) Operating income 1.8 3.1 7.2 10.6 11.2 15.5 11.7 8.0 Interest expense (11.1 ) (11.1 ) (11.2 ) (18.5 ) (19.0 ) (18.3 ) (18.4 ) (17.0 ) Change in fair value of warrant liability 2.3 5.6 (0.0 ) 3.5 - - - - Debt modification and\nextinguishment costs - - - (6.7 ) - - - (3.8 ) Other, net 1.6 1.0 0.9 2.2 (0.8 ) 2.8 (2.0 ) 0.9 (Loss) income before income taxes (5.5 ) (1.3 ) (3.0 ) (8.9 ) (8.6 ) 0.1 (8.7 ) (11.9 ) Income tax expense (1.8 ) (1.0 ) (2.6 ) (1.8 ) (2.7 ) (0.1 ) (3.0 ) (2.5 ) Net loss (1) (7.3 ) (2.4 ) (5.6 ) (10.8 ) (11.3 ) (0.0 ) (11.8 ) (14.3 ) Net loss attributable to noncontrolling\ninterests and prior controlling interest 2.8 2.6 1.4 5.2 5.4 0.0 11.8 14.3 Net (loss) income attributable to TIP Inc.
