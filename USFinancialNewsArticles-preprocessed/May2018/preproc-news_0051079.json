    "text": "29 COMMENTS Philip Roth, whose raucous, playful, elegant and often outrageous novels about Jewish life and sex and death and betrayal made him one of the country’s greatest novelists, has died at age 85.\nThe Associated Press, citing Mr. Roth’s literary agent, confirmed he had died.\nMr. Roth was born in Newark, N.J. The aging industrial city featured in many of his works, dating back to his first published book, 1959’s “Goodbye, Columbus,” a novella and five short stories that won the National Book Award for fiction the following year.\nDuring his career Mr. Roth wrote more than 30 books, according to his publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He tackled the issue of racial identity in “The Human Stain” (2000), imagined what America might have been like if Charles Lindbergh had won the presidency in 1940 in “The Plot Against America” (2004), and examined American dreams in the late 1960s and early 1970s in “American Pastoral” (1997), for which he won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.\n“He was the writer of the second half of the 20th century in English,” said Ross Miller, who edited the definitive collection of Mr. Roth’s work for the Library of America. “He was unrivaled, particularly in the period between ‘The Counterlife,’ and ‘The Dying Animal.’ It’s one of the great literary streaks, where every book is first rate.”\nPhilip Roth, right, won a National Book Award in 1960 for fiction with ‘Goodbye Columbus.” Photo: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Although Mr. Roth wrote across a wide span of topics, he was inevitably drawn most closely to three: sex, death and betrayal.\nFor many, Mr. Roth would be inextricably linked to one of the great comic, sexually charged novels of recent memory, 1969’s “Portnoy’s Complaint,” in which the lead character appears almost overwhelmed with lust.\nSexual desire resonates through many of Mr. Roth’s works. These include 2001’s “The Dying Animal,” a short book in which the fictional literature professor David Kepesh—who is also featured in novels “The Breast” and “The Professor of Desire”—must make a devastating decision involving a former lover that puts into question his past moral choices.\nAlthough much of his work appeared autobiographical, Mr. Roth said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that his personal history represented only a starting point. “The person is a model who then develops into somebody,” he said. “You may be with a real person, but you have to come to inhabit that character yourself, and at that point, at least the way I do it, you leave the real person behind.”\nAs he aged, Mr. Roth became increasingly focused on shorter novels that were invariably dark and confrontational. These included four works that Mr. Roth considered to be part of a connected series: “Everyman” (2006), “Indignation” (2008), “The Humbling,” (2009) and “Nemesis” (2010).\n“You have to be able to compress and condense,” said Mr. Roth. “That’s the skill, to condense and pack a punch at the same time.”\nWrite to Jeffrey A.
