    "text": "Defending star Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry in the NBA Finals won’t be a one-man job for coach Tyronn Lue’s Cleveland Cavaliers.\nMay 22, 2018; Oakland, CA, USA; Houston Rockets forward PJ Tucker (4) and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30) battle for a rebound during the third quarter in game four of the Western conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Oracle Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports Lue said Wednesday while starting point guard George Hill is likely to be matched up with Curry the most, the Cavaliers coach will be ready to throw everything and the kitchen sink at the former two-time MVP when the NBA Finals open Thursday night in Oakland, Calif.\n“Multiple guys are gonna be thrown at Steph,” Lue told USA Today. “He’s a tough player. He’s gonna take a lot of shots. He’s gonna get shots. He’s gonna make some tough shots, so we understand that.”\nThe 30-year-old Curry played in only 51 games during the regular season due to injury and missed the Warriors’ first six postseason games, but has looked like his old self on the court ever since returning.\nCurry is averaging 24.8 points on 38.5-percent shooting from 3-point range, 6.1 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.8 steals over 11 playoff games, never scoring fewer than 18 points.\nThe five-time All-Star averaged 25 points during Golden State’s seven-game Western Conference finals victory against over Houston Rockets. In Game 7, Curry 27 points, 10 assists and nine boards in the Warriors’ 101-92 victory.\n“We want to be physical, stay on his body,” Lue added. “Just being alert and taking away those easy like — losing him in transition or we turn our head, he moves and he gets a three wide open or an offensive rebounds, he moves and we don’t lock into him. Those are the ones we want to take away. We just gotta make sure we take away the easy ones.”\nThe Cavaliers defeated the Boston Celtics in their own seven-game series to reach their fourth straight Finals.\nCleveland and Golden State are meeting for a record fourth straight Finals series.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
