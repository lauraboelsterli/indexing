(NYSE: NNN), a real estate investment trust, today announced its operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Highlights include:\nOperating Results:\nRevenues and net earnings, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO available to common stockholders and diluted per share amounts:\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nRevenues\n$\n152,836\n$\n141,432\nNet earnings available to common stockholders\n$\n94,698\n$\n51,622\nNet earnings per common share\n$\n0.62\n$\n0.35\nFFO available to common stockholders\n$\n102,769\n$\n78,267\nFFO per common share\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.53\nCore FFO available to common stockholders\n$\n103,030\n$\n88,122\nCore FFO per common share\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.60\nAFFO available to common stockholders\n$\n102,880\n$\n89,045\nAFFO per common share\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.60\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nFFO per common share increased 26.4% over prior year results Core FFO per common share increased 11.7% over prior year results AFFO per common share increased 11.7% over prior year results Portfolio occupancy was 99.2% at March 31, 2018 as compared to 99.1% on December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 Invested $177.0 million in property investments, including the acquisition of 52 properties with an aggregate 400,000 square feet of gross leasable area at an initial cash yield of 6.7% Sold 15 properties for $71.6 million producing $38.6 million of gains on sales No common shares were issued under the ATM equity program\nCore FFO guidance for 2018 was increased from a range of $2.60 to $2.64 to a range of $2.62 to $2.66 per share. The 2018 AFFO is estimated to be $2.66 to $2.70 per share. The Core FFO guidance equates to net earnings of $1.51 to $1.55 per share, plus $1.11 per share of expected real estate depreciation and amortization and excludes any gains from the sale of real estate and any charges for impairments and retirement severance costs. The guidance is based on current plans and assumptions and is subject to risks and uncertainties more fully described in this press release and the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nJay Whitehurst, Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"National Retail Properties' strong first quarter results highlight our ability to raise well-priced capital through dispositions, which is a meaningful strategic advantage when equity markets are choppy. Our proven capability to accretively recycle capital, combined with our highly occupied portfolio and our solid pipeline of new acquisitions, positions us to raise guidance for 2018 and continue our track record of consistent per share growth on a multi-year basis.\"\nNational Retail Properties invests primarily in high-quality retail properties subject generally to long-term, net leases. As of March 31, 2018, the company owned 2,800 properties in 48 states with a gross leasable area of approximately 29.1 million square feet and with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.4 years. For more information on the company, visit www.nnnreit.com .\nManagement will hold a conference call on May 1, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. ET to review these results. The call can be accessed on the National Retail Properties web site live at http://www.nnnreit.com . For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available on the company's web site. In addition, a summary of any earnings guidance given on the call will be posted to the company's web site.\nStatements in this press release that are not strictly historical are \"forward-looking\" statements. These statements generally are characterized by the use of terms such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"estimated,\" or other similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, which may cause the company's actual future results to differ materially from expected results. These risks include, among others, general economic conditions, local real estate conditions, changes in interest rates, increases in operating costs, the preferences and financial condition of the company's tenants, the availability of capital, and, risks related to the company's status as a REIT. Additional information concerning these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") filings, including, but not limited to, the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. Copies of each filing may be obtained from the company or the Commission. Such forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the company's current operating plans and estimates. Actual operating results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in this press release. National Retail Properties, Inc. undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date these statements were made.\nThe reported results are preliminary and not final and there can be no assurance that the results will not vary from the final information filed on Form 10-Q with the Commission for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of these reported results have been made.\nFunds From Operations, commonly referred to as FFO, is a relative non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") and is used by the company as follows: net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry, excluding gains (or including losses), any applicable taxes and noncontrolling interests on the disposition of certain assets, the company's share of these items from the company's unconsolidated partnerships and any impairment charges on a depreciable real estate asset.\nFFO is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of performance of real estate companies. FFO does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of the company's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. The company's computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is included in the financial information accompanying this release.\nCore Funds From Operations (\"Core FFO\") is a non-GAAP measure of operating performance that adjusts FFO to eliminate the impact of certain GAAP income and expense amounts that the company believes are infrequent and unusual in nature and/or not related to its core real estate operations. Exclusion of these items from similar FFO-type metrics is common within the REIT industry, and management believes that presentation of Core FFO provides investors with a potential metric to assist in their evaluation of the company's operating performance across multiple periods and in comparison to the operating performance of its peers because it removes the effect of unusual items that are not expected to impact the company's operating performance on an ongoing basis. Core FFO is used by management in evaluating the performance of the company's core business operations and is a factor in determining management compensation. Items included in calculating FFO that may be excluded in calculating Core FFO may include items like transaction related gains, income or expense, impairments on land or commercial mortgage residual interests, preferred stock redemption costs or other non-core amounts as they occur. The company's computation of Core FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating Core FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to Core FFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (\"AFFO\") is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net earnings, as an indication of the company's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the company's performance. The company's computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to AFFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release.\nNational Retail Properties, Inc.\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nIncome Statement Summary\nRevenues:\nRental and earned income\n$\n148,605\n$\n137,298\nReal estate expense reimbursement from tenants\n4,158\n3,860\nInterest and other income from real estate transactions\n73\n274\n152,836\n141,432\nOperating expenses:\nGeneral and administrative\n8,697\n8,919\nReal estate\n5,862\n5,663\nDepreciation and amortization\n44,498\n40,143\nImpairment losses – real estate and other charges, net of recoveries\n2,248\n1,206\nRetirement severance costs\n261\n—\n61,566\n55,931\nOther expenses (revenues):\nInterest and other income\n(25)\n(137)\nInterest expense\n26,602\n26,614\n26,577\n26,477\nEarnings before gain on disposition of real estate\n64,693\n59,024\nGain on disposition of real estate\n38,596\n14,624\nEarnings including noncontrolling interests\n103,289\n73,648\nLoss (earnings) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(9)\n9\nNet earnings attributable to NNN\n103,280\n73,657\nSeries D preferred stock dividends\n—\n(3,598)\nSeries E preferred stock dividends\n(4,097)\n(4,097)\nSeries F preferred stock dividends\n(4,485)\n(4,485)\nExcess of redemption value over carrying value of Series D\npreferred shares redeemed\n—\n(9,855)\nNet earnings available to common stockholders\n$\n94,698\n$\n51,622\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n153,041\n146,930\nDiluted\n153,393\n147,280\nNet earnings per share available to common stockholders:\nBasic\n$\n0.62\n$\n0.35\nDiluted\n$\n0.62\n$\n0.35\nNational Retail Properties, Inc.\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nFunds From Operations (FFO) Reconciliation:\nNet earnings available to common stockholders\n$\n94,698\n$\n51,622\nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n44,419\n40,063\nGain on disposition of real estate\n(38,596)\n(14,624)\nImpairment losses – depreciable real estate, net of recoveries\n2,248\n1,206\nTotal FFO adjustments\n8,071\n26,645\nFFO available to common stockholders\n$\n102,769\n$\n78,267\nFFO per common share:\nBasic\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.53\nDiluted\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.53\nCore Funds From Operations Reconciliation:\nNet earnings available to common stockholders\n$\n94,698\n$\n51,622\nTotal FFO adjustments\n8,071\n26,645\nFFO available to common stockholders\n102,769\n78,267\nExcess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred\nshare redemption\n—\n9,855\nRetirement severance costs\n261\n—\nTotal Core FFO adjustments\n261\n9,855\nCore FFO available to common stockholders\n$\n103,030\n$\n88,122\nCore FFO per common share:\nBasic\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.60\nDiluted\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.60\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) Reconciliation:\nNet earnings available to common stockholders\n$\n94,698\n$\n51,622\nTotal FFO adjustments\n8,071\n26,645\nTotal Core FFO adjustments\n261\n9,855\nCore FFO available to common stockholders\n103,030\n88,122\nStraight line accrued rent\n(998)\n(675)\nNet capital lease rent adjustment\n228\n231\nBelow-market rent amortization\n(697)\n(660)\nStock based compensation expense\n2,145\n2,581\nCapitalized interest expense\n(828)\n(554)\nTotal AFFO adjustments\n(150)\n923\nAFFO available to common stockholders\n$\n102,880\n$\n89,045\nAFFO per common share:\nBasic\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.61\nDiluted\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.60\nOther Information:\nPercentage rent\n$\n546\n$\n548\nAmortization of debt costs\n$\n888\n$\n859\nScheduled debt principal amortization (excluding maturities)\n$\n134\n$\n127\nNon-real estate depreciation expense\n$\n81\n$\n82\n2018 Earnings Guidance:\nCore FFO guidance for 2018 is $2.62 to $2.66 per share.
