    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 3:24 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago EU considering more sanctions on Venezuela, to call for new vote - draft statement Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBRUSSELS Union foreign ministers will warn Venezuela on Monday it faces more economic sanctions following President Nicolas Maduro’s re-election and will call for a fresh presidential vote, according to a draft statement seen by Reuters. Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro speaks during a special session of the National Constituent Assembly to take oath as re-elected President at the Palacio Federal Legislativo in Caracas, Venezuela May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Marco Bello\nEU diplomats briefed on discussions said the EU travel bans and asset freezes would not be decided on Monday at the regular meeting of ministers in Brussels, but that a decision to impose more penalties was expected in June.\n“The EU calls for the holding of fresh presidential elections in accordance with internationally recognised democratic standards,” foreign ministers will say in their statement that has been agreed by EU governments. “The EU will act swiftly ... with the aim of imposing additional targeted and reversible restrictive measures,” the statement said.
