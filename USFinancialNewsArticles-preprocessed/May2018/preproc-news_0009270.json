    "text": "TEL AVIV, May 1 (Reuters) - Israeli startup Namogoo said on Tuesday it raised $15 million in a funding round led by Hanaco Venture Capital, bringing total financing to $29 million.\nExisting investors GreatPoint Ventures, Blumberg Capital and Inimiti Capital also participated in the round.\nNamogoo said its technology eliminates unauthorized ads injected on consumer browsers, which divert customers to competitor websites and cost online businesses millions of dollars in stolen revenue each year.\nThe new funds will be used to boost adoption of its “customer hijacking prevention” technology and accelerate growth of its new product, digital insights, which analyses third-party services running on publisher sites, the company said.
