    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pegasystems Inc. (NASDAQ: PEGA), the software company empowering customer engagement at the world's leading enterprises, today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\n\"We're pleased to see our clients embracing our strategic shift to more recurring arrangements,\" said Alan Trefler, founder and CEO, Pegasystems. \"We have a unique offering for customer engagement and digital process automation that has tremendous potential. We continue to be very positive about how our software is being adopted and our long-term growth opportunities.\"\n\"We are excited to see our term and cloud ACV grow 22 percent, year over year, driving total ACV of nearly $500 million,\" said Ken Stillwell, CFO, Pegasystems. \"We have discussed the importance of ACV as our most relevant performance metric of the growth and predictability of the future cash flow of our business, especially under the new revenue standard.\"\nSelect financial and performance metrics (1)(2)\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nAs Adjusted\nPerpetual license (GAAP and Non-GAAP)\n$\n23,078\n$\n37,899\n$\n(14,821)\n(39%)\nTerm license (GAAP and Non-GAAP)\n$\n64,695\n$\n89,109\n$\n(24,414)\n(27%)\nSoftware license revenue (GAAP and Non-GAAP)\n$\n87,773\n$\n127,008\n$\n(39,235)\n(31%)\nTotal revenue (GAAP and Non-GAAP)\n$\n235,182\n$\n256,309\n$\n(21,127)\n(8%)\nNet income (GAAP)\n$\n12,200\n$\n52,963\n$\n(40,763)\n(77%)\nNet income (Non-GAAP)\n$\n20,252\n$\n54,070\n$\n(33,818)\n(63%)\nDiluted earnings per share (GAAP)\n$\n0.15\n$\n0.65\n$\n(0.50)\n(77%)\nDiluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP)\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.66\n$\n(0.42)\n(64%)\nCash provided by operating activities (GAAP and Non-GAAP)\n$\n55,655\n$\n32,444\n$\n23,211\n72%\n(1) A reconciliation of our Non-GAAP to GAAP measures is contained in the financial schedules at the end of this release. The Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard (\"ASC 606\") in the current quarter and has adjusted prior periods to conform.\n(2) The decrease in total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to;\nA large multi-year term renewal of approximately $35 million recognized in revenue in the first quarter of 2017 under ASC 606; and The growth of cloud ACV was more than double the rate of term ACV. Cloud arrangements are recognized in revenue over the contract duration, as compared to term arrangements, which are recognized in revenue when effective under ASC 606.\nAnnual contract value (ACV) (1)\n(1) ACV, as of a given date, is the sum of the following two components:\nThe sum of the annual value of each term and cloud contract in effect on such date, with the annual value of a term or cloud contract being equal to the total value of the contract divided by the total number of years of the contract. Maintenance revenue reported for the quarter ended on such date, multiplied by four.\nQuarterly conference call\nPegasystems will host a conference call and audio-only webcast associated with this announcement at 5:00 p.m. EDT today.\nA live audio webcast of the conference call, together with detailed financial information, can be accessed through the investor information page of the Company's website at www.pega.com/about/investors .\nDial-in information is as follows: (888) 394-8218 (domestic) or (323) 701-0225 (international).\nTo listen to the webcast , log onto www.pega.com/about/investors at least five minutes prior to the event's broadcast and click on the webcast icon in the investors section.

Pegasystems' management utilizes a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of the business, for making operating decisions, and for forecasting and planning for future periods. The Company's annual financial plan is prepared on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and both are approved by our board of directors. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these measures in managing the business, the Company uses non-GAAP measures and financial performance results in the evaluation process to establish management's compensation.\nThe non-GAAP measures exclude the effects of certain business combination accounting entries, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related and restructuring expenses, and certain other adjustments. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and its anticipated future results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nA reconciliation of the Company's GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial schedules at the end of this release.\nForward-looking statements\nCertain statements contained in this press release may be construed as \" \" as defined in the Private 1995.\nThese are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate, and management's beliefs and assumptions.

Important factors that could cause actual future activities and results to those expressed in such include, among others, variation in demand for our products and services and the difficulty in predicting factors affecting the timing of license revenue recognition; reliance on third party relationships; our beliefs and the timing of the completion of our analysis regarding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, including its impact on income tax expense and deferred tax assets; the inherent risks associated with international operations and the continued uncertainties in the global economy; our continued effort to market and sell both domestically and internationally; foreign currency exchange rates; the financial impact of any future acquisitions; the potential legal and financial liabilities and reputation damage due to cyber-attacks and security breaches; and management of our growth. These risks and other factors that could cause actual results to those expressed in such , are described more completely in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as other filings we make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").

Our non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures, and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to comparable GAAP measures, the reasons why management uses these measures, the usefulness of these measures, and the material limitations on the usefulness of these measures, see disclosure under \"Discussion of non-GAAP financial measures\" included earlier in this release and below.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:\nAmortization of intangible assets : We have excluded the amortization expense of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses and profitability measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and are expected to contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods. Stock-based compensation : We have excluded stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP operating expenses and profitability measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expense.\n(2) Stock-based compensation was as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nCost of revenues\n$\n3,701\n$\n3,622\nSelling and marketing\n4,658\n3,405\nResearch and development\n3,637\n3,312\nGeneral and administrative\n3,113\n2,169\n$\n15,109\n$\n12,508\nIncome tax benefit\n$\n(3,141)\n$\n(3,815)\n(3) The effective tax rates were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nAs Adjusted (4)\nEffective tax rate (GAAP)\n(53)%\n20%\nEffective tax rate (Non-GAAP)\n22%\n34%\nThe difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 primarily related to the impact of the following items on our GAAP effective tax rate:\nExcess tax benefits generated by our stock-based compensation plans; Tax credits for stock-based compensation awards to research and development employees; and Unfavorable foreign stock-based compensation adjustments.\n(4) We adopted the new revenue recognition standard (\"ASC 606\") in the current quarter and have adjusted prior periods to conform.\nPEGASYSTEMS INC.\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nAs Adjusted (1)\nAssets:\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n$\n254,837\n$\n223,748\nTotal receivables (billed and unbilled)\n498,715\n542,341\nGoodwill\n73,017\n72,952\nOther assets\n179,386\n172,526\nTotal assets\n$\n1,005,955\n$\n1,011,567\nLiabilities and stockholders' equity:\nAccrued expenses, including compensation and related expenses\n$\n92,371\n$\n111,548\nShort-term deferred revenue\n175,586\n166,297\nDeferred income tax liabilities\n39,932\n38,463\nOther liabilities\n35,943\n41,022\nStockholders' equity\n662,123\n654,237\n$\n1,005,955\n$\n1,011,567\n(1) We adopted the new revenue recognition standard (\"ASC 606\") in the current quarter and have adjusted prior periods to conform.\nPEGASYSTEMS INC.\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nAs Adjusted (1)\nOperating activities:\nNet income\n$\n12,200\n$\n52,963\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities:\nChange in operating assets and liabilities, net\n19,591\n(47,555)\nStock-based compensation expense\n15,109\n12,508\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets\n6,145\n6,088\nOther non-cash\n2,610\n8,440\nCash provided by operating activities\n55,655\n32,444\nCash used in investing activities\n(31,278)\n(3,727)\nCash used in financing activities\n(23,052)\n(15,994)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n2,186\n521\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n3,511\n13,244\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n162,279\n70,594\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period\n$\n165,790\n$\n83,838\n(1) We adopted the new revenue recognition standard (\"ASC 606\") in the current quarter and have adjusted prior periods to conform.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pegasystems-announces-financial-results-for-the-first-quarter-of-2018-300646647.html\nSOURCE Pegasystems Inc.",
