    "text": "LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - Russia’s En+ Group, which manages Oleg Deripaska’s aluminium and hydropower businesses, will present the U.S. Treasury with a plan to reduce his stake and change its directors - a plan contingent on the lifting of U.S. sanctions against the company, a source close to En+ said.\nThe company is still working to secure buyers for Deripaska’s stake to bring him below 50 percent, the source said.\nThe source said En+ would likely have to ask the U.S. authorities for an extension to the June 6 deadline for Deripaska to sell the stake and for the independent directors to be appointed, the source added.
