    "text": "MAYFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Materion Corporation (NYSE- MTRN) announced today that its Board of Directors declared a second quarter 2018 dividend of $0.105 per share of common stock, an increase of $0.005 per share, or approximately 5%. The dividend is payable on June 1, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 16, 2018.\nJugal Vijayvargiya, President and CEO, stated, “The dividend increase reflects our sixth consecutive annual increase and continuing confidence in the strength of our business, its prospects for long-term growth and our ability to generate cash sufficient to continue to grow the business organically as well as through acquisitions while returning cash to our shareholders.”\nOn an annualized basis, the amount of the dividend is $0.42 per share and equates to a yield of approximately 1% based on the Materion common stock price at the close of trading on May 1, 2018. The dividend represents a quarterly cash payout of approximately $2.1 million, or $8.4 million on an annualized basis. Subject to a continuing strong capital position and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in the best interest of shareholders, Materion intends to pay a quarterly dividend on an ongoing basis.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nPortions of the narrative set forth in this document that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking statements, in particular, the outlook provided above.
