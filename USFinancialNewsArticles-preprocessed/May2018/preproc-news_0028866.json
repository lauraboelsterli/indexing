More than 200 former Transamerica employees now work for TCS at this Little Rock facility, as part of TCS recruiting and protecting more than 2,200 Transamerica jobs across the U.S. in multiple locations.\nThe Little Rock office is a new U.S. business center for TCS, adding to its existing office in Bentonville, Arkansas, which hosts more than 150 employees.

Now this partnership with Transamerica will create more jobs for our existing workforce,\" said Governor Asa Hutchinson. \"I appreciate TCS' commitment to our state and the economic opportunities it is providing for those already in high-tech jobs and those preparing for a high-tech career.\"\nTCS also plans to bring its Ignite My Future in School program to Arkansas, providing free professional development and resources for educators to integrate computational thinking – a foundational skill for 21 st century careers – into core subjects.
