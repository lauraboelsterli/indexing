    "text": "San Jose, California, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sonasoft Corp. (OTCPK: SSFT), a leader in eDiscovery solutions and business continuity services, announces that it has jointly signed a purchase agreement to acquire Cornerstone Technologies and all related interests and assets. The acquisition will be finalized after both companies have their financials audited and shareholder approval is obtained.\n“Collectively driving Sonasoft to the next level is what this merger is about,” said Frank Velasquez, President and CEO of Cornerstone Technologies. “Cornerstone’s strengths are in marketing, sales, and developing enterprise relationships with high-end IT services that complement Sonasoft’s excellent technology and product offerings. We are confident that together our strengths will yield top-line growth and increase higher-margin returns.”\n“We are committed to a path of acquisitions and have created a winning strategy to grow,” said Andy Khanna, CEO of Sonasoft. “Sonasoft provides a public vehicle for the combined companies to expand and grow. Once the Company has completed the audit, then we will file with the SEC to become a fully reporting company. The Company also intends to up-list to the OTCQB. The Company’s ability to raise capital from these initiatives will fuel our efforts to acquire additional companies and technologies that will expand our bottom-line revenue and market share value.”\nThe closing of this acquisition is subject to the completion of due diligence. Both companies will have their financials audited and shareholder approval will be required before the acquisition is completed.
