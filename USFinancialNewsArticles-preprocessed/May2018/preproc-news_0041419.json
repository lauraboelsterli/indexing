Between May 22 and 24 when it was held last year, prices jumped 69 percent, Fundstrat said. Prices popped another 138 percent in the two months after the conference.\nIn a note to clients published ahead of this year's event, Fudstrat predicted a bump \"likely greater\" than in previous years \"given dramatic jump in attendance plus the fact BTC is down YTD.\"\nInstead, prices stayed in the low $8,000 range throughout the week, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin hit a high of $8,835 last week before blockchain enthusiasts flocked to New York. The cryptocurrency has dropped more than 40 percent this year.\nBitcoin's one-week performance\nSource: CoinDesk\n\"While there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on crypto-currencies strengthened during the conference,\" said Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, who is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin.\nThis year's Consensus conference drew in more than 8,500 attendees, according to Barry Silbert, CEO and founder of parent company Digital Currency Group. That's more than triple the 2,700 attendees CoinDesk reported for the May 2017 conference. At roughly $2,000 a ticket, the conference raked in at least $17 million in ticket sales alone.\nKate Rooney | CNBC Many attendees had to wait more than an hour to register at CoinDeskâ€™s Consensus 2018 conference at the New York Hilton Midtown. More than 20 other events happened as part of a \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation. Among the private, post-conference festivities: Snoop Dogg performed in the West Village for crypto start-up Ripple, and a new venture called rented out the 210-foot party yacht \"Cornucopia Majesty.\"\nZ-cash is one of the the only major cryptocurrencies to rally this week after trading platform Gemini announced it would list the coin on its licensed exchange.\nOther major cryptocurrencies struggled this week. Since Monday, ethereum has fallen roughly 9 percent, bitcoin cash is down 22 percent, and litecoin and XRP have both dropped 12 percent.\nWATCH: How to start your very own cryptocurrency show chapters How to start your very own cryptocurrency 7:15 AM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 | 03:13 ",
