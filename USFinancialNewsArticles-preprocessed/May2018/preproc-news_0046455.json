    "text": "43 COMMENTS The foreign students were wrapping up a retreat in a North Carolina town, sharing stories about their first six months in the U.S., when Sabika Sheikh captivated the room with a spur-of-the moment speech: she prayed every night to wake up to a world of peace, her friend at the retreat recalled her saying.\nMs. Sheikh, a 17-year-old from Pakistan, faced the opposite of peace last Friday, just a few weeks shy of the end of her year abroad in Texas when a Santa Fe High School student attacked the school . She was one of eight students killed, along with two teachers.\n“That girl came to America to experience a new culture, to see how the school system works here,” said Zerina Spahalic, a Bosnian studying in Kentucky through the same program as Ms. Sheikh. “And she was killed in a place where nobody would think she would be killed.”\nPeople think of Pakistan as a place of violence and instability, said Ms. Spahalic, 16, also from a country born of years of war. “But that girl died in America. That’s hard for me.”\nAbdul Aziz Sheikh, Ms. Sheikh’s father, said the family was “shocked and senseless” when they learned she died.\nRelated\n‘Don’t Scream’: How the Texas School Shooting Unfolded Victims Remembered at Church Service Santa Fe High Takes the Field, and Takes a Bow Lives Lost in Three Decades of School Shootings Shooting Victims: Girl Scout, Substitute Teachers The news came, first broadly about a shooting at a Texas school, through a news ticker on a Pakistani TV channel. Then a CNN broadcast offered more details, including their first live look at the American school they had been so proud to tell relatives would host their daughter, after a competitive application process.\n“I was ringing on her phone but there was no response,” Mr. Sheikh said from the family home in Karachi. And then a dreaded call from the hospital, saying “Sabika is no more.”\nThousands of teens from countries around the world study in the U.S. every year through scholarship or cultural exchange programs, leaving home for what many see as the opportunity of a lifetime.\nMost are sponsored by private initiatives, but many come through U.S. government programs like the one that brought Ms. Sheikh from Pakistan, the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study program, funded by the State Department.\nThe program sponsored about 900 students this school year who lived and studied in nearly every state, a spokesman said. Ms. Sheikh was one of 72 from Pakistan.\nIn a video Ms. Sheikh recorded after learning she got into the program, she says the news was “too much to handle” and sent her squealing into school the next day.\n“I wrote a diary entry that day because it was really special for me,” she says in the video. “Seeing those proud smiles on my parents’ faces? That was the best moment of my life.”\nA shooting at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, Friday morning left at least 10 dead and others injured. The suspect identified as 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a student at the high school, is in custody. Photo: Associated Press. At school, she said some of her classmates “got sad a bit, that I’ll be leaving this. But this was, like, the bestest thing that happened.”\nThe Pakistani Consulate in Houston helped organized a prayer service and memorial for Ms. Sheikh on Sunday at a local mosque.\nIn towns big and small, students live with American families, learning about the U.S. and sharing their own cultures and traditions. The State Department said Ms. Sheikh’s death in a school shooting was the first for a foreign student in the U.S. in one of its sponsored programs.\nChristy Jane Hurst, who is hosting Ms. Spahalic from Bosnia and Herzegovina in her home in Lawrenceburg, Ky., said one of the first things she told her student’s parents was “I will make sure your child is safe.”\n“I told them, we will love and take care of your child and protect her,” said Mrs. Hurst, whose family hosted their first foreign student in 2016-2017 and enjoyed the experience so much they decided to host again.\nMs. Spahalic, who had spent time with Ms. Sheikh on two program outings in the past year, came home from school Friday in tears after learning her friend was killed. She remembered Ms. Sheikh’s speech at the retreat in January, after which other students hugged Ms. Sheikh and asked to snap photos together.\nMs. Spahalic said she was shocked at the shooting but not entirely surprised: her own host school, Anderson County High School, was in lockdown not long ago because of a shooting threat. “I was traumatized by that. It’s the first time something like that happens to me,” she said.\nHer parents considered pulling her out of the program but decided to let her stay, she said. The program ends next month, and after the Texas shooting, Ms. Spahalic said her mother told her she was “walking on needles” waiting for her return.\nIn Pakistan, the Sheikh family couldn’t wait to see their daughter, the eldest of four, who was due home in a few weeks. Her father said she was craving a home-cooked meal—she said she was getting tired of fries—and had given them a long list of her favorite dishes.\nShe loved America but was also eager to come back home, Mr. Sheikh said.\nHer body will arrive in Pakistan on Monday, he said.\n—Waqar Gillani in Islamabad and Jim Carlton in San Francisco contributed to this article.\nWrite to Nour Malas at nour.malas@wsj.com",
