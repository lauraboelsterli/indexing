As expanded capabilities in payroll, financials and benefits are incorporated into the Frontline Insights Platform, Frontline will work to expand the Prologic TEAMS footprint into other regions.\nCappello Global, LLC served as exclusive strategic and financial advisor to Prologic Technology Systems, Inc.
