    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 6:21 AM / Updated 15 minutes ago Kingfisher quarterly sales dented by March cold snap Reuters Kingfisher ( KGF.L ), Europe’s second largest home improvement retailer, said on Thursday sales in its latest quarter were dented by unusually adverse weather conditions in March which impacted shopper footfall. FILE PHOTO: Signs outside the B&Q and Screwfix stores in Loughborough, Britain March 23, 2016. REUTERS/Darren Staples/File Photo\nThe firm said in Britain like-for-like sales at its B&Q business slumped 9 percent in the three months to April 30, while growth at the Screwfix chain slipped to 3.6 percent.\nAnalysts had forecast a decline of about 8 percent and a rise of 5 percent respectively.\nKingfisher said in France, where it trades as Castorama and Brico Depot, like-for-like sales were down 3.9 percent, broadly in line with analysts’ expectations.\nOverall group like-for-like sales fell 4.0 percent, with 3.0 percent of that decline attributed to the weather.\nKingfisher said market conditions “continue to be mixed.” Reporting by James Davey; editing by Kate Holton",
