    "text": "Drug giant Novartis revealed Wednesday that it paid President Donald Trump 's lawyer Michael Cohen $1.2 million for health-care policy consulting work that he proved \"unable\" to do.\nThe company also said it has been questioned by special counsel Robert Mueller 's team about the payments to Cohen.\nNBC News reported later Wednesday that a senior Novartis official said that Cohen reached out shortly after Trump's election \"promising access\" to the new administration.\nNovartis said it signed a one-year contract with Cohen's shell company, Essential Consultants, for $100,000 per month in February 2017, shortly after Trump was inaugurated as president.\nNovartis said it believed Cohen \"could advise the company as to how the Trump administration might approach certain U.S. health-care policy matters, including the Affordable Care Act.\"\nBut just a month after signing the deal, Novartis executives had their first meeting with Cohen, and afterward \"determined that Michael Cohen and Essentials Consultants would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had anticipated.\"\nGetty Images Michael Cohen, longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, arrives at the United States District Court Southern District of New York on April 26, 2018 in New York City. But Novartis kept paying Cohen.\n\"As the contract, unfortunately, could only be terminated for cause, payments continued to be made until the contract expired by its own terms in February 2018,\" Novartis said.\nThat means that Cohen was paid up to $1.2 million for his work.\nOn Tuesday, Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels , said investigators for his law firm had found that Novartis had paid Cohen's shell company nearly $400,000 in four installments last year.\nAvenatti said that AT&T paid $200,000 to Essential Consultants in four installments of $50,000 each per month.
