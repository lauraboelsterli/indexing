    "text": "FORT MYERS, Fla., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alico, Inc. (“Alico” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ALCO) today announces financial results for the second quarter and six months For the six months ended, the Company recorded net income of $3.2 million and earnings of $0.39 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $4.1 million and earnings of $0.49 per diluted common share in the prior year. The decrease in net income is primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Irma on the current production season and a valuation allowance resulting in a tax expense of $6.1 million. Partially offsetting this decrease are lower operating expenses and a one-time deferred tax benefit of $10.1 million due to the federal corporate tax rate change enacted on December 22, 2017.\nWhen both periods are adjusted for non-recurring items related to transaction costs, separation and consulting fees, gains on sale of real estate and property and equipment, employee stock compensation expense, net deferred tax and other valuation allowances, the Company incurred an adjusted loss of $0.18 per diluted common share for the six month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to adjusted earnings of $0.43 per diluted common share for the six months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $9.3 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Adjusted free cash flow for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was flat compared to the same period in the prior year, even though Alico increased capital expenditures significantly in 2018 due to a more aggressive tree-planting program.\nThese financial results reflect the seasonal nature of Alico’s business as impacted by Hurricane Irma. Historically, the second and third quarters of Alico's fiscal year produce the majority of the Company's annual revenue and working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters. Due to Hurricane Irma, in the first six months of fiscal 2018 Alico harvested fruit earlier than in prior years.\nOn November 16, 2017, Alico announced the Alico 2.0 Modernization Program to aggressively improve the operations of the Company and optimize its return on capital employed through cost reductions, increased efficiencies and disposition of non-performing assets. Since then, Alico’s citrus and ranch operations, including all back office support activities, have been improved through Alico 2.0. Because the program has been successful, Alico will continue to measure the productivity of all of its assets and eliminate costs that will not negatively affect citrus production. Alico 2.0 remains active to improve long-term performance throughout the Company. Consistent with the objectives of Alico 2.0, the Company divested several underperforming assets during the first six months of fiscal 2018.\nThe Company reported the following financial results:\n(in thousands except for per share amounts) 31, 2018\nSix Months Ended March 31, 2018 2018 2017 Change\n2018 2017 Change Net (loss) income $ (5,530 ) $ 5,884 $ (11,414 ) NM $ 3,208 $ 4,141 $ (933 ) (22.5 )% EBITDA (1) $ 8,307 $ 16,408 $ (8,101 ) (49.4 )% $ 10,381 $ 19,643 $ (9,262 ) (47.2 )% Earnings (loss) per diluted common share $ (0.67 ) $ 0.70 $ (1.37 ) NM $ 0.39 $ 0.49 $ (0.10 ) (20.4 )% Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 9,438 $ 14,688 $ (5,250 ) (35.7 )% $ (251 ) $ (2,749 ) $ 2,498 (90.9 )% (1) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this earnings release for details regarding these measures.\nNM = Not Meaningful\nAlico Citrus Division Results\nDuring the six months ended March 31, 2018, Alico Citrus harvested approximately 3.4 million boxes of fruit, a decline of 27.9% from the same period in the prior year. The Early and Mid-Season harvest was completed and those total boxes decreased by 43.7%. Valencia boxes harvested through March 31, 2018 increased by 20.0% over the same period in the prior year because the harvesting season commenced approximately one month earlier than in the prior year due to Hurricane Irma. This will likely result in the Valencia harvesting being completed earlier this year and the Company anticipates operating results to be lower in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nAs previously announced, Alico continues to estimate its total number of boxes harvested per acre for fiscal year 2018 will decrease by approximately 40-45% due to the impact of Hurricane Irma. The Company expects operating expenses for fiscal year 2018 will remain consistent with fiscal year 2017 on a per acre basis, and the financial benefits of Alico 2.0 will begin to be realized in fiscal year 2019 because growing costs incurred in fiscal 2018 are expensed in the following crop season when fruit is harvested and sold.\nCitrus production for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized in the following table.\n(boxes and pound solids in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, Six Months Ended\nMarch 31, Change Change 2018 2017 Unit % 2018 2017 $ % Boxes Harvested: Early and Mid-Season 597 2,186 (1,589 ) (72.7 )% 1,811 3,215 (1,404 ) (43.7 )% Valencias 1,470 1,225 245 20.0 % 1,470 1,225 245 20.0 % Total Processed 2,067 3,411 (1,344 ) (39.4 )% 3,281 4,440 (1,159 ) (26.1 )% Fresh Fruit 24 115 (91 ) (79.1 )% 97 244 (147 ) (60.2 )% Total 2,091 3,526 (1,435 ) (40.7 )% 3,378 4,684 (1,306 ) (27.9 )% Pound Solids Produced: Early and Mid-Season 3,125 12,510 (9,385 ) (75.0 )% 9,194 17,950 (8,756 ) (48.8 )% Valencias 8,651 7,467 1,184 15.9 % 8,651 7,467 1,184 15.9 % Total 11,776 19,977 (8,201 ) (41.1 )% 17,845 25,417 (7,572 ) (29.8 )% Average Pound Solids Per Box: Early and Mid-Season 5.23 5.72 (0.49 ) (8.6 )% 5.08 5.58 (0.50 ) (9.0 )% Valencias 5.89 6.09 (0.20 ) (3.3 )% 5.89 6.09 (0.20 ) (3.3 )% Price per Pound Solids: Early and Mid-Season $ 2.83 $ 2.56 $ 0.27 10.5 % $ 2.64 $ 2.55 $ 0.09 3.5 % Valencias $ 2.84 $ 2.72 $ 0.12 4.4 % $ 2.84 $ 2.72 $ 0.12 4.4 % Alico Citrus cost of sales decreased to $31.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $38.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease is because the Company took a charge for inventory casualty losses in the quarter ended September 30, 2017, due to the impact of Hurricane Irma related to the reduced amount of fruit that was expected to be harvested this season.\nConservation and Environmental Resources Division Results\nIn January 2018, the Company sold its breeding herd and leased grazing rights on the Alico Ranch to a third party operator. The Company continues to own the property and conduct its long-term water dispersement program and wildlife management programs. As part of the sales transaction, the Company expensed all inventory costs that were accumulated at the date of sale.\nOther Corporate Financial Information\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.2 million to $7.0 million for the six months The decrease primarily relates to one-time consulting fees incurred in the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by an accrual related to a change in our employee paid time-off policy and increased professional fees.\nOther expense, net was $2.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $2.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease of $0.4 million is primarily attributable to a reduction of interest expense due to mandatory pay down of long-term debt, as well as a prepayment made on a loan of approximately $4.5 million with proceeds from asset sales.\nThe Company paid a second quarter cash dividend of $0.06 per share on its outstanding common stock on April 13, 2018 to shareholders of record at March 30, 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018 the Company had working capital of $43.4 million and had term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, of $167.7 million.\nAbout Alico\nAlico, Inc. is a holding company with assets and related operations in agriculture and environmental resources, including citrus, wildlife management, and water management.

Due to significant depreciable assets associated with the nature of our operations and, to a lesser extent, interest costs associated with our capital structure, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Common Share, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are important measures to evaluate our results of operations between periods on a more comparable basis and to help investors analyze underlying trends in our business, evaluate the performance of our business both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and the broader market, provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and operational strength of our business and helps investors evaluate our ability to service our debt. Such measurements are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and should not be construed as an alternative to reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP information provided is unique to Alico and may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization adjusted for non-recurring transactions or transactions that are not indicative of our core operating results, such as gains or losses on sales of real estate and property and equipment. Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Common Share is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for non-recurring transactions divided by diluted common shares. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activities adjusted for non-recurring transactions less capital expenditures. The Company uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow to evaluate its business and this measure is considered an important indicator of the Company's liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, and pay dividends to common stockholders. The Company’s definition of Adjusted Free Cash Flow does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary spending.\nSource:Alico, Inc.",
