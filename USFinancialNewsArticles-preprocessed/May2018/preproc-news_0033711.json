    "text": "LYON, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nERYTECH Pharma (Euronext: ERYP - Nasdaq: ERYP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies by encapsulating therapeutic drug substances inside red blood cells, announced that it has appointed Alex Dusek as its Vice President Commercial Strategy and member of the executive team. Mr. Dusek brings 25 years of experience in market access, product marketing and sales across small biotech start-ups and multi-national pharmaceutical companies.\n“I am pleased to welcome Alex to the ERYTECH team at this exciting juncture,” said Gil Beyen, Chairman and CEO of ERYTECH. “His extensive experience in market access and commercial product launches will provide an invaluable foundation for commercial product preparedness and lay the groundwork for commercial success of our late-stage product candidates worldwide, with initial focus on the United States.”\nPrior to joining ERYTECH, Mr. Dusek served as the Vice President of Commercial Strategy at Argos Therapeutics, a publicly traded immuno-oncology company, where his work included pre-launch planning for the commercial distribution of an advanced cell therapy product. Before Argos, Mr. Dusek led the global brand strategy at Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals for the launch of a first-in-class, rare-disease agent, Adempas (riociguat). He was the first marketing employee at United Therapeutics hired to build the marketing infrastructure and grow the pulmonary hypertension franchise. Mr. Dusek earned a B.A. in Linguistics from the College of William and Mary, completed a post-baccalaureate pre-medical program at Columbia University, and received his M.B.A from the University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler Business School.\n“ERYTECH is the leader in red blood cell-based cancer therapeutics,” stated Mr. Dusek. “I’m excited to join a company with advanced clinical programs and a platform that offers the potential promise to treat patients suffering from many different serious diseases. I look forward to utilizing my broad product launch experience and assisting the team in the transformation of ERYTECH from a development company to a commercially successful operation.”\nMr. Dusek will be based in the United States, joining ERYTECH’s growing team in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nAbout ERYTECH: www.erytech.com\nFounded in Lyon, France in 2004, ERYTECH is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for rare forms of cancer and orphan diseases. Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS platform, which uses a novel technology to encapsulate therapeutic drug substances inside red blood cells, ERYTECH has developed a pipeline of product candidates targeting markets with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s initial focus is on the development of products that target the altered amino acid metabolism of cancer cells, depriving them of nutrients necessary for their survival.\nThe Company’s lead product, eryaspase, also known under the trade name GRASPA®, consists of an enzyme, L-asparaginase, encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells. L-asparaginase depletes asparagine, a naturally occurring amino acid essential for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. L-asparaginase has been a standard component of multi-agent chemotherapy for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but side effects limit treatment compliance, especially in adults and patients with weak performance status.\nEryaspase demonstrated positive efficacy and safety results in various clinical trials in ALL, including in a Phase 2 study in patients over 55 years of age and in a Phase 2/3 trial in relapsed or refractory ALL patients, as well as in pancreatic cancer, where it achieved positive results in a Phase 2b trial of second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. ERYTECH is preparing for the launch of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in second line pancreatic cancer and Phase 2 trials in first line pancreatic cancer and triple-negative breast cancer.\nERYTECH produces eryaspase at its own GMP-approved and operational manufacturing site in Lyon (France), and at a site for clinical production in Philadelphia (USA). ERYTECH has entered into licensing and distribution partnership agreements for eryaspase for ALL and AML in Europe with Orphan Europe (Recordati Group), and for ALL in Israel with TEVA, which will market the product under the GRASPA® brand name. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have granted orphan drug designations for eryaspase for the treatment of ALL, AML and pancreatic cancer.\nIn addition to eryaspase, ERYTECH is developing erymethionase, methionine-γ-lyase encapsulated in red blood cells, to target cancer cells’ amino acid metabolism and induce tumor starvation. ERYTECH is also exploring the use of its ERYCAPS platform for developing cancer immunotherapies (ERYMMUNE) and enzyme replacement therapies (ERYZYME).\nERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135, ticker: ERYP). ERYTECH is part of the CAC Healthcare, CAC Pharma & Bio, CAC Mid & Small, CAC All Tradable, EnterNext PEA-PME 150 and Next Biotech indexes.\nForward-looking information\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, forecasts and estimates.
