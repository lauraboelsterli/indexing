FILE PHOTO: President of En+ Group, Oleg Deripaska attends an agreement signing ceremony with the Krasnoyarsk region's government, in Moscow, Russia December 12, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo\nWashington imposed sweeping sanctions last month on some of Russia’s biggest companies and businessmen, including En+, striking at allies of President Vladimir Putin to punish Moscow for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other so-called malign activities.\nEn+, which manages Deripaska’s aluminum and hydropower businesses, said it would propose that Philippe Mailfait, an independent director at the group, replace Deripaska on the board of directors of Rusal, Russia’s largest aluminum producer.\nThe group on Friday reported first-quarter net profits of $667 million, with its revenue increasing 17 percent year-on-year to $3.4 billion.\nIt said the long-term effects of the U.S. move and the threat of additional sanctions were difficult to determine.\nThe group’s chairman said this month it was working on a plan it hoped would lead the United States to lift the sanctions.\nDeripaska has tried to distance himself from the companies. He agreed last month to lower his stake in En+ Group to less than 50 percent, after Washington said it could lift the sanctions against the company if he relinquished control.\nBut Deripaska has yet to cede his stake in the group.\nThe Russian government has pledged to assist Russian companies that experience financial troubles because of the U.S. sanctions.\nBut on Monday, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia was not considering buying stakes in En+ and Rusal.
