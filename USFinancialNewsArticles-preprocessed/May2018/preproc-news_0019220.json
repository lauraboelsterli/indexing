    "text": "NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Collectors Universe, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLCT), a leading provider of value-added authentication and grading services to dealers and collectors of high-value collectibles, today announced financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nOperational and Financial Highlights :\nRevenues in this year’s third quarter were $17.5 million, down 6% from the $18.6 million in last year’s third quarter. For this year’s nine months, revenues were $51.3 million, down 2% from $52.2 million in same period of last year.\nOur cards and autograph service revenues increased by $1.0 million, or 23%, in this year’s third quarter and $2.2 million, or 17% in this year’s nine months, representing record quarterly and nine-month revenues for that business.\nOur total coin service revenues declined by $2.0 million, or 16%, and by $3.0 million, or 8%, in this year’s third quarter and nine months. China coin revenues increased by $0.7 million, or 136%, and by $1.7 million, or 33%, in this year’s third quarter and nine months, as we continued to see brand acceptance in that region. However, in the United States, coins service revenues declined by $2.8 million or 24% and $5.0 million or 17%, due to the previously disclosed slowness in the domestic coin market.\nCoin service revenues generated by our overseas operations (inclusive of the China revenues discussed above) were 11% and 18% of total revenues in this year’s third quarter and nine months, as compared to 7% and 13% of total revenues in the same respective periods of last year.\nOur gross profit margins were 55% and 58%, respectively, in this year’s third quarter and nine months, as compared to 60% and 62% in the same respective periods of the prior year. Those declines were primarily attributable to the decreases in our U.S. coin revenues, as a significant proportion of our direct costs are relatively fixed in the short-term.\nOperating income was $2.0 million and $6.7 million in this year’s third quarter and nine months, as compared to $4.7 million and $12.0 million, respectively, in the corresponding periods of the prior year. The declines in operating income in the current year periods, primarily reflect the decreases in U.S. coin revenues as discussed above. In addition, we incurred higher non-cash stock-based compensation of $0.4 million and $0.6 million in this year’s third quarter and nine months, and $0.6 million in moving and lease exit costs for the relocation of our operations and headquarters to a new facility, in this year’s nine months.\nIncome from continuing operations was $1.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, and $5.2 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, in this year’s third quarter and nine months as compared to $3.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, and $7.5 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the corresponding respective periods of the prior year. The provisions for income taxes in the current year periods, reflect federal income taxes at a blended rate of 28% arising from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law in December 2017.\nThe Company’s cash position as of March 31, 2018 was $9.2 million, as compared to $9.8 million at June 30, 2017 and $8.7 million at December 31, 2017. Net cash used of $0.6 million in the nine months included $8.5 million of cash generated from continuing operations and $3.0 million of borrowings under our term loan, offset by $7.5 million used to pay cash dividends to stockholders, $4.4 million used for capital expenditures, and capitalized software costs, which are inclusive of expenditures for our new operations and headquarter facility and $0.2 million used for discontinued operations. In this year’s third quarter, we paid about $0.8 million in remaining disbursements for the new facility.\nOn May 1, 2018, we announced our fourth quarter dividend of $0.175 per share of common stock, which will be paid on May 25, 2018 to stockholders of record on May 16, 2018.\nOperations Commentary\nJoseph J. Orlando Chief Executive Officer, stated, “After a slower than expected Q2, Collectors Universe finished Q3 in stronger fashion. While there are still segments of the PCGS domestic business and overall coin market that remain soft, other parts of our business performed well. PCGS continues to gain traction overseas as our international coin business increased by 55% over the same quarter a year ago. In addition, our PSA and PSA/DNA division set another quarterly revenue record and continued its record pace for the fiscal year”\nConference Call and Webcast\nCollectors Universe will host a conference call to discuss results on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time/1:30 p.m. Pacific Time.

Forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" or future or conditional verbs such as \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" or \"may.\"\nDue to a number of to which our business and our markets are subject, our future financial performance may differ, possibly significantly, from expectations regarding our future financial performance that are expressed in, or that may be implied or inferred from the discussion of our operating results in this news release. Those , and their possible impact on our future financial performance, include, but are not limited to, the following: our continued dependence on our coin business which historically has generated more than 60% of our consolidated revenues and a substantial portion of our operating income, making our operating results more vulnerable to conditions that could adversely affect or cause stagnation in the prices of precious metals or reduce demand for and transactions in collectible coins; the risks that domestic or international economic conditions may deteriorate and lead to reductions in the demand for our collectibles authentication and grading services and, consequently, in our revenues and operating results; the risk that weakness or volatility in economic conditions or increases in interest rates in the United States or in the overseas markets where we operate will lead to longer-term changes in the spending habits of consumers or in the availability, costs and use of credit by smaller businesses, such as collectibles dealers, to fund purchases of collectibles, which could lead to longer-term declines in collectibles commerce and, therefore, in the demand for our services; the risks that claims under our coin and trading card authentication and grading warranties will increase substantially and that the warranty reserves we maintain for such claims will prove to be inadequate, which could cause our gross margin and operating results to decline or cause us to incur operating losses; the risk that our strategies of offering new services and expanding our collectibles authentication and grading business into new geographic areas, such as Europe and Asia will not be successful in enabling us to improve our profitability or may even cause us to incur significant losses; the risks and added complexity of conducting business overseas; the risk that it may become necessary for us to reduce the amount of, or suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future, due to conditions or circumstances outside of our control, such as adverse economic or market conditions, as well as our future financial performance and the cash needs of our business in the future.\nAdditional information regarding these risks and other to which our business is subject is contained in Item 1A, entitled “Risk Factors”, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 31, 2017 and readers of this news release are urged to review the discussion of those in that Report. Also, our actual financial results in the future may differ from those currently expected due to additional of which we are not currently aware or which we do not currently view as, but may in the future become, material to our business or operating results. Due to these , readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the contained in this news release or in our Annual or Quarterly Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which speak only as of their respective dates. We also disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of the contained in this news release or in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law or NASDAQ rules.\nContact:\nJoseph Wallace\nChief Financial Officer\nCollectors Universe\n949-567-1245\nEmail: jwallace@collectors.com\n- tables to follow -\nCOLLECTORS UNIVERSE, INC.
