    "text": "MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hydrogenics Corporation (NASDAQ:HYGS) (TSX:HYG) (\"Hydrogenics\" or \"the Company\"), a leading developer and manufacturer of hydrogen generation and hydrogen-based power modules, today reported first quarter 2018 financial results. Results are reported in US dollars and are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nRecent Highlights\n“Our first quarter was particularly busy with major proposals and significant project development,” said Daryl Wilson, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Revenue was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting shipment timing, but our gross margin and gross profit both rose due to improved product mix – ending the quarter with approximately $19.4 million of cash. We continue to bid on a steady stream of Quote: s for mobility fuel cells, energy storage systems, and fueling station equipment throughout North America and abroad while remaining particularly bullish on China and parts of Europe.\n“We anticipate a strong year of announcements and scale-up of the business, and the Company recently won a C$5 million government grant in Canada as part of our plans to invest in future growth initiatives. At the same time, the significant shipments to China last year for mobility applications are moving through the test and evaluation phase, prior to the next level of order magnitude. Our current pipeline of opportunities is large and growing, so we view first quarter operating results as not reflective of the potential for top line expansion this year and beyond. While we are always subject to a degree of uncertainty regarding timing, particularly in China, we’re optimistic about order acceleration and the path to profitability due to our leadership position within the industry, continued strong demand for clean, sustainable solutions, and the increasing interest in hydrogen-based energy applications.”\nSummary of Results for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nCompany revenue was $8.1 million compared with $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, with the year-over-year decline due to shipment timing. Gross margin improved to 39.7% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with from 30.6% last year, as the Company posted gross profit of $3.2 million in the current quarter versus $2.7 million in the prior-year period. The higher gross margin was principally due to improved product mix. Cash operating costs 1 increased $1.5 million to $4.9 million in the 2018 first quarter compared to $3.4 million in 2017 due to $1.1 million of higher net research and development (“R&D”) expenses, primarily related to final completion of the Enbridge Power-to-Gas facility in Toronto as well as an increase of $0.4 million in cash selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses.\nThe Company’s Adjusted EBITDA 2 loss was $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $0.7 million in the prior-year period. This variance reflects the aforementioned increase in cash operating costs, partially offset by higher gross profit.\nThe net loss for the quarter improved to $2.0 million, or $(0.13) per share, compared to $2.3 million, or $(0.18) per share, in the prior-year period.\nThe Company was awarded government funding in Canada totaling C$5 million reflecting a 50% match on anticipated expenditures related to scale-up of operations at Hydrogenics’ headquarters. The first C$2.5 million will be received in the second quarter of 2018, with the balance of funds advanced as expenditures are made later in 2018 and 2019.\nThe Company ended the first quarter of 2018 with backlog of $140.1 million, securing orders of $2.6 million for Power-to-Gas systems, fueling stations, industrial gas applications and mobility systems. Order backlog movement during the first quarter (in $ millions) was as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2017 backlog\nIFRS 15\nAdj. Orders\nReceived FX Orders\nDelivered/\nRevenue\nRecognized March 31,\n2018 backlog OnSite Generation $ 19.9 $ (0.8 ) $ 1.6 $ 0.4 $ 3.8 $ 17.3 Power Systems 124.9 (0.3 ) 1.0 1.5 4.3 122.8 Total $ 144.8 $ (1.1 ) $ 2.6 $ 1.9 $ 8.1 $ 140.1 Of the above backlog of $140.1 million, the Company expects to recognize $55.0 million in the following 12 months as revenue. Revenue for the year ending December 31, 2018 will also include orders both received and delivered during the balance of 2018.\nNotes\nCash operating costs are defined as the sum of SG&A and R&D, less amortization and depreciation, and stock-based compensation expense inclusive of compensation costs indexed to the Company’s share price. This is a non-IFRS measure and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Management uses this measure as a rough estimate of the amount of fixed costs to operate the Corporation and believes this is a useful measure for investors for the same purpose. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding stock based compensation (both cash settled long term compensation indexed to share price and share based compensation), other finance income and expenses, depreciation and amortization. These items are considered by management to be outside of Hydrogenics’ ongoing operational results. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nConference Call Details\nHydrogenics will hold a conference call at 1:00 p.m. ET on May 11, 2018 to review the first quarter results. The telephone number for the conference call is (877) 307-1373 or, for international callers, (678) 224-7873.
