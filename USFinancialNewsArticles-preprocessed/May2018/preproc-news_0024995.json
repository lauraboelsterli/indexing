Metal sales for the quarter were 11.0 million pounds of zinc, 1.1 million pounds of lead and 67,626 ounces silver, respectively, for revenue of $16.6 million.\nDuring the quarter, the Santander mill averaged 1,674 tonnes per day, which is materially below the 2,000 tonne-per-day design rate. This was due to planned maintenance work on a ball mill, resulting in approximately 25% lower processing capacity. Mining during Q1 was maintained at normal capacity, which resulted in an ore stock pile of approximately 65,000-tonnes at the end of the quarter. The mill maintenance was completed in late March and the mill is currently operating at higher than design capacity (April 2018 mill throughput averaged 2,350 tonnes per day).\nUnderground production was 187,073 tonnes of ore and average head grades were 4.46% zinc, 0.48% lead and 0.77 oz/ton silver, with production of 12,549 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 1,109 tonnes of lead-silver concentrate. Recoveries averaged 89% for zinc, 79% for lead and 58% for silver. Site cash operating costs were $64.50 per tonne milled, which is materially above the annual cost guidance range of $38-$42 per tonne and reflects lower production due to planned mill maintenance.\nSantander Production Results\nQ1-2018 Q1-2017 Tonnes Mined 187,073 148,689 Tonnes Milled 150,627 200,249 Average Head Grade:\nZinc (%)\nLead (%)\nSilver (oz/t)\n4.46\n0.48\n0.77\n3.80\n0.58\n0.96 Average Recoveries (%):\nZinc\nLead\nSilver\n89\n79\n58\n88\n79\n63 Payable Production: Zinc (pounds) 10,953,272 12,326,834 Lead (pounds) 1,170,588 1,875,891 Silver (ounces) 70,046 128,576 Total Cash Operating Costs (per pound of payable zinc produced) $ 1.08 $0.76 All-In Sustaining Cash Cost (per pound of payable zinc produced) $ 1.44 $0.96 Site Cash Operating Cost (per Tonne milled) (3) $ 64.50 $35.06\nSantander Sales Results\nQ1-2018 Q1-2017 Zinc Concentrate (dry metric tonnes) 12,715 13,579 Lead Concentrate (dry metric tonnes) 1,111 2,077 Payable Sales: Zinc (pounds) 10,993,766 11,804,614 Lead (pounds) 1,134,093 1,834,682 Silver (ounces) 67,626 125,557 Revenues (4) $ 16,602,000 $13,500,000 Average Realized Metal Price (5) : Zinc (per pound) $ 1.49 $1.27 Lead (per pound) $ 1.11 $1.03 Silver (per ounce) $ 16.52 $17.69 (3) Please refer to non-IFRS Measures in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release and in Trevali’s March 31, 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\n(4) Revenues include effects of settlement adjustments on sales from prior quarters.\n(5) Provisional realized metal prices.\nProduction for the balance of the year is expected to make-up the first quarter shortfall. The 2018 cost guidance remains unchanged at $38-$42 per tonne milled. Unitary costs will fall significantly from the first quarter levels due to increased mill throughput and production (Please refer to non-IFRS Measures in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release and in Trevali’s March 31, 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis) .\nCaribou Mine, Canada:\nProduction from the Caribou mine was 19.1 million payable pounds of zinc, 7.2 million payable pounds of lead and 216,087 payable ounces of silver. The mine sold 17.8 million pounds of zinc, 6.8 million pounds of lead, and 207,122 ounces of silver for total revenue of $28.1 million.\nMine production was 238,650 tonnes with mill throughput at 235,531 tonnes; recoveries averaged 75% for zinc, 62% for lead, and 41% for silver. Average head grades were 5.9% zinc, 2.4% lead and 2.1 oz/ton of silver, with production of 22,769 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 9,556 tonnes of lead-silver concentrate.\nSite operating costs for the Q1 were $64.12 per tonne, reflecting higher costs due to seasonal effects, as experienced in prior years.\nCaribou Production Results\nQ1-2018 Q1-2017 Tonnes Mined 238,650 222,264 Tonnes Milled 235,531 232,880 Average Head Grades: Zinc (%) 5.94 6.15 Lead (%) 2.43 2.68 Silver (oz/t) 2.14 2.29 Average Recoveries (%): Zinc 75 75 Lead 62 64 Silver 41 38 Payable Production: Zinc (pounds) 19,079,123 19,619,395 Lead (pounds) 7,200,955 8,107,773 Silver (ounces) 216,087 217,085 Total Cash Operating Costs (per pound of payable zinc produced) $ 0.73 $0.85 All-In Sustaining Cash Cost (per pound of payable zinc produced) $ 0.90 $0.95 Site Cash Operating Cost (per Tonne milled) (3) $ 64.12 $61.17\nCaribou Sales Results\nQ1-2018 Q1-2017 Zinc Concentrate (dry metric tonnes) 21,409 25,349 Lead Concentrate (dry metric tonnes) 9,058 10,956 Payable Sales:\nZinc (pounds)\n17,821,252\n21,773,627 Lead (pounds) 6,821,963 7,873,706 Silver (ounces) 207,122 203,078 Revenues (4) $ 28,072,000 $26,423,000 Average Realized Metal Price (5) : Zinc (per pound) $ 1.49 $1.25 Lead (per pound) $ 1.09 $1.05 Silver (per ounce) $ 16.53 $18.03 (3) Please refer to non-IFRS Measures in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release and in Trevali’s March 31, 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\n(4) Revenues include effects of settlement adjustments on sales from prior quarters.\n(5) Provisional realized metal prices.\nSecond quarter production from the Caribou operation will range from 23-25% of the full year guidance target for zinc and lead due to the seasonal transition from winter production at the mine. The annual 2018 guidance remains unchanged at $55-$61 per tonne milled with costs expected to trend lower in the second quarter (Please refer to non-IFRS Measures in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release and in Trevali’s March 31, 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis).\nThe 2018 business improvement program anticipates increased production gains and efficiencies as improvements are made to the site power infrastructure, mill control systems, ground control management and ventilation.\nRosh Pinah Mine, Namibia ( acquired by Trevali on August 31, 2017):\nQ1 production from Rosh Pinah was 22.8 million payable pounds of zinc, 3.9 million payable pounds of lead and 50,794 payable ounces of silver. Sales were 28.1 million pounds of zinc, for total revenue of $33.2 million. Due to limited lead concentrate production at Rosh Pinah, shipments are only scheduled approximately twice per year; there were none during Q1.\nMine production was 172,334 tonnes and mill throughput was 177,837 tonnes, with recoveries averaging 88% for zinc, 77% for lead, and 51% for silver. Average head grades milled were 7.9% zinc, 1.4% lead and 0.6 oz/ton silver, with production of 25,175 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 4,268 tonnes of lead-silver concentrate.\nSite cash operating costs per tonne milled were $54.41 and total cash operating costs were $0.90 per payable pound of zinc produced. Costs were marginally higher than the 2018 guidance range of $49 to $54 per tonne due to one-time costs associated with negotiating a three year labour agreement and no by-product lead or silver sales. The next lead-silver shipments are scheduled for Q2 and Q4-2018 respectively.\nRosh Pinah Production Results (100% basis)\nQ1-2018 Tonnes Mined 172,334 Tonnes Milled 177,837 Average Head Grade:\nZinc (%)\nLead (%)\nSilver (oz/t)\n7.92\n1.40\n0.58 Average Recoveries (%):\nZinc\nLead\nSilver\n88\n77\n51 Payable Production: Zinc (pounds) 22,831,575 Lead (pounds) 3,925,012 Silver (ounces) 50,794 Total Cash Operating Costs (per pound of payable zinc produced) $ 0.90 All-In Sustaining Cash Cost (per pound of payable zinc produced) $ 1.06 Site Cash Operating Cost (per Tonne milled) (3) $ 54.41\nRosh Pinah Sales Results (100% basis)\nQ1-2018 Zinc Concentrate (dry metric tonnes) 30,386 Lead Concentrate (dry metric tonnes) - Payable Sales: Zinc (pounds) 28,077,201 Lead (pounds) - Silver (ounces) - Revenues (4) $ 33,192,000 Average Realized Metal Price (5) : Zinc (per pound) $ 1.49 Lead (per pound) - Silver (per ounce) - (3) Please refer to non-IFRS Measures in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release and in Trevali’s March 31, 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\n(4) Revenues include effects of settlement adjustments on sales from prior quarters and is calculated on a 100% basis.\n(5) Provisional realized metal prices.\nBusiness improvement programs have been implemented to target key operational areas including production drilling support, introduction of raise-boring to improve the stope production cycle and mobile fleet optimization. Commissioning of the recently completed mill re-grind project continued through Q1 and is anticipated to result in improved zinc and lead recoveries going forward, in addition to higher-grade concentrate production when processing harder ore zones.\nPlanned 2018 metal production will increase in the second half of the year with lower grade stopes planned in the first half, followed by scheduled higher grade stopes in the second half of the year. The 2018 guidance remains unchanged for both metal production and costs (Please refer to non-IFRS Measures in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release and in Trevali’s March 31, 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis).\nPerkoa Mine, Burkina Faso (acquired by Trevali on August 31, 2017):\nQ1 production from Perkoa was 47.4 million payable pounds of zinc. Mill throughput was 179,940 tonnes with recovery averaging 94% for zinc and an average head grade of 14.5% zinc to produce of 47,413 tonnes of zinc concentrate. Mine production was 192,158 tonnes. Sales were 32.6 million pounds of zinc for total revenues of $40.7 million. Site cash operating costs per tonne milled were $111.72 and total cash operating costs per pound of payable zinc produced were $0.78.\nPerkoa Production Results (100% basis)\nQ1-2018 Tonnes Mined 192,158 Tonnes Milled 179,940 Average Head Grade: Zinc (%) 14.49 Average Recovery (%): Zinc 94 Concentrate Produced (dry metric tonnes): Zinc 47,413 Concentrate Grades: Zinc (%) 52 Payable Production: Zinc (pounds) 45,874,974 Total Cash Operating Costs (per pound of payable zinc produced) $ 0.78 All-In Sustaining Cash Cost (per pound of payable zinc produced) $ 0.84 Site Cash Operating Cost (per Tonne milled) (3) $ 111.72\nPerkoa Sales Statistics (100% basis)\nQ1-2018 Zinc Concentrate (DMT) 33,660 Payable Sales: Zinc (pounds) 32,598,594 Revenues (4) $ 36,852,000 Average Realized Metal Price (5) : Zinc (per pound) $ 1.49 (3) Please refer to non-IFRS Measures in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release and in Trevali’s March 31, 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\n(4) Revenues include effects of settlement adjustments on sales from prior quarters and is calculated on a 100% basis.\n(5) Provisional realized metal prices.\nThe Company approved the procurement of a more efficient site power generating system in Q1. The project entails the installation of two 2.5MW Heavy Fuel Oil generators for an estimated capital cost of $9.2 million. The project is expected to reduce operating costs by between $6 and $7 per tonne milled when installed.\nPerkoa production and costs remain in line with 2018 guidance and are expected to be broadly consistent through the year (Please refer to non-IFRS Measures in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release and in Trevali’s March 31, 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis) .\n2018 CONSOLIDATED PRODUCTION AND COST GUIDANCE (6,7,8)\nConsolidated production guidance for 2018 remains unchanged (see Table below)\nMine 2018 Zinc Production\n(million pounds payable) 2018 Lead Production\n(million pounds payable) 2018 Silver Production\n(000 ounces payable) Operating Costs\n(per tonne milled) Caribou 86-90 27.1-28.4 627-658 $55-$61 Perkoa (100%) (8) 155-165 n/a n/a $103-$113 Rosh Pinah (100%) (8) 105-115 5.7-6.0 123-129 $49-$54 Santander 54-57 11.0-11.6 654-687 $38-$42 Total 400-427 43.8-46.0 1,400-1,474 $60-$66 (6) Constitutes forward-looking information; see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.\n(7) Operating costs are based on various assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to: production volumes, commodity prices (Zn: $1.25/lb Pb: $1.00/lb Ag: $19/lb) and foreign currency exchange rates (N$/USD: 13.00; XOF/USD: 609; PEN/USD 3.25; C$/USD $1.25) and is a non-IFRS measure. Please refer to non-IFRS Measures in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this news release and in Trevali’s March 31, 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\n(8) Trevali’s ownership interest is currently 90% at Perkoa and 80% at Rosh Pinah.\nFormal production guidance is provided on an annual basis but we expect moderate fluctuations on a quarter-to-quarter basis due to normal-course mine scheduling, with modestly lower first quarter zinc production versus the balance of the year (Figure 1). 2018 production guidance remains on-track.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/58ac773e-4a97-4688-a0e2-a2b89870af66\nExploration Update:\nThe primary aim of the 2018 exploration program is to expand and discover new mineral resources adjacent to existing mine infrastructure, replace mined inventory, grow sustainable production, extend expected mine life and ultimately, contingent on success, provide production growth optionality to the operations.\nExploration and resource conversion drilling totaled approximately 26,500 metres during the quarter.\nAt Perkoa, 5,680 metres of underground resource conversion drilling in the Hanging Wall lens was completed and continued to return exceptionally high-grade zinc results, including:\n16.25 metres at 18.52% zinc, including 9.85 metres at 24.35% zinc; and 15.75 metres at 14.07% zinc, including 5.00 metres at 28.46% zinc\nA 5,300-metre follow-up program of underground exploration drilling targeting the Hanging Wall lens below the modelled resources commenced in April 2018. Three holes have been completed and intercepted massive to semi-massive sulphide mineralization at least 180 metres below the current deepest planned mining levels; assay results are pending. A Borehole Electromagnetic (“BHEM”) survey from surface exploration drill holes along the Perkoa ore horizon was completed during the quarter and several electromagnetic conductors were identified. The data is being processed and targets are expected to be drill tested during the second and third quarters. Reconnaissance mapping and sampling along the plus-25 kilometre strike length of the Perkoa Mine Horizon resulted in the discovery of surface to sub-surface gossans (weathered sulphide mineralization) associated with the geophysical anomalies. Air core drilling of these new targets commenced in April 2018.\nAt Santander, three underground and two surface drills were active at the Magistral deposits and adjacent targets. The approximately 18,000-metre program continues to test the continuity of the deposit to the 4,000-metre mine level, or approximately 300 vertical metres below current development. Drilling also tested targets at the high-grade Pipe and successfully intercepted new mantos below historically mined levels. A BHEM survey commenced in April.\nAt Rosh Pinah, three underground drills continued exploration and resource conversion drilling. A total of 5,500 metres of resource conversion and expansion drilling was completed targeting the extensions of the Western Orefield (WF3) to the north and down-plunge of the orebody. Integrated targeting within the broader exploration license also commenced during the period.\nIn the Bathurst Mining Camp, a 4,500-metre drill campaign commenced in April at the Restigouche project in order to provide production and mine planning optionality for future Caribou mill feed. Thirteen drill holes totaling 2,460 metres have been completed to date and results continue to validate the geological model. A total of 2,480 metres of resource conversion drilling was completed at Caribou mine during Q1.\nQualified Person and Quality Control/Quality Assurance\nEurGeol Dr. Mark D.
