That’s not the only thing we’re discussing with FOM (Formula One Management),” said Rahimov. “It’s most of the other commercial terms in the contract too.\n“They (Liberty) want to try the new approach too so its a bilateral effort to make this viable for all of us.”\nRahimov hoped everything could be sorted before the end of June: “I think we’ll come to some agreement,” he said.\nA recent economic study carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed Azerbaijan gaining a net economic impact of around $280 million from the race, over two years. The media value was put at an additional $100 million.\nThis year’s race was held in April and for the second year in a row served up a thriller with Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton winning.\nThe 2016 and 2017 grands prix were in June, when the weather is warmer, and Rahimov said that remained the preferred date because three or four months were needed to set everything up on the city streets.\n“If we are in April, then really we have to start in the winter and you have adverse weather, all the rains and winds that stops you from working effectively,” he said. “Ideally we would like to hold the race in June.” Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Christian Radnedge",
