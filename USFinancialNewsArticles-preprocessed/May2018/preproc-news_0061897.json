    "text": "DUEREN, Germany (Reuters) - Deutsche Post DHL ( DPWGn.DE ) could envisage floating its Streetscooter electric van business, which is expanding internationally, on the stock market, but not for another two to three years, an executive said.\nThe production line of the new StreetScooter electric delivery van is pictured during an opening tour in Dueren near Cologne, Germany, May 30, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay “It’s theoretically possible. We’re looking at the next two to three years,” Deutsche Post board member Juergen Gerdes said on Wednesday at the opening of a new production facility.\nSlideshow (11 Images) Deutsche Post developed the Streetscooter for internal use to keep emissions low as online shopping creates more demand for parcel deliveries, but demand from other companies for the van has pushed it to boost production.\nGerdes, however, said that Deutsche Post would not sell its entire stake in the business.\nThe new production site in Dueren, north western Germany, will be able to produce around 10,000 per year and joins another factory in Aachen, allowing the company to double production to 20,000 per year.\nDeutsche Post currently uses over 6,000 Streetscooter vans itself.\nOn Monday, it won a contract to deliver 200 electric trucks to a British company that delivers bottles of milk to homes.\nReporting by Matthias Inverardi; Writing by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Ludwig Burger and Susan Fenton\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
