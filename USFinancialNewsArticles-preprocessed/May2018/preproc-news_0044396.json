S&P 500 e-minis were down 4.5 points, or 0.17 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 25.75 points, or 0.37 percent.\nYields on the 10-year Treasury notes eked out a fresh 7-year highs, continuing a climb that was first triggered by Tuesday’s retail sales data that signaled the U.S. economy is on a stronger footing in the second quarter.\nCoca-Cola rose 1 percent after Barclays upgraded the stock to “overweight.”\nNetEase dropped 9 percent after the Chinese internet company’s first-quarter profit missed Wall Street estimates.\nOn the economic front, data at 8:30 a.m. ET is expect to show initial jobless claims rose 215,000 last week from 211,000 the week before.
