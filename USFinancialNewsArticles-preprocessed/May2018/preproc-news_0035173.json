    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cheniere Energy Partners LP Holdings, LLC (“Cheniere Partners Holdings”) (NYSE American: CQH) announced today that its board of directors has received a proposal from Cheniere Energy, Inc. (“Cheniere”) (NYSE American: LNG) pursuant to which Cheniere would acquire the publicly held shares of Cheniere Partners Holdings not already owned by Cheniere in a stock for stock exchange. Subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, Cheniere is proposing consideration of 0.4500 Cheniere shares for each outstanding publicly-held share of Cheniere Partners Holdings as part of a transaction that would be structured as a merger of Cheniere Partners Holdings with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cheniere. The proposed consideration represents a value of $28.24 per common share of Cheniere Partners Holdings based on the closing price of Cheniere’s shares as of May 16, 2018. The proposed transaction is expected to be a tax-free exchange to Cheniere Partners Holdings’ shareholders.\nCheniere owns approximately 91.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cheniere Partners Holdings.\nThe proposed transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement and approval of such definitive agreement and transactions contemplated thereunder by the board of directors of Cheniere, the board of directors of Cheniere Partners Holdings, and a conflicts committee established by the board of directors of Cheniere Partners Holdings, and the consummation of the proposed transaction would be subject to customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that any such approvals will be forthcoming, that a definitive agreement will be executed, or that any transaction will be consummated.\nAbout Cheniere Partners Holdings\nCheniere Partners Holdings owns an approximately 48.6% limited partner interest in Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (“Cheniere Partners”) (NYSE American: CQP) as of March 31, 2018. Cheniere Partners Holdings’ only business consists of owning Cheniere Partners units and, accordingly, its results of operations and financial condition are dependent on the performance of Cheniere Partners. Cheniere Partners is constructing and operating natural gas liquefaction facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. Cheniere Partners plans to construct up to six natural gas liquefaction trains (“Trains”), which are in various stages of development, construction, and operations. Trains 1 through 4 are operational, Train 5 is under construction, and Train 6 is being commercialized and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place. Each liquefaction train is expected to have a nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 4.5 mtpa of LNG and an adjusted nominal production capacity of approximately 4.3 to 4.6 mtpa of LNG. Cheniere Partners also owns and operates regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Creole Trail Pipeline, which interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines.\nFor additional information, please refer to the Cheniere Partners Holdings website at www.cheniere.com and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements”.
