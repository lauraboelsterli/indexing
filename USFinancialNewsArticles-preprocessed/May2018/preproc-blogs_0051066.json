Gordon.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday spelled out 12 requirements for a new agreement with Tehran that would require a wholesale change in Iran’s military posture in the Middle East.\nIn return for agreeing to an accord on nuclear and regional issues to replace the 2015 Iran nuclear accord from which President Donald Trump withdrew this month, Mr. Pompeo said, the U.S. would lift the punishing economic sanctions it is now moving to impose, restore diplomatic and commercial ties and allow Iran to have access to advanced technology.\nMeanwhile, oil prices again reached for the $80 a barrel threshold Tuesday morning after the U.S. threatened to further tighten the economic sanctions noose on Tehran.\nBrent crude—the global benchmark—was up 0.50% to $79.62 a barrel on London’s Intercontinental Exchange. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading up 0.35% at $72.60 a barrel.\nSMALL OUTAGES HAVE BIG IMPACT ON OIL PRICES\nSmall outages are becoming important because combined with other suspensions of production they create a torrent, but the market can quickly offset those interruptions in output writes Spencer Jakab for Heard on the Street. Investors should keep their eyes trained on Iran and Venezuela—both of which could keep prices high into the early summer.\nMeanwhile, the WSJ’s James Mackintosh says market participants should watch for opportunities in the oil and technology sectors. Since the oil-price low of January 2016, the global oil and tech sectors have both made more than 80%, including dividends, beating the wider market’s 53% return.\nCLIMATE PRESSURE ON SHELL IS WARNING TO OIL INDUSTRY\nInvestors are increasingly putting the onus on big oil firms to take action against climate change, writes The Wall Street Journal’s Sarah Kent.\nThe issue is set to come into focus at Royal Dutch Shell PLC’s annual meeting Tuesday where investors with nearly $8 trillion under management will call on the company to go beyond already ambitious plans to curb emissions, according to a copy of the statement seen by The Wall Street Journal.\nTHE U.S. TARGETS CHINESE STEEL COMING VIA VIETNAM\nThe U.S. on Monday put in place import duties on Chinese steel shipped via Vietnam following a decision that the materials evaded U.S. anti-dumping measures, Reuters reports. The move is part of larger trade dispute between Washington and Beijing which threatens to affect several sectors including the oil industry.\n‘ Places like Mexico and Brazil have created a fair, open fiscal regime where you can bid on certain terms ’\n— Wael Sawan, Shell’s executive vice president for deep water. MAJOR ENERGY COMPANIES EMBRACE LATIN AMERICA\nLatin America is becoming a go-to destination for some of the world’s biggest oil firms, which had previously avoided the region due to fears over a restrictive business climate and the threat of resource nationalism, write the WSJ’s Robbie Whelan, Paulo Trevisani and Bradley Olson.\nExxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and others have flocked to offshore auctions in Mexico and Brazil, fracking prospects in Argentina and big discoveries in the small nation of Guyana.\nLatin America has become one of the few areas in the world outside the U.S. where firms say they can find profitable drilling opportunities. Many countries with significant oil and gas reserves, such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, generally offer their best prospects to their own state oil companies, while U.S. sanctions have put Russia and Iran mostly out of reach.\nFUTURECURVE\nJune 5-6: The London Crude Oil Summit.
