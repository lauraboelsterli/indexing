    "text": "LEESBURG, Va., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- K2M Group Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:KTWO) (the “Company” or “K2M”), a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance ™ , today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary:\nTotal first quarter revenue of $67.9 million, up 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Domestic first quarter revenue of $49.9 million, up 8% year-over-year, comprised of: U.S. Complex Spine growth of 8% year-over-year U.S. Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) growth of 6% year-over-year U.S. Degenerative growth of 9% year-over-year International first quarter revenue of $18.0 million, up 15% year-over-year, and 9% on a constant currency basis. Net loss of $11.4 million for the first quarter, compared to a net loss of $10.9 million in the comparable quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.0 million for the first quarter, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $336,000 in the comparable quarter last year.\nFirst Quarter Product Introductions and Strategic Highlights:\nOn February 26, 2018, the Company announced the licensure of its BACS ® Data Management tool to the International Spine Study Group Foundation (ISSGF) for collecting spine patient data, including patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), as part of the ISSGF’s globally recognized research studies. On March 14, 2018, the Company announced the commercial launch of the YUKON ™ OCT Spinal System at the 34th Annual Meeting of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Section on Disorders of the Spine and Peripheral Nerves (AANS/CNS). At the meeting, the Company also showcased Balance ACS ® or (BACS), a comprehensive platform that applies three-dimensional solutions across the entire clinical care continuum to help drive quality outcomes for spine patients. On March 29, 2018, the Company announced the appointment of Lane Major as Chief Operating Officer, a new position within K2M.\nHighlights Subsequent to Quarter-End:\nOn April 27, 2018, the Company executed an exclusive agency and services agreement to replace its existing exclusive distribution agreement with its partner in Spain and Portugal, Medcomtech, S.A., whereby Medcomtech and K2M extended their partnership through 2024. Pursuant to the agreement, K2M acquired Medcomtech’s spine customer contracts and relationships and its existing K2M product inventory and instrumentation in exchange for certain outstanding receivables from Medcomtech.\nIn addition, Medcomtech will transition from a stocking-based distributor to a commission-based independent sales agency, and K2M will become responsible for and assume risk of billing, collections and inventory management for Medcomtech’s business related to K2M products while Medcomtech will remain focused on sales, marketing and market development activities for these products. Beginning in May, revenue generated by K2M in Spain and Portugal will reflect its supplier relationships at the hospital level as opposed to its prior wholesale relationship with Medcomtech. We believe this revised relationship with Medcomtech represents an opportunity to improve the growth and gross margin profile for Spain and Portugal going forward.\n\"Our first quarter total revenue growth of approximately 10% year-over-year reflect solid trends in the U.S. and stronger-than-expected demand in international markets,\" said Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Major. \"We delivered approximately 8% growth in the United States in Q1—at the high-end of our growth expectations—driven by solid execution against our strategic goal of increasing market share by introducing new and innovative spinal implant solutions like our first-of-its-kind MOJAVE PL 3D Expandable Interbody System featuring Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology and our YUKON OCT Spinal System that can be used with the PALO ALTO Cervical Static Corpectomy Cage System, the first and only static corpectomy cage in the world to receive a cervical 510(k) clearance.\"\nMr. Major continued, \"We have increased our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance expectations to a new range of $283 million to $287 million based on our improved revenue outlook for Spain. We remain confident in our ability to drive above-market growth in the U.S., fueled by our continued focus on leading the spine market by introducing new and innovative spinal implant solutions to help surgeons care for patients around the world who suffer from debilitating spinal pathologies.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThree Months Ended March 31, Increase/Decrease ($, thousands) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change % Change (as reported) (constant currency) United States $49,890 $46,207 $3,683 8.0 % 8.0 % International 17,986 15,678 2,308 14.7 % 9.3 % Total Revenue $67,876 $61,885 $5,991 9.7 % 8.3 % Total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased $6.0 million, or 9.7%, to $67.9 million, compared to $61.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Total revenue increased 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher sales volume from domestic new surgeon users and newer product offerings, and increased set investments by our distribution partners in Latin America.\nRevenue in the United States increased $3.7 million, or 8.0% year-over-year, to $49.9 million, and international revenue increased $2.3 million, or 14.7% year-over-year, to $18.0 million. First quarter 2018 international revenue increased 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency exchange positively impacted first quarter international revenue by $0.8 million, representing approximately 540 basis points of 2018 international growth year-over-year.\nThe following table represents domestic revenue by procedure category.\nThree Months Ended March 31, Increase/Decrease ($, thousands) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Complex Spine $18,513 $17,136 $ 1,377 8.0 % Minimally Invasive 8,375 7,872 503 6.4 % Degenerative 23,002 21,199 1,803 8.5 % U.S. Revenue $49,890 $46,207 $ 3,683 8.0 % By procedure category, U.S. revenue in the Company’s complex spine, MIS and degenerative categories represented 37.1%, 16.8% and 46.1% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased 7.6% to $43.5 million, compared to $40.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 64.0% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 65.3% for the prior year period, a decrease primarily reflecting the mix of sales to our lower margin partners in Latin America this quarter. Gross profit includes amortization expense on investments in surgical instruments of $3.9 million, or 5.7% of sales, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.5 million, or 5.6% of sales, for the comparable period last year.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased $4.0 million, or 8.1%, to $53.5 million, compared to $49.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by a $2.3 million increase in sales and marketing expenses and a $1.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses, compared to the comparable period last year.\nLoss from operations for the first quarter of 2018 increased $0.9 million to $10.0 million compared to a loss from operations of $9.1 million for the first quarter last year. Loss from operations included intangible amortization of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.4 million for the comparable period last year.\nTotal other expenses for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $0.5 million to $1.3 million, compared to $1.8 million last year. The decrease in other expense, net, was primarily attributable to an unrealized gain of $0.5 million from foreign currency remeasurement on intercompany payable balances, compared to unrealized loss of $27,000 in the first quarter last year.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $10.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and equivalents were $17.2 million and outstanding long-term indebtedness included the carrying value of the Convertible Senior Notes of $39.8 million and the capital lease obligation, net of current maturities, of $33.5 million. In addition, the Company also had $7.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $34.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company is updating its fiscal year 2018 expectations for revenue, net loss and adjusted EBITDA:\nThe Company now expects total revenue on an as reported basis in the range of $283.0 million to $287.0 million, representing growth of 10% to 11% year-over-year, compared to total revenue of $258.0 million in fiscal year 2017. Its prior revenue guidance expectations were for total revenue on an as reported basis in a range of $280.0 million to $284.0 million, representing growth of 9% to 10% year-over-year. The Company continues to expect growth in its U.S. business of approximately 10% to 11% year-over-year in 2018. The Company now expects growth in its International business of approximately 11% to 12% year-over-year in 2018, compared to prior guidance expectations for growth of approximately 5% to 7% year-over-year. The Company continues to expect currency to have a positive impact on total revenue in 2018 of approximately $2 million. The Company continues to expect total net loss of $34.0 million to $30.0 million, compared to net loss of $37.1 million in fiscal year 2017. The Company continues to expect an Adjusted EBITDA benefit in the range of $4.0 million to $8.0 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $740,000 in fiscal year 2017.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time on May 1, 2018 to discuss the results of the first quarter, and to host a question and answer session.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures principally as a measure of the Company's operating performance and believes that these measures are useful to investors because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. The Company also believes that these measures are useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-to-period. We calculate constant currency by converting the prior-year results using current-year foreign currency exchange rates.\nAdjusted Gross Profit represents Gross Profit less amortization expense of surgical instruments. The Company presentsAdjusted Gross Profit because it believes it is a useful measure of the Company's gross profit and operating performance because the measure is not burdened by the timing impact of instrument purchases and related amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net loss plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and foreign currency transaction (gain) loss.\nThe Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is a useful indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA principally as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s annual operating budget and financial projections.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect the Company’s cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on its GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. The Company’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of gross profit to adjusted gross profit and net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\nThree Months Ended March 31, $ in thousands 2018 2017 Reconciliation from Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit Gross profit $ 43,457 $ 40,406 Surgical instrument amortization 3,862 3,464 Adjusted gross profit (a Non-GAAP Measure) $ 47,319 $ 43,870\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Reconciliations from Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (11,398 ) $ (10,873 ) Interest expense 1,782 1,732 Income tax expense 77 42 Depreciation and amortization 5,546 7,195 Stock-based compensation expense 1,451 1,541 Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (478 ) 27 Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP measure) $ (3,020 ) $ (336 ) The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for our 2018 guidance:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2018 Net loss $ (32,000 ) Interest expense 8,500 Income tax expense 100 Depreciation and amortization 23,000 Stock-based compensation expense 6,400 Foreign currency transaction gain —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 6,000 The reconciliation assumes the mid-point of the Adjusted EBITDA range and the mid-point of each component of the reconciliation, corresponding to guidance of $4.0 million to $8.0 million for 2018.\nSource:K2M Group Holdings, Inc.",
