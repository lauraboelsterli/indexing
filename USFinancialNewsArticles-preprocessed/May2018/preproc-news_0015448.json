    "text": "(Reuters) - Justify won the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville on Saturday, becoming the first horse since Apollo in 1882 to win the ‘Run for the Roses’ without a start as a two-year-old.\nMay 5, 2018; Louisville, KY, USA; Mike Smith aboard Justify (7) beats Javier Castellano aboard Audible (5) to the finish line to win the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. Mandatory Credit: Mark Zerof-USA TODAY Sports Unfazed by the sloppy track on a rainy Derby day, the 5/2 favorite rocketed out of the gate and was neck and neck with longshot Promises Fulfilled before jockey Mike Smith pushed the Chestnut colt into gear to record the comfortable win and break the “Curse of Apollo”.\nRelated Coverage Derby winner Justify will go for Preakness title “It will take a horse like him to break that curse and just wow, he’s just something else,” said Smith, who also won the race in 2005 on Giacomo.\nMay 5, 2018; Louisville, KY, USA; Mike Smith aboard Justify (7) in the winner's circle during the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. Mandatory Credit: Mark Zerof-USA TODAY Sports “He’s got unbelievable talent and then he’s got a mind to go with it. For such a young horse he is just so big and talented,” he added of Justify, which has won all four of its starts.\nSlideshow (8 Images) Good Magic finished second in the first leg of U.S. thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown series for three-year-olds, with Audible third.\nThe victory is the fifth for Justify trainer Bob Baffert, who also trained 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.\n“He was doing it easy,” Baffert said.\n“Him and American Pharoah and Arrogate, these horse are cut different ... I rank him up there with my top ones.”The win marks the sixth consecutive year where the favorite has won the race despite this year’s field being seen as the most competitive in recent years.\nMendelssohn, the Aidan O’Brien-trained colt looking to be the first European-based horse to win the Derby, collided into other horses shortly after the break and never recovered, finishing last.\nThe win came on the rainiest day in the race’s history with nearly three inches falling on the dirt track prior to the race, though the wet weather did little to dampen the enthusiasm of the 157,813 in attendance.\nReporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Peter Rutherford\n ",
