    "text": "Colonoscopies are never fun. But they are necessary to help catch colon cancer.\nNow the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new drug that could make preparation for the screening easier.\nCalled Plenvu, this liquid drug is designed to replace the traditional, poor-tasting bowel cleaning liquid that patients drink to prep their systems for a colonoscopy. The drug will allow patients take less liquid and still prepare for the screening.\nRead more from USA Today:\nRomaine lettuce: Why it's hard to keep it safe from E. coli and other bacteria\nDid Dish Network telemarketer call you?

It estimates over 97,000 cases of colon cancer and over 43,000 cases of rectal cancer will emerge in the U.S. this year, with over 50,000 deaths expected as a result of colorectal cancer.\nSalix says that the new drug will be available in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2018.\nshow chapters This pen will let surgeons detect cancer in seconds 1:14 PM ET Thu, 22 March 2018 | 01:18",
