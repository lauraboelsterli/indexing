Cycling – the 101st Giro d'Italia cycling race – The 167-km Stage 2 from Haifa to Tel Aviv, Israel - May 5, 2018 - Team Quick-Step rider Elia Viviani of Italy celebrates winning the 2nd stage in Tel Aviv, Israel. REUTERS/Nir Keidar\nSam Bennett, of Bora-Hansgrohe, was in the lead with a kilometre to go but Viviani showcased his impressive power once again to close in on the Irishman before the final corner and crossed the finish line first.\nViviani, who won the second stage after a similar comeback on Saturday, finished ahead of Sacha Modolo (Cannondale-Drapac) and Bennett had to settle for third.\nJakub Mareczko (Wilier Triestina-Selle Italia) and Danny van Poppel (Lotto NL - Jumbo) rounded out the top five. Slideshow (2 Images)\nIsrael Cycling Academy’s Guillaume Boivin was cheered on by the home crowd as the Canadian, along with Marco Frapporti (Androni Giocattoli-Sidermec) and Enrico Barbin (Bardiani-CSF), led the race from the start.\nThe trio were swept up by the peloton in the closing stages and finished well behind the top 10 in the last stage to be held in Israel.\nRohan Dennis retains the overall leader’s pink jersey while Barbin retains the blue jersey after he was second-fastest to reach the summit of this stage’s Cat 4 climb.
