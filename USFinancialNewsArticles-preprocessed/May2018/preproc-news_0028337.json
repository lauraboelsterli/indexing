    "text": "BOGOTA (Reuters) - Right-wing candidate Ivan Duque held a healthy lead over rivals ahead of Colombia’s presidential election on May 27, with 34 percent of voters saying they planned to back him, a survey by Cifras y Conceptos showed on Thursday.\nColombian presidential candidate Ivan Duque is seen in an elevator after a campaign event in Bogota, Colombia May 10, 2018. REUTERS/Jaime Saldarriaga Support for Duque, a protégé of former President Alvaro Uribe, fell 1.5 points from its last survey in April, and was below numbers from other opinion polls.\nLeftist candidate Gustavo Petro, a former M-19 rebel and former mayor of Bogota, was in second place with 22.5 percent, down 1.5 points from the last survey and down 12.5 points compared with a recent poll by Centro Nacional de Consultoria (CNC).\nCentrist Sergio Fajardo was third with 13.8 percent and support for center-right German Vargas Lleras was 13.2 percent.\nReporting by Bogota newsroom, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ",
