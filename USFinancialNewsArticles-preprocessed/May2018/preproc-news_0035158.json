    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian leader Anwar Ibrahim said on Wednesday that he would give full support to the government led by former rival Mahathir Mohamad, but would not immediately be part of it.\nMalaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim gives a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin “I have given my assurance, I am here as a concerned citizen to give complete support to manage the country on the understanding that we are committed to the reform agenda, beginning with the judiciary, media and the entire apparatus,” Anwar said in a news conference at his home after he was freed from custody.\nAnwar said it was Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s prerogative to form the cabinet, but noted he had given assurances that he will consult party leaders.\nAnwar said he would take some time off with his family. “I’ve told Tun Mahathir, I don’t need to serve in the cabinet for now,” he said, using an honorofic for the prime minister.\nReporting by Joseph Sipalan and Tom Westbrook; Editing by Preveen Menon and Raju Gopalakrishnan\n ",
