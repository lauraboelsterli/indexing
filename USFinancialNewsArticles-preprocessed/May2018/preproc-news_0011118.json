    "text": "Record Recurring Revenues of $236.6 million, Up by 25% Record Total Revenues of $276.8 million, Up by 21%\nWESTON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ultimate Software (Nasdaq: ULTI), a leading provider of human capital management (HCM) solutions in the cloud, announced today our financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Ultimate reported recurring revenues of $236.6 million, a 25% increase, and total revenues of $276.8 million, a 21% increase, both compared with 2017’s first quarter. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $21.0 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, as compared with GAAP net income of $7.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $40.5 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, as compared with non-GAAP net income for 2017’s first quarter of $22.9 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. For further discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures, see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below.\n“Our first quarter results were a great start for 2018. They kept us on pace to achieve our 2018 goals and laid a solid foundation for our future,” said Scott Scherr, founder, president, and CEO. “Recurring revenues were up by nearly 25% to approximately $237 million and total revenues were up by 21% to $277 million, both ahead of expectations, and our non-GAAP operating margin was also higher than expectations at 20%. Our year-over-year customer retention rate remained at what we believe to be a large-company, HCM industry high of approximately 96%.\n“In February, Ultimate was honored to be named #3 on Fortune and Great Place to Work’s prestigious 2018 list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. This is our seventh consecutive year in the top 25. This month, we were equally proud to be ranked #2 on the Best Workplaces in Canada list by Great Place to Work, and #4 on Workforce Magazine’s Workforce 100, our highest ranking ever on this list and the highest in our industry. The Workforce 100 evaluates companies from all over the world for HR management, and this year’s list includes such respected companies as Amazon, Nike, Apple, and Netflix.\n“In mid-March, we had a record of nearly 4,000 HR and business professionals, partners, and industry analysts join us in Las Vegas for Connections, our annual customer conference, where we had the opportunity to thank and honor our customers, and to celebrate our people-focused technologies and practices that are transforming the HR community,” added Scherr.\nUltimate’s financial results teleconference will be held today, May 1, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, at www.investorcalendar.com/event/20306 . The call will be available for replay at the same address beginning at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time today. Windows Media Player software is required to listen to the call and can be downloaded from the site. Forward-looking information about future company performance will be discussed during the teleconference call.\nFinancial Highlights\nRecurring revenues from our cloud offering grew by 25% for the first quarter of 2018 over the same period in 2017. Recurring revenues were 85% of total revenues for 2018’s first quarter, as compared with 83% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2017. Ultimate’s total revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 21%, versus those for 2017’s first quarter. Ultimate’s annualized retention rate, on a rolling 12-month basis, was approximately 96% for our recurring revenue cloud customer base as of March 31, 2018. Cash flows from operating activities for 2018’s first quarter were $56.6 million, compared with $46.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow was $33.7 million as of March 31, 2018, compared with $23.6 million as of March 31, 2017. Our free cash flow margins expanded to 12.2% for the first quarter of 2018, from 10.3% for the first quarter of 2017.\nStock Repurchases\nThe combination of cash, cash equivalents, and corporate marketable securities was $147.9 million as of March 31, 2018, compared with $165.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we used $50.3 million to acquire 221,983 shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value common stock (“Common Stock”) to settle employees’ tax withholding obligations associated with their restricted stock that vested during the period. We have 1,342,005 shares available for repurchase under our Stock Repurchase Plan.\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018:\nRecurring revenues of approximately $237 to $239 million, Total revenues of approximately $267 to $269 million, and Operating margin, on a non-GAAP basis (discussed below), to exceed 20%.\nFor the year 2018:\nRecurring revenues to increase in excess of 20% over 2017, Total revenues to increase in excess of 18% over 2017, and Operating margin, on a non-GAAP basis (discussed below), to exceed 21%.\nOperating margin expectations were determined on a non-GAAP basis using the methodologies identified under the caption “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” in this press release.\nWe have not reconciled our forward-looking operating margin on a non-GAAP basis to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. Such reconciliation would require unreasonable effort at this time to estimate and quantify with a reasonable degree of certainty various necessary GAAP components, including, for example, those related to stock-based compensation or others that may arise during the year. In particular, stock-based compensation is impacted by factors that are outside of the Company’s control and can be difficult to predict. The actual amount of stock-based compensation expense, for the year ending December 31, 2018, will have a significant impact on our operating margin on a GAAP basis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release are, and certain statements on the teleconference call may be, forward-looking statements within the meaning provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date hereof.
