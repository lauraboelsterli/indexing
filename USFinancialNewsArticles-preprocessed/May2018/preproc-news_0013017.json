    "text": "BILLERICA, Mass., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conformis, Inc. (NASDAQ:CFMS), a medical technology company that uses its proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell joint replacement implants that are customized to fit each patient's unique anatomy, announced today financial results ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 Summary\nTotal revenue of $19.7 million, down 4% year-over-year on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis Product revenue of $19.5 million, down 4% year-over-year on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis\n• U.S. product revenue of $16.0 million, consistent year-over-year\n• Rest of World product revenue of $3.5 million, down 22% year-over-year on a reported basis and 30% year-over-year on a constant currency basis Gross margin of 45%, an increase of 1,300 basis points year-over-year\n\"As reported earlier, our first quarter revenue of $19.7 million was consistent with our revenue guidance. We continue to make progress in the US while facing headwinds in our OUS business due to reimbursement challenges,” said Mark Augusti, President and Chief Executive Officer of Conformis, Inc. “Importantly, our gross margin - which is a key imperative for us - increased to 45% for the quarter, a 1,300 basis point increase over the same quarter last year. This gross margin improvement is a reflection of our operational execution and we believe positions us well for the remainder of 2018.”\nThree months ended March 31, Increase/(decrease) ($, in thousands) 2018 2017 $\nChange %\nChange %\nChange (as reported) (constant currency) United States $ 16,027 $ 15,964 $ 63 — % — Rest of world 3,456 4,415 (959 ) (22)% (30)% Product revenue 19,483 20,379 (896 ) (4 )% (6 )% Royalty revenue 173 76 97 128 % 128 % Total revenue $ 19,656 $ 20,455 $ (799 ) (4 )% (6 )% First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 decreased $0.8 million to $19.7 million, or 4% year-over-year on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis. Total revenue in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 includes royalty revenue of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, related to patent license agreements.\nProduct revenue decreased $0.9 million to $19.5 million, or 4% year-over-year on a reported basis and 6% on constant currency basis. U.S. product revenue remained consistent at $16.0 million year-over-year, and Rest of World product revenue decreased $1.0 million to $3.5 million, or 22% year-over-year on a reported basis and 30% on a constant currency basis. Product revenue from sales of iTotal PS increased $0.7 million to $5.9 million or 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. Product revenue from sales of iTotal CR, iDuo and iUni decreased $1.6 million to $13.6 million, or 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. The decrease in product revenue was primarily in Germany, including the partial knee reimbursement rate change and weakness in iTotal CR sales.\nTotal gross profit increased $2.3 million to $8.8 million, or 45% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.5 million, or 32% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. This 1,300 basis point increase in gross margin year-over-year was driven mostly by cost reductions as a result of vertical integration and manufacturing efficiencies and higher year-over-year average selling prices, partly due to a favorable foreign exchange impact.\nTotal operating expenses decreased $2.6 million to $21.2 million, or 11% year-over-year. This decrease in expenses was driven primarily by a reduction in general and administrative expense.\nNet loss was $12.0 million, or $0.22 per basic share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $17.2 million, or $0.40 per basic share, for the same period last year. Net loss per basic share calculations assume weighted-average basic shares outstanding of 54.7 million of 2018, compared to 42.9 million for the same period last year.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled $57.3 million, compared to $45.2 million as of December 31, 2017. On January 29, 2018, the Company closed its follow on public offering of Company common stock, in which the Company received $23 million in gross proceeds, or $21.6 million in net proceeds, before legal and accounting expenses, from the sale of 15,333,333 shares of the Company’s common stock. This included an offering of 13.3 million shares of stock plus the exercise by our underwriters of the full overallotment, or Greenshoe, of 2 million shares.\nNote on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company provides certain information regarding the Company's financial results or projected financial results on a non-GAAP \"constant currency basis.\" This information estimates the impact of changes in foreign currency rates on the translation of the Company's current or projected future period financial results as compared to the applicable comparable period.
