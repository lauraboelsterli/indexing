J.Crew brand sales continue to sequentially improve toward positive comp, and Madewell had a record quarter with a 31% comp increase,\" said Jim Brett, Chief Executive Officer. \"Most significantly, for the first time since 2014, the Company achieved comparable sales growth. As our strategy continues to unfold, we will deliver an expanded and enhanced product range along with the launch of a data-driven personalization engine and point-based loyalty program, culminating in the J.Crew brand relaunch in September, just in time for the most important fall and holiday seasons.\"\nBalance Sheet highlights:\nCash and cash equivalents were $36.0 million compared to $104.6 million at the end of the first quarter last year. The cash balance at the end of the first quarter this year reflects the payment of transaction costs of $35.2 million and debt repayments pursuant to the refinancing of $27.0 million. Inventories increased 6% to $345.3 million from $325.0 million at the end of the first quarter last year. Total debt, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was $1,711 million compared to $1,503 million at the end of the first quarter last year. On July 13, 2017, the Company completed a debt exchange and refinancing. For more information, see the section entitled \"Debt Exchange and Refinancing\" below. Additionally, there were $42 million of outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility, with excess availability of $219 million, at the end of the first quarter this year. As of the date of this release, there were outstanding borrowings of approximately $27 million under the ABL Facility, with excess availability of approximately $217 million.\nDebt Exchange and Refinancing\nOn July 13, 2017, the Company completed the following interrelated liability management transactions:\nPrivate Exchange Offer. An exchange offer in which $565.7 million principal outstanding of 7.75%/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2019 issued by the Company's parent were exchanged for (i) $249.6 million of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the \"Exchange Notes\") and (ii) shares of preferred and common stock of the Company's parent. Term Loan Amendment. An amendment of the Company's term loan credit facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\") to, among other things, facilitate the following related transactions: the repayment of $150.5 million principal amount then outstanding under the Term Loan Facility; the transfer of the remaining undivided ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand to a subsidiary of the Company which, together with the undivided ownership interest transferred in December 2016, represent 100% of the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand, and the execution of related license agreements; the issuance of $97.0 million principal amount of an additional series of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021, subject to the same terms and conditions as the Exchange Notes, for cash at a 3% discount, the proceeds of which were loaned to the Company and were applied, in part, to finance the repayment of the $150.5 million principal amount of term loans referenced above; and the raising of additional borrowings under the Term Loan Facility of $30.0 million, for cash at a 2% discount, provided by the Company's sponsors, the net proceeds of which were also applied, in part, to finance the repayment of the $150.5 million principal amount of term loans referenced above.\nFor more information on the Private Exchange Offer and Term Loan Amendment, see the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 5, 2018.\nRevenue Recognition\nAt the beginning of fiscal 2018, the Company adopted a pronouncement that clarified the principles of revenue recognition and standardized a comprehensive model for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers. The adoption was applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, with the cumulative effect of all fiscal years prior to those periods presented recorded to retained earnings. For more information on the adoption of the pronouncement, see the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 5, 2018.\nHow the Company Assesses the Performance of its Business\nIn assessing the performance of its business, the Company considers a variety of performance and financial measures. A key measure used in its evaluation is comparable company sales, which includes (i) net sales from stores that have been open for at least 12 months, (ii) e-commerce net sales, and (iii) shipping and handling fees. Due to the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017, when calculating comparable company sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company realigned the weeks of the first quarter last year to be consistent with the current year retail calendar.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis announcement includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. An explanation of the manner in which the Company uses adjusted EBITDA and an associated reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures is included in Exhibit (3).\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss first quarter results is scheduled for today, May 30, 2018, at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

The Company believes the presentation of this measure will enhance the ability of its investors to analyze trends in its business, evaluate its performance relative to other companies in the industry, and evaluate its ability to service debt.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and therefore, differences may exist in the manner in which other companies calculate this measure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to (i) net income, as a measure of operating performance, or (ii) cash flows, as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation to, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Company's results as measured in accordance with GAAP.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jcrew-group-inc-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-2018-results-300656771.html\nSOURCE J.Crew Group, Inc.",
