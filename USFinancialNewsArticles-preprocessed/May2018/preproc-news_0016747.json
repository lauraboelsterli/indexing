    "text": "ATLANTA, Veritiv Corporation (NYSE: VRTV), a North American leader in business-to-business distribution solutions, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We are off to a good start in 2018,\" said Mary Laschinger, Chairman and CEO of Veritiv Corporation. \"Looking ahead, we expect growth in Packaging and Facility Solutions to offset the secular challenges being experienced in our Print and Publishing segments, keeping us on target for our 2018 commitments.\"\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017:\nNet sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 5.3% from the prior year. Net sales increased 4.9% from the prior year, excluding the positive effect of foreign currency (0.4%) in the first quarter of 2018. Net loss was $(15.8) million, compared to net loss of $(2.2) million in the prior year. Net integration, acquisition and restructuring charges were $20.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $10.5 million in the prior year. Basic and diluted loss per share were $(1.00) compared to $(0.14) in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $29.7 million, a decrease of 0.3% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 1.4%, a decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year.\n\"We recently completed our third multi-state operating system conversion, and it has been, like the others, a smooth transition. Overall, our operating system conversions remain on track to be substantially complete by the end of 2018,\" said Stephen Smith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Veritiv Corporation.\nVeritiv Corporation will host a live conference call and webcast today, May 8, 2018, at 10 a.m. (ET) to discuss its first quarter financial results.

In addition, the credit agreement governing our asset-based lending facility permits us to exclude the foregoing and other charges in calculating \"Consolidated EBITDA\", as defined in the facility. We approximate foreign currency effects by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not an alternative measure of financial performance under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by, and not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, we consider and evaluate non-GAAP measures in connection with a review of the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures and to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Please see the following tables for reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nTable I\nVERITIV CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nNET LOSS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA; ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN\n(in millions, unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet loss\n$\n(15.8)\n$\n(2.2)\nInterest expense, net\n9.3\n6.4\nIncome tax benefit\n(1.9)\n(1.4)\nDepreciation and amortization\n14.4\n13.1\nEBITDA\n6.0\n15.9\nRestructuring charges, net\n11.9\n4.1\nStock-based compensation\n5.6\n3.7\nLIFO reserve increase (decrease)\n5.7\n(2.5)\nNon-restructuring asset impairment charges\n—\n0.7\nNon-restructuring severance charges\n1.3\n0.5\nNon-restructuring pension charges, net\n(0.7)\n—\nIntegration and acquisition expenses\n8.3\n6.4\nFair value adjustment on Tax Receivable Agreement\ncontingent liability\n(0.2)\n0.9\nFair value adjustment on contingent consideration\nliability\n(8.3)\n—\nOther\n0.1\n0.1\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n29.7\n$\n29.8\nNet sales\n$\n2,101.0\n$\n1,994.6\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales\n1.4\n%\n1.5\n%\n with multimedia: releases/veritiv-announces-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300644128.html\nSOURCE Veritiv Corporation",
