    "text": "Comments\nCAIRO (Reuters) – A navy chariot that belonged to historical Egypt’s boy-king, Tutankhamen, has been moved to a brand new museum close to the Pyramids that Cairo hopes will assist deliver vacationers again to the nation.\nThe chariot, constituted of Lebanese cedar wooden and animal pores and skin, had been on show at Egypt’s Military Museum in Cairo since 1987. But antiquities authorities have determined to place all artefacts discovered within the younger king’s tomb in Luxor in 1922 on show collectively at Cairo’s Grand Egyptian Museum.\n“The military chariot that arrived today from the military museum is King Tutankhamen’s sixth chariot,” stated museum director Tarek Sayed Tawfik.\nHe stated six chariots had been discovered at Tutankhamen’s tomb, some for ceremonies, some for looking and one lighter and quicker than the remaining for struggle. This had been stored on the Military Museum.\n“For the first time, inside the Grand Egyptian Museum, these chariots will be displayed together,” Tawfik stated.\nKing Tut dominated Egypt as pharaoh for 10 years till his loss of life at age 19, round 1324 B.C.\nThe navy chariot was taken in packing containers from the museum on the Cairo Citadel, to its new house simply past the Great Pyramids of Giza, which is ready to be the world’s largest archaeological museum.\nThe tourism sector is one among Egypt’s primary sources of overseas foreign money but it surely has struggled since a 2011 rebellion that led the then President Hosni Mubarak to step down. But there are indicators that vacationers are starting to return.\nAn Egyptian official stated in January the variety of vacationers in 2017 jumped 54 % to eight.three million, in comparison with a 12 months earlier. The determine compares with 14.7 million in 2010 earlier than the rebellion. Reporting by Mohamed Zaki; Editing by Sami Aboudi and Matthew Mpoke Bigg ",
