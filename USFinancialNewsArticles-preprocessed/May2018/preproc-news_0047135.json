    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 5:35 PM / Updated 30 minutes ago SNCF exploring sell-down of stakes in two subsidiaries: Les Echos Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nPARIS (Reuters) - France’s state-run rail company SNCF is exploring selling down its stakes in two subsidiaries, hire car start-up Ouicar and car-sharing platform iDVroom, business newspaper Les Echos reported on Thursday.\nLes Echos said SNCF had mandated investment bank Rothschild with testing the market and identifying potential investors.\nA spokesman for SNCF said he could not immediately confirm the report and declined further comment.\nLes Echos cited a source saying SNCF was prepared to cede control of the two subsidiaries but that there was no question of completely divesting from both.\nSNCF paid 28 million euros ($32.8 million) for a 75 percent stake in Ouicar in 2015. Ouicar provides a platform for drivers to hire a car from private owners, rather than through hire car companies.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron is locked in a battle with rail unions over his plans to create a leaner, more efficient SNCF that could better stand up to foreign competition once its monopoly ends.\nUnions say the reform is a first step towards privatization. Macron’s government says it has no plans to open the rail company up to private capital. Reporting by Elizabeth Pineay; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Dale Hudson",
