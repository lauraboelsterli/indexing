    "text": "QUEBEC CITY, May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Komet Resources Inc. (“Komet” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:KMT) announces appointments for the following executive positions effective May 14, 2018:\nMr. Werner Claessens as President and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Pascal Van Osta as Vice-president Exploration and Chief Operating Officer; Mr. Étienne Courchesne as Chief Financial Officer.\nMr. Claessens and Mr. Van Osta are professional geologists and collectively have over 70 years of experience in gold and base metal exploration in West Africa and the Guyana Shield of South America. During their parallel careers they achieved several successes as part of the teams that discovered Sadiola Hill and Morila gold deposits in Mali, Samira Hill in Niger, Youga in Burkina Faso and Agbaou Hill in Côte d’Ivoire, all of which became producing mines. More recently they focused on the world class gold-copper Toroparu project in Guyana, which is now at the feasibility stage. Mr. Claessens experience has been more focussed on management and development of large projects whereas Mr. Van Osta’s strength is focussed on exploration and operations. Both are Professional Geologists with Master’s degrees and are registered with the European Federation of Geologists.\nMr. Étienne Courchesne (CPA, CA) has over 15 years of experience in public company financial reporting, more recently in the mining industry. He is a graduate of Hautes-Études Commerciales (HEC) in Montreal in accounting, earning his CA designation in 2002. Prior to joining Komet, Mr. Courchesne was Corporate controller of Stornoway Diamond Corporation, who operates a successful diamond mine in Northern Québec.\nThe Company would also like to announce the appointment of Mr. Claessens to the Board of Directors to replace Mr. Marcel Robillard, who has resigned from the Board to focus on the growth of Puma Exploration. Mr. Robillard is sincerely thanked for his services to Komet Resources since its inception.\nMr. Robert Wares, Chairman of Komet, commented: “We are very pleased to add Mrs. Claessens, Van Osta and Courchesne to the executive team of the Company. They bring tremendous professional experience in managing and executing exploration projects, especially West African projects, and have proven capacity to bring any worthwhile mineral discovery to production stage.”\nMore information about the corporation is available at: http://kometgold.com .\nChairman of the board: Robert P.
