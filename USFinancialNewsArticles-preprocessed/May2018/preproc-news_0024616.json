    "text": "-- Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. ET --\nSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ® (Nasdaq:PTLA) today reported financial results for the three months and provided a corporate update.\n“We achieved several major manufacturing and regulatory milestones this past year, including last week’s U.S. approval of Andexxa ® . We are now concentrating the Company’s efforts on the successful launch of Andexxa and Bevyxxa ® , which both have the potential to impact public health and become standards of care in the field of thrombosis,” said Bill Lis, chief executive officer of Portola. “We are also encouraged by interim data for our next compound for hematologic cancers, cerdulatinib, which will be presented next month at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting. Together, these three compounds comprise a leading thrombosis and hematology portfolio, all with global rights.”\nRecent Achievements, Upcoming Events and Milestones\nAndexxa [coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo] – antidote for the reversal of the Factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban.\nAndexxa received Accelerated Approval from the FDA on May 3, 2018 for patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Earned an additional $100 million milestone payment from the Company’s royalty-based financing with Health Care Royalty Partners based on the FDA approval of Andexxa in May 2018. Early Supply Program to launch in June with broader commercial launch anticipated in early 2019, upon FDA approval of the Generation 2 product. Presented interim data from the ongoing Phase 3b/4 ANNEXA-4 study in a late-breaking clinical trial presentation at the American College of Cardiology’s 67th Annual Scientific Session & Expo (ACC.18). Enrollment on track for completion this summer. Received a positive CHMP trend vote and working with regulatory authorities to address their accompanying request for additional data. Built significant Generation 2 product inventory to meet broad demand upon regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe.\nBevyxxa (betrixaban) – oral, once-daily Factor Xa inhibitor approved for extended prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acute medically ill patients with risk factors for VTE.\nInitiated U.S. commercial launch and continued to expand the field force and market access teams. Additional results from the APEX trial published in the American Heart Journal and the American Journal of Medicine continue to highlight betrixaban’s effect on symptomatic VTE and VTE-related deaths. Eight abstracts accepted at the upcoming International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) meetings.\nCerdulatinib – an oral, dual-spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor in development for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell and other T-cell malignancies in patients who have failed multiple therapies.\nCompleted enrollment in two of four cohorts of the ongoing Phase 2a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of cerdulatinib in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell and T-cell malignancies who have failed multiple therapies. Interim results from the ongoing Phase 2a study accepted for presentation at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. Received initial feedback from the FDA on the potential regulatory pathway.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.6 million, compared with $5.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. This includes $6.0 million in collaboration and license revenue earned under Portola’s collaboration and license agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer, Bayer Pharma, Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Daiichi Sankyo, as well as $0.6 million in product revenue from initial sales of Bevyxxa, which was launched in the U.S. in January 2018.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $91.9 million, compared with $45.7 million for the same period in 2017. Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 included $11.0 million in stock-based compensation expense, compared with $9.0 million for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were $60.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $30.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is due to the second Generation 2 commercial manufacturing campaign. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $31.5 million, compared with $15.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase is due to the build-out of the field force and marketing spend for the Bevyxxa launch.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Portola reported a net loss of $84.2 million, or $1.28 net loss per share, compared with a net loss of $41.7 million, or $0.74 net loss per share, for the same period in 2017.
