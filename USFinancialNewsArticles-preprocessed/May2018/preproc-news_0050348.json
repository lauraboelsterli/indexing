GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Trump casts doubt on planned summit with North Korean leader U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was a \"substantial chance\" his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not take place as planned on June 12 amid concerns that Kim is resistant to giving up his nuclear weapons. • Japan's manufacturing growth cools to 9-month low in May - flash PMI Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the slowest pace in nine months in May as new orders cooled, a preliminary survey showed on Wednesday, signalling a softening in domestic demand that could hamper an economic rebound. • Trump floats management changes instead of sanctions for China's ZTE U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday floated a plan to fine ZTE, and shake up its management as his administration considered rolling back more severe penalties that have crippled the Chinese telecommunications company. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading down 0.2 percent at 10,524.00. • Indian government bonds are likely to trade little changed ahead of the release of minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting later today. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.79 percent-7.84 percent band today. • The Indian rupee is expected to open lower against the dollar, in-line with weakness in most regional currencies, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s May meeting minutes release. Renewed concerns over U.S. and China trade matters also weighed on demand for regional assets. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks ended lower on Tuesday, weighed down by lingering uncertainty over the outcome of trade talks between the United States and China and declines in energy and industrial shares. • Asian shares edged up but investors were cautious after U.S. President Donald Trump tempered optimism over progress made so far in trade talks between the world's two largest economies. • The dollar inched higher versus a basket of currencies, with investors awaiting minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting for hints on the pace of further U.S. monetary tightening. • The U.S. Treasury Department sold $33 billion in two-year notes to fair demand on Tuesday, the first sale of $99 billion in coupon-bearing supply this week. • Oil prices edged lower as the market took a breather on expectations OPEC may raise supplies as early as June, although geopolitical risks kept a floor under the market. • Gold prices rose amid a steady dollar and uncertainty over the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks, while investors waited for minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting for clues on the outlook for U.S. interest rates.
