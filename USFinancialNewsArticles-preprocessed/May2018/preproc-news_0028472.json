    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told Iran’s president that she supports maintaining a big-power nuclear accord, following the withdrawal of the United States, as long as Tehran upholds its side of the deal, her office said on Thursday.\nFILE PHOTO - German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks during the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the \"Women's Union\" of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Frankfurt, Germany, May 5, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski In a telephone call with Hassan Rouhani, Merkel called for talks to be held in a broader format on Iran’s ballistic missile program and its regional activities - including in Syria and Yemen, her office said in a statement.\nShe condemned overnight attacks by Iranian forces on Israeli military positions in the Golan Heights, and called on Iran to contribute to de-escalation in the region, the statement added.\nReporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Kevin Liffey\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
