    "text": "HOUSTON, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES) (\"WES\" or the \"Partnership\") and Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (NYSE: WGP) (\"WGP\") today announced first-quarter 2018 financial and operating results.\nWESTERN GAS PARTNERS, LP\nNet income (loss) available to limited partners for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $65.9 million, or $0.38 per common unit (diluted), with first-quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $272.1 million and first-quarter 2018 Distributable cash flow (1) of $231.4 million.\nWES previously declared a quarterly distribution of $0.935 per unit for the first quarter of 2018. This distribution represented a 2% increase over the prior quarter's distribution and a 7% increase over the first-quarter 2017 distribution. The first-quarter 2018 Coverage ratio (1) of 1.05 times was based on the quarterly distribution of $0.935 per unit.\n\"Our first quarter results highlight the sustained growth in the DJ and Delaware Basins,\" said Chief Executive Officer, Benjamin Fink. \"We and Anadarko continue to execute the largest midstream capital program in our history, and I am pleased to report that the program remains on schedule. We continue to anticipate a significant acceleration of Delaware Basin volumes during the second half of this year.\"\nThe Partnership also announced that it has secured the right to participate in two long haul crude pipelines from the Permian Basin: a 20% interest in Enterprise's Midland-to-Sealy pipeline and up to a 15% interest in Plains' Cactus II pipeline from West Texas to Corpus Christi.\n(1) Please see the tables at the end of this release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures and calculation of the Coverage ratio.\n\"These projects are outstanding business opportunities given our outlook for Permian Basin oil production relative to takeaway capacity,\" said Mr. Fink. \"We are updating our 2018 outlook for capital expenditures, including equity investments, to a range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion to reflect our expected participation in these projects. Furthermore, we expect to fund our capital program without accessing the equity capital markets while maintaining investment grade credit metrics.\"\nTotal throughput attributable to WES for natural gas assets for the first quarter of 2018 averaged 3.6 Bcf/d, which was 5% above the prior quarter and 8% below the first quarter of 2017. Total throughput for crude oil, NGL and produced water assets for the first quarter of 2018 averaged 258 MBbls/d, which was 8% above the prior quarter and 53% above the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to throughput from the DBM water systems, which commenced operation during the second quarter of 2017.\nCapital expenditures attributable to WES, including equity investments but excluding acquisitions, totaled $298.2 million on a cash basis and $323.4 million on an accrual basis during the first quarter of 2018, with maintenance capital expenditures on a cash basis of $16.4 million.\nWESTERN GAS EQUITY PARTNERS, LP\nWGP indirectly owns the entire general partner interest in WES, 100% of the incentive distribution rights in WES and 50,132,046 WES common units. Net income (loss) available to limited partners for 2018 totaled $101.0 million, or $0.46 per common unit (diluted).\nWGP previously declared a quarterly distribution of $0.56875 per unit for the first quarter of 2018. This distribution represented a 4% increase over the prior quarter's distribution and a 16% increase over the first-quarter 2017 distribution. WGP received distributions from WES of $125.3 million attributable to the first quarter of 2018 and will pay $124.5 million in distributions for the same period.\nCONFERENCE CALL TOMORROW AT 11 A.M. CDT\nWES and WGP will host a joint conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time (12:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time) to discuss first-quarter 2018 results.

A replay of the conference call will also be available on the website for two weeks following the call.\nWestern Gas Partners, LP (\"WES\") is a growth-oriented Delaware master limited partnership formed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to acquire, own, develop and operate midstream assets.

In addition, in its capacity as a processor of natural gas, WES also buys and sells natural gas, NGLs and condensate on behalf of itself and as agent for its producer customers under certain of its contracts.\nWestern Gas Equity Partners, LP (\"WGP\") is a Delaware master limited partnership formed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to own the following types of interests in WES: (i) the general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in WES, both owned through WGP's 100% ownership of WES's general partner, and (ii) a significant limited partner interest in WES.\nFor more information about Western Gas Partners, LP and Western Gas Equity Partners, LP, please visit www.westerngas.com .\nThis news release contains . WES and WGP's management believes that their expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. No assurance, however, can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. A number of factors could cause actual results to the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this news release. These factors include the ability to meet financial guidance or distribution growth expectations; the ability to safely and efficiently operate WES's assets; the supply of, demand for, and price of oil, natural gas, NGLs and related products or services; the ability to meet projected in-service dates for capital growth projects; construction costs or capital expenditures exceeding estimated or budgeted costs or expenditures; and the other factors described in the \"Risk Factors\" sections of WES's and WGP's most recent Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in their other public filings and press releases.

VandenBrand\nDirector, Investor Relations\njon.vandenbrand@anadarko.com\n832.636.6000\nWestern Gas Partners, LP Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nBelow are reconciliations of (i) net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (GAAP) to WES's Distributable cash flow (non-GAAP), (ii) net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (GAAP) and net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") (non-GAAP), and (iii) operating income (loss) (GAAP) to Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (\"Adjusted gross margin\") (non-GAAP), as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management believes that WES's Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin, and Coverage ratio are widely accepted financial indicators of WES's financial performance compared to other publicly traded partnerships and are useful in assessing its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin and Coverage ratio, as defined by WES, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, WES's Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin and Coverage ratio should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP and other applicable performance measures, such as operating income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities.\nWestern Gas Partners, LP Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures,
