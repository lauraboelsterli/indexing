    "text": "May 14, 2018 / 1:11 PM / Updated 30 minutes ago Shell, Eni trial on Nigeria corruption re-adjourned to June Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMILAN (Reuters) - The trial of top executives from oil majors Eni ( ENI.MI ) and Shell ( RDSa.L ) over alleged corruption in Nigeria kicked off on Monday with a brief procedural hearing and a decision to re-adjourn next month. A Shell logo is seen at a gas station in Buenos Aires, Argentina, March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci\nAt the next hearing, set for June 20, the Milan court said it would assess requests from third parties, including a series of international non-profit organisations, to join the case.\nAt Monday’s hearing Domenico Cartoni Schittar, a lawyer representing the Nigerian government, said he was stepping down from his role.\nIn comments in a signed document seen by Reuters, Cartoni Schittar said he had given up on a mandate which he said had become “awkward”. FILE PHOTO: The logo of oil company Eni-Saipem is pictured at the petrol station in Milan, Italy, February 28, 2016. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini\nThe long-running graft case revolves around the 2011 purchase by Eni and Shell of Nigeria’s OPL-245 offshore oilfield for about $1.3 billion.\nMilan prosecutors allege bribes were paid to win the licence to explore an oil block that holds an estimated 9 billion barrels of oil but which has never entered into production.\nGlobal Witness, a campaign group that has conducted its own investigations, has described the case as one of the biggest corruption scandals in the history of the oil industry.\nEni CEO Claudio Descalzi and former Shell Foundation Chairman Malcolm Brinded are standing trial along with 11 other defendants and the two companies.\nAll the accused have denied any wrongdoing.\nThe former Shell executives involved in the case have claimed a procedural error was made when the original ruling to send the case to court was taken and have applied to Italy’s Supreme Court to void it.\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to judge that appeal on June 12.
