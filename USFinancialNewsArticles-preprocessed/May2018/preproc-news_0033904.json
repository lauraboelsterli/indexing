    "text": "LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May’s government will publish detailed plans for its future relationship with the European Union next month, according to a government official, in an attempt to break the deadlock in Brexit negotiations.\nA so-called White Paper is likely to outline the position for sectors including financial services, agricultural and automotives and will be published before next month’s summit of EU leaders, the official said.\nDiplomats and officials in Brussels have raised doubts about whether the bloc and London will be able to mark a milestone in the negotiations at the summit of EU leaders on June 28-29 and have complained Britain has not been clear on what it wants.\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union was not immediately available for comment.\nReporting By Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
