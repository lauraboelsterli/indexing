    "text": "Published: May 24, 2018 8:35 a.m. ET Share\nShares log biggest drop in six years after a report critiquing company’s business practices, stock valuation\nBy Steven Russolillo\nShares of Hong Kong-traded Samsonite International S.A., the world’s largest luggage maker by volume, on Thursday suffered their worst drop in six years after a short seller issued a report critiquing the company’s business practices and its stock valuation.\nThe 48-page report was released by a new Texas activist investment fund called Blue Orca Capital LLC launched earlier this month by Soren Aandahl, a former director of research at California-based short-selling firm Glaucus Research. Choosing Samsonite 1910, -9.84% as its first target, Blue Orca claimed that the company is “a mid-level brand masquerading as a premium luxury player” and that it suffers from “questionable accounting practices and poor corporate governance.”\nSamsonite’s Hong Kong-listed shares fell 9.8%, its biggest one-day drop since June 2012, after the report was published. The shares climbed over 60% last year and hit a record high in April, giving the company a market value of $6.8 billion at the time. They last traded at 30.70 Hong Kong dollars per share, down 14% in the year to date.\nA representative for Samsonite didn’t immediately comment. Trading of the shares was halted Thursday morning after the report was released. ",
