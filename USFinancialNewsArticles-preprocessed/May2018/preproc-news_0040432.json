    "text": "LAVAL, Quebec, May 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (NYSE/TSX: VRX) (\"Valeant\" or the \"Company\") today announced that Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (the \"Issuer\"), the Company's wholly owned indirect subsidiary, has priced its previously announced offering of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.50% unsecured senior notes due 2027 (the \"Notes\"). The Notes were offered at par. The offering is expected to close on or about June 1, 2018. As previously announced, the Company is seeking to amend and restate its existing credit agreement (as amended and restated, the \"New Credit Agreement\") and borrow $4.565 billion of new Term B loans (the \"New Term B Loans\") under the New Credit Agreement (the \"Refinancing\"). The proceeds of the Notes and the New Term B Loans, along with cash on hand, are expected to be used to refinance the Company's outstanding Term B loans and redeem the Company's 5.375% Senior Notes due 2020, the Issuer's 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020, the Issuer's 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 and the Issuer's 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022, and to pay related fees and expenses.\nThe Notes will be guaranteed by the Company and each of its subsidiaries that are guarantors under the New Credit Agreement. Consummation of the offering of the Notes and the Refinancing are subject to various closing conditions, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully complete these refinancing transactions on the terms described above, or at all.\nThe Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or any state securities law and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes will be offered in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been and will not be qualified for sale to the public by prospectus under applicable Canadian securities laws and, accordingly, any offer and sale of the securities in Canada will be made on a basis which is exempt from the prospectus requirements of such securities laws.\nThis news release is being issued pursuant to Rule 135c under the Securities Act and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nAbout Valeant\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
