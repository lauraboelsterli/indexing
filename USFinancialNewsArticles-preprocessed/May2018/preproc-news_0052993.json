    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- EVgo, the nation's largest network of public electric vehicle (EV) fast charging stations, today announced the expansion of its leadership team with clean energy industry veterans to advance opportunities for DC fast charging across the country. Jonathan Levy has been named Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, and Sara Rafalson has been named Director of Market Development.\n\"The entire transportation sector is rapidly changing, and I could not be more excited to join the EVgo leadership team as we grow what is already the leading public fast charging network in the U.S.,\" said Levy. \"Having worked on advanced transportation in the government and the investment community, I am looking forward to digging into operations and working with the excellent team at EVgo to deliver fast charging solutions to enable more Americans to access a better way to drive.\"\n\"Momentum is on our side in transportation electrification,\" said Rafalson. \"I'm looking forward to leveraging my renewable energy policy experience to help EVgo further expand its reach to newer markets.\"\nLevy brings decades of experience as a problem solver in the public and private sectors, spanning policy, strategic, and operational roles ranging from drafting legislation and assessing policy risks to crisis management work. Coming from his previous role as Director of Policy and Strategy at Vision Ridge Partners, where he remains an advisor, Jonathan already has a deep knowledge of the EV charging industry as a whole and EVgo in particular. In his new role as Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at EVgo, Levy works hand-in-hand with the rest of the executive team in exploring new partnerships and business opportunities, improving execution, and ensuring EVgo's continued thought leadership in a dynamic sector. Levy's federal experience includes six years of service in the Obama Administration at the U.S. Department of Energy and the White House as well as prior service on Capitol Hill as policy advisor to then-Congressman Rahm Emanuel.\nIn her role as Director of Market Development at EVgo, Rafalson will lead public policy and market strategy efforts, working with utilities, regulators, industry partners, and state legislatures across the country to advance opportunities for DC fast charging and transportation electrification from her office in Oakland, CA. Prior to joining the EVgo team, Ms. Rafalson led public policy and market strategy efforts for Sol Systems, a national solar energy development firm based in Washington, D.C. While at Sol Systems, she served as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors for the Maryland-D.C.-Delaware-Virginia Solar Energy Industries Association (MDV-SEIA) and focused mostly on advancing opportunities for renewable energy deployment in the East Coast and in the Midwest. Additionally, Ms. Rafalson previously led national initiatives to increase recruitment and retention of women in cleantech industries through the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and as former President of Women in Solar Energy. She currently sits as a co-chair for the Women of Renewable Industries and Sustainable energy (WRISE) national leadership forum.\nFor more information on EVgo, visit EVgo.com .\nAbout EVgo\nEVgo is America's Largest Public Fast Charging Network.
