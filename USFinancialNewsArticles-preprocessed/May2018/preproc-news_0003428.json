Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2018\n(In thousands, unaudited)\nThe presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is important to investors because Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance by investors within the healthcare industry. Adjusted EBITDA is used to evaluate financial performance and determine resource allocation for each of Select Medical's operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, income from operations, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for Select Medical. Adjusted EBITDA is used by Select Medical to report its segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, stock compensation expense, acquisition costs associated with U.S. HealthWorks, non-operating gain (loss), and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2017\n2018\nNet income\n$\n23,463\n$\n43,982\nIncome tax expense\n13,202\n12,294\nInterest expense\n40,853\n47,163\nNon-operating loss (gain)\n49\n(399)\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries\n(5,521)\n(4,697)\nLoss on early retirement of debt\n19,719\n10,255\nIncome from operations\n91,765\n108,598\nStock compensation expense:\nIncluded in general and administrative\n3,749\n3,990\nIncluded in cost of services\n837\n937\nDepreciation and amortization\n42,539\n46,771\nU.S. HealthWorks acquisition costs\n—\n2,936\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n138,890\n$\n163,232\nLong term acute care\n$\n72,337\n$\n72,972\nInpatient rehabilitation\n16,328\n26,776\nOutpatient rehabilitation\n31,351\n30,525\nConcentra\n42,592\n57,797\nOther (a)\n(23,718)\n(24,838)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n138,890\n$\n163,232\n(a)\nOther primarily includes general and administrative costs.\nVI. Reconciliation of Income per Common Share to Adjusted Income per Common Share\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2018\n(In thousands, except per share amounts, unaudited)\nAdjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Items excluded from adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Select Medical believes that the presentation of adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares are important to investors because they are reflective of the financial performance of our ongoing operations and provide better comparability of our results of operations between periods. Adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to, or substitutes for, net income, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following tables reconcile net income available to common stockholders and income per common share to adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares for Select Medical.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2017\nPer Share (a)\n2018 (b)(c)\nPer Share (a)\nNet income attributable to Select Medical\n$\n15,870\n$\n33,739\nEarnings allocated to unvested restricted stockholders\n507\n1,111\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n15,363\n$\n0.12\n$\n32,628\n$\n0.25\nAdjustments:\nLoss on early retirement of debt\n19,719\n7,324\nU.S. HealthWorks acquisition costs\n—\n1,745\nEstimated income tax benefit (d)\n(7,796)\n(3,478)\nEarnings allocated to unvested restricted stockholders\n(381)\n(184)\nAdjusted net income available to common stockholders\n$\n26,905\n$\n0.21\n$\n38,035\n$\n0.29\nAdjustment for dilution\n0.00\n0.00\nAdjusted income per common share – diluted shares\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.29\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n128,464\n129,691\nDiluted\n128,628\n129,816",
