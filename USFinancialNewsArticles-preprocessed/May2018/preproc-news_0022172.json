    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Thursday it had made a preliminary finding that U.S. producers were being harmed by imports of steel automotive wheels from China.\nFILE PHOTO: Workers pack cold rolled steel coil at a steel company in Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu province, China April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Muyu Xu/File Photo The decision follows an announcement last month by the U.S. Commerce Department that it had opened an investigation to determine if certain steel wheels from China are dumped in the United States and whether producers in China are receiving unfair subsidies.\nReporting by Eric Walsh and Makini Brice; Editing by Tim Ahmann\n ",
