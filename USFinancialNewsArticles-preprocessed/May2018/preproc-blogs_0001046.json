    "text": "Watch: Pelicans crash a California graduation, and 1 lands on the red carpet Published 48 Mins Ago 1 Hour Ago | 00:54\nA pair of pelicans crashed a graduation ceremony at Pepperdine University in the California beachfront community of Malibu over the weekend.\nThe long-beaked birds flew in Saturday as the class of 2018 was receiving diplomas outdoors on a lawn overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\nVideo broadcast by KABC-TV shows one of the big birds landed among seated observers who managed to toss it back into the air, only to have it land on a red carpet at the centre of the ceremony.\nThe pelican resisted efforts by several men to get it to move along.\nIt finally waddled away.",
