REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\nDuring the appointment - which the BoE said was likely to last six to nine months - Van Steenis will help BoE staff study new financial technology, emerging market capital flows and the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n“Huw van Steenis’s vast experience of both the asset management and banking industry, together with his track record of taking the long-term view on the major structural forces driving the economy, will be invaluable,” BoE Governor Mark Carney said.\nVan Steenis was global head of strategy at British fund management company Schroders ( SDR.L ) from late 2016 until February this year, before which he spent many years as a senior financial services analyst at U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ).
