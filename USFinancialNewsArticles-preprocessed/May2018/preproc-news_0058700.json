    "text": "May 29 (Reuters) - British windows and doors retailer Safestyle UK Plc, which issued a profit warning in April, said on Tuesday its non-executive Chairman Peter Richardson resigned with immediate effect, a month after assuming the role.\n“Richardson assumed the role of Chair at short notice but it has become clear that the specific challenges currently facing the business and the time commitment required are beyond what he envisaged,” said the Bradford-based retailer, which has seen a deterioration in the trading since the start of the year.\nRichardson joined the Safestyle board as a non-executive director in July 2016.\nThe company added it would now look for a chairman with “requisite time, experience and turnaround skills”.\nReporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ",
