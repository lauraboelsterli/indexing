    "text": "BERLIN, May 23 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s cabinet agreed on Wednesday to grant compensation of up to around 1 billion euros to utilities RWE and Vattenfall for income lost due to the nuclear phase out, the environment ministry said.\nThe move follows a Constitutional Court ruling in 2016 which stated that a decision in 2011 to decommission nuclear power stations by the end of 2022 violated some property rights, clearing the way to compensation but leaving the amount open.\nA draft law seen by Reuters was drawn up last month, stating that the amount would probably be in the high three-digit-million euros ballpark.
