Rugby Union - England v Barbarians, Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain - May 27, 2018 England's Elliot Daly in action with Barbarians' Victor Vito Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien\nThe hosts fielded a mixture of regular internationals and young players, but the inexperienced lineup was no match for the power of the Barbarians who ran in nine tries in an entertaining game full of running rugby.\nWinger Chris Ashton, who has 39 caps for England, grabbed a hat-trick of tries for the Barbarians inside 25 minutes as they crossed the line five times in the first half.

Slideshow (2 Images)\n“We weren’t good enough by a long way,” England flyhalf George Ford said after the match. “We’ll have to have a look at it because we can’t be performing like that.”\nEngland were beaten 9-6 on the try count despite fielding seven regular starters, all of whom were involved in the Six Nations.\nOne of those regulars, Ford, actually denied Ashton a hat-trick inside ten minutes after catching his former team mate, but England still suffered early on.\nThe Baa-Baas scored three unanswered tries inside 12 minutes, with additional conversations from Scotland’s Finn Russell, before Elliot Daly and Piers Francis scored quick-fire tries for England.\nFrancis scored another before the break, as did Bath youngster Zach Mercer, but the Barbarians stayed well on top.\nEngland slowed the Barbarians’ scoring down in the second half, but scored just two more tries through Ben Launchbury and Jonny May, both converted by Ford, as they slumped to another defeat.
