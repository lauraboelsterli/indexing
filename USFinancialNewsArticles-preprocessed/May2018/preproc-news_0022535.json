    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Great Elm Capital Corp. (“we,” “us,” “our” or “GECC”), (NASDAQ:GECC), today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (1)\nNet investment income (“NII”) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $3.9 million, or $0.36 per share, which was in excess of our declared monthly base distribution of $0.083 per share (or approximately $0.25 per share for the quarter) for the same period and equated to a 1.45x base distribution coverage. In May, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) declared monthly distributions of $0.083 per share for the third quarter of 2018, representing a yield of approximately 8.45% of March 31, 2018 net asset value (“NAV”). Net assets on March 31, 2018 were approximately $125.6 million. NAV per share on March 31, 2018 was $11.79, as compared to $12.42 per share on December 31, 2017. We had approximately $317,000 of net realized gains on portfolio investments that were monetized during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or approximately $0.03 per share, and net unrealized depreciation of investments of approximately ($8.2) million, or approximately ($0.77) per share. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we invested approximately $63.2 million across 13 investments (2) , including seven new portfolio investments. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we monetized approximately $29.1 million across 12 investments (in part or in full). (3)\n“We were particularly active this quarter as we found a number of attractive opportunities via both primary and secondary markets. These opportunities allowed us to grow our asset base and, importantly, diversify our portfolio holdings,” said Peter A. Reed, GECC’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “A majority of the credit belongs to our investment team whose in-depth research and sourcing relationships created attractive, risk-adjusted opportunities despite less than favorable conditions for credit investing.”\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nAs of March 31, 2018, we held 30 debt investments across 23 companies, totaling approximately $194.3 million and representing 99.8% of invested capital. First lien and / or senior secured debt investments comprised 99.8% of invested capital as of the same date.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the weighted average current yield on our debt portfolio was approximately 14.8% with approximately 54.4% of invested debt capital in floating rate instruments.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we deployed approximately $63.2 million (2) into new and existing investments across 13 investments (seven new investments, six additional investments). The weighted average price of the new debt investments was 99% of par, carrying a weighted average current yield of 10.2%. All of these investments are first lien and / or senior secured investments.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we monetized 12 investments, in part or in full, for approximately $29.1 million (3) , at a weighted average current yield of 11.1%. Our weighted average realization price was just above par.\nLEGACY FULL CIRCLE PORTFOLIO\nIn the year and a half since the Full Circle Capital Corporation (“Full Circle”) merger closed, we have been working diligently to monetize what was largely viewed as a challenged legacy portfolio, as evidenced by the steep discount to NAV at which Full Circle’s shares were trading prior to and subsequent to the merger announcement. During that time, we have exited 22 positions across 15 portfolio companies realizing an aggregate total return of $4.2 million on these positions, a significant achievement given the market’s assessment of this portfolio. These positions represented approximately 69% of the aggregate cost basis of the legacy Full Circle portfolio.\n“Our progress to date is the direct result of the considerable amount of time and resources deployed by our team to monetize nearly 70% of the legacy Full Circle portfolio at a net gain,” noted Mr. Reed. “We often discuss our special situations approach to investing and this is exactly what we are referring to: identifying value which may not be appreciated by the broader market and utilizing our restructuring expertise and willingness to roll up our sleeves to help realize the same.”\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $7.5 million, or $0.70 per share. Net expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were approximately $3.6 million, or $0.34 per share.\nNet realized gains for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were approximately $317,000, or $0.03 per share. Net unrealized depreciation from investments for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately ($8.2) million, or ($0.77) per share.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of March 31, 2018, available liquidity from cash and money market investments was approximately $29.9 million, exclusive of our holdings of United States Treasury Bills.\nTotal debt outstanding as of March 31, 2018 was $79.0 million, comprised of the 6.50% notes due September 2022 (NASDAQ: GECCL) and the 6.75% notes due January 2025 (NASDAQ: GECCM).\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nDistributions:\nOur Board declared the monthly distributions for the third fiscal quarter of 2018 at $0.083 per share. The schedule of distribution payments is as follows:\nMonth Rate Record Date Payable Date July $0.083 July 31, 2018 August 15, 2018 August $0.083 August 31, 2018 September 14, 2018 September $0.083 September 28, 2018 October 15, 2018 Our distribution policy has been designed to set an annual base distribution rate that is covered by NII. From time to time, as catalyst-driven investments are realized or when we out-earn our declared distributions, we intend to supplement monthly distributions with special distributions from NII generated in excess of the declared distributions. (4)\nLeverage:\nOn May 3, 2018 at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, a majority of stockholders approved the application of the modified minimum asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, in accordance with the Small Business Credit Availability Act (\"SBCAA\") that was signed into law on March 23, 2018. As a result of such approval, and subject to satisfying certain ongoing disclosure requirements under the SBCAA, effective May 4, 2018, the asset coverage ratio test applicable to the Company has been decreased from 200% to 150%, permitting GECC to incur additional leverage.\nAs of the end of Q1/2018, we had approximately $79.0 million in par value of debt outstanding with an asset coverage ratio of 255% and debt to equity ratio of 0.63x, significantly below the previous debt to equity ratio limit of 1.0x.\nMr. Reed stated, “We believe the passage of the SBCAA benefits the Company and its stockholders by providing the Company with flexibility to manage its balance sheet through the selective use of additional leverage. We intend to deploy this leverage prudently, in amounts and at times that we believe can best deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. Notwithstanding this ability to incur additional leverage, we are cognizant of where we are in the credit cycle and do not believe it would be wise to incur the full amount of additional leverage permitted under the SBCAA at this time. As always, we remain keenly focused on creating long-term stockholder value by investing in securities with significant downside protection derived from robust asset coverage and/or recurring free cash flow.”\nPortfolio Investments:\nPR Wireless, Inc. In April 2018, the senior secured term loan to PR Wireless, Inc. was sold at par, resulting in a realized gain of approximately $800,000.\nAvanti Communications Group plc (“Avanti”) In December 2017, Avanti announced a proposed restructuring plan whereby the terms of its second lien debt would be amended (its coupon rate reduced to 9.0%; the company to have the option to pay in kind (“PIK”) its interest payments for the remaining life of the security; and its maturity date to be extended by a year) and its current third lien debt would be “equitized” in a debt for equity swap. In April 2018, a majority of Avanti shareholders voted in support of the proposed restructuring plan, allowing for the plan to close on April 26, 2018. In consideration for their support, the existing shareholders retain 7.5% of the common equity pro-forma for the issuance associated with the restructuring and the third lien debtholders own 92.5%. GECC now owns approximately 9.1% of Avanti’s common equity. In April 2018, Kyle Whitehill joined Avanti as its new CEO, replacing Alan Harper, previously the company’s Interim CEO. With Mr. Whitehill starting in April, Mr. Harper resumed his role as a Non-Executive Director of the company. In April 2018, Avanti successfully launched HYLAS 4. HYLAS 4 is Avanti’s largest capacity satellite and will provide data communications services with fixed beams serving Africa and Europe and steerable beams that can cover territory as far west as the United States and as far south as the southern tip of South America. HYLAS 4 is now in its period of in-orbit testing, a period that typically lasts approximately three months. If in-orbit testing is successfully completed, we anticipate Avanti would commence selling capacity and thus generating revenue from HYLAS 4.\nSubsequent Investments (5) : In April 2018, we purchased an additional $1.8 million of par value of Aptean Holdings, Inc. second lien term loan at a price of approximately 101% of par value. In April 2018, we purchased an additional $0.5 million of par value of SESAC Holdco II LLC second lien term loan at a price of approximately 100% of par value. In April and May 2018, we funded an additional $1.8 million of par value to Tallage Davis, LLC.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nGreat Elm Capital Corp. will host a conference call and webcast on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to discuss its first quarter financial results.
