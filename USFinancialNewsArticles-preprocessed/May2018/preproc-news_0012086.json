The empty podium is seen after Jean-Marc Janaillac, Chief Executive Officer of Air France-KLM Group, attended a news conference to announce his resignation in Paris, France, May 4, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau - RC17AC9E9030\nMore than half of the staff at the French carrier who cast a ballot voted against the offer of a 7 percent salary increase over four years, prompting Janaillac to say he would resign.\nStrikes over the pay dispute, due to resume on May 7 and May 8, have cost the company 300 million euros (£265.5 million) so far.\nJanaillac, who is chairman at Air France as well as chairman and CEO of parent group Air France-KLM, agreed to stay on until a May 15 shareholder meeting, the company said in a statement. Air France-KLM’s board will also meet then. ($1 = 0.8363 euros) Reporting by Sarah White; Editing by Kevin Liffey",
