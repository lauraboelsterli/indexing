A colleague advised Jean Otte, who headed customer service, not to say much when she went in for her first meeting with the new bosses.\nInstead, she showed up with charts explaining why she should get a raise and a promotion. “Jean made a name for herself by telling us she was one of the most important people in the company because every day she was talking to our customers,” said Jack Yurish, who was an executive vice president at National. “She basically decided if I’m going to go down in flames, I’m going to go down firing.”\nThe English-born Ms. Otte (pronounced like “ought”) eventually got a promotion to corporate vice president and was given added responsibility for training and quality.\nIn 1993, she left National to set up her own company, Women Unlimited Inc., to train female executives to advance their careers. Companies including Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Prudential Financial Inc. signed up.\nMs. Otte died May 1 at her home in Little Silver, N.J. She was 79 and had undergone cancer treatment in recent years.\nObituaries\nButch Granville Steered Texaco Through Oil-Market Turmoil in the 1970s May 25, 2018 Peter Mayer Revived Penguin Books by Giving Readers What They Wanted May 25, 2018 She described her mission as teaching women “how to get the boys to pass you the ball.”\nAmong her maxims:\n“Every day at work is a potential job interview.”\n“It’s not what you know. It’s who knows you know.”\n“The right message at the wrong time is the wrong message.”\nShe acknowledged that some women preferred working for men. “You learn all this stuff so early,\" she told the New York Daily News in 1998. “If a little girl wants something, who does she go to? Her mother or her father? Daddy, of course. Mommy was always the beast and Daddy let you eat the ice cream. You’re taking that with you, so in some sense, a woman boss becomes the mommy.”\nBut she also argued that women were growing more used to female bosses. As with male executives, female bosses could be either “rotten” or “fabulous,” she told the Asbury Park Press in 2001. “We have to stop this expectation that women should behave better than a male,” she said. “Get over it. Move on.”\nAt a seminar for women in 2001, she advised them to start “acting like players—not just implementing someone else’s plan but drawing up your own plans.”\nMany women were held back by unrealistic expectations, an unwillingness to take risks or a tendency toward self-righteousness, she said.\n“Men are very simple. They’re much easier to manage,” she said. The women at the seminar laughed and agreed. “We are absolutely complex. I know many of you may not like what I’m going to say, but we cannot manipulate another woman the way we can manipulate an unsuspecting man. Am I right?”\nJean Marion Bush was born March 18, 1939, in Dagenham, England, on the fringes of London. She remembered taking shelter in underground rail stations during World War II bomb raids. Her father was a manager at a plant making telecommunications cables. Her mother worked as a cook to support the family after her husband died.\nJean Bush earned a teaching certificate from a college in Wales and later applied to work as a flight attendant at British Overseas Airways. Instead, the airline assigned her to work at an airport complaint booth.\n“I wore my jaunty little hat and said things like, ‘I’m so sorry you had a problem,’ ” she told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 1992. She obtained a transfer to New York and quickly felt that the U.S. gave her more freedom to do what she wanted rather than what was expected. She became a citizen, married and had two sons.\nShe worked in customer service and other roles for McDonald’s Corp. , Illinois Bell Telephone Co. and the Toni home permanent division of Gillette Co. At Toni, she said, “I learned to deal with the worst complaints God ever invented—those from bald women and green-haired women.”\nSetting up her own firm was a struggle. Initially, she had trouble persuading companies to send their female managers to her training seminars. She hoped to have 50 women in her first training program but settled for fewer than 20.\nSearching for more clients, she got an appointment with Rosina Racioppi, a human resources executive for the U.S. unit of the German chemical company Degussa AG. “I was trying to shuffle her out the door as quickly as I could,” Ms. Racioppi recalled, but Ms. Otte’s sales pitch was relentless. “Her pure joy and excitement were contagious,” said Ms. Racioppi, who finally agreed to send women from Degussa for training with Women Unlimited. Later, Mr. Racioppi joined Women Unlimited’s staff.\nIn the early years, Ms. Otte had to keep expenses low. When she brought colleagues from other cities to New York to help lead training sessions, they stayed at her home in the Forest Hills section of Queens rather than at hotels. She cooked their dinners.\nAs more companies signed up for the seminars, Ms. Otte expanded her services across the country. About 10 years ago, she sold Women Unlimited to Ms. Racioppi and retired. More than 12,000 women have gone through the training programs.\nMs. Otte spent much of her retirement in Little Silver, a New Jersey town that reminded her of an English village. Her survivors include a sister, two sons and one grandchild.\nIn line with her wishes, her friends plan to remember her with a cocktail party rather than a funeral service.\nWrite to James R.
