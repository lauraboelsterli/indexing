    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Milan prosecutors have asked for a probe into a former Treasury official accused of having sold confidential government information to her previous employer Ernst & Young to be dropped, judicial sources and a lawyer said on Wednesday.\nMagistrates had suspected Susanna Masi was paid some 220,000 euros ($257,004) between 2013-2015 in return for sensitive material that could have given Ernst & Young an unfair advantage.\nBut prosecutors decided there was no case to answer since the Treasury had been aware that Masi was also being paid by her previous employer, the sources said.\nErnst & Young did not comment.\nThe request for the case to be dropped now needs to be approved by a judge.\nReporting by Emilio Parodi; Writing by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
