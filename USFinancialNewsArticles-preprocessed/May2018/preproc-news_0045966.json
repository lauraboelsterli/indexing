    "text": "3 COMMENTS Gina Haspel was sworn in Monday as the first female director of the Central Intelligence Agency and said she wanted to improve the agency’s foreign language proficiency and station more officers overseas.\nPresident Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Ms. Haspel’s predecessor, attended the 30-minute ceremony at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.\nIn remarks before her swearing in, Mr. Trump told attendees that Ms. Haspel, 61, now would lead an agency to which she had dedicated her life, a remark that was met with lengthy applause among employees in the audience who have welcomed the appointment of a CIA veteran as director.\nIn her inaugural remarks as director, Ms. Haspel referred to her contentious confirmation process, noting that she was only the second career operations officer to become director in the agency’s 70-year history.\n“After the experience of the last two months, I think I know why that is,” she said.\nOn Thursday, the Senate voted to confirm Ms. Haspel by a 54-45 vote. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is battling brain cancer, wasn’t at the vote. But Mr. McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said in a statement that he believed her involvement in a controversial program of interrogations run by the agency after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks disqualified her.\nOther senators expressed concern about her authorship of a memo that led to the destruction of 92 videotapes of those interrogations.\nDuring her confirmation process, Ms. Haspel renounced the harsh interrogation practices said the U.S. wouldn’t reinstate them while she was director.\nMs. Haspel worked as a case officer in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Africa and Europe. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ms. Haspel became an intelligence-operations officer and rose up the ranks of the agency’s Russia operations.\nOver the course of her career, Ms. Haspel four times served as chief of station—the top CIA official in a country responsible for all the agency’s operations there. In recent years, Ms. Haspel served in several top roles in the division of the CIA responsible for covert operations.\nWrite to Nancy A. Youssef at Nancy.Youssef@wsj.com",
