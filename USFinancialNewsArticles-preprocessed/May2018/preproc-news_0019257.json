    "text": "OAK BROOK, Ill., Federal Signal Corporation (NYSE:FSS), a leader in environmental and safety solutions, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet sales of $250 million, up $71.9 million, or 40% compared to last year Record first quarter orders of $330 million, up $115 million, or 54%, from last year GAAP EPS of $0.21, up 75% from $0.12 last year Adjusted EPS of $0.23, up 64% from $0.14 last year Raising full-year adjusted EPS * outlook to a range of $1.15 to $1.22, from a range of $1.10 to $1.20\nConsolidated net sales for the first quarter were $249.7 million, up $71.9 million, or 40% versus the same quarter a year ago. First quarter income from continuing operations was $12.9 million, equal to $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $7.2 million, equal to $0.12 per share, in the prior-year quarter.\nThe Company also reported adjusted net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of $14.0 million, equal to $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $8.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the same quarter a year ago. The Company is reporting adjusted results to facilitate comparisons of underlying performance on a year-over-year basis. A reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures is provided at the conclusion of this news release.\nQ1 Results Reflect Significant Increases in Orders, Sales and Income, Driven by Organic Growth and M&A\n\"We are off to a strong start in 2018, with first quarter results reflecting significant year-over-year growth in both the top and bottom line,\" commented Jennifer L. Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our first quarter orders were at record levels, surpassing the previous high established in the fourth quarter of last year. Similar to last quarter, we saw some pull-forward of orders from customers seeking to secure availability of certain product lines with extended lead times, or to manage the procurement of their chassis. We estimate that this resulted in the acceleration of an additional $25 million of orders into the first quarter that we had anticipated receiving later in the year.\"\nConsolidated orders were $329.7 million for the quarter, up $115.1 million, or 54%, compared to the prior-year quarter. The Environmental Solutions Group reported orders of $274.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $107.8 million, or 65%, compared to the prior-year quarter. The improvement was driven by organic order growth of approximately $44 million, or 27%, primarily represented by higher orders for vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners, and the acquisition of TBEI. Orders within our Safety and Security Systems Group were up $7.3 million. Consolidated backlog at March 31, 2018 was $337 million, up $163 million, or 94%, compared to last year.\nIn the Environmental Solutions Group, net sales were up $68.8 million, or 54%, due to the addition of $51.3 million in net sales from the TBEI acquisition and organic sales improvement of $17.5 million, or 14%, driven by higher domestic shipments of sewer cleaners and vacuum trucks. Sales in the Safety and Security Systems Group increased by $3.1 million, or 6%.\nConsolidated first quarter operating income was $19.6 million, up $8.2 million, or 72%, compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by a $10.3 million increase within the Environmental Solutions Group. Consolidated operating margin was 7.8%, up from 6.4% in the prior-year quarter.\nConsolidated adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"adjusted EBITDA\") for the first quarter of 2018 was $29.5 million, up $10.5 million, or 55%, compared to the prior-year quarter, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.8% compared to 10.7% last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the Environmental Solutions Group was up $13.5 million, or 87%, to $29.0 million, and its adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.8%, up from 12.1% last year. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, adjusted EBITDA was $7.0 million, compared to $7.7 million last year, and its adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.2%, compared to 15.4% last year.\nStrong Financial Position and Healthy Cash Flow Support Additional Debt Reduction and Cash Returns to Shareholders\nNet cash of $10.3 million was provided by continuing operating activities in the first quarter of 2018, which facilitated additional debt repayments of $8.6 million. At March 31, 2018, consolidated debt was $267 million, total cash and cash equivalents were $35 million and the Company had $121 million of availability for borrowings under its credit facility.\n\"Our debt leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was down to 2.1 times adjusted EBITDA,\" said Sherman. \"With our strong financial position, we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, invest in new product development initiatives, and fund cash returns to shareholders.\"\nThe Company also funded dividends of $4.2 million during the first quarter, and as recently announced, the Board of Directors increased the dividend that will be payable in the second quarter to $0.08 per share, up 14%.\nOutlook\n\"The strategic initiatives implemented in recent years continue to gain traction, and our recent acquisitions are performing well,\" Sherman noted. \"The strength of our backlog, the aggressive actions we have taken to minimize the impact of increased commodity costs and the favorable conditions in our end markets provide us with increased confidence for the rest of the year. At this time, we are raising our full-year 2018 adjusted EPS* outlook to a new range of $1.15 to $1.22, from a range of $1.10 to $1.20.\"\n* Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP measure, which includes certain adjustments to reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS. Our outlook assumes certain adjustments to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related expenses, purchase accounting effects and hearing loss settlement charges, where applicable. In 2017, we also made adjustments to exclude the impact of restructuring activity, executive severance costs, pension settlement charges, and special tax items, where applicable. Should any similar items occur during 2018, we would expect to exclude them from the determination of adjusted EPS. However, because of the underlying uncertainty in quantifying amounts which may not yet be known, a reconciliation of our Adjusted EPS outlook to the most applicable GAAP measure is excluded based on the unreasonable efforts exception in Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B).\nCONFERENCE CALL\nFederal Signal will host its first quarter conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided this supplemental information to investors, analysts, and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analyses of operating results, to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliations below, and to provide an additional measure of performance which management considers in operating the business.\nAdjusted net income and earnings per share from continuing operations (\"EPS\"):\nThe Company believes that modifying its 2018 and 2017 net income and diluted EPS provides additional measures which are representative of the Company's underlying performance and improves the comparability of results across reporting periods. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 adjustments were made to reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS to exclude the impact of restructuring activity, executive severance costs, acquisition and integration-related expenses, purchase accounting effects and hearing loss settlement charges, where applicable.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n12.9\n$\n7.2\nAdd:\nIncome tax expense\n4.1\n3.8\nIncome before income taxes\n17.0\n11.0\nAdd:\nRestructuring\n—\n0.3\nExecutive severance costs\n—\n0.7\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n0.5\n0.5\nPurchase accounting effects (a)\n0.6\n0.5\nHearing loss settlement charges\n0.4\n—\nAdjusted income before income taxes\n18.5\n13.0\nAdjusted income tax expense (b)\n(4.5)\n(4.5)\nAdjusted net income from continuing operations\n$\n14.0\n$\n8.5\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(dollars per diluted share)\n2018\n2017\nEPS, as reported\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.12\nAdd:\nIncome tax expense\n0.07\n0.06\nIncome before income taxes\n0.28\n0.18\nAdd:\nRestructuring\n—\n0.00\nExecutive severance costs\n—\n0.01\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n0.01\n0.01\nPurchase accounting effects (a)\n0.01\n0.01\nHearing loss settlement charges\n0.01\n—\nAdjusted income before income taxes\n0.31\n0.21\nAdjusted income tax expense (b)\n(0.08)\n(0.07)\nAdjusted EPS\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.14\n(a)\nPurchase accounting effects relate to adjustments to exclude the step-up in the valuation of equipment acquired in connection with current and prior-year acquisitions that was sold subsequent to the acquisition dates in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as to exclude the depreciation of the step-up in the valuation of the rental fleet acquired in the JJE transaction.\n(b)\nAdjusted income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was recomputed after excluding the impact of restructuring activity, executive severance costs, acquisition and integration-related expenses, purchase accounting effects and hearing loss settlement charges, where applicable.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nThe Company uses adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net sales (\"adjusted EBITDA margin\"), at both the consolidated and segment level, as additional measures which are representative of its underlying performance and to improve the comparability of results across reporting periods. We believe that investors use versions of these metrics in a similar manner. For these reasons, the Company believes that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, at both the consolidated and segment level, are meaningful metrics to investors in evaluating the Company's underlying financial performance.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of income from continuing operations, interest expense, hearing loss settlement charges, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, executive severance costs, purchase accounting effects, other income/expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of income from continuing operations, interest expense, hearing loss settlement charges, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, executive severance costs, purchase accounting effects, other income/expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense divided by net sales for the applicable period(s).\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of segment operating income, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, purchase accounting effects and depreciation and amortization expense, as applicable. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of segment operating income, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, purchase accounting effects and depreciation and amortization expense, as applicable, divided by net sales for the applicable period(s). Segment operating income includes all revenues, costs and expenses directly related to the segment involved. In determining segment income, neither corporate nor interest expenses are included. Segment depreciation and amortization expense relates to those assets, both tangible and intangible, that are utilized by the respective segment.\nOther companies may use different methods to calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.\nConsolidated\nThe following table summarizes the Company's consolidated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin and reconciles income from continuing operations to consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n($ in millions)\n2018\n2017\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n12.9\n$\n7.2\nAdd:\nInterest expense\n2.5\n0.6\nHearing loss settlement charges\n0.4\n—\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n0.5\n0.5\nRestructuring\n—\n0.3\nExecutive severance costs\n—\n0.7\nPurchase accounting effects *\n0.4\n0.4\nOther expense (income), net\n0.1\n(0.2)\nIncome tax expense\n4.1\n3.8\nDepreciation and amortization\n8.6\n5.7\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA\n$\n29.5\n$\n19.0\nNet sales\n$\n249.7\n$\n177.8\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA margin\n11.8\n%\n10.7\n%\n* Excludes purchase accounting expenses reflected in depreciation and amortization of $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively\nEnvironmental Solutions Group\nThe following table summarizes the Environmental Solutions Group's adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin and reconciles operating income to adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n($ in millions)\n2018\n2017\nOperating income\n$\n20.6\n$\n10.3\nAdd:\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n0.3\n0.2\nPurchase accounting effects *\n0.4\n0.4\nDepreciation and amortization\n7.7\n4.6\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n29.0\n$\n15.5\nNet sales\n$\n196.6\n$\n127.8\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n14.8\n%\n12.1\n%\n* Excludes purchase accounting expenses reflected in depreciation and amortization of $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively\nSafety and Security Systems Group\nThe following table summarizes the Safety and Security Systems Group's adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin and reconciles operating income to adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n($ in millions)\n2018\n2017\nOperating income\n$\n6.1\n$\n6.4\nAdd:\nRestructuring\n—\n0.3\nDepreciation and amortization\n0.9\n1.0\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n7.0\n$\n7.7\nNet sales\n$\n53.1\n$\n50.0\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n13.2\n%\n15.4\n%\n : releases/federal-signal-raises-full-year-outlook-after-reporting-strong-first-quarter-earnings-and-record-orders-up-54-300644115.html\nSOURCE Federal Signal Corporation",
