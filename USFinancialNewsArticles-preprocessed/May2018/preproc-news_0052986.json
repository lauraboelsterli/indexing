    "text": "BRUSSELS (AP) â€” The Latest on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's meeting with European Union officials (all times local):\n6:30 p.m.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is apologizing for the internet giant's failure to prevent some of the internet tools it has developed from being misused.\nDuring a testimony at the European Parliament Zuckerberg said Tuesday that whether it was \"fake news, foreign interference in elections and developers misusing people's information. We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibilities.\"\nSpeaking to a group of EU parliamentary group leaders in Brussels, he said: \"That was a mistake, and I'm sorry for it.\"\n11:45 a.m.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faces senior European Union lawmakers later Tuesday to answer questions about a scandal over the alleged misuse of the data of millions of Facebook users.\nIn testimony to be broadcast live, Zuckerberg will be questioned by leaders of the European Parliament's main party groups and committees.\nZuckerberg testified last month to the U.S. Congress, but had been noncommittal about appearing in Europe. He sent a senior official to speak to the British parliament and offered to do the same in Brussels, but the EU assembly insisted on hearing him in person.\nTuesday's hearing was originally supposed to be held behind closed doors. EU Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee President Claude Moraes said the fact that it will now be made public \"is very significant.\"",
