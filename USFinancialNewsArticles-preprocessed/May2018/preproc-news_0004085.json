Rescued endangered radiated tortoise are seen feeding in Ifaty, Madagascar April 27, 2018. Susie Bartlett/The Wildlife Conservation Society/Handout via Reuters\nThe radiated tortoises - prized by dealers for their beautiful shells - were so dry that some of them had to be soaked in water for weeks, said Susie Bartlett, from the Wildlife Conservation Society, based in New York’s Bronx Zoo.\nOthers had to be injected with rehydration fluids and in some cases antibiotics and painkillers, she added.\nPolice found them in a house on the island last month, arrested three people and called in the experts. A rescued endangered radiated tortoise is seen feeding in Ifaty, Madagascar April 30, 2018. Susie Bartlett/The Wildlife Conservation Society/Handout via Reuters\nBartlett and colleagues spent days working in 100 Fahrenheit heat at a care facility in one of the tortoises natural habitats - the spiny forests on the island’s southwestern coast.\n“We got poked and scratched by spiny branches when crawling through to access the animals,” said Bartlett.\nSome have died but thousands of others are getting better. It is unlikely they will be released back into the wild anytime soon because they could be recaptured by poachers.\nThey are prized as delicacies in some parts of Asia, and as pets in other areas, Bartlett added.
