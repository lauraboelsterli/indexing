    "text": "Taylor Swift is known for her shrewd dealings in the music business , but the 28-year-old pop star, who Forbes estimated was worth $280 million in 2017, is also making a name for herself in real estate.\nEarlier this year, Swift picked up a 3,540-square-foot apartment in New York for $9.75 million, bringing her total spending for property on a single city block to almost $50 million, New York Post reports.\nWhile she's adding properties on the East Coast, she's selling them out West.\nSwift recently sold a Beverly Hills, California home for $4 million to Nicolas Bijan Pakzad, The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday , and has listed a second home in the same neighborhood for $2.95 million, according to the paper. Agent Drew Mandile at Sotheby's International Realty declined to comment on the recent listing.\nScroll through the embedded Instagram images below to see the latest Los Angeles mansion Swift has put on the market.\nThe 2,950-square-foot residence at 1908 North Beverly Drive was built in 1959. It was last sold in 2012 for $1.775 million , according to Trulia .\nThe house has four bedrooms and 4.5 baths, including those in the \"mother-in-law\" apartment, which has a separate entrance.\nThe living room has floor-to-ceiling glass windows, with a door to the property's pool and outdoor area. There, visitors can take in views of the California mountains, Trulia reports .\nInside the home, the property is equipped with a gourmet kitchen and stainless steel appliances. There's also breakfast nook with booths.\nFor homeowners who plan to pair their cuisine with fine wines, the home features a climate-controlled wine cellar, which can hold up to 1,000 bottles.\nDon't miss: Here's the $12 million reno Jeff Bezos is planning for his $23 million D.C. mansion\nLike this story?
