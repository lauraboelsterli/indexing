(“Centerra”) (TSX:CG) today reported net earnings of $9.0 million or $0.03 per common share (basic) on revenues of $235.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. The first quarter 2018 results include charges of $4.4 million related to the acquisition of AuRico Metals Inc. Excluding this item, adjusted earnings NG in the first quarter of 2018 were $13.5 million or $0.05 per common share (basic). During the same period in 2017, the Company reported net earnings (and adjusted earnings NG ) of $57.0 million or $0.20 per common share (basic) on revenues of $285.3 million.\n2018 First Quarter Highlights\nClosed the AuRico Metals Inc. acquisition on January 8, 2018. Started construction of the Öksüt Project in Turkey late-March, after receiving the pastureland permit, investment incentive certificate and Board approval during the quarter. Partially restarted mill processing operations at Mount Milligan, operating both ball mill circuits at 40,000 tpd at the end of the first quarter. On February 1, 2018, entered into a $500 million, four-year senior secured revolving credit facility with a lending syndicate of eight financial institutions as lenders, replacing prior facilities. See “Liquidity – Credit Facilities”. Produced a total of 129,764 ounces of gold, including 100,220 ounces at Kumtor and 29,544 ounces at Mount Milligan. Sold a total of 132,432 ounces of gold in the quarter, including 116,919 ounces at Kumtor and 15,513 ounces at Mount Milligan. Mount Milligan produced 6.1 million pounds of copper during the period and sold 4.5 million pounds of copper. Company-wide all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce sold NG were $932, excluding revenue-based tax in the Kyrgyz Republic and income tax reflecting the lower sales volumes. Cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital NG of $66.6 million. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments at March 31, 2018 were $123.4 million. Value of royalty portfolio enhanced by mineral reserve increases at Kirkland Lake Gold’s Fosterville operation.\nCommentary\nScott Perry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Centerra stated, “I am pleased to report that the roll-out of our Work Safe – Home Safe program has been fully embraced across the organization and we are now embarking on our drive to zero harm within the work place. We are seeing the early benefits of this safety program where on April 11 th , 2018, our Kumtor operation achieved a significant milestone of one full year and 6 million man-hours without incurring a lost time injury.”\n“Another significant milestone achieved during the quarter was that we commenced construction activity at the Öksüt Project in Turkey. Our site contractor mobilized their equipment and crews and started work on the main access road to site. Work will continue to ramp up over the summer and we will report back with regular updates on the construction activity at Öksüt.”\n“As we reported earlier, we have restarted mill processing activities at the Mount Milligan Mine. Currently, our team on site has both of the ball mill circuits operating at an average throughput of approximately 40,000 tonnes per day while we wait for additional volumes of water from the upcoming freshet (spring melt). Once the freshet is underway, we plan to increase the throughput to our targeted average of 55,000 tonnes per calendar day throughput for the second half of the year.”\n“With Mount Milligan back up and running, the Company produced a total of 129,764 ounces of gold in the quarter and 6.1 million pounds of copper. Due to the lower production volumes and the corresponding lower sales volumes our all-in sustaining costs (before taxes) NG were skewed higher this quarter coming in at $932 per ounce. The costs were higher, since Mount Milligan continued to mine through the mill shutdown and had fixed costs to cover during the period, but Kumtor achieved all-in sustaining costs (before taxes) NG of $758 per ounce in the quarter. As production increases at both sites and sales increase in the second half of the year, we expect to see our all-in sustaining costs come down significantly to be more in line with normal operating levels.”\n“Financially, the operations delivered in the quarter approximately $67 million of cash provided by operations before changes in working capital NG . Kumtor generated $85 million while Mount Milligan had a use of cash of only $7 million before working capital changes despite the mill being shutdown for 6 weeks and then operating at less than half capacity for a significant portion of the quarter.”\nSelect First Quarter 2018 Developments\nAcquisition of AuRico Metals Inc .\nOn January 8, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition (the “AuRico Acquisition”) of 100% of the outstanding shares of AuRico Metals Inc. (“AuRico”). AuRico was a North American-based mining development and royalty company with interests in the Kemess Underground project (the “Kemess Underground”), a feasibility stage underground gold-copper project in British Columbia, Canada, and the Kemess East project (together “Kemess Project”).\nThe AuRico Acquisition was completed by way of a Plan of Arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario), whereby the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding AuRico common shares for Cdn$1.80 per share in cash consideration, representing an aggregate transaction value of approximately Cdn$307 million ($247 million).\nAuRico’s holdings also included a free cash-flow generating royalty portfolio which includes a 1.5% net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty on the Young-Davidson gold mine in Ontario and a 2.0% NSR royalty on the Fosterville mine in Australia. The value of the royalty portfolio has increased with the significant growth in mineral reserves at the Fosterville Mine operated by Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. At December 31, 2017, mineral reserves at Fosterville increased by 65% to 1.7 million ounces of gold at 23.1 g/t from Kirkland Lake’s June 30, 2017 mid-year estimate. The Swan Zone mineral reserve doubled to over a million ounces of gold at 61.2 g/t (see Kirkland Lake’s news release dated February 20, 2018).\nPrior to the acquisition, the Kemess Underground project achieved the following milestones in 2017:\nMarch 2017 – granted an Environmental Assessment (EA) Certificate from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office May 2017 – signed an Impact Benefit Agreement (“IBA”) with an alliance of three First Nations groups – the Takla Lake First Nations, Tsay Key Dene First Nation and the Kwadacha First Nation (collectively known as “Tse Key Nay” or “TKN”) August 2017 – submitted construction permit applications with the Major Mines Permitting Office\nIn addition, the Kemess East project announced in May 2017 the results of a preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) supporting an 11 million tonne per annum panel cave underground mine. A PEA is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.\nSee “Development Projects – Kemess Underground Project” for further details.\nMount Milligan - Mill Shutdown and Partial Restart\nOn December 27, 2017, the Company reported that, due to a lack of sufficient fresh water resources, mill processing operations at the Mount Milligan mine had been temporarily suspended. Milling operations restarted, at a reduced capacity, on February 5, 2018 utilizing one ball mill to minimize water requirements. Following a ramp-up period, mill operations achieved sustainable mill throughput levels of approximately 30,000 tonnes per day by mid-February.\nOn March 23, 2018, the second ball mill was restarted following a build-up of water in Mount Milligan’s tailings storage facility (TSF) due to faster than expected thawing of ice in the TSF as well as pumping of water from groundwater sources, tower drains and nearby Philip Lake.\nBy the end of the first quarter 2018, milling operations had achieved a throughput of 40,000 tpd.\nAs at April 30, 2018, the Company has made two shipments of copper/gold concentrates in 2018 with a gross value of approximately $74 million.\nSee “Mount Milligan Mine” for further details.\nExploration Update\nExploration expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $2.4 million compared to $1.7 million in the same quarter of 2017. Exploration activities during the first quarter included drilling, trenching, geological mapping, geophysics, surface sampling and geophysics at the Company’s various projects.\nMount Milligan Mine\nExploration activities in the first quarter of 2018 at Mount Milligan included till drilling and near-pit infill diamond drilling south-west of the current Mount Milligan pit. A total of 3,445 metres in ten diamond drill holes was completed. Assay result have been returned from four drill holes.

Overview of Consolidated Results\nFirst Quarter 2018 compared to First Quarter 2017\nThe Company recorded net earnings of $9.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $57.0 million in the same period of 2017. The lower earnings in the first quarter of 2018 reflect the shutdown and partial restart of milling operations at Mount Milligan. Also negatively impacting earnings was lower gold production at Kumtor, due primarily to processing complex Sarytor ore with lower average mill gold head grades and lower recoveries, partially offset by higher realized gold prices. In addition, the first quarter of 2018 earnings include costs related to the AuRico Acquisition and integration of $4.4 million. Excluding the costs related to the AuRico Acquisition, adjusted earnings NG in the first quarter of 2018 were $13.5 million compared to $57.0 million in the comparative period.\nProduction:\nGold production in the first quarter of 2018 totaled 129,764 ounces compared to 172,644 ounces in the same period of 2017. Gold production at Kumtor was 100,220 ounces in 2018, 21% lower than the 127,400 ounces produced in 2017. The decrease in ounces poured at Kumtor is a result of milling lower grade and lower recovery ore from stockpiles (2.58 g/t and 72.2% recovery compared to 3.53 g/t and 76.0% recovery) compared to first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, Mount Milligan produced 29,544 ounces of gold and 6.1 million pounds of copper, compared to 45,244 ounces of gold and 12.6 million pounds of copper in the first quarter of 2017. The lower production at Mount Milligan in the first quarter of 2018 is due to the shutdown and partial restart of milling operations due to the lack of fresh water and low water volumes used in processing.\nSafety and Environment:\nCenterra had seven reportable injuries which included two lost time injuries, four medical aid injuries and one restricted work injury in the first quarter of 2018. On April 11, 2018, the Kumtor operation achieved one full year and 6 million man-hours without incurring a lost time injury.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018 there were no reportable release to the environment.\nFinancial Performance:\nRevenue decreased to $235.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $ 285.3 million in the same period of 2017, as a result of lower sales at Mount Milligan (15,513 gold ounces compared to 53,232 gold ounces and 4.5 million pounds of copper compared to 13.6 million pounds of copper) and 13% fewer gold doré ounces sold at Kumtor. The decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2018 reflects lower production as described above. However, the decrease in overall revenue was partially offset by a 4% higher combined average realized gold price NG during the first quarter of 2018 ($1,204 per ounce compared to $1,154 per ounce in the first quarter of 2017).\nCost of sales decreased in the first quarter of 2018 to $152.8 million compared to $171.9 million in the same period of 2017, mainly resulting from the lower number of gold ounces and copper pounds sold. Depreciation, depletion and amortization associated with production was $41.3 million in 2018 as compared to $54.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to lower sales volumes in the first quarter of 2018.\nStandby costs of $10.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018 represent overhead costs at Mount Milligan during the mill shutdown and ramp-up period that were unrelated to normal processing volumes.\nFinancing costs in the first quarter of 2018 totalled $14.8 million, including a charge of $4.9 million for the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Centerra B.C. Facility, EBRD Facility and the AuRico Acquisition Facility settled in the quarter. Financing costs in the comparative quarter of 2017 totalled $7.7 million, representing interest paid and amortization of deferred financing costs on the Centerra B.C. Facility and the EBRD Facility.\nOperating Costs:\nOperating costs (on a sales basis) NG decreased to $111.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $117.6 million in the same period of 2017. The decrease in costs is primarily due to lower sales volumes for gold and copper, partially offset by higher molybdenum sales and prices.\nCenterra’s all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce of gold sold NG , which excludes revenue-based tax and income tax, increased to $932 in 2018 from $750 in the comparative period mainly as a result of 30% fewer gold ounces sold, higher sustaining capital NG , increased administration costs, as a result of the AuRico Acquisition, partially offset by lower capitalized stripping costs at Kumtor.\nConsolidated All-in Sustaining Costs on a by-product basis (per sounce sold):\nhttp://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/fbcf9dac-9d5a-42da-aade-dbe0fa7fe2d8\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its cash on hand and working capital as at March 31, 2018, together with future cash flows from operations and cash provided by the Company’s existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its anticipated operating cash requirements, although there can be no assurance of this.\nAs at March 31, 2018, the Company held cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of $123 million and undrawn credit facilities of $335 million.\nCash generation and capital management: Cashflow Unaudited ($ millions, except as noted) Three Months ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Cash provided by operations before changes in working capital NG 66.6 118.1 (44 %) - Changes in working capital (106.3 ) (45.6 ) 133 % Cash (used in) provided by operating activities (39.7 ) 72.5 (155 %) Cash used in investing activities: - Capital additions (cash) (59.0 ) (69.0 ) (14 %) - Short-term investment net redeemed (net purchased) - (25.0 ) (100 %) - Payment to AuRico shareholders (247.0 ) - (100 %) - Cash received on AuRico acquisition 20.2 - 100 % - Increase in restricted cash (2.3 ) (2.7 ) (14 %) - Other investing items (6.0 ) (8.2 ) (27 %) Cash used in investing activities (294.1 ) (104.9 ) 180 % Cash received from (used in) financing activities: - Proceeds from (repayment of) debt 49.1 (37.5 ) (231 %) - Payment of interest and borrowing costs and other (10.7 ) (8.7 ) 22 % Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 38.4 (46.2 ) (183 %) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (295.4 ) (78.7 ) 275 % Cash provided by operations before working capital changes NG decreased to $66.6 million in first quarter of 2018, compared to $118.1 million in the comparative period, as a result of lower earnings in the current year and higher working capital levels. Working capital movements in the first quarter of 2018 reflect increased levels at Mount Milligan due to the timing of payments to Royal Gold and increased receivable levels at Kumtor due to timing of shipments, partially offset by reduced levels in the molybdenum business.\nThe Company used $39.7 million in cash from operations in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to generating $72.5 million in the same period of 2017. Mount Milligan used $42.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, as a result of the mill processing disruptions discussed previously (compared to $2.8 million used in the comparative period), while Kumtor generated $43.1 million as compared to $91.6 million for the comparative period in 2017, a decrease related to lower production and the timing of shipments.\nCash used in investing activities increased to $294.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $104.9 million in the same period of 2017, reflecting in 2018 the AuRico Acquisition for net cash outlays of $226.8 million.\nCash provided by financing activities of $38.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 represents the drawdown of $125 million under the AuRico Acquisition Facility (which was later replaced by the Corporate Facility), the repayment of the EBRD Facility of $76 million and payment of interest and borrowing costs. In the comparative quarter of 2017, the Company used $46.2 million from its financing activities, including principal repayments of $25 million on its EBRD Facility and $12.5 million on the Centerra B.C. Facility, in addition to normal payments for interest and borrowing costs.\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments at March 31, 2018 decreased to $123.4 million from $416.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nCredit Facilities\nCenterra was in compliance with the terms of all of its credit facilities at March 31, 2018.\nCenterra Revolving Term Corporate Facility\nOn February 1, 2018, the Company entered into a new $500 million four-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"Corporate Facility\").\nThe Corporate Facility is held at the corporate level and is an amendment and restatement of a credit facility entered into by Centerra B.C. Holdings Inc. (the “Centerra B.C. Facility”), which had an outstanding balance owed of $190 million at the time of the amendment. The Corporate Facility also replaced the AuRico Acquisition Facility and the EBRD Facility (discussed below).\nThe Corporate Facility is for general corporate purposes, including working capital, investments, acquisitions and capital expenditures and as at March 31, 2018 had a drawn balance of $315 million.\nOMAS Facility\nIn 2016, OMAS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $150 million five-year revolving credit facility (the “OMAS Facility”). In April 2018, the OMAS Facility was amended, and among other things, extended the expiry of the facility from December 30, 2021 to March 31, 2024. The purpose of the OMAS Facility is to assist in financing the construction of the Company’s Öksüt Project.\nAvailability of the OMAS Facility is subject to customary conditions precedent, with a deadline for completion of June 30, 2018. If the conditions are not satisfied, waived or amended by such deadline, the commitments under the OMAS Facility will be cancelled. The Company expects that such conditions will be satisfied in the normal course.\nAs part of the April 2018 amendment to the OMAS Facility, OMAS agreed to apply all excess cash flow towards debt prepayment until the Öksüt Project’s mining license is extended beyond its current expiry date of January 16, 2023. OMAS intends to apply for the extension of its mining license when permitted under Turkish legislation, which is two years prior to its expiry In addition, Centerra will provide a limited guarantee of a portion of OMAS’ obligations under the OMAS Facility and will agree to comply with certain covenants which are consistent with the covenants under the Corporate Facility. The guarantee will be callable under certain limited circumstances – primarily if the Öksüt mining license is not extended beyond January 16, 2023. The guarantee provided by Centerra as at January 16, 2023 will be limited to the OMAS facility balance outstanding at that time.\nAs at March 31, 2018, $4.9 million (December 31, 2017 - $4.8 million) of OMAS Facility deferred financing fees were included in prepaid expenses as the Company has yet to draw from the facility. The deferred financing fees are being amortized over the term of the OMAS Facility. The Company expects to be in a position to draw on the OMAS Facility in the second quarter of 2018. See “Caution Regarding Forward Looking information”.\nAuRico Metals Inc. Acquisition Facility\nSubsequent to the end of the year, on January 8, 2018, the Company announced it had acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of AuRico. The purchase was funded, in part, by a $125 million acquisition facility (“AuRico Acquisition Facility”). The AuRico Acquisition Facility was repaid and cancelled when the Company entered into the Corporate Facility, noted above.\nCenterra EBRD Corporate Facility\nIn 2016, the Company entered into a five-year $150 million revolving credit facility (the “EBRD Facility”) with EBRD. In the first quarter of 2018, in connection with the entering into of the Corporate Facility, the Company repaid the $76 million principal amount outstanding under the EBRD Facility and subsequently cancelled the EBRD Facility.\nCapital Expenditure (spent and accrued) $ millions Three Months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change Consolidated: Sustaining capital NG 24.7 19.8 4.9 Capitalized stripping (1) 38.5 62.5 (24.0 ) Growth capital NG 3.4 0.9 2.5 Öksüt Project development 5.4 2.1 3.3 Greenstone Gold Property capital (2) 1.8 1.0 0.8 Kemess Underground Project development 0.2 - 0.2 Gatsuurt Project development - 0.5 (0.5 ) Total 74.0 86.8 (12.8 ) (1 ) Includes cash component of $28.7 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (2017: $46.7 million). (2 ) In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, the 50% share paid on behalf of Premier Gold Mines Limited in the project is capitalized as part of mineral properties in Property, Plant & Equipment. Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $74.0 million compared to $86.8 million in the same period of 2017, resulting mainly from reduced spending on capitalized stripping at Kumtor, higher spending on the Company’s development projects (mainly at Öksüt), partially offset by higher sustaining capital NG for equipment rebuilds and overhauls.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company seeks to manage its exposure to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates by entering into derivative financial instruments from time-to-time.\nFuel Hedges:\nIn 2016, the Company established a diesel fuel price hedging strategy using derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with changes in diesel fuel prices to the cost of operations at the Kumtor Mine. The diesel fuel hedging program is a 24-month rolling program and the Company targets to hedge up to 50% of monthly diesel purchases. The Company hedges its exposure with crude oil futures contracts, as the price of diesel fuel closely correlates to the price of crude oil.\nGold and Copper Derivative Contracts:\nThe Company must satisfy its obligation under the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement by delivering refined physical gold and LME copper warrants to Royal Gold at the time of receiving payment from third-party purchasers who purchase concentrate from the Mount Milligan mine. In order to hedge the metal price risk that arises when physical purchase and concentrate sales pricing periods do not match, the Company has entered into certain forward gold and copper purchases and forward sales contracts pursuant to which it purchases gold or copper at an average price during a future quotational period and sells gold or copper at the current spot price. These derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.\nMount Milligan Gold and Copper Facility Hedges:\nAs part of an amendment to the Centerra B.C. Facility in August 2017, a condition precedent to draw funds from the facility required the Company to enter into a hedging program to cover the period from July 2017 to June 2019. The amendment required hedging 50% of future un-streamed gold and 75% of un-streamed copper production at the Mount Milligan mine at a minimum average floor price of $1,200 per gold ounce and minimum average floor price of $2.50 per copper pound.\nThe hedge positions for each of these programs as at March 31, 2018 are summarized as follows:\nSettlement As at March 31, 2018 Program Instrument Unit Average strike price Type 2018 2019 Total position Fair value gain (loss) ('000') Fuel Hedges Crude oil options (1) Barrels $65 Fixed 225,000 72,000 297,000 $ 1,584 Fuel Hedges Zero-cost collars (2) Barrels $46/$59 Fixed - 23,000 23,000 $ 185 Centerra B.C.

(2) Under the zero-cost collar: (i) the Company can put the number of gold ounces or copper pounds to the counterparty at the minimum price, if the price were to fall below the minimum, and (ii) the counterparty has the option to require the Company to sell to it the number of gold ounces or copper pounds at the maximum price, if the price were to rise above the maximum. (3) ND = Royal Gold hedging program with floating terms, that are not defined as at March 31, 2018. As part of the amendment of the Corporate Facility in the first quarter of 2018, the hedging program is no longer required. In early April 2018, the Company unwound a selection of hedges that were scheduled to settle in the second quarter of 2018. The unwound hedges included copper forward contracts with an average strike price of $2.95 per pound, copper zero-cost collars with a ceiling of $2.73 per pound and gold forward contracts with an average strike price of $1,285 per oz. The cost to unwind these instruments was $2.8 million. The following table outlines the March 31, 2018 hedge program positions excluding the contracts that were unwound in April 2018:\nAs at March 31, 2018 Program Instrument Unit Average strike\nprice Type 2018 2019 Total\nposition Fair value\ngain (loss)\n('000') Centerra B.C.

The remaining copper hedging program in 2018 consists of 27.6 million copper pounds of zero-cost collars at an average strike price range of $2.50 to $3.30 per pound.\nThe gold hedging program is more heavily weighted to zero cost collars in the second half of the program in 2018 and 2019 with 70% and 100% collars, respectively. This hedging strategy has also been adopted for copper hedges with 100% collars remaining in 2018 and 2019.\nCenterra does not enter into off-balance sheet arrangements with special purpose entities in the normal course of its business, nor does it have any unconsolidated affiliates.\nOperating Mines and Facilities\nKumtor Mine\nThe Kumtor open pit mine, located in the Kyrgyz Republic, is one of the largest gold mines in Central Asia. It has been in production since 1997 and has produced over 11.6 million ounces of gold to March 31, 2018.\nDevelopments in 2018\nThe Company continued to work with the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to satisfy the conditions precedent to completion of the comprehensive settlement agreement entered into with the Government on September 11, 2017. In April 2018, the longstop date for completion of all such conditions has again been extended and has now been set at May 31, 2018. See “Other Corporate Developments – Kyrgyz Republic”.\nOn April 19, 2018, the Kyrgyz Republic Government was dismissed following a vote of no confidence in the Kyrgyz Republic Parliament. We understand that a new government has been formed and Centerra will continue to work with the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to ensure the satisfaction of the remaining conditions precedent to completion of the Strategic Agreement.\nKumtor Operating Results ($ millions, except as noted) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Financial Highlights: Revenue - $ millions 153.0 164.1 (7 %) Cost of sales (cash) 42.6 35.2 21 % Cost of sales (non-cash) 35.6 37.2 (4 %) Cost of sales (total) 78.2 72.4 8 % Cost of sales - $/oz sold (1) 669 537 24 % Cash provided by operations 43.1 91.6 (53 %) Cash provided by operations before changes in working capital (1) 84.6 102.4 (17 %) Operating Highlights: Tonnes mined - 000s 47,314 39,003 21 % Tonnes ore mined – 000s 1,405 - 0 % Average mining grade - g/t 2.02 - 0 % Tonnes milled - 000s 1,668 1,536 9 % Average mill head grade - g/t 2.58 3.53 (27 %) Mill Recovery - % 72.2 % 76.0 % (5 %) Mining costs - total ($/t mined material) 1.08 1.23 (12 %) Milling costs ($/t milled material) 9.26 10.05 (8 %) Gold produced – ounces 100,220 127,400 (21 %) Gold sold – ounces 116,919 134,682 (13 %) Average realized gold price (1) - $/oz sold $ 1,309 $ 1,219 7 % Capital Expenditures (sustaining) (1) - cash 11.3 15.2 (26 %) Capital Expenditures (growth) (1) - cash 3.4 0.9 281 % Capital Expenditures (stripping) - cash 28.7 46.7 (39 %) Capital Expenditures (stripping) - non-cash 9.7 15.8 (38 %) Capital expenditures (total) 53.2 78.7 (32 %) Operating Costs (on a sales basis) (2) 42.6 35.2 21 % All-in sustaining costs (including taxes) (1) 88.6 102.7 (14 %) Adjusted operating costs (1) - $/oz sold $ 412 $ 300 37 % Operating Costs (on a sales basis)- $/oz sold (1) $ 365 $ 261 40 % Gold - All-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis - $/oz sold (1) $ 758 $ 763 (1 %) Gold - All-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis (including taxes) - $/oz sold (1) $ 942 $ 935 1 %\n(1) Non-GAAP measure. See discussion under “Non-GAAP Measures” (2) Operating costs (on a sales basis) is a non-GAAP measure and is comprised of mine operating costs such as mining, processing, administration, royalties and production taxes (except at Kumtor where revenue-based taxes are excluded), but excludes reclamation costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Production\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Kumtor focused on developing the Central Pit through mining cut-backs 18 and 19 and the unloading of ice. In addition, Kumtor carried out preparation works to access cut-back 20B.\nTotal waste and ore mined in the first quarter of 2018 was 47.3 million tonnes compared to 39.0 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 21%. The main reasons for this increase were due to favourable weather conditions in 2018 compared to 2017, which resulted in fewer delays, 9% shorter average haulage distance compared to 2017, and various process improvements that increased truck payloads.\nKumtor produced 100,220 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 127,400 ounces of gold in the same period of 2017. The decrease in ounces poured in the first quarter of 2018 is a result of processing the stockpiled ore from the Sarytor pit which is lower grade and more metallurgically complex, as compared to the stockpiled ore processed from cut-back 17 in the comparative period of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, Kumtor’s average mill head grade was 2.58 g/t with a recovery of 72.2% compared to 3.53 g/t and a recovery of 76.0% for the same period in 2017.\nOperating costs and All-in Measures:\nOperating costs (on a sales basis) NG , including capitalized stripping, decreased in the first quarter of 2018 by $10.6 million to $ 71.3 million compared to $81.9 million in the same period of 2017. The movements in the major components of operating costs (mining, milling and site support), including capitalized stripping but before changes in inventory, is explained below:\nMining Costs, including capitalized stripping (First Quarter 2018 compared to First Quarter 2017):\nhttp://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/e470688a-2c10-45c7-a71b-44084a3fe45d\nMining costs, including capitalized stripping, totaled $51.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, which was $3.4 million higher than the comparative quarter in 2017. Increased costs for first quarter of 2018 includes higher diesel costs ($5.3 million), which was due to higher consumption resulting from an increase in tonnes mined and higher fuel prices, as well as higher labour costs ($0.8 million) mainly due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuation. Higher costs were partially offset by lower maintenance costs ($2.6 million) resulting from increased work on the Hitachi shovels and haul trucks conducted in the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the first quarter of 2018.\nMilling Costs (First Quarter 2018 compared to First Quarter 2017):\nMilling costs amounted to $15.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $15.4 million in the comparative quarter of 2017. Higher mill reagent costs ($0.7 million) were mainly due to increased processed tonnes in the mill. This was offset by lower liner costs ($0.7 million) resulting from liner replacements in March 2017, which replacements were not performed during the first quarter of 2018.\nSite support Costs (First Quarter 2018 compared to First Quarter 2017):\nSite support costs in the first quarter of 2018 totalled $12.9 million compared to $10.7 million in 2017. The increase is attributable primarily to higher costs for food supplies and other miscellaneous costs.\nOther Cost movements\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) associated with sales decreased to $ 35.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $ 37.2 million in the comparative period, mainly due to fewer ounces sold.\nAll-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce sold NG , which excludes revenue-based tax, was $758 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $763 in the same period of 2017. The decrease was mainly due to lower pre-strip capitalized costs incurred, as a result of higher mining costs expensed in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by lower ounces sold.\nIncluding revenue-based taxes, all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce sold NG was $942 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $935 in the same period of 2017. The increase is mainly due to higher all-in sustaining costs NG (explained above).\nMount Milligan Mine\nThe Mount Milligan Mine is an open pit mine located in north central British Columbia, Canada producing a gold and copper concentrate. Production at Mount Milligan is subject to a streaming arrangement with Royal Gold, Inc. and RGLD GOLD AG (collectively, “Royal Gold”) referred to hereafter as the “Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement” pursuant to which Royal Gold is entitled to purchase 35% of the gold produced and 18.75% of the copper production at the Mount Milligan mine for $435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered.\nRecent Developments – Water Balance\nAs previously discussed:\nOn December 27, 2017, milling operations were suspended at Mount Milligan resulting from lower than expected fresh reclaim water volumes in the tailings storage facility (TSF), which is used for mill processing operations. On February 5, 2018, the Company reported that its Mount Milligan operation restarted mill operations at a reduced capacity, utilizing one ball mill to minimize water requirements. Mill operations achieved sustainable mill throughput levels of approximately 30,000 tonnes per day (tpd) by mid-February. The Company received an amendment to the Mount Milligan Environmental Assessment Certificate that allows for limited withdrawal of water from Philip Lake until October 2018. Mount Milligan began drawing water from the lake in early March 2018. The Company expects to carry out the necessary studies, and to consult with affected First Nations groups to work toward a further long-term amendment to the Environmental Assessment Certificate. On March 23, 2018, the second ball mill was started, with throughput steadily increasing to 40,000 tpd by end of March. After the freshet (spring melt) the mill throughput is planned to be steadily increased and is expected to average 55,000 tonnes per calendar day for the second half of 2018.\nMount Milligan Operating Results ($ millions, except as noted) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Financial Highlights: Gold sales 16.1 56.1 (71 %) Copper sales 10.0 28.6 (65 %) Total Revenues 26.1 84.7 (69 %) Cost of sales (cash) 19.9 50.7 (61 %) Cost of sales (non-cash) 4.3 15.0 (71 %) Cost of sales (total) 24.2 65.7 (63 %) Cash used in operations (42.4 ) (2.8 ) 1417 % Cash provided by (used in) operations before changes in working capital (1) (6.7 ) 32.0 (121 %) Operating Highlights: Tonnes mined - 000s 7,572 11,181 (32 %) Tonnes ore mined – 000s 2,230 5,865 (62 %) Tonnes milled - 000s 1,738 4,744 (63 %) Mill Head Grade Copper (%) 0.20 % 0.17 % 23 % Mill Head Grade Gold (g/t) 0.79 0.52 51 % Copper Recovery - % 83.6 % 76.2 % 10 % Gold Recovery - % 69.9 % 58.5 % 19 % Mining costs - total ($/t mined material) $ 2.37 $ 1.65 44 % Milling costs - total ($/t milled material) $ 4.96 $ 4.35 14 % Concentrate Produced (dmt) 13,536 27,751 (51 %) Payable Copper Produced (000's lbs) (4) 6,143 12,595 (51 %) Payable Gold Produced (oz) (4) 29,544 45,244 (35 %) Gold Sales (payable oz) (4) 15,513 53,232 (71 %) Copper Sales (000's payable lbs) (4) 4,506 13,612 (67 %) Average Realized Price - Gold (combined) - $/oz (1) (3) $ 1,037 $ 1,054 (2 %) Average Realized Price - Copper (combined) - $/lb (1) (3) $ 2.22 $ 2.10 6 % Capital Expenditures (sustaining) (1) - cash 12.8 4.5 181 % Capital expenditures (total) 12.8 4.5 181 % Operating Costs (on a sales basis) ('000s) (2) 19.9 50.7 (61 %) Adjusted Operating costs- $/oz sold (1) 702 443 59 % Gold - All in Sustaining costs on a by-product basis - $/oz sold (1) 1,554 530 193 % Gold - All in Sustaining costs on a by-product basis (including taxes) - $/oz sold (1) 1,565 549 185 % Gold - All in Sustaining costs on a co-product basis - $/oz sold (1) 1,303 667 95 % Copper - All in Sustaining costs on a co-product basis - $/pound sold (1) 3.08 1.86 66 %\n(1) Non-GAAP measure. See discussion under “Non-GAAP Measures” (2) Operating costs (on a sales basis) is comprised of mine operating costs such as mining, processing, site and regional office administration, royalties and production taxes, but excludes reclamation costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization. (3) The average realized price of gold is a combination of market price paid by third parties and $435 per ounce paid by Royal Gold, while the average realized price of copper is a combination of market price paid by third parties and 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered paid by Royal Gold, in each case under the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement. (4) Mount Milligan payable production and sales are presented on a 100% basis (the Mount Milligan Streaming Agreement entitles it to 35% and 18.75% of gold and copper sales, respectively). Under the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement, Royal Gold will pay $435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered. Payable production for copper and gold reflects estimated metallurgical losses resulting from handling of the concentrate and payable metal deductions, subject to metal content, levied by smelters. The current payable percentage applied is approximately 95% for copper and 97.5% for gold, which may be revised on a prospective basis after sufficient history of payable amounts is determined. Production\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, mining was focused on phases 3 and 4. Road construction to access phase 8 was completed, and stripping of waste from phase 8 is expected to start in the second quarter of 2018. Total waste and ore mined in the first quarter of 2018 was 7.6 million tonnes and total tonnes moved was 8.1 million. Due to the mill shutdown in the first quarter of 2018 and the resulting change in the mining focus including pulling forward shovel maintenance, the comparative quarter of 2017 saw higher total waste and ore mined of 11.1 million tonnes and higher total tonnes moved of 11.8 million. Mine production averaged 90,000 tpd while it was 131,000 tpd in the comparative quarter of 2017.\nTotal mill throughput was 1.7 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.7 million tonnes in the same quarter of 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, mill throughput averaged 19,000 tonnes per calendar day (roughly 30,000 tonnes per operating day), compared to 53,000 tpd in the same quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total payable gold production was 29,544 ounces compared to 45,244 ounces in the comparative quarter of 2017. Total payable copper was 6.1 million pounds in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 12.6 million pounds in the same quarter of 2017.\nOperating costs and All-in Measures\nOperating cost (on a sales basis) NG , including standby costs, in the first quarter of 2018 was $30.6 million compared to $50.7 million in the same quarter of 2017. Operating costs in the first quarter of 2018 were lower than the same quarter of 2017 mainly due to lower sales volumes.\nThe movements in the major components of operating costs (mining, milling and site support), before changes in inventory, is explained below:\nMining Costs (First Quarter 2018 compared to First Quarter 2017):\nhttp://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/df70a54a-e2cb-4ce5-8e5a-ce321c7fe671\nMining costs totalled $13.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, which was $2.3 million lower than the comparative quarter of 2017. The decrease in costs for the first quarter of 2018 includes lower maintenance cost ($1.6 million) resulting from a settlement of a long term maintenance agreement, lower explosive costs ($1.4 million) due to lower tonnes mined (7.6 million tonnes versus 11.1 million tonnes), impact of a reduced power factor, higher TSF allocation costs ($1.2 million) due to higher waste mined and moved to the TSF and lower other mining costs ($0.4 million). This was partially offset by higher labour cost ($1.8 million) due to an increase in manpower, higher diesel costs ($0.4 million) due to higher prices, and higher costs for other operating material and supplies ($0.4 million).\nMilling Costs, including standby costs (First Quarter 2018 compared to First Quarter 2017):\nhttp://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/4a4219e8-4a03-498d-ac76-632540b60401\nMilling costs (including standby costs) totalled $19.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $20.6 million in the comparative quarter of 2017. The decrease in operating costs was due to lower electricity costs ($3.1 million) and milling consumable costs ($2.9 million), partially offset by higher labour costs ($2.4 million) due to an increase in manpower with the addition of a maintenance night shift crew and higher maintenance materials costs ($1.9 million) as the opportunity was taken to bring forward maintenance work during the mill suspension. In addition, rental costs were higher ($0.4 million) due to additional pumps and generators to proceed with water resources management.\nOther Cost movements\nSite support costs in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $10.5 million versus $9.8 million in comparative quarter of 2017. The increase in site support costs include higher administration costs for materials and supplies ($0.7 million), higher labour costs ($0.5 million) due to increased manpower, higher environmental consultants costs ($0.4 million) associated with EA expansion and other various cost increases. This was partially offset by lower royalties costs ($1.5 million) resulting from lower product sales.\nDD&A was $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared $15.9 million in the comparative quarter of 2017, reflecting decreased production and sales levels.\nAll-in sustaining costs before tax on a by-product basis per ounce sold NG was $1,554 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $530 in the first quarter of 2017. The unit cost increase results from recording only one concentrate shipment in the first quarter of 2018 (due to the reduced mill production) compared to three concentrate shipments in the same period of 2017 (15,513 ounces versus 53,232 ounces).\nAll-in sustaining costs after tax on a by-product basis per ounce sold NG was $1,565 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $549 in the first quarter of 2017.\nCapital expenditure in the first quarter of 2018 was $12.8 million which includes tailings storage facility ($4.7 million), major repair of mining equipment ($3.4 million), Philip Lake infrastructure development ($2.0 million), purchase of milling equipment ($1.0 million), development of additional water wells ($0.8 million) and purchase of upper camp trailers and other projects ($0.8 million). Sustaining capital NG expenditures in the comparative quarter of 2017 was $4.5 million including spending on the tailings storage facility ($3.4 million), major repair of mining equipment ($0.4 million), purchase of mining equipment ($0.4 million) and other projects ($0.3 million).\nMolybdenum Business\nThe molybdenum business includes two North American primary molybdenum mines that are currently on care and maintenance: the Thompson Creek Mine (\"TC Mine\") (mine and mill) in Idaho, U.S.A. and the 75%-owned Endako Mine (mine, mill and roaster) in British Columbia, Canada. The molybdenum business also includes the Langeloth metallurgical roasting facility (the \"Langeloth Facility\") in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. TC Mine operates a commercial molybdenum beneficiation circuit to treat molybdenum concentrates to supplement the concentrate feed sourced directly for the Langeloth Facility. This beneficiation process at the TC Mine has allowed the Company to process high copper molybdenum concentrate purchased from third parties, which is then transported to the Langeloth Facility for processing.\nThe molybdenum business provides tolling services for customers by converting molybdenum concentrates to molybdenum oxide powder and briquettes and ferromolybdenum products. Additionally, molybdenum concentrates are also purchased to convert to upgraded products which are then sold in the metallurgical and chemical markets.\nMolybdenum Operating Results ($ millions, except as noted) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Financial Highlights: Molybdenum (Mo) Sales - $ millions 54.1 34.3 58 % Tolling, Calcining and Other 2.2 2.2 (1 %) Total Revenues and Other Income 56.3 36.5 54 % Cost of sales - cash 48.9 31.6 55 % Cost of sales - non-cash 1.4 2.0 (34 %) Cost of Sales - Total 50.3 33.7 49 % Care & Maintenance costs - Molybdenum mines 2.6 3.3 (21 %) Total capital expenditure 0.2 - 354 % Cash used in operations (9.2 ) (2.3 ) 294 % Cash provided by operations before changes in working capital (1) 4.3 1.7 145 % Production Highlights: Mo purchased 4,034 2,826 43 % Mo oxide roasted 4,307 4,734 (9 %) Mo sold 4,431 4,023 10 % Toll roasted and upgraded Mo 1,241 1,689 (27 %)\n(2) Cash (used in) provided by operations before changes in working capital, is a non-GAAP measure and is discussed under “Non-GAAP Measures”. Production:\nA total of 4.4 million pounds of molybdenum were sold and 1.2 million pounds were tolled during the first quarter of 2018 resulting in sales revenue of $56.3 million. In the first quarter of 2018, the molybdenum business generated $4.3 million of cash from the operations before changes in working capital NG , net of $2.6 million in care and maintenance expenses at the two molybdenum mines. Total capital spending was $0.2 million.\nDevelopment Projects\nÖksüt Project:\nAt the Öksüt Project in Turkey, the Company spent $5.4 million during the first quarter of 2018 ($2.1 million during the first quarter of 2017) on fees payable in connection with the pastureland permit and further development activities to enable commencement of the construction phase of the project.\nIn January 2018, OMAS received approval of its pastureland permit for the Öksüt Project and construction activities at the Öksüt Project commenced in late March 2018 with the mobilizing of construction crews and construction of the main access road started. The first gold pour is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2020. OMAS is expected to invest approximately $220 million over 22 months to bring the Öksüt Project into production.\nIn February 2018, OMAS received an Investment Incentive Certificate (“IIC”) from the Turkish Ministry of Economy for the development of the Company’s Öksüt Project. The IIC provides tax related advantages such as a decrease of corporate income tax rate from 20% to 2%, VAT and customs duty exemptions, and government support for social security premiums and interest payments on loans.\nKemess Underground Project:\nOn January 8, 2018, the Company completed the AuRico Acquisition, which has a 100% interest in the Kemess Project located in north-central British Columbia, Canada. The Kemess Project site (or “Kemess”) includes infrastructure from the past producing Kemess South mine. There are currently no mining operations or mine development activities at the Kemess site and on-site activities are restricted to care and maintenance activities until such time when a decision is made to proceed with the development of the proposed Kemess Underground Project.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company spent $1.4 million and $0.6 million on care and maintenance and pre-development activities at Kemess, respectively. Pre-development spending at Kemess included responding to questions from regulators and stakeholders on project permit applications, engineering and various testwork for the project, as well as continued spend on project engineering and tendering of various contracts.\nThe Company continues to work at advancing the final normal course permits for the underground access and construction and expects to receive those permits in the second half of 2018. No construction decision has, as yet, been made on the Kemess Project.\nDuring the quarter, the Centerra board approved an updated development program of $48 million for 2018 to further advance the project. The program is expected to focus on pre-construction activities (totalling $31 million), including the purchase of a water treatment and water discharge system, $11 million to be spent on care & maintenance on the property and $4 million to be recognized as pre-development expense.\nGreenstone Gold Property:\nAs previously disclosed, the Greenstone Partnership has not made a development or construction decision on the Hardrock Project. The Greenstone Partnership completed and submitted the Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Assessment (“EIS/EA”) to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (“CEAA”) and Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (“MOECC”) in July 2017, and anticipates a decision by year-end.\nThe Greenstone Partnership undertook other activities in the first quarter of 2018 to de-risk the profile of the project.\nThe Company spent $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 ($2.3 million in 2017) addressing comments on the EIS/EA, permitting work, engineering on public infrastructure programs and engineering to support permit applications, and continued engagement with Aboriginal communities in negotiating impact benefit agreements.\nTo date, Centerra’s funding towards its C$185 million commitment in the Greenstone Partnership totals C$71.9 million ($55.3 million).\nQuarterly Results – Previous Eight Quarters\nOver the last eight quarters, Centerra’s results reflect the impact of decreasing input costs (mainly for consumables) which have seen a continued decrease since 2016, except for diesel prices which increased in 2017 and into the first quarter of 2018. Over the same periods, gold prices progressively increased over the first three quarters of 2016, until dropping in the fourth quarter and resumed a steady increase over the 2017 year and into the first quarter of 2018. In 2017, the Euro, Canadian dollar, Mongolian tugrik and Kyrgyz som appreciated against the U.S. dollar thereby putting pressure on operating costs spent in these currencies. These currencies held their own in the first quarter of 2018. Comparatively, most currencies weakened in 2016 as compared to the U.S. dollar which had a positive impact on foreign-denominated costs (such as labour). The Company reduced its carrying value of its Mongolian assets by $41.3 million (pre-tax) in the second quarter of 2017 and recorded a provision of $60 million in connection with the Strategic Agreement in the third quarter of 2017. The quarterly production profile at Kumtor for 2017 was more consistent across each quarter, while the production profile in 2016 was more concentrated in the last nine months of the year. Non-cash costs have progressively increased at Kumtor due to its expanded mining fleet and the increased amortization of capitalized stripping resulting from increased stripping as the Central pit has become larger. The addition of Mount Milligan’s results began with the closing of the acquisition of Thompson Creek on October 20, 2016. The quarterly financial results for the last eight quarters are shown below:\n$ million, except per share data 2018 2017 2016 Quarterly data unaudited Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Revenue 235 358 276 279 285 306 220 162 Net earnings (loss) 9 130 (1 ) 23 57 64 67 3 Basic earnings (loss) per share 0.03 0.45 - 0.08 0.20 0.23 0.28 0.01 Diluted earnings (loss) per share 0.03 0.43 - 0.08 0.20 0.23 0.28 - Other Corporate Developments\nThe following is a summary of corporate developments with respect to matters affecting the Company and its subsidiaries. Readers are cautioned that there are a number of legal and regulatory matters that are currently affecting the Company and that the following is only a brief summary of such matters. For a more complete discussion of these matters, see the Company’s news releases and its 2017 Annual Information Form and specifically the section entitled “Risks that can affect our business” therein available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . The following summary also contains forward-looking statements and readers are referred to “Caution Regarding Forward-looking Information”.\nKyrgyz Republic\nStrategic Agreement\nAs previously disclosed, Centerra and its Kyrgyz subsidiaries (Kumtor Gold Company (“KGC”) and Kumtor Operating Company) entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement (the “Strategic Agreement”) with the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (the “Government”) on behalf of the Kyrgyz Republic on September 11, 2017. The Strategic Agreement includes, among other things:\n(i) full and final reciprocal releases and resolution of all existing arbitral and environmental claims, disputes, proceedings and court orders, and releases of the Company and its Kyrgyz subsidiaries from future claims covering the same subject matter as the existing environmental claims arising from approved mine activities; (ii) the agreement of KGC to: make a one-time lump sum payment totaling $57 million to a new, government-administered Nature Development Fund ($50 million) following closing and to a new, government administered Cancer Care Support Fund ($7 million) which was paid in 2017;\nwithin 12 months of closing make a further one-time payment of $3 million to the new, government administered Cancer Care Support Fund;\nmake annual payments of $2.7 million to the Nature Development Fund, conditional on the Government continuing to comply with its obligations under the Strategic Agreement; and\naccelerate its annual payments to Kumtor’s Reclamation Trust Fund in the amount of $6 million a year until the total amount contributed by KGC reaches the total estimated reclamation cost for the Kumtor Project (representing the independent assessment of Kumtor’s current reclamation costs) subject to a minimum total reclamation cost of $69 million (which is broadly in line with KGC’s current estimated reclamation cost for the Kumtor Project); The releases of liability and outstanding payments are subject to a range of initial conditions precedent designed to protect Centerra, KGC and KOC, including (i) the approval by the Government of various outstanding items, including the Kumtor life-of-mine (LOM) plan, official reserves report and the tailings dam expansion, (ii) compliance by the Government with its obligations under the project agreements entered into by the Government, KOC and KGC in 2009 (the “Kumtor Project Agreements”), (iii) continued operation of the Kumtor Mine by KGC and KOC with all necessary permits, (iv) no expropriatory action having been taken by the Government, and (v) termination of the environmental disputes and the civil and criminal proceedings instigated by the Kyrgyz General Prosecutor’s Office on terms satisfactory to Centerra. The Government approvals conditions noted in (i) above all been obtained and the Company is continuing to work closely with the Government to expeditiously satisfy the remaining conditions precedent to the Strategic Agreement, which are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. The initial longstop date for the satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent to completion of the Strategic Agreement has been extended to May 31, 2018.\nIn connection with the Strategic Agreement, the arbitration previously commenced by Centerra, KGC and KOC against the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and Kyrgyzaltyn will be suspended until May 31, 2018. During the suspension, the parties will work towards completing the Strategic Agreement and the resolution of all outstanding matters affecting the Kumtor Project.\nOn April 19, 2018, the Kyrgyz Republic Government was dismissed following a vote of no confidence in the Kyrgyz Republic Parliament. The Company understands that a new government has been formed and Centerra will continue to work with the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to ensure the satisfaction of the remaining conditions precedent to completion of the Strategic Agreement.\nKyrgyz Republic Claims\nThe following is a summary of the claims in the Kyrgyz Republic against the Kumtor Project, including those made by Kyrgyz Republic state environmental agencies and the General Prosecutor’s office.\nSAEPF Claims\nOn September 4, 2017, the Bishkek Inter-District Court terminated a claim made by the Chui-Bishkek-Talas Local Fund of Nature Protection and Forestry Development (the “Local Fund”) of the Kyrgyz Republic State Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry (“SAEPF”) which sought compensation for alleged environmental pollution in the amount of 40,340,819 Kyrgyz soms (approximately $580,000 based on the exchange rate of 69.6105 Kyrgyz soms per US$1.00).\nOn September 4, 2017, the Bishkek Inter-District Court also terminated the claim made by SAEPF which had alleged that Kumtor owes additional environmental pollution fees in the amount of approximately $220 million. The court also lifted the interim court order which prohibited KGC from taking any actions relating to certain financial transactions including, transferring property or assets, declaring or paying dividends, pledging assets or making loans. As a result, KGC transferred cash balances over and above its ordinary working capital requirements to Centerra on September 15, 2017, when the lifting of the interim court order became effective.\nSIETS Claims\nAs previously disclosed, on May 25, 2016, the Bishkek Inter-District Court in the Kyrgyz Republic ruled against Kumtor Operating Company (“KOC”), Centerra’s wholly-owned subsidiary, on two claims made by the State Inspectorate Office for Environmental and Technical Safety of the Kyrgyz Republic (“SIETS”) in relation to the placement of waste rock at the Kumtor waste dumps and unrecorded wastes from Kumtor’s effluent and sewage treatment plants. The Inter-District Court awarded damages of 6,698,878,290 Kyrgyz soms (approximately $94.4 million at current exchange rates) and 663,839 Kyrgyz soms (approximately $9,300 at current exchange rates), respectively. On June 1, 2016, the Inter-District Court ruled against KOC on two other claims made by SIETS in relation to alleged land damage and failure to pay for water use. The Inter-District Court awarded damages of 161,840,109 Kyrgyz soms (approximately $2.3 million) and 188,533,730 Kyrgyz soms (approximately $2.7 million), respectively.\nOn March 27, 2018, upon the application of SIETS, the Bishkek City Court terminated each of the SIETS claims noted above, though we understand that SIETS has subsequently filed applications to re-open those claims.\nKyrgyz Republic General Prosecutor’s Office Proceedings\nThe Company is and was subject to a number of other criminal proceedings commenced by the Kyrgyz Republic General Prosecutor’s Office and other Kyrgyz Republic state agencies as described below. However, the Strategic Agreement provides a pathway to the resolution of claims, except as noted below.\nCriminal Proceedings Against Unnamed KGC Managers\nOn May 30, 2016, a criminal case was opened by the Kyrgyz Republic General Prosecutor’s Office (“GPO”) against unnamed KGC managers alleging that such managers engaged in transactions that deprived KGC of its assets or otherwise abused their authority, causing damage to the Kyrgyz Republic. Specifically, the case appears to be focused on the reasonableness of certain of KGC’s commercial transactions and in particular, the purchase of goods and supplies in the normal course of its business operations and the expenses relating to the relocation of the Kumtor Project’s camp in 2014 and 2015. Further to such investigation, the GPO has carried out searches of KGC’s offices and seized documents and records. The Company has received notice that this proceeding has been terminated as of March 15, 2018\n2013 KGC Dividend Civil and Criminal Proceeding\nOn June 3, 2016, the Inter-District Court renewed a claim previously commenced by the GPO seeking to unwind the $200 million dividend paid by KGC to Centerra in December 2013 (the “2013 Dividend”). On September 14, 2017, the Bishkek Inter-District Court determined to leave the claim without review and, accordingly, the claim has been terminated. The Company understands that the GPO also initiated a criminal investigation of executives of the Company and KGC in respect of the 2013 Dividend but that investigation was terminated on February 28, 2018.\nCriminal Investigation into Environmental Matters\nKGC is also aware of an outstanding criminal investigation in the Kyrgyz Republic which concerns the same subject matter as the SIETS claims described above. The Company expects that this investigation will be terminated in connection with the Strategic Agreement.\nLand Use Claim\nAs previously noted, KGC had challenged the purported 2012 cancellation of its land use (surface) rights over the Kumtor concession areas in the Kyrgyz Republic courts as well as in its arbitration claim (described above). On August 28, 2017, the Bishkek Inter-District Court terminated the proceeding commenced by the GPO in respect of Kumtor’s land use rights over the Kumtor concession area. The Company expects that new land use certificates will be issued to Kumtor prior to completion of the Strategic Agreement.\nKGC Employee Movement Restrictions\nIn connection with certain of the foregoing criminal investigations, restrictions had been imposed by the Kyrgyz Republic on certain KGC managers and employees, which prohibit them from leaving the Kyrgyz Republic. The Company understands that all such movement restrictions have now been lifted.\nGPO Review of Kumtor Project Agreements\nOn June 14, 2016, according to reports in the Kyrgyz Republic, the Kyrgyz Republic President instructed the GPO to investigate the legality of the agreements relating to the Kumtor Project which were entered into in 2003, 2004 and 2009. The 2009 Restated Investment Agreement governing the Kumtor Project which was entered into in 2009 superseded entirely the 2003 and 2004 agreements. The 2009 Restated Investment Agreement was negotiated with the Kyrgyz Republic Government, Kyrgyzaltyn and their international advisers, and approved by all relevant Kyrgyz Republic state authorities, including the Kyrgyz Republic Parliament and any disputes under the 2009 Restated Investment Agreement are subject to resolution by international arbitration. The Company understands that this investigation has been closed with respect to certain individuals.\nCriminal Charges Regarding 2016 Casualty at Kumtor Mill\nOn June 16, 2016, the Investigator of the Jety-Oguz District Department of Interior Affairs initiated criminal proceedings against two KGC managers in relation to the previously disclosed death of a KGC employee due to an industrial accident which occurred in January 2016. On July 11, 2017, the criminal proceedings were dismissed by the Kyrgyz courts but were later sent for new consideration by the courts upon the request of the deceased’s family. This claim is not expected to be resolved in connection with the Strategic Agreement.\nManagement Assessment of Outstanding Kumtor Matters\nAs noted above, the Strategic Agreement contained no admission on the part of Centerra or its Kyrgyz subsidiaries of: (i) any environmental wrongdoing, (ii) any non-compliance with Kyrgyz law or the Kumtor Project Agreements or (iii) any pre-existing obligation to make additional environmental or Reclamation Trust Fund payments or environmental remediation efforts. The Company and KGC continue to dispute all of the allegations noted above.\nWhile the Strategic Agreement provides a pathway for the resolution of all outstanding matters affecting the Kumtor Project, there are no assurances that all of the conditions precedent to the completion of the settlement contained in the Strategic Agreement will be satisfied. If the settlement contained in the Strategic Agreement is not completed, there are no assurances that (i) the Company will be able to successfully resolve any or all of the outstanding matters affecting the Kumtor Project or that any future discussions between the Kyrgyz Republic Government and Centerra will result in a mutually acceptable resolution; or (ii) the Kyrgyz Republic Government and/or Parliament will not take actions that are inconsistent with the Government’s obligations under the Strategic Agreement or Kumtor Project Agreements, including adopting a law “denouncing” or purporting to cancel or invalidate the Kumtor Project Agreements or laws enacted in relation thereto which have the effect of nationalization of the Kumtor Project.\nThe inability to successfully resolve all such matters, whether through the Strategic Agreement or otherwise, could lead to suspension of operations of the Kumtor Project and would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, if all such claims are not resolved as provided for in the Strategic Agreement and despite the Company’s view that all disputes related to the 2009 Restated Investment Agreement should be determined in arbitration, there are risks that the arbitrator may (i) reject the Company’s claims; (ii) determine it does not have jurisdiction; and/or (iii) stay the arbitration pending determination of certain issues by the Kyrgyz Republic courts. Even if the Company receives an arbitral award in its favour against the Kyrgyz Republic and/or Kyrgyzaltyn, there are no assurances that it will be recognized or enforced in the Kyrgyz Republic. Accordingly, the Company may be obligated to pay part of or the full amounts of, among others, the SIETS and SAEPF claims regardless of the action taken by the arbitrator. The Company does not have insurance or litigation reserves to cover these costs. If the Company were obligated to pay these amounts, it would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.\nMongolia\nClaim Against the Mongolian Mineral Resources Authority to Annul Certain Administrative Decisions Related to Gatsuurt Mining Licenses.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, a non-governmental organization called “Movement to Save Mt. Noyon” filed a claim in Mongolian court against the Mongolian Mineral Resources Authority (MRAM) requesting that MRAM annul two administrative decisions related to the mining licenses underlying the Gatsuurt Project. Centerra Gold Mongolia (“CGM”), the wholly owned subsidiary of Centerra and the holder of these mining licenses, is involved in the claim as a third party. One administrative decision related to a routine approval of a change of name of the Gatsuurt license holder. That administrative decision does not affect the validity of the Gatsuurt licenses. The second decision related to a non-material license. The claimant’s request has previously been granted twice (in May 2016 and May 2017) by the lower court and overturned both times on appeal. On July 26, 2017, the Mongolian lower court granted the claimant’s request to suspend the two administrative acts and that decision has subsequently been upheld by an appellate court. While Centerra believes that this claim is without merit, there are no assurances that the claim will be resolved in favour of CGM. Subsequent adverse rulings of the Mongolian courts which may otherwise relate to the Gatsuurt licenses or delays in the court process may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations or financial condition.\nAccounting Estimates, Policies and Changes\nAccounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS required management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The critical estimates and judgments applied in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are consistent with those used in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAccounting policies and recent changes\nThe accounting policies applied in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are consistent with those used in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, with the exceptions listed in note 3 of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nRecently issued but not adopted accounting guidance\nNote 3 in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 presents a list of recently issued accounting standards either adopted or not yet adopted by the Company, provides a brief description on the nature of these changes and potential impact on the Company. The Company adopted IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in its first quarter 2018 results with minimal impact. Recently issued accounting standards and amendments not yet adopted related to IFRS 16, Leases and amendments and IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, which come into effect on January 1, 2019.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”)\nThe Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, is responsible for the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) and internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Centerra adheres to the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s (COSO) revised 2013 Internal Control Framework for the design of its ICFR. There was no material change to the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe evaluation of DC&P and ICFR was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of management, including Centerra’s CEO and CFO. Based on these evaluations, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the design of these DC&P and ICFR were effective throughout the first quarter of 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nProduction, cost and capital forecasts for 2018 are forward-looking information and are based on key assumptions and subject to material risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are discussed herein under the headings “Risks That Can Affect Our Business”, “Material Assumptions & Risks” and “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information” in this document. Also refer to the Company’s most recent Annual Information Form and specifically the section entitled “Risks That Can Affect Our Business” therein available on SEDAR.\n2018 Gold Production\nCenterra’s 2018 gold production is expected to be between 645,000 to 715,000 ounces, which is unchanged from the previous guidance disclosed in the Company’s news release of February 23, 2018. Kumtor’s gold production forecast is expected to be in the range of 450,000 ounces to 500,000 ounces and Mount Milligan’s payable gold production is expected to be in the range of 195,000 to 215,000 ounces, which is unchanged from the previous guidance. Kumtor and Mount Milligan are expected to generate about 45% and 30% of their annual gold production, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nCenterra’s 2018 guidance for production, exploration, corporate administration, royalty income and DD&A expense is unchanged from the previous guidance disclosed in the Company’s news release of February 23, 2018. Centerra’s 2018 guidance for capital spending has been revised to reflect additional planned spending on the Kemess Underground Project and reclassification of some Kemess costs from capital expenditures to pre-development, care and maintenance, and G&A costs.\n2018 Copper Production\nPayable copper production is expected to be in the range of 47 million pounds to 52 million pounds, which is unchanged from the previous guidance.\nCenterra’s 2018 production is forecast as follows:\n2018 Production Guidance Units Kumtor Mount Milligan (1) Centerra Gold Unstreamed Gold Payable Production (Koz) 450 – 500 127 – 140 577 – 640 Streamed Gold Payable Production (1) (Koz) – 68 – 75 68 – 75 Total Gold Payable Production (2) (Koz) 450 – 500 195 – 215 645 – 715 Copper Unstreamed Copper Payable Production (Mlb) – 38 – 42 38 – 42 Streamed Copper Payable Production (1) (Mlb) – 9 – 10 9 – 10 Total Copper Payable Production (3) (Mlb) – 47 – 52 47 – 52\n1) The Royal Gold Stream Arrangement entitles Royal Gold to 35% and 18.75% of gold and copper sales, respectively, from the Mount Milligan Mine and Royal Gold will pay $435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered. 2) Gold production assumes 79% recovery at Kumtor and 61% recovery at Mount Milligan. 3) Copper production assumes 79% recovery for copper at Mount Milligan. Forecast production in 2018 at Mount Milligan is dependent on sufficient water being available throughout the year. As discussed earlier, Mount Milligan is pursuing more permanent permitting solutions to allow higher levels of pumping from current water sources and is developing additional ground water sources. Should the spring melt provide average water flow into the tailing ponds and permit extensions or new access to additional water sources not materialize, we expect that production throughput will need to be reduced during winter months in the first quarter of 2019 to preserve water, thereby negatively impacting production levels.\n2018 All-in Sustaining Unit Costs NG\nCenterra’s 2018 all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold NG on a by-product basis are unchanged from the previous guidance and are forecast as follows:\n2018 All-in Sustaining Unit Costs NG (4) Kumtor Mount Milligan (2) Centerra Ounces sold forecast 450,000 – 500,000 195,000 – 215,000 645,000-715,000 All-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis (1), (2) $733 – $815 $806 – $888 $799 – $885 Revenue-based tax (3) and taxes (3) 171 – 190 19 – 21 125 – 139 All-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis, including taxes (1), (2), (3) $904 – $1,005 $825 – $909 $924 – $1,024 Gold - All-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis ($/ounce) (1),(2) $733 – $815 $847 – $932 $812 – $900 Copper - All-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis ($/pound) (1),(2) – $1.90 – $2.10 $1.90 – $2.10\n1) Non-GAAP measure. See discussion under “Non-GAAP Measures” 2) Mount Milligan payable production and ounces sold are on a 100% basis (the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement entitles Royal Gold to 35% and 18.75% of gold and copper sales, respectively). Unit costs and consolidated unit costs include a credit for forecasted copper sales treated as by-product for all-in sustaining costs and all-in sustaining costs plus taxes. The copper sales are based on a copper price assumption of $3.00 per pound sold for Centerra’s 81.25% share of copper production and the remaining 18.75% of copper revenue at $0.45 per pound (15% of spot price, assuming spot at $3.00 per pound), representing the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement. Payable production for copper and gold reflects estimated metallurgical losses resulting from handling of the concentrate and payable metal deductions, subject to metal content, levied by smelters. 3) Includes revenue-based tax at Kumtor and the British Columbia mineral tax at Mount Milligan based on a forecast gold price assumption of $1,275 per ounce sold. 4) Results in chart may not add due to rounding. 2018 Capital Expenditures\nCenterra’s projected capital expenditures for 2018, excluding capitalized stripping, have been revised to $237 million, including $100 million of sustaining capital NG and $137 million of growth capital NG , compared to $242 million, including $100 million of sustaining capital NG and $142 million of growth capital NG disclosed in the previous guidance to reflect reclassification of some of the Kemess Underground Project costs to pre-development, care and maintenance, and G&A costs. All other capital expenditure estimates are unchanged from the previous guidance.\nProjected capital expenditures (excluding capitalized stripping) include:\nProjects 2018 Sustaining Capital (1)\n($ millions) 2018 Growth Capital (1)\n($ millions) Kumtor mine 49 14 Mount Milligan mine 44 - Öksüt project - 82 Kemess Underground project - 31 Greenstone Gold property - 10 Other (Thompson Creek mine, Endako mine (75%), Langeloth facility and Corporate) 7 - Consolidated Total $ 100 $ 137\n(1) Sustaining and growth capital are non-GAAP measures and are discussed under “Non-GAAP Measures”. Kemess Underground Project\nIn 2018, total planned spending on pre-construction activities at the Kemess Underground project has been increased to $48 million from $36 million in the previous guidance. The Company estimates that $11 million of the total of $48 million will be spent on care & maintenance of the property, $4 million will be recognized as pre-development expense, $2 million will be spent on G&A with the balance of $31 million classified as capital expenditures. Pre-construction activities include permitting costs, pre-construction activities related to the access corridor and the construction of water management facilities. The Company continues to engage in discussions with regulators regarding its permit applications and other approvals required in advance of a potential construction decision later in the year. Additional details related to the Kemess Underground project is described in the technical report dated July 14, 2017 and filed on SEDAR by AuRico Metals Inc. and is available in the AuRico Metals profile on SEDAR.\nSensitivities\nCenterra’s revenues, earnings and cash flows for the remaining nine months of 2018 are sensitive to changes in certain key inputs or currencies. The Company has estimated the impact of any such changes on revenues, net earnings and cash from operations.\nChange Impact on\n($ millions) Impact on\n($ per ounce sold) Costs Revenues Cash flows Net Earnings (after tax) AISC (3) on by-product basis Gold price (1) $50/oz 3.7 – 4.3 21.5 – 24.7 17.8 – 20.4 17.8 – 20.4 0 - 1 Copper price (1) 10 % 2.1 – 2.5 7.5 – 8.7 5.4 – 6.2 5.4 – 6.2 11 – 12 Diesel fuel 10 % 3.9 - 4.3 - 5.3 - 5.8 3.9 - 4.3 8 – 9 Kyrgyz som (2) 1 som 1.0 - 2.0 - 1.0 - 2.0 1.0 - 2.0 1 - 2 Canadian dollar (2) 10 cents 24.0 - 27.0 - 24.0 - 27.0 21.0 - 24.0 28 – 31\n(1) Gold and copper price sensitivities include the impact of the hedging program set up in order to mitigate gold and copper price risks. (2) Appreciation of currency against the U.S. dollar will result in higher costs and lower cash flow and earnings, depreciation of currency against the U.S. dollar results in decreased costs and increased cash flow and earnings. (3) Non-GAAP measure. See discussion under “Non-GAAP Measures”. Material Assumptions and Risks\nMaterial assumptions or factors used to forecast production and costs for the remaining nine months of 2018 include the following:\n• a gold price of $1,275 per ounce, • a copper price of $2.90 per pound, • a molybdenum price of $12 per pound, up from the previous assumption of $8.25 per pound, • exchange rates: $1USD:$1.25 CAD $1USD:71.0 Kyrgyz som, $1USD:3.5 Turkish lira $1USD:0.87 Euro • diesel fuel price assumption: $0.45/litre at Kumtor $0.82/litre at Mount Milligan, up from the previous assumption of $0.69/litre The assumed diesel price of $0.45/litre at Kumtor assumes that no Russian export duty will be paid on the fuel exports from Russia to the Kyrgyz Republic. Diesel fuel for Kumtor is sourced from separate Russian suppliers. The diesel fuel price assumptions were made when the price of oil was approximately $68 per barrel. Crude oil is a component of diesel fuel purchased by the Company, such that changes in the price of Brent crude oil generally impacts diesel fuel prices. The Company established a hedging strategy to manage changes in diesel fuel prices on the cost of operations at the Kumtor mine. The diesel fuel hedging program is a 24-month rolling program. The Company targets to hedge up to 50% of crude oil component of monthly diesel purchases exposure.\nOther material assumptions were used in forecasting production and costs for the remaining nine months of 2018. These material assumptions include the following:\nThe Company and its applicable subsidiaries throughout the year continue to meet the terms of their respective credit facilities in order to maintain current borrowings and compliance with the facilities financial covenants. That the Company and the newly installed Kyrgyz Republic Government (“Government”) continue and that the parties continue to work constructively to complete the Kumtor Strategic Agreement, that the Government does not take any actions that are contrary to the Strategic Agreement and/or the Kumtor Project Agreement and which have a material adverse impact on the Kumtor operations, and that the Kyrgyz proceedings are not reinstated or progressed contrary to the terms of the Strategic Agreement and/or the Kumtor Project Agreements. The mine plans, expertises and related permits and authorizations at Kumtor which have been received to date for 2018 are not withdrawn and that any further approvals are obtained in a timely manner from relevant governmental agencies in the Kyrgyz Republic. Any recurrence of political or civil unrest in the Kyrgyz Republic will not impact operations, including movement of people, supplies and gold shipments to and from the Kumtor mine and/or power to the mine site. Any sanctions imposed on Russian entities do not have a negative effect on the costs or availability of inputs or equipment to the Kumtor Project. The movement in the Ce",
