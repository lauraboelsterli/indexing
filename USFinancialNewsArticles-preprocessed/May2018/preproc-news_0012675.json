    "text": "ANNAPOLIS JUNCTION, MD, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nAchieved net income per diluted share of $0.22 from continuing operations, and adjusted net income per share of $0.48 versus $0.39 in the prior year Grew sales 20% or 5% excluding acquisitions and FX Completed the acquisition of the Sandvik welding wire business Improved full year adjusted net income per share outlook\nColfax Corporation (NYSE: CFX), a leading diversified industrial technology company, today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company reported first quarter 2018 net income of $25 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $39 million, or $0.31 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Income from continuing operations was $27 million or $0.22 per diluted share, including a $15 million loss on short term investments and $8 million of restructuring charges. Adjusted net income in the first quarter was $60 million, or $0.48 per share compared to $48 million or $0.39 per share for the same prior year period. Results include a $0.03 gain from a facility sale.\nFirst quarter 2018 net sales of $881 million grew 20.1% versus the comparable period of 2017, including the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects (FX). Excluding acquisitions and FX, Fabrication Technology segment sales grew 6.4%, and Air & Gas Handling segment sales increased 2.4%. First quarter 2018 Air & Gas Handling orders decreased 2.5% to $327 million compared to the prior year period. Excluding acquisitions and FX, orders decreased 24.9%. Air & Gas Handling finished the quarter with backlog of $889.5 million compared to $867.2 million at the same time in 2017.\n“We delivered another quarter of organic sales growth this quarter, led by solid performance in our Fabrication Technology business,” said Matthew Trerotola, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Market demand continues to strengthen in most of this segment’s global markets, and we are using CBS to drive further productivity improvements and advance a range of growth initiatives. This segment’s margins sequentially improved and were in-line with our expectations for full-year improvement. Our Air & Gas Handling business achieved another quarter of general industrial order growth while continuing to execute restructuring projects to address lower demand for power market applications.”\nDuring the first quarter, the Company completed its acquisition of the welding wire operations of Sandvik Materials Technology into its Fabrication Technology segment. Sandvik is a leading provider of stainless steel and nickel alloy filler metal and extends Colfax’s portfolio in the faster-growing specialty filler metal segment.\n“Colfax is well-positioned to achieve expectations for earnings growth of at least 18% in 2018,” said Mr. Trerotola. “We continue to expect overall organic sales growth supported by our faster-growing Fabrication Technology business and improving Air & Gas Handling market conditions later in the year. Restructuring actions are on target to deliver at least $25 million of savings in 2018, and we have a clear path to margin improvement. Recently-completed acquisitions are performing well and building momentum, and our pipeline of opportunities remains full.”\nReflecting first quarter performance, Colfax increased its adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year from $2.00-$2.15 to $2.05-$2.20.\nConference Call and Webcast\nColfax will host a conference call to provide details about its results today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. The call will be open to the public through +1-877-303-7908 (U.S. callers) or +1-678-373-0875 (international callers) and referencing the conference ID number 6599567 or through webcast via Colfax’s website at www.colfaxcorp.com under the “Investors” section. Access to a supplemental slide presentation can also be found at the Colfax website under the same heading. Both the audio of this call and the slide presentation will be archived on the website later today and will be available until the next quarterly call.\nAbout Colfax Corporation\nColfax Corporation is a leading diversified industrial technology company that provides air & gas handling and fabrication technology products and services to customers around the world principally under the Howden and ESAB brands.

The Company uses its Colfax Business System (CBS), a comprehensive set of tools, processes and values, to create superior value for customers, shareholders and associates. Colfax is traded on the NYSE under the ticker “CFX.” Additional information about Colfax is available at www.colfaxcorp.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Adjustments\nColfax has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, projected adjusted net income per share, adjusted operating income, organic sales growth, and organic order decline. Adjusted operating income excludes Restructuring and other related items, gain or loss on short term investments, Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge and Pension settlement loss. Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and projected adjusted net income per share exclude Restructuring and other related charges, gain or loss on short term investments, Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, Pension settlement loss, acquisition-related intangibles amortization, and other non-cash acquisition related charges. The effective tax rates used to calculate adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share was 21.1% for the first quarter ended March 30, 2018. The effective tax rates used to calculate adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share was 26.0% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Organic sales growth and organic order decline exclude the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These non-GAAP financial measures assist Colfax management in comparing its operating performance over time because certain items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult, as they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency or relate to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different from the ongoing productivity improvements of the Company. Colfax management also believes that presenting these measures allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the Company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented above to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements, including forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
