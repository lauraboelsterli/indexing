    "text": "HOLLISTON, Mass., May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Biostage, Inc. (OTCQB: BSTG), a biotechnology company developing bioengineered organ implants to treat life-threatening conditions of the esophagus, bronchus and trachea, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company also recapped a series of advances in raising additional capital, validating its technology, adding further expertise to its team, and planning its market expansion.\nSummary of First Quarter Financial Results\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $1.5 million, or a net loss per diluted share of $0.56, compared to a net loss of approximately $3.8 million, or a net loss per diluted share of $2.83 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $2.3 million year-over-year decrease in net loss was attributable to a $1.5 million decrease in research and development costs, a $700,000 decrease in non-cash expense from change in the fair value of warrants, and a $100,000 decrease in selling general and administrative expenses. Also, the Company recognized grant income for qualified expenditures from a Fast-Track SBIR grant of approximately $59,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. There was no grant income recorded in the comparable period in 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash\nAt March 31, 2018, Biostage had cash on hand of $2.8 million and had no debt. The Company used net cash of approximately $2.1 million for operations during the first quarter, approximately $700,000 of which represented payments of aged vendor payables incurred in 2017. The Company also generated approximately $800,000, net, from financing activities during the first quarter.\nOn May 3, 2018, the Company reported that two private investors had signed binding agreements to purchase a total of 1 million common shares priced at $3.60 per share. The Company expects those private placement transactions to close by the end of May.\nFirst Quarter Operating Highlights\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company continued to build on the momentum provided by its $4 million December 2017 private placement. The Company:\nPublished successful results of a pre-clinical study demonstrating esophageal regeneration in large animals Announced preliminary findings related to the first successful in-human use of a Cellspan ™ implant to regenerate a patient's esophagus Expanded the Company's scientific expertise by appointing Dr. Christine Finck and Dr. Charles Cox, Jr. to its Scientific Advisory Board Appointed Jason Chen as the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors in connection with plans to expand into the Chinese market Appointed distinguished children's hospital executive Dr. James Shmerling to the Company's Board of Directors Completed an additional $1 million private placement Received approval of a SBIR Fast-Track grant to develop its Cellspan™ Esophageal Implant (CEI) as a novel treatment for esophageal atresia in pediatric patients. An initial Phase I award of $225,000 was granted; assuming that this phase of the project is successful, Phase II would support pre-clinical testing of pediatric CEI development and could provide up to $1.5 million of additional nondilutive financial resources over two years.\nJim McGorry, Company CEO, commented, \"One of Biostage's strengths has been our development of connections and relationships with the right people which have allowed us to constantly push forward on key fronts; to focus on our plan while building converging plans with others. Our partnerships with researcher-clinicians like Drs. Finck and Cox; our collaboration with leading medical centers like Connecticut Children's and Mayo Clinic; and our relationships with market specialists like Mr. Chen, have led to the several key developments we announced during the first quarter. We made significant progress in further validating our technology and expanding our Scientific Advisory Board. We added operational and healthcare experts to our Board of Directors and raised additional capital. We added several key hires to our internal team and finalized our development plan for our pediatric esophageal product candidate in collaboration with Connecticut Children's Medical Center. We initiated proof of concept preclinical studies as part of that program. All of these things were made possible in the first quarter by the connections we've made with credible experts who share our vision and believe in our technology.\"\nJason Chen, the Chairman of Biostage's Board of Directors, weighed in, \"As Biostage pushes the frontier of regenerative medicine and works toward filing an IND to bring life-saving technology to patients, we're also diligently building a plan to expand that technology's reach to the hundreds of thousands suffering from esophageal cancer in the Chinese market. With progress every day behind the scenes along with scientific advances and expanding leadership expertise, I'm as confident as ever of Biostage's current direction, and proud to be a part of it.\"\nAbout Biostage, Inc.\nBiostage is a biotechnology company developing bioengineered organ implants based on the Company's Cellframe ™ technology which combines a proprietary biocompatible scaffold with a patient's own stem cells to create Cellspan organ implants.
