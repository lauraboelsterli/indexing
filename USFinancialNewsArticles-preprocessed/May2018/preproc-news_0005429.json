    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. (\"Mammoth\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:TUSK) today reported financial and operational results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nKey Highlights for the First Quarter 2018:\nTotal revenue was $494.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up 34% sequentially from $369.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and up 559% from $75.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $55.5 million, a $10.4 million decrease from $65.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and an improvement of $60.5 million from a net loss of $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The three months ended December 31, 2017 included a provisional benefit of $31.0 million due to changes in tax policy as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) was $130.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up 18% sequentially from $110.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and up 1,037% from $11.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Reduced debt to $39.0 million as of March 31, 2018, which is down $60.9 million from December 31, 2017. Executed two amendments to Mammoth subsidiary Cobra Acquisitions LLC's contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\"PREPA\") to aid in the restoration of the electric utility infrastructure in Puerto Rico, increasing the total contract value to approximately $945 million, up from $200 million originally. Completed the expansion of Mammoth subsidiary Taylor Frac LLC's sand facility, increasing company-wide functional sand production capacity to approximately 4.0 million tons per year, up from 3.0 million tons per year at December 31, 2017.\nArty Straehla, Mammoth's Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"The first quarter was challenging due to several factors including harsh working environments, severe winter weather and logistics issues, but our teams were able to overcome these obstacles and continue to execute at a high level. The first quarter of 2018 was our third sequential record quarter on an EBITDA basis, which was underpinned by the hard work performed by our teams in Puerto Rico. Debt was reduced by $61 million during the quarter, despite spending approximately $36 million on growth capital, highlighting our significant cash flow. The outlook for all of our operating divisions is strong and we intend to continue to grow both organically and through accretive acquisitions.\"\nPressure Pumping Services\nMammoth's pressure pumping division contributed revenues (inclusive of inter-segment revenues) of $101.1 million on 1,672 stages for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a 10% decrease from $111.9 million on 1,375 stages for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and a 149% increase from $40.6 million on 860 stages for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The sequential decline in the first quarter of 2018 was a result of a combination of significant winter weather and sand logistics constraints.\nInfrastructure Services\nMammoth's infrastructure services segment contributed revenues of $325.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a 56% increase from $209.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The infrastructure services segment did not generate revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Cobra and PREPA amended the initial PREPA contract to increase the total contract amount by an additional $745.4 million.\nNatural Sand Proppant Services\nMammoth's natural sand proppant division contributed revenues (inclusive of inter-segment revenues) of $51.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up 16% from $43.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and up 227% from $15.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company sold 735,584 tons of sand for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a 23% increase from 600,182 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and a 187% increase from 255,865 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company completed the expansion of its Taylor Frac facility during the first quarter of 2018, increasing Mammoth's total processing capacity to approximately 4.0 million tons per year. The Company is currently upgrading certain equipment at its Piranha facility, which is expected to further increase Mammoth's total sand processing capacity to 4.4 million tons per year by mid-2018.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services\nMammoth's contract land and directional drilling services division contributed revenues (inclusive of inter-segment revenues) of $15.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an 11% increase from $13.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and a 41% increase from $10.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The average drilling day rate was $16,541, $15,964 and $14,400, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nMammoth anticipates that it will operate, on average, five to six rigs throughout 2018.\nOther Services\nMammoth's other services, including coil tubing, pressure control, flowback, cementing, equipment rentals and remote accommodations, contributed revenues (inclusive of inter-segment revenues) of $22.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a 51% increase from $15.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and a 157% increase from $8.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in revenues was primarily due to increase in utilization.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased to $38.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $27.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to increased bad debt expense and increased compensation and benefits.\nSG&A expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, were 8% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 7% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, Mammoth had cash on hand totaling $10.4 million and borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility of $39.0 million.

Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the CODM manages the segments, evaluates the segment financial statements and makes key operating and resource utilization decisions. Segment evaluation is determined on a quantitative basis based on a function of operating income (loss) as well as a qualitative basis, such as nature of the product and service offerings and types of customers.\nOn June 5, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of (1) Sturgeon Acquisitions, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries Taylor Frac LLC, Taylor RE, LLC and South River, LLC (collectively, \"Sturgeon\"); (2) Stingray Energy Services and (3) Stingray Cementing (together with Stingray Energy Services, the “Stingray Acquisition”) in exchange for the issuance by Mammoth of an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of its common stock.\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company and Sturgeon were under common control and it is required under accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (\"GAAP\") to account for this common control acquisition in a manner similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Therefore, the Company's historical financial information has been recast to combine Sturgeon with the Company as if the acquisition had been completed at commencement of Sturgeon's operations on September 13, 2014.\nConference Call Information\nMammoth will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. CST (11:00 am EST) to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial and operational results.

used by management and external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Mammoth defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition related costs, equity based compensation, interest expense, net, other (income) expense, net (which is comprised of the (gain) or loss on disposal of long-lived assets) and provision (benefit) for income taxes. The Company excludes the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the energy service industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of Mammoth's operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Mammoth's computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure its ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) on a consolidated basis and for each of the Company's segments (in thousands):\nConsolidated\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss): 2018 2017 2017 Net income (loss) $ 55,546 $ (4,981 ) $ 65,915 Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense 26,908 17,237 27,770 Impairment of long-lived assets — — 4,146 Acquisition related costs (46 ) 1,247 51 Equity based compensation 1,256 570 1,093 Interest expense, net 1,237 397 1,381 Other expense, net 28 184 (28 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 45,918 (3,106 ) 10,155 Adjusted EBITDA $ 130,847 $ 11,548 $ 110,483\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nPressure Pumping Services\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss): 2018 2017 2017 Net income $ 1,959 $ 182 $ 6,338 Depreciation and amortization expense 13,986 9,158 13,590 Equity based compensation 418 271 438 Interest expense 504 128 599 Other expense, net 12 3 2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 16,879 $ 9,742 $ 20,967\nInfrastructure Services\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss): 2018 2017 2017 Net income (loss) $ 47,299 $ (134 ) $ 47,873 Depreciation and amortization expense 2,407 — 1,805 Acquisition related costs (8 ) — 8 Equity based compensation 457 — 316 Interest expense 76 — 168 Other expense (income), net 2 — (4 ) Provision for income taxes 47,957 — 29,290 Adjusted EBITDA $ 98,190 $ (134 ) $ 79,456\nNatural Sand Proppant Services\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss): 2018 2017 2017 Net income (loss) $ 9,372 $ (766 ) $ 5,263 Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense 2,316 1,363 2,791 Impairment of long-lived assets — — 324 Acquisition related costs (38 ) 1,038 42 Equity based compensation 186 70 184 Interest expense 80 133 107 Other (income) expense, net (13 ) 14 (40 ) Benefit for income taxes — — (36 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 11,903 $ 1,852 $ 8,635\nMAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss: 2018 2017 2017 Net loss $ (5,450 ) $ (6,844 ) $ (8,910 ) Depreciation expense 4,355 4,968 4,657 Impairment of long-lived assets — — 3,822 Acquisition related costs — 22 — Equity based compensation 107 112 77 Interest expense, net 395 217 467 Other expense (income), net 40 164 (6 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ (553 ) $ (1,361 ) $ 107\nOther Services (a)\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income: 2018 2017 2017 Net income $ 2,107 $ 2,581 $ 15,386 Depreciation and amortization expense 3,844 1,748 4,927 Acquisition related costs — 187 2 Equity based compensation 89 117 77 Interest expense (income), net 182 (81 ) 40 Other (income) expense, net (13 ) 3 20 Benefit for income taxes (2,038 ) (3,106 ) (19,099 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,171 $ 1,449 $ 1,353\n(a) Includes results for the Company's coil tubing, pressure control, flowback, cementing, equipment rentals and remote accommodations services and corporate related activities.\nSource:Mammoth Energy Services, Inc.",
