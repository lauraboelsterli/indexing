Ting Mobile posted another quarter of solid year-over-year revenue and margin growth. On Ting Internet, we continued to see strong adoption in our three active towns and we prepared to start lighting up customers in our next two. Meanwhile, we announced our next Ting town, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina.”\nFinancial Results\nNet revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased 38% to $95.8 million from $69.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 and benefited from the accelerated revenue recognition of $14.6 million related to a bulk transfer of 2.65 million domain names during the first quarter of 2018.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $3.7 million, or $0.35 per share, from $2.4 million, or $0.23 per share, for the first quarter of 2017 driven by the growth in Adjusted EBITDA and lower statutory tax rates as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the first quarter of 2018 increased 64% to $10.4 million from $6.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 driven by Enom and Ting Mobile.\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was $16.6 million compared with $18.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 and $15.0 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017.\nNotes:\n1. Adjusted EBITDA\nTucows reports all financial information required in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, to assist financial statement users in an assessment of our historical performance, the Company typically discloses and discusses a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted EBITDA, in press releases and on investor conference calls and related events that exclude certain non-cash and other charges as the Company believes that the non-GAAP information enhances investors' overall understanding of our financial performance.\nThe Company believes that the provision of this supplemental non-GAAP measure allows investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company’s core business using similar evaluation measures to those used by management. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA to measure its performance and prepare its budgets. Since adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure, the Company’s calculation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA is calculated before recurring cash charges, including interest expense and taxes, and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of the business, it should not be considered as a liquidity measure. Non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. The Company endeavors to compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA to net income based on U.S. GAAP, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's results. Tucows strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nThe Company’s adjusted EBITDA definition excludes depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, income tax provision, interest expense, interest income, stock-based compensation, asset impairment, gains and losses from unrealized foreign currency transactions and infrequently occurring items, including acquisition and transitions costs. Gains and losses from unrealized foreign currency transactions removes the unrealized effect of the change in the mark-to-market values on outstanding unhedged foreign currency contracts, as well as the unrealized effect from the translation of monetary accounts denominated in non-U.S. dollars to U.S. dollars.\nThe following table reconciles net income to adjusted EBITDA (dollars in thousands):\n3 months ended March 31 2018 (unaudited) 2017 (unaudited) Net income for the period 3,744 2,446 Depreciation of property and equipment 1,232 757 Amortization of intangible assets 2,331 1,761 Interest expense, net 896 868 Provision for income taxes 1,183 (125) Stock-based compensation 578 318 Unrealized loss (gain) on change in fair value of forward contracts (3) (18) Unrealized loss (gain) on foreign exchange revaluation of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities 176 (50) Acquisition and transition costs* 241 382 Adjusted EBITDA 10,378 6,339 *Acquisition and other costs represents transaction-related expenses, transitional expenses, such as duplicative post-acquisition expenses, related to our acquisition of Enom in January 2017. Expenses include severance or transitional costs associated with department, operational or overall company restructuring efforts, including geographic alignments.
