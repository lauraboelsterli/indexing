    "text": "TUCSON, Ariz., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. today announced financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The company generated revenue of $801,000, up 51% from the prior year, and reported signed agreements for 345 instruments. Contracts for customer evaluations total 256 instruments while revenue generating placements grew to 89 across the U.S. and European regions.\n“The team made considerable commercial and development progress to start the year, increasing awareness and adoption of the Accelerate Pheno™ system, and expanding its capability beyond bloodstream infections and sepsis to include patients with severe bacterial pneumonia,” said Lawrence Mehren, President and CEO. “By giving physicians the ability to optimize antibiotic therapy at least two days earlier, we continue to move closer to achieving our mission to dramatically improve outcomes for patients with these life-threatening infections.”\nThe company highlighted 12 recent customer studies shared at ECCMID, the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. These studies, all related to the Accelerate Pheno™ system, were shared at the congress by hospitals in Italy, Germany, Sweden, and the United States.\nThe company also reported progress on development of its severe bacterial pneumonia kit including alignment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on a shorter and less complex, 510(k) regulatory pathway, for the test, along with the addition of two new pathogens and three additional antibiotics. The expected start of the U.S. clinical trial remains in late Q2 to Q3.\nMr. Mehren, together with Steve Reichling, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call to review the financial results, commercial progress, and development updates at 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time on May 9, 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 results\nNet sales of $801,000 compared to $530,000 in the first quarter of 2017\nGross margin realized was 39%, impacted by one-time charges reported for the quarter\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses of $14.4 million, compared to $10.5 million in the prior year period, driven by higher personnel and customer evaluation-related costs across the U.S. and Europe\nR&D expenses for the first quarter of $6.8 million, compared to $4.3 million in the same quarter of 2017 due to investments made in preparation for activities related to the U.S. clinical trial for respiratory\nNet loss of $20.8 million, or $0.37 per share on weighted average basic shares of 55.6 million shares outstanding, which includes $5.6 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense\nNet cash used in the quarter was $16.2 million, ending the quarter with total cash, investments, and cash-equivalents from all activities of $193.6 million\nFull financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 will be filed on Form 10-Q through the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) website at http://www.sec.gov .\nAudio Webcast and Conference Call\nListen to an audio webcast of the call by visiting the events section of the company’s investor relations website at ir.axdx.com .

(Nasdaq:AXDX), is an in vitro diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions for the global challenge of antibiotic resistance and healthcare-associated infections. The company recently obtained FDA marketing authorization for antimicrobial susceptibility testing direct from positive blood culture samples using its Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC kit. The system and kit leverage proprietary molecular identification methods and morphokinetic cellular analysis (MCA) to provide minimum inhibitory concentrations for a range of applicable antibiotics. The fully-automated system is designed to eliminate the lengthy culture and sample preparation steps required prior to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Recent market studies suggest the solution offers results 1-2 days faster than conventional methods, enabling clinicians to optimize antibiotic selection, dosage, and infusion strategy specific to the individual patient and their infection.\nThe “ACCELERATE DIAGNOSTICS” and “ACCELERATE PHENO” and “ACCELERATE PHENOTEST” and diamond shaped logos and marks are trademarks or registered trademarks of Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc.\nFor more information about the company, its products or technology, visit axdx.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain of the statements made in this press release are forward looking, such as those, among others, about our projections as to when certain key business milestones may be achieved, the potential of our products or technology, the growth of the market, our estimates as to the size of our market opportunity and potential pricing, our competitive position and estimates of time reduction to results, and our future development plans and growth strategy.
