Built around SuperCom's Magna platform, the deployment will allow for quick expansion of additional e-Gov modules, which would lead to potential increases in the overall contract size.

In early 2018, announced the company is developing various cryptocurrency capabilities for its SuperPay secure mobile money suite. Upon completion, SuperPay users will be able to purchase and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies through the suite.\nIoT and Connectivity:\nIn October 2017, began the deployment of PureSecurity Electronic Monitoring (EM) Suite for GPS and home detention offender tracking and monitoring in Tennessee. SuperCom has already received initial orders under the agreement as well as follow-on orders, which should continue to ramp up over time. The project is billed at a per-unit daily rate and is already generating steady-state recurring revenues. In November 2017, announced the deployment of PureSecurity EM Suite in Atlanta, Georgia.

Also began the process of piloting features to new customers in the U.S. and Europe. Safend concluded 2017 with a greater than 90% retention rate in the U.S., driven by sustained customer satisfaction and continued technological improvements.\nManagement Commentary\n\"2017 was a banner year for SuperCom, highlighted by a dramatic transformation in our financial performance as well as growth across all of our strategic business segments and major geographic markets globally,\" said Arie Trabelsi, President and CEO of SuperCom. \"Thanks to the successful integration efforts of the previous year's acquisitions, we were able to generate record annual revenue, while also optimizing our costs in certain key areas of our business leading to a greater than 400% increase in gross profit. In the fourth quarter specifically, we grew our revenue 93% over the prior year, while also significantly reducing our expenses as a percentage of total revenue across the board.\"\n\"Operationally, we have continued to execute on our growth strategy across all our business segments. In our e-Gov division, we secured an eight-year contract with Iceland for an ePassport and National ID Card system back in September. And more recently, we signed a new contract with an existing national government customer in Africa, representing approximately $4 million in value and expected to increase our steady-state recurring revenue. This contract is in addition to other recent large-scale e-Gov deployments in Africa, which have already transitioned to steady-state and are generating recurring revenue that contributed to our improved performance. Within our IoT division, we continue to win new business in the U.S. and globally. In fact, we have announced additional wins in six locations in the last few months alone and have 11 EM deployments currently ongoing globally. And in our Cyber Security division, we ended the year with a greater than 90% retention rate in the U.S., thanks to both sustained customer satisfaction as well as continued technological improvements.\"\n\"Moving forward, we are increasingly confident in our prospects for the current year and beyond. As we have now been able to demonstrate consistently over the course of a full year, placing an emphasis on certain key areas within our business can lead to long-term revenue expansion and a solid foundation to reliably and successfully scale our operations. Additionally, we are focused on growing our margins to greater levels by winning new business and transitioning our various ongoing deployments into consistent steady-state recurring revenue generators. In all, our ultimate goal continues to be the creation of sustainable and profitable growth and value for our shareholders for the many years ahead.\"\nConference Call\nThe company will hold a conference call today (May 14, 2018) at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time / 5:00 p.m. Israel time) to discuss these results and financial outlook.\nSuperCom management will host the call, followed by a question and answer period.\nU.S. toll-free: 1-800-289-0438\nIsrael toll-free: 972-1809-212-883\nInternational: 1-323-794-2423\nConference ID: 7892404\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.
