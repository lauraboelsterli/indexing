    "text": "May 29, 2018 / 4:11 AM / Updated 17 minutes ago Major Chinese port bans some oil, chemical products ahead of summit Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nBEIJING (Reuters) - One of China’s top ports will ban handling refined oil products, liquefied petroleum gas and dangerous chemicals in early June, amid preparations for a regional summit in the city.\nUsing these products in port operations or transporting them will be banned from June 1-6, according to a statement published on the official WeChat account of the work safety watchdog in Qingdao, the nation’s top crude oil importing hub.\nThe statement did not directly refer to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit taking place in Qingdao from June 9-10, but China typically takes such steps ahead of major political gatherings to ensure they proceed with clear skies and without any accidents that could disrupt events.\nOil traders have worried in recent months that the summit could crimp flows of foreign commodities into the world’s top energy consumer.\nQingdao, a major oil refining hub in the northern province of Shandong, will also ban vessels during June 4-11 when sea visibility drops below 1 nautical mile, the statement said.\nVessel navigation in the main channel at Qingdao port could also be restricted when necessary from June 9-10.\nThe port was last year ranked the top destination for imported crude oil and second for some types of fuel oil. [O/CNPORTS]\nJointly led by Russia and China, the SCO was launched in 2001 to combat radical Islam and other regional security concerns. India and Pakistan became full members last year.
