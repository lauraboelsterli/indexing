Russia’s Hmeimim air base is operating as normal,” it said.\nThe British-based war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said explosions had been heard near the base and appeared to have come from Russian air defenses confronting an attack.(This version of the story was refiled to change spelling of Hmeimim air base throughout to conform with Reuters style) Reporting by Denis Pinchuk and Lisa Barrington; Editing by Kevin Liffey",
