    "text": "NEW YORK, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- OneJet , the air transportation network providing nonstop connectivity within medium-size markets, today announced the completion of an acquisition agreement with Ultimate JetCharters. As one of the country's premier charter operators, Ultimate JetCharters operates 30-seat Dornier and Embraer regional jet aircraft for private charter clients, as well as per-seat scheduled services on select routes under the Ultimate Air Shuttle brand.\nThe combined operation will have a collective fleet of nearly 25 aircraft by the end of 2018, including aircraft operated by Ultimate and existing operating partner, Contour Airlines. Ultimate will be integrated into OneJet's network during the course of the next month, with flights beginning on June 4th. Concurrently, OneJet will continue to accelerate the addition of Embraer ERJ aircraft to its network throughout the course of 2018; the company introduced the aircraft with the launch of service between Buffalo and Albany earlier this year.\nThe Ultimate Air Shuttle brand will remain independent and continue to operate per-seat scheduled services to and from Cincinnati, as well as private charters for corporate, casino and collegiate clients.\n\"The Ultimate team is renowned by both customers and industry colleagues for its stellar operational reliability and customer service, with over 30 years of experience providing a wonderful product to both corporate and leisure customers,\" OneJet CEO Matthew Maguire said. \"The opportunity to integrate this demonstrated level of premium service, expertise and infrastructure within our expanding network of point-to-point regional routes will further enhance the travel experience and service options for our collective customers, providing a wonderful platform for both organizations' continued growth.\"\nUltimate JetCharters CEO John Gordon said: \"Ultimate JetCharters and Ultimate Air Shuttle were built on the foundation of serving the customer. That mission will not change. In fact, combining the strengths of both companies will provide an even better service experience and additional travel options for our customers. We look forward to continuing to build a culture and operation built on these values and leveraging the capabilities of each company.\"\nTogether, the companies' networks will serve over 17 cities, including Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Albany, Buffalo, Hartford, West Palm Beach, Kansas City, New York (via Morristown, New Jersey), Chicago, Charlotte, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Louisville, Atlanta, Columbus and Raleigh-Durham.\nOneJet will make various schedule and routing adjustments during May, including the announcement of several new routes, as the Ultimate operations are integrated into its network.\nFor additional information about the companies, visit www.onejet.com or www.ultimateairshuttle.com .\nAbout OneJet\nOneJet is an air transportation network that provides consumers increased access to nonstop travel in small to midsize markets at relatively low cost.
