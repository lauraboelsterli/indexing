FILE PHOTO: Eataly logo is pictured on a wood box at the Eataly food market store in the former Smeraldo teather downtown Milan, Italy, March 20, 2016. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini\nThe grocery chain, which sells Italian delicacies at stores it has been opening around the world, is privately owned, but Guerra confirmed plans to list around 30 percent of the capital next year.\nEataly is betting on growing revenues to 690-720 million euros (609-635 million pounds) in 2020 from 465 million euros last year. It also sees adjusted core profits of 60-65 million euros in 2020. Reporting by Elisa Anzolin; writing by Francesca Landini, editing by Valentina Za",
