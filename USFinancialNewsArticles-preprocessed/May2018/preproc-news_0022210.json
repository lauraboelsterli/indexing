Dowhan has accepted the invitation and attended his first workshop in this capacity on Wednesday, March 14 th .\nIn partnership with The Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) and Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (CIMM), DMA's Council for Data Integrity enables the data services community to provide marketers and agencies with the insights they need to ensure that the data they are using is accurate, reliable and of the highest quality.\n“Brands spend billions of dollars each year on identity data,” said Dowhan. “They need full transparency into that data. I’m honored to join the DMA’s Council for Data Integrity to leverage my experience working with TruSignal to develop people-based solutions and identity graphs to help ensure advertisers get the solutions they deserve.”\nDowhan’s experience leading strategic business units, product development and marketing analytics in executive roles at leading brands like eBureau (acquired by TransUnion in 2017), Adteractive, Drugstore.com and NextCard, Inc., is expected to help in the contribution of meaningful perspective and change in the marketing industry toward greater transparency and deeper understanding.\nThe council will define labeling standards for identity data similar to the standards the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) applies to food labels – so that every marketer, agency, data provider and publisher can easily understand the sources and marketing value of their identity data.\n“As the only trade association representing the entire marketing and media value chain, DMA is delighted to have David Dowhan’s business and marketing acumen on our Council for Data Integrity,” said Data & Marketing Association CEO Tom Benton. “DMA is uniquely positioned to bring solutions to the marketing ecosystem’s most vexing challenges, and we will benefit significantly from David’s deep understanding of people-based marketing.”\nAbout DMA ( www.thedma.org ):\nFounded in 1917 and driving the data and marketing agenda for a full century, the Data & Marketing Association (DMA) champions deeper consumer engagement and business value through the innovative and responsible use of data-driven marketing.
