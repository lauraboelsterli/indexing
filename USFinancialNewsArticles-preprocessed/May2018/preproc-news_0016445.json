    "text": "- 12-Month Data Presented at American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting Demonstrated Eptinezumab Further Reduced Migraine Risk Following Third and Fourth Quarterly Infusions -\n- Biologics License Application (BLA) Submission Expected in Q1 2019 -\n- Key Clinical Data Milestones, CMC Studies and Commercial Preparedness Activities Remain on Track -\n- Strengthened the Board of Directors and Management Team –\n- Conference Call Today at 5 p.m. ET -\nBOTHELL, Wash., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALDR) (“Alder” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of migraine, today provided a business update and reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“During the first quarter of 2018, we continued to achieve key data milestones for eptinezumab that further reinforced the encouraging clinical profile demonstrated by our earlier data. At the AAN Annual Meeting in April, we presented new 12-month data from our PROMISE 1 Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating eptinezumab in prevention of episodic migraine. The data demonstrated that patients experienced even further long-term reductions in migraine following the third and fourth quarterly infusions. In addition, eptinezumab PROMISE 2 Phase 3 data in chronic migraine was selected by the AAN Science Committee as one of the most noteworthy clinical trial presentations, and was the only migraine presentation featured in the exclusive plenary session of the meeting. Further, we are encouraged by the positive feedback from the physician community regarding eptinezumab’s clinical profile and the consistency of data across clinical trials,” said Paul B. Cleveland, Alder’s Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Cleveland continued, “Our primary goal is the submission of a high-quality BLA that will meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) requirements for approval and ensure eptinezumab’s successful commercial launch. As we committed, we have completed an internal review of all activities related to our BLA and have concluded that we can achieve a high-quality BLA submission in the first quarter of 2019. To support these efforts, we have appointed Dr. Eric Carter as Interim Chief Medical Officer and have added additional outside resources to complement our team. Importantly, all key clinical and chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) study milestones remain on track, and there are no new clinical or CMC data that change our confidence in our ability to pursue FDA approval of eptinezumab. We are continuing to position the Company for our next phase of growth by enhancing our management team and Board with Eric’s appointment and with the recent additions of Erin Lavelle as Chief Operating Officer and Jeremy Green as a Director.”\n2018 Key Milestones and Company Highlights\nOn April 26, Jeremy Green, Founder and Portfolio Manager of Redmile Group, LLC, was appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors.\nIn April 2018, Alder delivered eight eptinezumab presentations at the 70th Annual AAN Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, California, which included new data from the PROMISE 1 Phase 3 clinical trial in episodic migraine patients that demonstrated the following:\nFollowing one quarterly infusion, patients with a 75% or greater response experienced increased migraine-free intervals (median 32.5 days) and improved quality of life outcomes\nLong-term and further reduction in migraine risk following the third and fourth quarterly infusions, with more than 50% of patients on average achieving a 75% reduction or greater of monthly migraine days from baseline\nOn April 23, 2018, Eric Carter was appointed as Interim Chief Medical Officer.\nOn April 16, 2018, Erin Lavelle was appointed to the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer.\nOn March 15, 2018, Alder Board member Paul B. Cleveland was appointed as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer. In February 2018, the Company received approximately $277.7 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2025 (including approximately $36.3 million from the exercise of an over-allotment option granted to the underwriters in the offering). On January 12, 2018, the Company received approximately $97.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of convertible preferred stock in a committed equity financing with certain institutional and other accredited investors affiliated with or managed by Redmile Group, LLC. On January 8, 2018, the Company announced eptinezumab significantly reduced migraine risk and met primary and all key secondary endpoints in its pivotal PROMISE 2 Phase 3 clinical trial for chronic migraine prevention . On January 5, 2018, the Company entered into a European patent settlement and global license agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals International GmbH, which clarified Alder’s freedom to develop, manufacture and commercialize eptinezumab in the United States and globally.\nUpcoming Corporate Milestones\nPlanned 2018 Corporate Milestones for eptinezumab Timing PROMISE 2 six-month data (chronic migraine) June 2018 12-month open label safety study June 2018 Pharmacokinetic comparability study 2H 2018 BLA submission Q1 2019 First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nAs of March 31, 2018, Alder had $587.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash compared to $286.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Research and development expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $74.0 million, compared to $90.7 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to lower manufacturing costs driven by timing of expenses, which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Research and development expenses for 2018 included a one-time payment of $25 million under the settlement and global license agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals International GmbH. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $11.7 million, compared to $10.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in spending was primarily due to headcount growth. Net loss applicable to common stockholders for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $117.6 million, or $1.73 per share, compared to net loss of $100.3 million, or $1.99 per share on a fully-diluted basis, for the same period in 2017.\nFinancial Outlook\nThe Company believes its available cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash will be sufficient to meet the Company’s projected operating requirements into 2020.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAlder will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss these financial results and recent corporate highlights.

Alder’s lead product candidate, eptinezumab, is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and is currently in late-stage clinical development for the prevention of migraine. Unlike other CGRP inhibitors, eptinezumab was specifically designed as an infusion therapy to address significant patient need. Alder is also developing ALD1910, a preclinical mAb that inhibits pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) for migraine prevention.
