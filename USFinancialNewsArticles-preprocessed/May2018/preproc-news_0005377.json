(NYSE:EBS) reported financial results for the quarter and three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n(in millions, except per share value) Q1 2018\n(unaudited) Q1 2017\n(unaudited) Total Revenues $117.8 $116.9 Net Income (Loss)\nNet Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share (1) ($4.9)\n($0.10) $10.5\n$0.23 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (2)\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share (2) ($1.6)\n($0.03) $14.3\n$0.29 EBITDA (2)\nEBITDA Per Diluted Share (2) $3.1\n$0.06 $25.4\n$0.51 Q1 2018 AND RECENT BUSINESS ACCOMPLISHMENTS\nProcurement Contract\nAwarded a contract valued at up to $26 million over 12 months by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the continued supply of VIGIV [Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] into the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile. VIGIV is the only therapeutic licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of complications due to smallpox vaccination.\nProduct Development\nCompleted Mutual Recognition Procedure for market authorization of BioThrax ® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed) in five Concerned Member States within the European Union – Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the U.K. and France. Initiated, together with Valneva, a Phase 1 clinical trial in the U.S. to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VLA1601, our vaccine candidate against Zika virus, using Valneva’s validated expression platform. Initial data from this trial is expected in late 2018 or early 2019. Initiated a Phase 2 dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical benefit of FLU-IGIV, an anti-influenza immune globulin being developed as an intravenous treatment for serious illness caused by influenza A infection in hospitalized patients, and developed on the Company’s hyperimmune platform, on which several marketed antibody therapeutics have been licensed, including Anthrasil ® [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (human)] and VIGIV. The clinical study will continue to enroll patients through the next influenza season and is expected to be completed in 2019.\n2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n(I) Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 (Unaudited)\nRevenues\nTotal Revenues\nFor Q1 2018, total revenues were $117.8 million, a slight increase over 2017. Total revenues reflect a delay in the timing of BioThrax deliveries as previously disclosed by the Company on February 22, 2018. In addition, Q1 2018 total revenues were impacted by the delay in the delivery of some ACAM2000 ® , (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine Live) shipments during the quarter. The Company has commenced delivery and expects to complete all delayed Q1 deliveries by the end of the second quarter.\nProduct Sales\nFor Q1 2018, product sales were $75.8 million, a decrease of 8% as compared to 2017. The decrease is principally attributable to lower BAT ® [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) - (Equine)] and BioThrax ® sales, partially offset by an increase in other product sales, principally attributable to sales of ACAM2000 ® and Raxibacumab (Anthrax Monoclonal Antibody), both of which were acquired in Q4 2017.\n(in millions)\n(unaudited) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 % Change Product Sales BioThrax ® $20.2 $43.8 (54%)\nOther 55.6 38.2 46%\nTotal Product Sales $75.8 $82.0 (8%)\nContract Manufacturing\nFor Q1 2018, revenue from the Company’s contract manufacturing operations was $26.1 million, an increase of 48% as compared to 2017. The increase primarily reflects the completion of a milestone related to the expansion of certain contract manufacturing capabilities at the Company’s Lansing site.\nContracts and Grants\nFor Q1 2018, contracts and grants revenue was $15.9 million, a decrease of 8% as compared to 2017. The decrease primarily reflects a reduction in revenue associated with the successful completion of multiple U.S. government development contracts as well as reduced R&D activities related to certain ongoing funded development programs.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nFor Q1 2018, cost of product sales and contract manufacturing was $58.0 million, an increase of 25% as compared to 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to sales of ACAM2000 and Raxibacumab, both of which were acquired in Q4 2017, partially offset by lower sales of BAT and BioThrax.\nResearch and Development (Gross and Net)\nFor Q1 2018, gross R&D expenses were $29.1 million, an increase of 42% as compared to 2017. The increase primarily reflects increased contract development services performed for NuThrax TM (anthrax vaccine adsorbed with CPG 7909 adjuvant) and the introduction of costs associated with development work related to the technology transfer of the Raxibacumab manufacturing process to the Company’s Bayview manufacturing site in Baltimore.\nFor Q1 2018, net R&D expense (calculated as gross research and development expenses minus contracts and grants revenue) was $13.2 million, an increase of $10 million as compared to 2017, reflecting increased investment in countermeasure development programs not currently funded in whole or in part by third-party partners, notably costs associated with the Raxibacumab technology transfer, the FLU-IGIV flu therapeutic Phase 2 trial, the ZIKV-IG Zika therapeutic Phase 1 trial preparations, and the UNI-FLU universal flu vaccine preclinical effort, among others.\n(in millions)\n(unaudited) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 % Change Research and Development Expenses $29.1 $20.5 42%\nAdjustments: - Contracts and grants revenue $15.9 $17.3 (8%)\nNet Research and Development Expenses $13.2 $3.2 313%\nSelling, General and Administrative\nFor Q1 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses were $40.2 million, an increase of $5 million as compared to 2017, attributable primarily to increased stock compensation and professional services costs.\nIncome Taxes\nFor Q1 2018, the tax benefit in the amount of $4.5 million includes a discrete benefit of $2.3 million related to stock compensation activity resulting in an effective tax rate of 48%. Excluding the discrete benefit, the Q1 2018 effective tax rate was 24%.\nNet Income (Loss) & Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nFor Q1 2018, the Company recorded a net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, versus net income of $10.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in 2017. (1)\nFor Q1 2018, the Company recorded an adjusted net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, versus net income of $14.3 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in 2017. (1) (2)\n2018 FINANCIAL FORECAST & OPERATIONAL GOALS\nThe Company is reaffirming its full year 2018 financial performance forecast:\nTotal Revenue $715 million to $755 million Pre-Tax Income $120 million to $140 million Net Income (3) $95 million to $110 million Adjusted Net Income (2) (3) $110 million to $125 million EBITDA (2) (3) $175 million to $190 million The Company is also reaffirming its full year 2018 operational goals:\nAdvance NuThrax development to enable Emergency Use Authorization filing with the FDA in 2018 Complete ACAM2000 deliveries; establish a multi-year follow-on contract with the U.S. government Deliver Raxibacumab doses under current contract; advance technology transfer to the Company’s Bayview facility in Baltimore, Maryland Progress pipeline to have at least four product candidates in advanced development Complete an acquisition that generates revenue within 12 months of closing\nQ2 2018 FINANCIAL FORECAST\nThe Company forecast for Q2 2018 total revenue is $205 million to $230 million. This forecast reflects the deliveries of BioThrax and ACAM2000 previously expected in the first quarter as well as continued deliveries of both products in the second quarter.\nFOOTNOTES\n(1) See “Calculation of Diluted Earnings Per Share.”\n(2) See “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and EBITDA” for a definition of terms and a reconciliation table.\n(3) Reflects an estimated tax rate that includes the expected effects of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on the Company’s 2018 income tax provision.\n(4) “Net revenue” is computed as Total Revenue minus Contracts & Grants Revenue.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST INFORMATION\nCompany management will host a conference call at 5:00 pm (Eastern Time) today, May 3, 2018, to discuss these financial results.

Such a method only applies to results prior to November 14, 2017, the date the Company terminated conversion rights associated with the 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the Notes). This method requires net income to be adjusted to add back interest expense and amortization of debt issuance cost, both net of tax, associated with the Notes. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, Net income (loss) per diluted share was calculated using the “treasury method.” The following table details the adjustments made in this calculation.\n(in millions, except per share value)\n(unaudited) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net Income (Loss) ($4.9)\n$10.5 Adjustments: + Interest expense, net of tax -- 0.9 + Amortization of debt issuance costs, net of tax -- 0.2 Net Income (Loss), adjusted (“if converted”)\nNet Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share, adjusted (“if converted”) ($4.9)\n($0.10) $11.6\n$0.23 Weighted Average Diluted Shares 49.6 49.7 RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND EBITDA\nThis press release contains two financial measures (Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization)) that are considered “non-GAAP” financial measures under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Adjusted Net Income adjusts for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict, or reflect the non-cash impact of charges resulting from purchase accounting. EBITDA reflects net income excluding the impact of depreciation, amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes. The Company views these non-GAAP financial measures as a means to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company’s historical operating results and comparison to competitors’ operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business.\nThe determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (Unaudited)\n(in millions, except per share value) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Source Net Income (Loss) ($4.9)\n$10.5 N/A Adjustments: + Acquisition-related costs (transaction & integration) 0.2 0.6 SG&A + Non-cash amortization charges 4.0 1.9 COGS, SG&A,\nOther Income + Exit and disposal costs -- 1.4 SG&A + Impact of purchase accounting on inventory step-up -- 1.8 COGS Tax effect (0.9)\n(2.0)\nTotal Adjustments: 3.3 3.7 Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Diluted Share ($1.6)\n($0.03) $14.2\n$0.29 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA (Unaudited)\n(in millions, except per share value) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net Income (Loss) ($4.9)\n$10.5 Adjustments: + Depreciation & Amortization 12.3 9.8 + Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes (4.5)\n3.2 + Total Interest Expense 0.2 1.9 Total Adjustments 8.0 14.9 EBITDA\nEBITDA per Diluted Share $3.1\n$0.06 $25.4\n$0.51\nSource:Emergent BioSolutions",
