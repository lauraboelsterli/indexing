The group’s flagship oversees mining project, the Chilean Sierra Gorda mine, made a net loss of $66 million, little changed year on year because higher costs were offset by a revenue uplift from rising metal prices.\nKGHM said the average copper price in the first quarter rose by 19 percent year on year. ($1 = 3.6258 zlotys) Reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko Editing by Marcin Goclowski and David Goodman",
