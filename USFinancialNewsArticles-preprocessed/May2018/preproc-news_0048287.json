    "text": "Kim Jong Un impersonator poses for selfies in Singapore An impersonator of Kim Jong Un was spotted in Singapore over the weekend. The man, who goes by the name Howard X, said he was in Singapore to wish for a successful summit between the actual Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. It's not yet clear if the summit will actually take place. Trump announced last week he had pulled out of the event, but then suggested it may still happen. 17 Hours Ago | 02:37\nAs the fate of the June 12 summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hangs in the balance, an impersonator of the North Korean leader has already been spotted posing for selfies at the proposed site of the meeting.\nThe man, who goes by the name Howard X, was seen on Sunday walking along the streets of central Singapore shaking hands and posing for photos.\nHoward X said the purpose of his trip was to wish for a successful summit between the real Kim and Trump.

And, on Sunday, the president said an American delegation was meeting with North Korean officials in preparation for the meeting.",
