    "text": "ISTANBUL, May 28 (Reuters) - Turkey’s Central Bank said on Monday it completed the process of simplifying its monetary policy and that the one-week repo rate would be the policy rate.\nThe Turkish lira firmed to 4.56 following the announcement from 4.5850 beforehand.\nThe simplified monetary policy will go into effect on June 1, it said in an earlier statement, adding that the one-week repo rate will be the bank’s policy rate, at a level equal to the current funding rate, or 16.5 percent.
