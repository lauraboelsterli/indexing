    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 9:02 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago Trump weighs 10 percent cut in EU steel, aluminium exports to U.S.- WSJ Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is considering trade measures to cut EU steel and aluminium exports to the United States by about 10 percent, in a sign that Brusselsâ€™ concessions to secure tariff exemptions have not met White House demands, the Wall Street Journal said, citing EU officials familiar with the talks. U.S. President Donald Trump looks at a photographer after a meeting with South Korea's President Moon Jae-In at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 22, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nWashington proposed two options for the European Union, a quota fixed at 90 percent of U.S. imports from the bloc in 2017 and a tariff-rate quota that would target the same 10 percent reduction via levies, the Journal quoted Poland's Entrepreneurship and Technology Minister Jadwiga Emilewicz as saying after EU governments discussed U.S. trade relations on Tuesday. on.wsj.com/2J1azkS\nTrump has set tariffs of 25 percent on incoming steel and 10 percent on aluminium on grounds of national security but has granted EU producers an exemption until June 1 pending the outcome of the talks.\nEU proposals to open its markets wider to U.S. products, including cars, appear not to have persuaded Washington to lift the threat of import tariffs on EU steel and aluminium, the EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said earlier on Tuesday.
