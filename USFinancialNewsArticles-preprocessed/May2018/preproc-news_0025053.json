(Nasdaq:DEPO) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and provided an update on its business performance and strategic initiatives.\n“I’m pleased with our results in the first quarter as well as the excellent progress we’re making toward repositioning our company, diversifying our commercial portfolio, and attracting new senior management talent to our team,” said Arthur Higgins, President and CEO of Depomed. “Our continued progress underscores the strong commitment we have to our three-pillar strategy of Maintain, Grow and Build, with the overall goal of improving profitability in 2018 and beyond.”\nFinancial Highlights\nFirst-quarter GAAP revenues were $128.4 million (1) First-quarter GAAP net income of $33.8 million or $0.48 per share First-quarter non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $31.8 million First-quarter ending cash and marketable securities of $101.7 million\n(1) First quarter total GAAP revenues include one-time items described in the table below.\nThe first quarter contained the following one-time items:\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP REVENUES (in thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 Total revenues (GAAP basis) $ 128,404 $ 90,447 Non-cash adjustment to commercialization agreement revenues (2) (52,486 ) - Release of NUCYNTA sales reserves (3) (12,455 ) - Managed care dispute reserve - 4,742 Total revenues (non-GAAP basis) $ 63,463 $ 95,189 (2) Adjustment for the non-cash value assigned to inventory transferred to Collegium.\n(3) $12.5 million benefit from the release of sales reserves for which the Company is no longer financially responsible.\nBusiness Highlights\nCollegium Commercialization Agreement : In January, Depomed closed a commercialization agreement with Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. under which Collegium is commercializing both NUCYNTA® ER and NUCYNTA®. In exchange, for the first four years of the agreement, Depomed is expected to receive a minimum annual royalty of $135 million ($132 million prorated for 2018). Under the agreement, Collegium began paying royalties to Depomed in the first quarter of 2018. The Company is pleased to report that previous NUCYNTA ER supply shortages, which negatively impacted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018, have been resolved.\nCosyntropin Development Update: Depomed and its development partner recently began enrolling and dosing the first pediatric patients in a new clinical trial evaluating Cosyntropin (Synthetic ACTH Depot) for the treatment of infantile spasms, a specific seizure type present in infantile epilepsy syndrome, a rare pediatric disorder. In addition, as previously announced, the Company expects its development partner to file a New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the use of Cosyntropin in a separate indication. That filing is expected by year end.\nNew Business Development Agreements: To help strengthen its existing Neurology and Pain portfolio, Depomed today announced two new business development agreements. First, the Company amended its existing licensing agreement with Applied Pharma Research S.A. to in-license a new presentation of CAMBIA® that will offer patients a more convenient dosage form. The Company expects to file for FDA approval of this new CAMBIA presentation in 2019, if approved, this presentation will be patent protected through 2026. In addition, the Company entered into a new co-promotion relationship with Allegis Pharmaceuticals for Zipsor. Under terms of the new agreement, beginning in June, Allegis will supplement the Company’s existing sales force outreach by adding approximately 30 new sales reps that focus exclusively on primary care physicians in targeted geographic regions. Depomed and Allegis will share revenues above a pre-defined baseline.\nCorporate Headquarters Relocation: During the first quarter, the Company began relocating its Corporate Headquarters from Newark, CA, to Lake Forest, IL. The Company anticipates the new headquarters to be fully operational in the third quarter. The relocation is consistent with Depomed’s overall strategy to transform into a leaner, more entrepreneurial, and faster-moving company. The new headquarters location is near a concentration of pharmaceutical companies, allowing the Company to attract new pharmaceutical talent. Separately, the Company received shareholder approval to reincorporate in Delaware and to change its name at a future date.\nRevenue Summary\nREVENUES (GAAP BASIS) (in thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 Product sales, net: Gralise® $ 14,827 $ 17,600 CAMBIA® 6,416 7,190 Zipsor® 4,746 4,651 Total neurology product sales, net 25,989 29,441 NUCYNTA® products (1) 18,145 56,919 Lazanda® (2) 220 3,925 Total product sales, net 44,354 90,285 Commercialization agreement (3) 83,800 - Royalties 250 162 Total revenues $ 128,404 $ 90,447 (1) The Company licensed the commercial rights to sell NUCYNTA to Collegium on January 9, 2018.

We believe that the presentation of these non‑GAAP financial measures, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provides supplementary information to analysts, investors, lenders, and our management in assessing the Company’s performance and results from period to period. We use these non‑GAAP measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the Company’s performance, and in part, in the determination of bonuses for executive officers and employees. These non‑GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, net income or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non‑GAAP adjusted earnings and non‑GAAP adjusted earnings per share are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and represent GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP earnings (loss) per share adjusted to exclude non-cash adjustment to Collegium agreement revenue and cost of sales, release of NUCYNTA sales reserves, amortization, and non‑cash adjustments related to product acquisitions, stock‑based compensation expense, non‑cash interest expense related to debt, CEO transition, restructuring costs, adjustments associated with non-recurring legal settlements and disputes, and to adjust for the tax effect related to each of the non-GAAP adjustments. Non‑GAAP adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude non-cash adjustment to Collegium agreement revenue and cost of sales, release of NUCYNTA sales reserves, interest income, interest expense, amortization, IPR&D and non‑cash adjustments related to product acquisitions, stock‑based compensation expense, depreciation, taxes, transaction costs, restructuring costs, adjustments related to non-recurring legal settlements and disputes, and CEO transition. Non‑GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non‑GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
