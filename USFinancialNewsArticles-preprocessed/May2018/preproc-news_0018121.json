A report from the Fort Lauderdale Police Department released Wednesday afternoon said the vehicle's speed is believed to have been a factor in the accident.\n\"Our thoughts are with the families and friends affected by this tragedy,\" Tesla said in a statement. \"We are working to establish the facts of the incident and offer our full cooperation to local authorities.\"\nPolice said the driver who died was Barrett Riley and the passenger who died was Edgar Monserratt Martinez, according to NBC Miami. Alexander Berry was named as the passenger who was ejected and injured, the report said.\nshow chapters 5 outrageous Elon Musk moments from the bizarre Tesla call 10:37 PM ET Thu, 3 May 2018 | 02:21 The crash is under investigation, the NBC Miami report said.\nThere have been a few high-profile crashes involving Tesla cars, including some where Autopilot was engaged. Most recently, a man crashed his Tesla Model X in Mountain View, California, in March.\nThe ensuing investigation led to a falling out between Tesla and the National Transportation Safety Board, which was looking into the crash. The NTSB said Tesla had improperly released information related to the crash before it had been properly vetted. Tesla had said it withdrew from the investigation, and that the agency had violated its own rules by releasing \"incomplete information to the media.\"\nRead the full story at NBC Miami.",
