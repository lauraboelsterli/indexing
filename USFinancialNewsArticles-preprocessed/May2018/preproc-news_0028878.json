Shanghai stocks climbed 3.58 percent this month.\n** About 12.45 billion shares were traded on the Shanghai exchange, roughly 85.3 percent of the market’s 30-day moving average of 14.61 billion shares a day. The volume in the previous trading session was 12.93 billion. ** As of 0704 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 21.60 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is above its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 13.68 as of the last full trading day, while the dividend yield was 2.2 percent (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)",
