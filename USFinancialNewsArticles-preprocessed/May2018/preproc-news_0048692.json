That is its biggest retracement of any day since April 27.\n* COPPER INVENTORIES: On-warrant stocks of copper in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses - metal not earmarked for delivery and therefore available to the market - fell 7,975 tonnes to 226,300 tonnes, their lowest since late January.\n* GRASBERG: Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd said it was in discussions to sell its interest in the world’s second largest copper mine to Indonesia’s state mining holding company Inalum.\n* VEDANTA: An Indian court halted the proposed expansion of Vedanta Resources copper smelter where a day earlier 11 people were killed when police fired on protesters seeking closure of the plant on environmental grounds.\n* LEAD: LME lead closed up 0.1 percent at $2,476.50 a tonne, having hit a 12-week high in the previous session after Chinese speculators drove a rally based on potential supply shortages.\n* NICKEL: LME nickel finished 0.9 percent lower at $14,650 a tonne. Nickel remains the best performer among base metals, with a year-to-date gain of nearly 14 percent.\n* NICKEL INVENTORIES: LME nickel stockpiles fell by another 2,454 tonnes, data on Wednesday showed, and are at their lowest since 2014, underlining a deficit in the metal used for stainless steel.\n* OTHER METALS: LME zinc closed down 0.9 percent at $3,029 a tonne, while aluminium was flat at $2,270 a tonne. Tin finished the day up 0.5 percent at $20,625 a tonne.\nAdditional reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr. in Manila; Editing by Louise Heavens and Mark Potter\n ",
