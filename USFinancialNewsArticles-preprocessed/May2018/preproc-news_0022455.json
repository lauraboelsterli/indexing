    "text": "MOSCOW, May 7 (Reuters) - Russia’s newly appointed Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev proposed on Monday appointing Finance Minister Anton Siluanov as first deputy prime minister in a new government, TASS state news agency reported.\nEarlier, President Vladimir Putin stuck with long-serving Prime Minister Medvedev in his first act after being sworn in for a new term, signalling he would keep faith with a policy direction that has brought Russia into conflict with the West.
