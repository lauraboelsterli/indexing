    "text": "May 12, 2018 / 8:36 PM / Updated 34 minutes ago Tennis-Kvitova lasts the pace to claim record third Madrid title Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMADRID, May 12 (Reuters) - Petra Kvitova outlasted the unseeded Kiki Bertens to win a thrilling Madrid Open final on Saturday 7-6(8-6) 4-6 6-3 and become the first player to lift the trophy for a third time.\nCzech Kvitova, ranked 10th in the world, struck the first blow in a tense match which lasted two hours 52 minutes by edging the tie-break at the end of a gruelling 75-minute first set, taking advantage of a third set point when Bertens found the net.\nThe Dutchwoman had beaten Caroline Wozniacki and Maria Sharapova in a sparkling week in the Spanish capital to reach her first premier mandatory final and recovered well from surrendering the first set to take the second.\nShe led by a break in the third but let her advantage slip and Kvitova broke twice in a row to take a 4-2 lead in the decider.\nBertens broke back to make it 4-3 but lost her next service game and Kvitova served out the final game to love, sealing victory when Bertens hit the tramlines with a backhand.\nIn doing so, she took her landmark third title, surpassing the two each won by Serena Williams and Simona Halep in Madrid, which established a womenâ€™s section in 2009.\nTwice-Wimbledon winner Kvitova was forced out of action for more than five months last year after her racket hand was stabbed by a burglar who broke into her apartment in December 2016.\nBut she has returned with a vengeance, winning the St Petersburg Ladies Trophy, the Qatar Total Open and the Prague Open this year before making history in Madrid.
