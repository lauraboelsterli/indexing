    "text": " Houthis say fire rocket at southern Saudi military base\nRIYADH (Reuters) - Yemen’s armed Houthi movement fired a rocket at the King Faisal military base in the southern Saudi Arabian city of Jizan on Tuesday, the group’s al-Masirah TV said on Twitter.\nThere were no immediate reports of damage or casualties and no confirmation from Saudi authorities.\nThe Houthis, an Iran-allied group that holds much of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, have fired a series of missiles into the kingdom in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict in Yemen widely seen as a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
