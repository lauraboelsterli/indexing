    "text": "2 COMMENTS I enjoyed the exchange between Profs. Jason Furman (“ Worry About the Trade Deficit—a Bit ,” op-ed, May 2) and Donald Boudreaux ( Letters , May 8) on the meaning of “current-account deficit.” Mr. Furman says: “If a country saves less money than it puts toward things like factories and equipment, then it has to finance the difference with foreign borrowing.” Mr. Bourdreaux argues: “It is simply untrue that the difference between total investment in the U.S. and total savings in the U.S. must be financed with borrowed funds.” He then gives a number of examples of redressing the balance by transferring U.S. assets to foreign creditors.\nThe correct formula is (investment - disinvestment) = (saving + borrowing). A classic example is the transfer of Manhattan from American Indians to the Dutch for 60 guilders. I am not sure who got the better deal, but the Indians’ current account remained in balance.\nSteven Crow, Ph.D.\nBoulder, Colo.",
