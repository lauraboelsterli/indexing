(NYSE:COTV) (“Cotiviti”), a leading provider of payment accuracy and analytics-driven solutions primarily focused on the healthcare industry, today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Cotiviti will host a conference call on May 2, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss results.\n“Our first quarter results reflect Cotiviti’s ongoing success in delivering significant client value,” said Doug Williams, Chief Executive Officer. “Revenue growth in the first quarter was positively impacted by a $46.6 million Medicare recovery audit contractor (RAC) refunds and appeals liability release. Excluding the liability release, adjusted net revenue grew 8% reflecting 10% growth in our Healthcare segment driven by the retrospective line of business, and partially offset by an 8% decline in Global Retail.”\nWilliams continued, “We are very encouraged by the Healthcare revenue generation opportunities we are experiencing with existing clients through contracted scope expansions and cross sell opportunities. In the first quarter, we generated revenue from one new PCA cross sell. As our clients implement and ramp their scope expansions, policy adoption and cross sells, we are well-positioned to have strong future top line growth for both prospective and retrospective solutions.”\n“Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% in the quarter and drove notable margin expansion and cash generation. This enabled us to continue to reduce our net debt leverage to 2.1x at March 31, 2018,” said Brad Ferguson, Chief Financial Officer. “Our strong leverage profile provides the financial flexibility to support ongoing investments in the business to fuel growth, potential mergers and acquisitions, and the opportunistic repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the quarter increased 37% to $219.0 million, compared to $160.1 million in the first quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a $46.6 million refunds and appeals liability release reflected in the RCA line of business. The liability release was due to the expiration of our original Medicare RAC contract effective January 31, 2018 and based on management’s best estimate of any potential refunds and appeals liability remaining. Excluding the liability release, adjusted net revenue grew 8% from the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted net revenue growth was driven by a 10% increase in the adjusted Healthcare segment revenue to $153.8 million. Healthcare benefitted from 13% growth in adjusted RCA revenue, partially offset by a 2% decline in PCA. Total Global Retail revenue declined 8% compared to the same period a year ago, primarily a result of a difficult comparison due to large settlements recorded in the first quarter 2017. Net income increased 100% to $53.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $27.0 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. First quarter net income was driven by higher revenue primarily from the $46.6 million original Medicare RAC liability release and the growth in our clinical chart validation solutions. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $63.8 million, an 11% increase from a year ago. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $39.1 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, a 22% increase from a year ago.\n2018 Guidance\nCotiviti’s updated full year 2018 guidance includes:\nTotal net revenue (including $46.6 million for Medicare RAC appeals release) in a range of $787 million to $807 million; Adjusted net revenue 1 (excluding the Medicare RAC appeals release) in a range of $740 million to $760 million; Net income in a range of $140 million to $155 million; Adjusted EBITDA 1 in a range of $295 million to $310 million; Estimated effective tax rate of approximately 25%, excluding the impact of stock option exercises, restricted stock units and non-deductible stock-based compensation; and Fully diluted weighted average shares of approximately 96 million, excluding any future share repurchases.\n1 Adjusted Net Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share are non-GAAP financial measures. For an explanation of these as measures of the Company’s operating performance, refer to the reconciliation in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nConference Call Information\nTo participate in the conference call on May 2, domestic callers can dial (877) 883-0383 and international callers can dial (412) 902-6506 and provide the following conference passcode: 3845310.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or current conditions included in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “seek,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “continue,” “likely,” “should,” and other words.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of performance or results. These assumptions and our future performance or results involve risks and uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control). Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions and the following: system interruptions or failures, including cyber-security breaches, identity theft or other disruptions that could compromise our information; our inability to successfully leverage our existing client base by expanding the volume of claims reviewed and cross-selling additional solutions; our clients declining to renew their agreements with us or renewing at lower performance fee levels; our failure to innovate and develop new solutions for our clients; delays in implementing our solutions; our failure to maintain or upgrade our operational platforms; inability to develop new clients; improvements to healthcare claims and retail billing processes reducing the demand for our solutions or rendering our solutions unnecessary; loss of a large client; early termination provisions in our contracts; our failure to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing; our inability to manage our relationships with information suppliers, software vendors or utility providers; our inability to protect our intellectual property rights, proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how; our inability to execute our business plans including our inability to manage our growth; our inability to successfully integrate and realize synergies from any future acquisitions or strategic partnerships; our inability to realize the book value of intangible assets; our being required to pay significant refunds to CMS under our Medicare RAC contracts or significant changes to the Medicare RAC program; declines in contracts awarded through competitive bidding or our inability to re-procure contracts through the competitive bidding process; our success in attracting and retaining qualified employees and key personnel; our inability to expand our retail business; fluctuations in our results of operations; our failure to maintain effective internal controls; litigation, regulatory or dispute resolution proceedings, including claims or proceedings related to intellectual property infringements or claims not covered by insurance; healthcare spending fluctuations; consolidation among healthcare payers or retailers; slow development of the healthcare payment accuracy market; negative publicity concerning the healthcare payment industry or patient confidentiality and privacy; significant competition for our solutions; risks associated with international operations; general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control; variations in our revenue between reporting periods due to timing issues; our failure to comply with applicable federal, state, local and international privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards; changes in regulations governing healthcare administration and policies, including governmental restrictions on the outsourcing of functions such as those that we provide; changes in tax laws and rules or in their interpretation or enforcement; the timing and magnitude of shares purchased under our share repurchase program; risks related to our substantial indebtedness and holding company structure; volatility in bank and capital markets; and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Additional factors or events that could cause our actual performance to differ from these forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual financial condition, results of operations, future performance and business may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company defines Adjusted Net Revenue as total net revenue less non-recurring revenue such as the Medicare RAC refunds and appeals release. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other non-operating (income) expense such as foreign currency translation, income tax expense (benefit), transaction-related expenses and other, stock-based compensation and the adjustment related to the original Medicare RAC contract. The Company defines Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share as net income adjusted for non-cash and other non-recurring items.\nManagement believes Adjusted Net Revenue is useful because it provides supplemental information about non-recurring revenue that is one-time in nature and should not be considered in run rate revenue expectations. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons without regard to our financing methods, capital structure or other items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Management believes Adjusted Net Income is useful because it provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons without regard to non-cash expenses and other items that are one-time in nature. In order to assure that all investors have access to similar data the Company has determined that it is appropriate to provide these non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting them in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, income from operations, net cash provided by operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCotiviti Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (Unaudited)\nASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 189,297 $ 165,518 Restricted cash 13,941 11,383 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $17 and $176 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively;
