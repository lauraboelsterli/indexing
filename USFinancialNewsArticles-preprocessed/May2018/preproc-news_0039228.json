Gabriel has an energy, his desire is contagious, his movement... I think that this will calm down with age. Firmino is older, has already played in other places,” Guardiola told ESPN.

If you play one, you have to play the other, if you play the other, you have to play the one. It’s an endless discussion.\n“It’s Tite’s problem, not mine. But it’s a debate.”\nCity have flourished under Guardiola this campaign, embarking on a record-breaking run to seal the title, but his first season at the club was not as successful with the Etihad outfit failing to win any silverware.\n“Last season has helped us to understand a lot of things so that we apply this season,” Guardiola said. “People usually believe that coaches, no matter who they are, arrive at a club and things start working fine. And it is not like that.”\nThe former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss dismissed the notion that he doubted himself during City’s poor run, saying he was “very clear and psychologically strong” about the club’s playing style.
