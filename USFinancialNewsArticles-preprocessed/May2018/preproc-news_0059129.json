FILE PHOTO: South Africa's rugby team new coach Rassie Erasmus gestures during a media briefing in Johannesburg, South Africa, March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo\nErasmus is primarily focused on the upcoming home series against England that starts in Johannesburg on June 9, and opted not to send the majority of players likely to be involved in those three tests to the United States.\nThe match also falls outside of the June international window, which restricted the South Africa coach from picking overseas-based players.\nLock Pieter-Steph du Toit will captain a side that has just 134 test caps and an average age of 24 among the starting XV.\nWings Travis Ismaiel and Makazole Mapimpi will get their first outing in a Bok jersey, along with centre Andre Esterhuizen, scrumhalf Ivan van Zyl, Sevens veteran and flank Kwagga Smith, lock Jason Jenkins and prop Ox Nche.\n“As coaches, we are tremendously excited about the prospect of seeing some of our best young players getting the opportunity to play at this level,” Erasmus said in a media release from South African Rugby.\n“Wales have a very solid and effective kicking strategy. Their cohesive forward and set-piece play are some of their main strong points. However, I do believe that we have picked a match-day squad that will be able to compete very strongly.”\nThere are another six uncapped players on the bench including flyhalf Robert du Preez, who if he makes it onto the pitch will mark the first time in South African rugby history that a father and three sons have played for the national team.\nThe quartet would consist of Robert Sr and two more of his children, Jean-Luc and Daniel, who have already worn the Bok jersey.\nThe match will be the second time that South Africa will face Wales at a neutral ground outside of a Rugby World Cup.\nThey clashed at Wembley in London in 1998 during the construction of the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff as the Boks won 28-20.\nThe match will be a first in charge for Erasmus, who took over from Allister Coetzee earlier this year, tasked with rebuilding a Bok team that had won just 11 of their 25 tests since the start of 2016.\nTeam: 15-Curwin Bosch, 14-Travis Ismaiel, 13-Jesse Kriel, 12-Andre Esterhuizen , 11-Makazole Mapimpi, 10-Elton Jantjies, 9-Ivan van Zyl, 8-Dan du Preez, 7-Oupa Mohoje, 6-Kwagga Smith, 5-Pieter-Steph du Toit (captain), 4-Jason Jenkins, 3-Wilco Louw, 2-Chiliboy Ralepelle, 1-Ox Nche.\nReplacements: 16-Akker van der Merwe, 17-Steven Kitshoff, 18-Thomas du Toit, 19-Marvin Orie, 20-Sikhumbuzo Notshe, 21-Embrose Papier, 22-Robert du Preez, 23-Warrick Gelant.
