A lot of analysts are expecting strong earnings as oil rebounds, and that hasn’t really played out so much early this year.”\nAt 12:50 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 163.06 points, or 0.67 percent, at 24,523.27, the S&P 500 was up 21.91 points, or 0.82 percent, at 2,693.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 50.07 points, or 0.69 percent, at 7,316.98.\nThe growth sectors including technology, financials and industrials were all higher, with only the defensive utilities and telecoms in the red.\nBut worries that rising oil prices will perk up inflation lingered.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to a two-week high and above the key 3 percent level on expectations of higher interest rates.\n“Oil is probably not helping, it’s a kind of a potential inflation indicator,” said Mark Travis, chief executive officer of Intrepid Capital Funds in Jacksonville Beach, Florida.\n“The underlying challenge for the financial markets is not so much whether Trump does or doesn’t do anything. It is the impact of the rates rising facing an expensive capital markets.”\nAmong stocks, Walmart fell 3.3 percent after the retailer took a majority stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart for about $16 billion.\nWalt Disney dipped 1.6 percent despite reporting a quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.47-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 32 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 129 new highs and 44 new lows.
