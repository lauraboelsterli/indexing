    "text": "BROOKINGS, S.D., May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Daktronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:DAKT) today reported fiscal 2018 fourth quarter net sales of $138.2 million, operating loss of $5.4 million, and net loss of $3.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to net sales of $143.7 million, operating income of $1.7 million, and a net income of $0.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 fourth quarter orders were $162.0 million compared to $178.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Backlog at the end of the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter was $171 million, compared to a backlog of $203 million a year earlier and $151 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nNet sales, operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the fiscal year ended April 28, 2018, were $610.5 million, $12.5 million, $5.6 million and $0.12 per diluted share, respectively. This compares to $586.5 million, $15.4 million, $10.3 million and $0.23 per diluted share, respectively, for fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 orders were $583.5 million compared to $613.5 million for fiscal 2017.\nCash flow provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended April 28, 2018 was $30.4 million, compared to $39.4 million in fiscal 2017. Free cash flow, defined as cash provided from or used in operating activities less net investment in property and equipment, was a positive $14.4 million for fiscal 2018, as compared to a positive free cash flow of $31.1 million for fiscal 2017. Net investment in property and equipment was $15.9 million for fiscal 2018, as compared to $8.3 million for fiscal 2017. We had no repurchases of shares of common stock during fiscal 2018. We repurchased approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $6.42 per share for a total use of cash of $1.8 million during fiscal 2017. Cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $64.3 million, which compares to $65.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Consolidated Financial Results\nOrders for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased by 9.1 percent as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Orders increased in the International and High School Park and Recreation business units, decreased in the Live Events and Transportation business units, and remained relatively flat in the Commercial business unit. The timing of orders for large projects varies according to the needs of the customer, which was the primary cause of the decrease in order volume.\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased by 3.8 percent as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Net sales increased in International and the High School Park and Recreation business units, decreased in the Live Events and Commercial business units, and remained relatively flat in the Transportation business unit. The decline in sales is the result of lower orders.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 21.6 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 23.5 percent a year earlier. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to warranty charges. Operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $35.2 million, compared to $32.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in total operating expense was primarily attributable to an increase in selling expenses and planned increases in product development activities. Operating loss as a percentage of sales was 3.9 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to an operating income as a percentage of sales of 1.2 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Consolidated Financial Results\nOrders for fiscal 2018 decreased by 4.9 percent as compared to fiscal 2017. Orders increased in the International and High School Park and Recreation business units, and decreased in the Commercial, Live Events, and Transportation business units. High School Park and Recreation and International orders increase was primarily due to overall strong market demand. The International, Live Events, and Transportation business units are large project based and are subject to volatility due to timing of large contracts. Commercial business unit orders decrease was due to spectacular and on-premise niches order timing, offset by an increase in the Out-of-Home niche.\nNet sales for fiscal 2018 increased 4.1 percent as compared to fiscal 2017. Net sales increased in the Live Events, Transportation, High School Park and Recreation, and International business units and decreased in the Commercial business unit. Live Events net sales increase was primarily due to the timing of demand for upgraded or new solutions for arenas, professional sports, and colleges and universities. High School Park and Recreation increase in net sales was primarily due to the timing of shipments of scoring systems and message centers. Transportation's increase in net sales was related to the variability of large order production timing caused by customer project schedules. International net sales increase was mainly attributable to market demand for digital solutions in the Out-of-Home niche. Commercial net sales decreased as a result of lower order volumes in our on-premise and spectacular niches.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 23.9 percent for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Operating expenses for fiscal 2018 were $133.2 million, compared to $125.0 million for fiscal 2017. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in planned product development activities. Annual operating income as a percentage of sales decreased to 2.0 percent for fiscal 2018 as compared to 2.6 percent for fiscal 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 55.2 percent as compared to 33.7 percent. The change in rates was primarily due to the accounting adjustments triggered by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that provided significant changes to the U.S. tax code. We estimate an effective tax rate of approximately 21 percent for fiscal 2019.\nReece Kurtenbach, chairman, president and chief executive officer, stated, \"While the overall results of fiscal 2018 were below expectations, we remain optimistic for the future. We proactively increased product development activities during fiscal 2018 and introduced additional narrow pixel pitch solutions and control features to our broad array of offerings. Our development spend increased $6.4 million year over year. Warranty charges were approximately $10 million more than our forecast. Additional spends related to warranty were targeted at preserving customer relationships, as well as a few isolated site issues. Warranty as a percent of sales was 3.5 percent as compared to 2.5 percent last year. Sales increased slightly and included completion of more Transportation business unit projects and premier global installations like the Mercedes-Benz Stadium and Piccadilly Lights. We also sold our non-digital division assets for a gain. The new U.S. tax law negatively affected fiscal 2018 net income. All taken into account, we were profitable for the year and our balance sheet remains strong. We generated positive free cash flow for the year and invested over $18 million into our manufacturing capabilities and information systems infrastructure. Investments made in product development in fiscal 2018 will provide on-going benefits well into the future.\"\nOutlook\nKurtenbach continued, \"As we enter into fiscal 2019; sport, commercial, and governmental entities continue to choose digital applications to support their needs. This demand is driving long-term growth in LED video displays as well as other digital applications. Our range of solutions and global capabilities make us the industry's most experienced digital display provider. We are focused on winning more orders and will continue our velocity in product development to serve the industry's growing demand. We expanded our quality and reliability management programs and invested in resources over the past years to strengthen our overall quality. In addition, we are focused on carefully managing our operation spend as we continue on our path to long-term profitable growth.\"\nWebcast Information\nThe company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its financial results today at 10:00 am (Central Time).

The term free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and is not a measure of operating income, cash flows from operating activities or other GAAP figures and should not be considered alternatives to those computations. Free cash flow is intended to provide information that may be useful for investors when assessing period to period results.\nSource:Daktronics, Inc.",
