    "text": "CORONA, Calif., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acology Inc. (ACOL-OTCMARKETS) released its’ 10Q, confirming that business continues to steadily grow and sustaining the expansion of the company that began more than 18 months ago. Among the highlights are:\nGross revenues up nearly 20%\nNet income continues to surge, with new products now accounting for over 35% of sales\nIncreased Assets and Accounts Receivable\nAnother 6-Figure Debt Reduction in the quarter, following other substantial debt reductions in the previous 3 quarters\nSharp increases in the Canadian Licensed Producer sector\nAcology continues to focus from the inside-out, accelerating plans implemented earlier this year to create a stronger core business and expand sharply into several aspects of the cannabis market, with an eye on becoming the preferred retail packaging unit for both the Canadian and US market. In addition, the steady increase in sales for Acology’s MedX 2-way humidity packs are accounting for the steady rise in the company’s net revenues. Substantial orders from Canadian LPs are still increasing, a trend that Acology is confident will continue into the foreseeable future.\nThe company also announced that there is every indication that Acology will be granted the European Patent for its’ signature product, the MedTainer™, by the end of the year if not sooner. This comes on last month’s announcement that Acology had purchased the entire United States MedTainer IP Portfolio and followed with the granting of the Canadian Design Patent for the multi-functional container.\nFor investor or sales information please visit Acology Inc. and D&C Distributors online or by phone.
