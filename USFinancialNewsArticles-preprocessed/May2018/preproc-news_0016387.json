Investors include Sapphire Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures, Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst, and the Australian Government Future Fund.\nMy colleague Jonathan Vanian has the exclusive details :\nCEO Ajeet Singh declined to disclose the company’s private valuation, but he said it is now worth over $1 billion. That would put ThoughtSpot among an elite group of so-called unicorn startups that are worth $1 billion or more.\nIn total, the company has raised $306 million since its founding in 2012. It will use the fresh capital to hire more staff in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Singh said this should be the company’s last private round as it prepares for a possible IPO in the next few years.

Here are some takeaways:\n• The most significant valuation increase was at the late stage , where the median pre-money valuation as of the first quarter of 2018 went up to $75 million, which is a 19% increase from 2017. A big reason for this? Heaps of dry powder.\n• The shift toward funding more mature companies was especially present in the angel & seed stage in Q1. At those stages, the median age for companies receiving financing pushed to three years, which is twice as old as a decade ago. The reason? Lots of alternative funding options such as accelerators, equity or product crowdfunding, and a greater ability to bootstrap.\n• The median time between venture rounds remains extended, sitting at 1.4 years for angel & seed and early-stage rounds, an increase from a long-term average of 1.2 years. For late-stage, it sits at about 1.8 years compared to an average of 1.5 years.\n• It doesn’t seem that VC valuation increases are driven by an increase in investor protections. For instance, the percentage of deals with cumulative dividends — as well as those with participation rights — has fallen steadily over the past decade.\nIt’s a pretty in-depth report.
