Reuters Good morning. Apple Inc., Facebook and Twitter Inc. all have updated their global privacy rules in anticipation of the European Union’s internet-privacy rule that takes effect late this month. The impact of the General Data Protection Regulation beyond the EU’s borders is the latest sign of the bloc’s growing power in global rule-making, reports The Journal’s Daniel Michaels .\nEU rules targeting industries within the bloc—from consumer products to financial services—have set international benchmarks with increasing frequency. Some are taken piecemeal, as with GDPR , from which non-EU companies are cherry-picking elements. Other rules have become de facto world-wide references.\n“There are a whole series of actors in the U.S. and Asia who will now be subject to the law,” Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, head of France’s privacy regulator, told WSJ. “GDPR is an important signal that Europe has influence in this digital society.”\nThe EU’s Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities, or UCITS V–which in 2016 updated a financial directive first adopted in 1985–“is clearly regarded as a global standard,” said Guy Monson, chief investment officer at asset manager Sarasin & Partners. California’s electronic-waste recycling act of 2003, updated last year, specifically cites a broader EU law passed in 2002.\nThe EU’s 2006 Registration Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals law, or REACH, has spawned legislation in China, South Korea, Turkey and other countries, though few are as sweeping as the EU law, industry officials said.\nEurope’s international influence stems from a confluence of factors, starting with its market size. Companies wanting access to the EU’s 500 million potential consumers—one of the world’s richest markets for products and services—must play by the bloc’s rules.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nCrisis of the week: Bolloré tackles bribery allegations. French police took businessman Vincent Bolloré into custody on April 24 as part of a bribery investigation involving his family holding company, Bolloré Group . Three crisis-management experts examine the firm’s public response.\nCOMPLIANCE\nU.S. puts sanctions on Venezuelan official. The U.S. imposed sanctions against Pedro Luis Martin Olivares, Venezuela’s former financial intelligence chief, over his alleged work as a drug kingpin, the WSJ reports. Mr. Martin couldn’t be reached for comment.\nChinese official gets life sentence. A Chinese court gave a life sentence to Sun Zhengcai, once seen as a potential successor and rival to President Xi Jinping, on corruption charges. Mr. Sun was a member of the Communist Party’s ruling Politburo until his ouster last year, the WSJ reports.\nSun Zhengcai at the opening session of the National People’s Congress in Beijing last March, a few months before his downfall.

After years of budget pressure and escalating responsibilities, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is considering employee buyouts and the extension of a hiring freeze, the WSJ reports.\nDATA SECURITY\nRegulators cite weaknesses ahead of GDPR. Many of the regulators who will enforce the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation when it takes effect this month say they aren’t ready, Reuters reports.\nEgypt’s ride-hailing bill raises privacy concerns. Egypt’s parliament passed legislation requiring operators of ride-hailing apps such as Uber Technologies Inc. to hand over passenger data when requested by security agencies, the WSJ reports. To become law, the bill must be approved by President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.\nGOVERNANCE\nActivist sets sights on Citigroup. Activist investor ValueAct Capital Partners LP has built a roughly $1.2 billion stake in Citigroup Inc. , a bet that the bank’s strength as a service provider to corporations will enable it to make up ground its shares have lost in recent years, the WSJ reports.\nAsia is activists’ new target. Activist investors are finding targets in Asia, as a growing awareness of corporate governance makes companies vulnerable to investors seeking change. A J.P. Morgan report finds activists launched 106 campaigns in Asia last year, compared with 10 six years ago, the WSJ reports.\nREPUTATION\nNew York’s attorney general resigns. New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman abruptly resigned after the New Yorker published an article in which four women alleged he physically abused them. Mr. Schneiderman denied the allegation, the WSJ reports.\nRISK\nTrump to make call on Iran sanctions. Washington’s European allies were bracing for the U.S. to withdraw from the Iran nuclear accord, after President Donald Trump said he would announce on Tuesday his decision on a landmark agreement that he has repeatedly condemned, the WSJ reports.\nCompanies consider their Iran projects. A handful of multinationals are closely monitoring their Iranian interests—and some are plotting ways to preserve them—as the Trump administration weighs reinstating economic sanctions, the WSJ reports.\nSTRATEGY\nTakeda wins battle for Shire. Takeda Pharmaceutical reached an agreement to buy Shire PLC , marking the biggest-ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, the WSJ reports.\nA Shire logo outside the company’s offices in Dublin.

Cable giant Comcast is getting the pieces in place, including $60 billion in financing, to make a hostile bid for 21st Century Fox ’s entertainment assets should it choose to do so, the WSJ reports. Fox agreed in December to sell the assets in question to Walt Disney\nChip tester to buy a rival. Semiconductor-testing company Cohu Inc. has agreed to acquire rival Xcerra Corp. in a deal valued at about $627 million, months after the latter company scrapped a plan to sell itself to a Chinese company over national-security hurdles, the WSJ reports.\n from WSJ’s Risk & Compliance Journal cues up the most important news in risk and compliance every weekday morning.
