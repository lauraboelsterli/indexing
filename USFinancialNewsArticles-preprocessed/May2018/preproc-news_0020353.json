    "text": "Total revenue of $90.4 million, a 57% increase over 2017\nNet product sales of $89.1 million, a 58% increase over 2017\nOperating earnings of $31.4 million, an 87% increase over 2017\nDiluted earnings per share (GAAP) of $0.49, compared to $0.19 in 2017\nROCKVILLE, Md., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SUPN), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, today reported record financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and related Company developments.\nCommercial Update\nFirst quarter 2018 product prescriptions for Trokendi XR ® and Oxtellar XR ® , as reported by IQVIA, totaled 200,878, a 49.2% increase over the first quarter of 2017.\nPrescriptions Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Change % Trokendi XR 164,160 101,544 61.7%\nOxtellar XR 36,718 33,100 10.9%\nTotal 200,878 134,644 49.2%\nSource: IQVIA\nNet product sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $89.1 million, a 58.0% increase over $56.4 million in the same period in the prior year.\nNet Product Sales\n($ in millions)\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 Change % Trokendi XR $70.5 $42.0 67.9%\nOxtellar XR $18.6 $14.4 29.2%\nTotal $89.1 $56.4 58.0%\n“We delivered another strong quarter of growth in net product sales for both Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR, driven by the strong underlying demand for both products,” said Jack Khattar, President and CEO of Supernus Pharmaceuticals. “We are executing well against our commercial strategy and continue to build on the momentum established last year.”\nDuring April 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review the Company’s efficacy supplement requesting expansion of the current indication for Oxtellar XR to include monotherapy treatment of partial seizures of epilepsy for adults and for children 6–17 years. Oxtellar XR is currently indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of partial seizures of epilepsy for adults and for children 6–17 years. A decision by the FDA on the Company’s supplement is expected by the end of December 2018.\nMr. Khattar added, “We are excited about this potential label expansion for Oxtellar XR and believe it will allow us to maximize the potential of the product in epilepsy.”\nProgress of Product Pipeline\nThe Company continues to expect that data will be available from the Phase III programs for SPN-812 and SPN-810 by the first quarter of 2019.\nOverall enrollment in the four Phase III trials for SPN-812, a novel non-stimulant for the treatment of ADHD, is approximately 61% complete. The program consists of four three-arm, placebo-controlled trials; two of which are pediatric trials and two of which are adolescent trials.\nEnrollment continues in both Phase III trials (P301 and P302) for SPN-810, currently in development for Impulsive Aggression (IA) in pediatric patients who have ADHD. Enrollment in P301 and P302 is approximately 86% and 71% complete, respectively. In addition, the Company expects that a Phase III trial for SPN-810 treating IA in adolescents who have ADHD to start mid-2018.\nRegarding Oxtellar XR, the investigator-sponsored trial in bipolar disorder is expected to complete enrollment by year end 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $18.9 million, as compared to $9.6 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was due primarily to the initiation of the four Phase III clinical trials for SPN-812 in the second half of 2017, as well as the open-label extension trial for SPN-812.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $36.8 million, as compared to $28.2 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the salesforce by 40 salespeople who were fully deployed in the fourth quarter of 2017 and associated expenses. To a lesser extent, marketing programs to support the Company’s commercial products grew year over year.\nOperating Earnings and Earnings Per Share\nOperating earnings in the first quarter of 2018 were $31.4 million, an 87.0% increase over $16.8 million in the same period the prior year. The improvement in operating earnings was primarily due to increased net product sales, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nNet earnings (GAAP) in the first quarter of 2018 were $26.4 million, as compared to $10.3 million in the same period last year.\nDiluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $0.49 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.19 in the first quarter of 2017.\nWeighted-average diluted common shares outstanding were approximately 53.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to approximately 52.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $664.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and long term marketable securities, as compared to $273.7 million at December 31, 2017. This increase includes net proceeds from the sale of $402.5 million of convertible senior notes in March 2018, as well as $27.1 million of cash from operations in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Guidance\nFor full year 2018, the Company reiterates its prior guidance for net product sales, research and development expenses, operating earnings, and effective tax rate as set forth below:\nNet product sales in the range of $375 million to $400 million.\nResearch and development expenses of approximately $80 million.\nOperating earnings in the range of $125 million to $135 million, including approximately $7 million of licensing and non-cash royalty revenue.\nEffective tax rate of approximately 23% to 25%.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will hold a conference call hosted by Jack Khattar, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Patrick, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss these results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, on Wednesday, May 9, 2018. An accompanying webcast also will be provided.\nPlease refer to the information below for conference call dial-in information and webcast registration.
