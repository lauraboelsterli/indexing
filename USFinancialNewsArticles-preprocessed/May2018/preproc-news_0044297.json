REUTERS/David W Cerny\nThe U.S. squad had reeled off six straight wins to start the tournament, but a 6-0 loss to Sweden on Saturday relegated them to the consolation game. Canada lost to Finland and the U.S. in group play, but saw its hopes end in a 3-2 loss to Switzerland in the semifinals.\nKreider opened the scoring with a goal in the second period and added an empty-netter late in the third period. Ice Hockey - 2018 IIHF World Championships - Bronze Medal Match - USA v Canada - Royal Arena - Copenhagen, Denmark - May 20, 2018 - Chris Kreider of the U.S. celebrates after scoring.

Slideshow (9 Images)\nThe teams remained tied until Nashville Predators center Nick Bonino scored the game-winner on a rebound of Patrick Kane shot with under seven minutes to go in regulation.\nAnders Lee and Kreider then added empty-net goals in the final three minutes after Canada lifted goalie Curtis McElhinney for an extra skater.\nCanada had won gold in 2015 and 2016, before settling for silver in 2017 and was considered a favorite heading into the tournament.\nSweden and Switzerland play for the gold in the title game later Sunday.\n—Field Level Media",
