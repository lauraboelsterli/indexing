It was originally slated to start in 2016.\nThe commissioning LNG cargo from Ichthys will be exported to Inpex’s Naoetsu LNG terminal in Japan, according to the first source and a second one also familiar with the matter.\nInpex has said the Ichthys project will start-up this month with gas production set to begin by the end of May.\nProject holders in Ichthys are seeking five liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes for delivery into Japan and Taiwan over July to September to replace LNG they will not be able to supply from Ichthys due to delays in its start-up, two traders told Reuters.\nThat is to fulfil contractual commitments to buyers such as Taiwan’s state-owned CPC Corp and the world’s top LNG buyer JERA Co, a fuel joint venture of Tokyo Electric and Chubu Electric, one of the traders said.\nThe Inpex spokesman declined to comment, citing a confidentiality agreement with customers.\n“They have indicated their interest just to a few companies, so the requirement is not firm yet,” the trader said, adding that offers were due by Thursday.\nAt full operation, Ichthys is expected to produce 8.9 million tonnes of LNG a year, along with about 1.7 million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas and about 100,000 barrels per day of condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil.\nInpex holds 62.245 percent of Ichthys, France’s Total 30 percent, with the rest spread amongst Taiwan’s CPC Corp and Japanese utilities Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Kansai Electric, JERA Corp and Toho Gas .
