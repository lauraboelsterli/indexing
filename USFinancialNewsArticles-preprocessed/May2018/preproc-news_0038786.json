Britain's Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle leaves an ANZAC day service at Westminster Abbey in London, April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay\nThomas Markle, who lives in Mexico, was quoted as telling TMZ.com he was scheduled for a heart repair and blockage procedure early on Wednesday.\nMarkle threw the wedding plans into confusion earlier this week when he said he would not attend the May 19 nuptials because he did not want to embarrass his daughter. He later said he wanted to go, if his health allowed it. Reporting by Jill Serjeant; editing by Grant McCool",
