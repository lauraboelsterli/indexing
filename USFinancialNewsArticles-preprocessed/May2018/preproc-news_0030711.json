Based on our encouraging preclinical data, we are also planning for a new clinical study of CA4P as an immuno-oncology agent in combination with Opdivo® – initially evaluating the combination in advanced melanoma patients who have not responded to currently approved treatments.”\nAbout Mateon\nMateon Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing investigational drugs for the treatment of orphan oncology indications, with programs in acute myeloid leukemia and immuno-oncology.
