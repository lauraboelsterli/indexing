The meeting will happen two days before a temporary reprieve from U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs is due to expire. Published 1 Hour Ago Joshua Roberts | Reuters Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross\nEurope's top trade official Cecilia Malmstrom will meet U.S. counterparts Wilbur Ross and Robert Lighthizer in Paris on Wednesday, two days before a temporary reprieve from U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs is due to expire.\n\"A bilateral meeting with (U.S. Commerce) Secretary Ross is scheduled to take place on the margins of the OECD meeting on Wednesday,\" European Commission spokesman Daniel Rosario said in an email.\nMalmstrom will also meet Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative, separately during the same event.\nShe will also take part in a meeting with U.S. and Japanese counterparts on Thursday to continue trilateral discussions on steel overcapacity, the spokesman said.\nThe Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 28-country European Union, is seeking a permanent exemption from the tariffs, saying the EU is a U.S. ally and not responsible for global overcapacity of either steel and aluminium.\nMalmstrom herself said last week she did not think an EU proposal to discuss opening its markets wider to U.S. imports had convinced Washington to lift the threat of measures to curb EU steel imports.\nCanada and Mexico were also given temporary reprieves until June 1, while Argentina, Australia and Brazil have secured permanent exemptions, albeit in exchange for quotas.",
