These are merely projections and, as such, are based exclusively on the expectations of GOL's management. Such forward-looking statements depend, substantially, on external factors, in addition to the risks disclosed in GOL's filed disclosure documents and are, therefore, subject to change without prior notice. The Company's non-financial information was not reviewed by the independent auditors.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo be consistent with industry practice, we disclose so-called non-GAAP financial measures which are not recognized under IFRS or U.S. GAAP, including \"Net Debt\", \"Adjusted Net Debt\", \"total liquidity\", \"EBITDA\" and EBITDAR\". Our management believes that disclosure of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors, financial analysts and the public in their review of our operating performance and their comparison of our operating performance to the operating performance of other companies in the same industry and other industries. However, these non-GAAP items do not have standardized meanings and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled items adopted by other companies. Potential investors should not rely on information not recognized under IFRS as a substitute for the GAAP measures of earnings or liquidity in making an investment decision.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gol-reviews-financial-outlook-300645310.html\nSOURCE GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A.",
