    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 14 (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Monday it had written 12 major automakers, asking for meetings after the agency said the companies failed to meet a December 2017 target deadline for completing repairs on the highest-priority vehicles with Takata air bag inflators.\nThe agency disclosed it had written May 3 letters to automakers including Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp , General Motors Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Daimler AG and Ford Motor Co\nNearly 30 million U.S. vehicles remain unrepaired in the recall impacting 19 automakers in the largest ever recall in history. At least 22 deaths and more than 290 injuries worldwide are linked to Takata inflators that can explode, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017.
