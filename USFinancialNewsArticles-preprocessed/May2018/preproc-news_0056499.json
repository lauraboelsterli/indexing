    "text": "SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Sarajevo is hoping to host a Formula E race next year after a proposal by the Bosnian capitalâ€™s mayor was backed unanimously by the city council on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of French tyre maker Michelin is seen on a Formula E racing car on display at the innovative center of German postal and logistics group Deutsche Post DHL in Troisdorf near Bonn, western Germany March 9, 2016. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo The council now needs to approve 100,000 euros ($116,040) of funding for a feasibility study with organizers of the all-electric city-based series.\nThere was no immediate comment from Formula E.\nFormula E has already announced that the opening round of the 2018-19 season will be held in the Saudi Arabian city of Riyadh, and is in discussion with a number of undisclosed locations.\nA full calendar is due to be published in June.\nFILE PHOTO - Formula E - Berlin E-Prix - Flughafen Tempelhof, Berlin, Germany - May 19, 2018 Audi Sport Abt Schaeffler's Daniel Abt during the race REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer Mayor Abdulah Skaka said bringing a race to Sarajevo, whose plight became synonymous with a 44-month siege by Bosnian Serb forces during the Bosnian war in the 1990s, would boost tourism and the economy.\nNearly 500,000 international and local visitors came to the Sarajevo region last year, up 22 percent from 2016, according to city authorities.\nDespite boasting some of the largest green areas in the region, Sarajevo lies in a valley surrounded by high mountains and is notoriously prone to fog.\nHeavy traffic, poor spatial planning and solid-fuel based heating are mostly to blame for the poor air quality.\nReporting by Maja Zuvela: Editing by Daria Sito-Sucic and Alan Baldwin\n ",
