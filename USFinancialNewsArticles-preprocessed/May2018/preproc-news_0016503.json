    "text": "Announces Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.17 per Share\nReaffirms Full Year 2018 Outlook\nCENTENNIAL, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:NCMI) (the Company), the managing member and owner of 48.8% of National CineMedia, LLC (NCM LLC), the operator of the largest in-theater digital media network in North America, announced today consolidated results for the fiscal first quarter ended March 29, 2018.\nTotal revenue for the first quarter ended March 29, 2018 increased 11.5% to $80.2 million from $71.9 million for the comparable quarter last year. Operating income increased 115.7% to $11.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $5.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted OIBDA increased 32.4% to $23.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $17.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. Included in Adjusted OIBDA and operating income were $0.4 million and $1.4 million of non-cash impairment charges during 2018 and 2017, respectively, on investments obtained in prior years in exchange for advertising services. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.9 million, or net loss of $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.3 million, or net loss of $0.02 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding CEO transition-related costs, net loss for the first quarter of 2018 and for the first quarter of 2017 would have remained the same. See the tables at the end of this release for the reconciliations to the closest GAAP basis measurement.\nThe Company announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized the Company’s regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 1, 2018 to stockholders of record on May 18, 2018. The declaration, payment, timing and amount of any future dividends payable will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors who will take into account general economic and advertising market business conditions, the Company’s financial condition, available cash, current and anticipated cash needs, and any other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant. While it is the intention of the Company to continue its practice of distributing a substantial proportion of its free cash flow, the Board of Directors continues to review the factors listed above and others as deemed relevant to determine a sustainable distribution rate which balances the operating and strategic needs of the Company with those of its lenders and stockholders.\nCommenting on the Company’s first quarter 2018 operating results, Andy England, NCM’s CEO said, “It has been an excellent start to 2018, with first quarter results coming in better than our expectations and second quarter also off to a good start. We continue to attract new and returning advertisers, proving that the power of cinema advertising is alive and well. The launch of the first app in our Noovie digital ecosystem, Noovie ARcade, is bringing interactive augmented reality gaming to the big screen, enhancing the moviegoing experience and giving audiences a reason to arrive early to discover what’s next in entertainment – which is good for both consumers and brands.”\n2018 Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company reaffirms its outlook of total revenue to be flat to up 4.5% and Adjusted OIBDA to be down 2.5% to up 4.8% from the full year 2017. The Company expects total revenue in the range of $425.0 million to $445.0 million for the full year 2018, compared to total revenue for the full year 2017 of $426.1 million and Adjusted OIBDA in the range of $200.0 million to $215.0 million for the full year 2018 compared to Adjusted OIBDA for the full year 2017 of $205.1 million. During 2018, the Company expects to record approximately $23.0 million in integration and other encumbered theater payments from Cinemark and AMC associated with the Rave Theatres and Carmike Theatres acquisitions, which are recorded as a reduction of an intangible asset.\nSupplemental Information\nIntegration and other encumbered theater payments due from Cinemark and AMC associated with Rave Theatres and Carmike Theatres for the quarter ended March 29, 2018 and March 30, 2017 were $2.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. These payments were recorded as a reduction of an intangible asset.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast with investors, analysts and other interested parties May 7, 2018 at 8:30 A.M.

(2) OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin and adjusted income per share are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the United States. See attached tables for the non-GAAP reconciliations. NATIONAL CINEMEDIA, INC.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nUnaudited\nOIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin\nOperating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (“OIBDA”), Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the United States. OIBDA represents operating income before depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted OIBDA excludes from OIBDA non-cash share based compensation cost and Chief Executive Officer transition costs. Adjusted OIBDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance, to forecast future results and as a basis for compensation. The Company believes these are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on its operating performance and so highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company’s results with other companies that may have different depreciation and amortization policies, non-cash share based compensation programs, CEO turnover, interest rates, debt levels or income tax rates. A limitation of these measures, however, is that they exclude depreciation and amortization, which represent a proxy for the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company’s business. In addition, Adjusted OIBDA has the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the Company’s share based payment costs or costs associated with the resignation of the company’s former Chief Executive Officer. OIBDA or Adjusted OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income, net income or as indicators of operating performance, nor should they be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to OIBDA. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these non-GAAP presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, or calculations in the Company’s debt agreement.\nThe following tables reconcile operating income to OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nQuarter Ended March 29,\n2018\nMarch 30,\n2017\nOperating income $ 11.0 $ 5.1 Depreciation and amortization 9.5 9.6 OIBDA $ 20.5 $ 14.7 Share-based compensation costs (1) 2.8 2.7 CEO transition costs (2) — 0.2 Adjusted OIBDA $ 23.3 $ 17.6 Total revenue $ 80.2 $ 71.9 Adjusted OIBDA margin 29.1 % 24.5 % Adjusted OIBDA $ 23.3 $ 17.6 Carmike and Rave Theatres integration and other encumbered theater payments accrued\n2.2 0.4 Adjusted OIBDA after integration and other encumbered theater payments\n$ 25.5 $ 18.0 (1) Share-based compensation costs are included in network operations, selling and marketing and administrative expense in the accompanying financial tables as shown in the following table (dollars in millions).

Adjusted Net Loss and Loss per Share\nAdjusted net loss and loss per share are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the United States. Adjusted net loss and loss per share are calculated using reported net loss and loss per share and exclude CEO transition-related costs. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance. The Company believes these are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on its operating performance and so highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to a method used by the Company’s management and helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. Adjusted net income should not be regarded as an alternative to net income and should not be regarded as an alternative to income per share or as indicators of operating performance, nor should they be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that net income and income per share are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income as previously reported to net income as reported reflecting the impact of the change in accounting principle. In addition, as reported net income and income per share are reconciled to adjusted net income and income per share excluding the CEO transition-related costs for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nQuarter Ended March 29,\n2018\nMarch 30,\n2017\nNet loss as previously reported $ — $ (5.0 ) Adjustment due to change in accounting principle and correction of prior period error\n— 3.7 Net loss as reported $ (1.9 ) $ (1.3 ) CEO transition costs (1) — 0.2 Effect of noncontrolling interests (51.2% and 60.7%, respectively)\n— (0.1 ) Effect of provision for income taxes (88% and 38% effective rate, respectively)\n— — Net effect of adjusting items — 0.1 Diluted net loss excluding adjusting items $ (1.9 ) $ (1.2 ) Weighted Average Shares Outstanding as reported and as adjusted\nDiluted 76,640,414 60,309,087 Diluted loss per share as reported (2) $ (0.03 ) $ (0.02 ) Net effect of adjusting items — — Diluted loss per share excluding adjusting items\n$ (0.03 ) $ (0.02 ) (1) Chief Executive Officer transition costs represent consulting, relocation and other costs and are included in administrative expense in the accompanying financial tables. (2) The impact of the change in accounting principle and correction of a prior period error was an increase of $0.06 to diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 30, 2017.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507005352/en/\nNational CineMedia, Inc.\nINVESTOR CONTACT:\nTed Watson, 800-844-0935\ninvestors@ncm.com\nor\nMEDIA CONTACT:\nAmy Jane Finnerty, 212-931-8117\namy.finnerty@ncm.com\nSource: National CineMedia, Inc.",
