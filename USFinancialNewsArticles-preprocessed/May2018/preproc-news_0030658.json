    "text": "NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABEO), a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases, today announced that it is expanding its Board of Directors through the appointment of Messrs. Stefano Buono and Richard Van Duyne as independent Directors. Neither Mr. Buono nor Mr. Van Duyne has worked previously for the Company.\n“We are honored to have such high-caliber professionals as Stefano and Richard join our Board,” stated Steven H. Rouhandeh, Abeona’s Executive Chairman. “They bring extensive expertise in areas of major importance and value for Abeona as we expand and strengthen our organization and work to accelerate our progress.\"\nMr. Buono is an accomplished Italian physicist and alumnus of The European Organization for Nuclear Research. Until recently, Mr. Buono was the Chief Executive Officer and President of Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA), an international radiopharmaceutical company he founded in 2002. During his tenure at AAA, the company expanded its presence to 13 countries, grew to 630 employees, established 21 manufacturing facilities, registered 8 diagnostic drugs and one therapeutic drug both in Europe and in the U.S., completed 13 acquisitions, and reached €150M in sales prior to the launch of its first therapeutic, Lutathera®, for the treatment of Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs), an orphan disease. Among Mr. Buono’s many accomplishments was bringing AAA public in November 2015, on the NASDAQ exchange. The company traded under the ticker symbol AAAP, until it was acquired by Novartis in January 2018.\n“Abeona’s ambitious gene and cell therapies have the promise to bring treatments to patients for whom there are currently no treatment options available,” stated Mr. Buono. “Its mission to bring relief and an extended, better quality of life to patients, many of whom are children, is closely aligned with my own values, and I am happy to be able to contribute to the Company.”\nRichard (Dick) Van Duyne held executive-level business development positions with Warner-Lambert, Med-Pointe, and Pharmacia, before joining Daiichi Sankyo in 2003 as Global Head of Business Development, working directly with senior management in Tokyo, the U.S. and Europe on key licensing and business development projects. From April 2013 through November 2017 he served in a senior advisor role, working with the CEO on special projects. He continues to work with Daiichi Sankyo as a consultant. Mr. Van Duyne serves on the boards of Daiichi Sankyo Inc. (the wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo) and Bionpharma Inc., a privately-held generics company based in Princeton, N.J. Mr. Van Duyne received his B.S. in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, his M.B.A. from the Wharton Graduate Division, University of Pennsylvania and his J.D. from Stanford University.\nCommenting on the news, Mr. Van Duyne stated, “I am excited to be joining Abeona’s Board at such a time of momentum for the company and the gene-therapy space as a whole. I believe that Abeona's pipeline has significant potential to bring transformative therapies to patients with devastating, life-threatening diseases.”\nAbout Abeona: Abeona Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases.
