    "text": "JOHNSON CITY, Tenn., May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NN, Inc., (NASDAQ: NNBR), a diversified industrial company, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOperating Segment Recasting\nAs previously disclosed, in January 2018, NN implemented a new enterprise and management structure and reorganized its businesses into three new divisions. In the first quarter of 2018, NN began reporting its financial results based on these divisions.\nMr. Holder commented, \"During the first quarter we completed the strategic realignment of our business to correspond with products sold and end markets served. This realignment resulted in three new segments: Life Sciences, Mobile Solutions and Power Solutions. We anticipate that the new enterprise structure will allow NN to accelerate growth and further balance our business.\"\nThe figures provided below include recast segment results reflecting NN's new financial reporting and organizational structure.\nGAAP Results\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 increased $11.6 million, or 7%, to $169.1 million, compared to $157.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. The life sciences and automotive end markets accounted for the increase.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.7 million, compared to $13.9 million for the same period in 2017. Net Income (loss) on a GAAP basis for first quarter of 2018 was $(6.0) million. This compares to net income on a GAAP basis of $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 net income included $5.5 million of income from discontinued operations, net of tax.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for first quarter 2018 in the Life Sciences segment was $4.2 million, compared to $3.6 million for the same period in 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for first quarter 2018 in the Mobile Solutions segment was $9.8 million, compared to $10.6 million for the same period in 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for first quarter 2018 in the Power Solutions segment was $5.2 million, compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2017.\nAdjusted Results\nAdjusted income from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $17.8 million, compared to $20.3 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted net income increased to $8.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share from $7.1 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the same period in 2017.\nRichard Holder, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy toward building a diversified industrial company. We acquired Bridgemedica, adding key product development capabilities for that segment and continued the execution of the Life Sciences integration. On May 7, we completed the acquisition of Paragon Medical, which we believe will be transformative to the Life Sciences segment. Overall operating performance in the quarter was in line with our expectations. Operating margins were as anticipated inclusive of the short-term impact of our growth programs investments as well as the integration of our recently acquired businesses (DRT Medical & Bridgemedica) reflecting their pre-synergy margins.\"\nLife Sciences\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $31.2 million, compared to $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 35% or $8.1 million. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter was $6.9 million, compared to $5.9 million in 2017.\nMr. Holder commented, \"In addition to opening a new customer collocated engineering facility, Life Sciences added several new operations through acquisition. The operating results of these acquired locations continue to improve quarter-over-quarter as synergies are realized through the implementation of the NN Operating System.\"\nMobile Solutions\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $89.8 million, compared to $86.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 4% or $3.4 million. Growth in our Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) automotive business primarily accounted for the increase. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter decreased $0.5 million to $11.0 million, compared to $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nMr. Holder commented, \"Mobile Solutions continues to win new business and outgrow its CAFE-related end market. During the first quarter, the segment was preparing to launch several new multi-year programs, which required substantial up-front investment. While these investments had a negative impact on profitability in the quarter, they are expected to drive enhanced growth for Mobile Solutions in both sales and margin in the long term.\"\nPower Solutions\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $48.7 million, compared to $48.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.3 million. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter was $9.2 million, compared to $9.6 million in 2017.\nMr. Holder commented, \"Power Solutions continues to execute launches on several large scale multi-year programs primarily in the Aerospace and Defense end market. Many of the associated costs are being incurred ahead of anticipated future revenues and therefore negatively impact overall margins in the short-term. In addition, sales in the first quarter were impacted by inclement weather in the Northeast United States.\"\nThe full set of financial guidance for the first quarter of 2018 can be found in our supplemental presentation posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nninc.com .\nNN will discuss its results during its quarterly investor conference call on May 10, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET.

Each of adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income per diluted share provide supplementary information about the impacts of restructuring and integration expense, acquisition and transition expenses, foreign-exchange, amortization of intangibles and other non-operating impacts on our business.\nThe financial tables found later in this press release include a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share to the U.S. GAAP financial measures of income from operations, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted share.\nNN, Inc., a diversified industrial company combines advanced engineering and production capabilities with in-depth materials science expertise to design and manufacture high-precision components and assemblies for a variety of markets on a global basis.

Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplementary information about the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and integration related expenses, foreign-exchange impacts on inter-company loans, reorganizational and impairment charges. Over the past four years, we have completed seven acquisitions, two of which were transformative for the Company, and sold two of our businesses. The costs we incurred in completing such acquisitions, including the amortization of intangibles and deferred financing costs, and these divestitures have been excluded from these measures because their size and inconsistent frequency are unrelated to our commercial performance during the period, and which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating costs. We exclude the impact of currency translation from these measures because foreign exchange rates are not under management's control and are subject to volatility. Other non-operating charges are excluded as the charges are not indicative of our ongoing operating cost. We believe the presentation of adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income per diluted share provide useful information in assessing our underlying business trends and facilitates comparison of our long-term performance over given periods.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to actual income growth derived from income amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\n(a) Non-GAAP Adjusted income from operations represents GAAP income from operations, adjusted to exclude the effects of restructuring and integration expense; non-operational charges related to acquisition and transition expense, intangible amortization costs for fair value step-up in values related to acquisitions, and when applicable, our share of income from joint venture operations. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within the industry. Non-GAAP adjusted income from operations is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to GAAP income from operations.\n(b) This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the table above. In addition, the footnotes above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. NN, Inc. estimates the tax effect of the adjustment items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying NN, Inc's. overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment.\n(c) Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the tax-affected effects of restructuring and integration charges (related to plant closures and other charges incurred to implement our strategic goals that do not necessarily represent a major strategic shift in operations), charges related to acquisition and transition costs, amortization of intangibles costs for fair value step-up in values related to acquisitions and amortization of deferred financing costs, foreign exchange gain (loss) on inter-company loans, gains and losses in the fair value of interest rate swaps, estimated interest expense on cash held from divestiture, the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and income from discontinued operations. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within the industry. Non-GAAP adjusted income (loss) from segment operations is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nn-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300645861.html\nSOURCE NN, Inc.",
