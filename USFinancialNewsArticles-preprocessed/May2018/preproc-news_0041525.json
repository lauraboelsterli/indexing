REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin Speaking at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Putin said that U.S. President Donald Trump was a good businessman who used his stance on Nord Stream to promote sales of liquefied natural gas to Europe from the United States.\nThe United States opposes the planned Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline that would connect Russia and Germany, believing it would undermine Europeâ€™s energy security.\nReporting by Denis Pinchuk; Writing by Andrey Ostroukh; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
