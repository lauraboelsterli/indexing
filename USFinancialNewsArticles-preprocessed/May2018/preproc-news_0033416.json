    "text": "Cisco stock fell more than 4 percent in after-market trading on Wednesday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter, which ended on April 28. The company will hold a conference call with analysts at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.\nEarnings: 66 cents per share, excluding certain items, vs. 65 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $12.46 billion, vs. $12.43 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. With respect to guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, Cisco said in a statement that it expects 68 to 70 cents in earnings per share, excluding certain items, on 4 to 6 percent revenue growth, which comes out to $12.62 to 12.86 billion in revenue. Analysts had expected 69 cents in earnings per share, excluding certain items, and $12.73 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.\nThe company's service business segment produced $3.16 billion in revenue, below the FactSet consensus estimate of $3.23 billion, according to StreetAccount.\nCisco \"continues to achieve success\" in selling its Catalyst 9000 data center switches, and the fact that they require customers to also buy software licenses supports the company's transition toward a larger focus on software, Raymond James analysts led by Simon Leopold wrote in a May 10 note.\nIn the fiscal third quarter Cisco announced a TV dongle for screen sharing and said it plans to work with the Saudi Telecom Company on the development of 5G mobile networks.\nMore recently, Cisco announced the sale of its Service Provider Video Software Solutions business to Permira. Terms weren't disclosed, although Bloomberg said Permira paid $1 billion.\nPiperJaffray analysts James Fish and Andrew Nowinski said in a note last week that the company could opt to use the deal's proceeds for a larger share buyback or for acquisitions. \"With recent announcements from VMware driving an increasing competitive environment against Cisco, we believe the strategic rationale for Cisco to potentially acquire Nutanix has increased to better compete with VMware,\" the analysts wrote.\nCisco stock has risen 17 percent since the beginning of the year.\nThis is breaking news.
