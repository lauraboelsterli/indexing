    "text": "ST. PAUL, Minn., May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Image Sensing Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISNS) today announced results for its first quarter\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nFirst quarter royalties were $2.2 million, an increase of 32 percent from the same period in the prior year. First quarter product sales were $844,000, a decrease of 41 percent from the same period in the prior year. Operating expenses totaled $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15 percent from the prior year period. Capitalized software costs in the first quarter were $66,000 compared to $174,000 in the prior year period. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $17,000, compared to net income of $197,000 for the same period in the prior year. Cash balance increased to $3.3 million, up from $3.2 million at the end of 2017.\nFirst-Quarter Results:\nImage Sensing Systems' (ISS) 2018 first quarter revenue was $3.0 million, compared to $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin from the first quarter of 2018 was 85 percent, a 6 percent increase from a gross margin of 79 percent for the same period in 2017. The increase in the gross margin percent was primarily the result of a larger portion of sales from royalties during the quarter. Revenue from royalties was $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, a 32 percent increase.\nProduct sales decreased to $844,000 in the 2018 first quarter, a 41 percent decrease from $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in product sales resulted from lower volumes of sales in all jurisdictions. Autoscope video product sales and royalties were $251,000 and $2.2 million, respectively, and RTMS radar product sales were $593,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Product sales gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 58 percent, compared to 62 percent in the prior year period. The decrease in product margin was due to a higher percentage of Autoscope video product sold during the quarter, compared to the same period in the prior year.\nISS’s net loss in the first quarter was $17,000, or no income (loss) per basic share, compared to net income of $197,000, or $0.04 per basic share, in the prior year period. The first quarter of 2018 net income includes operating expenses of $2.6 million, a 15 percent increase from the first quarter of 2017. This increase is primarily due to increased sales and marketing costs related to a semi-annual industry trade show, Intertraffic, that took place in the first quarter of 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, ISS capitalized $66,000 of internal software development costs compared to $174,000 in the prior year period.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the amortization of intangible assets and depreciation for the applicable periods, operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $157,000 compared to operating income of $353,000 in the prior year period.\n“While we are encouraged by the increase in Autoscope royalty from the prior year period, we are very disappointed in the decrease in product sales. In response to this product revenue erosion, we have appointed new sales leadership. We are excited to have Andrew Markese join our team as Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing effective May 21 st ,” said Chad Stelzig, CEO of ISS. “Andy has demonstrated success cultivating high performing sales teams and taking a hands-on approach to generating sales growth.”\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nWe provide certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States).

Management uses this non-GAAP information to evaluate short-term and long-term operating trends in our core operations. Non-GAAP information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for or an alternative to GAAP financial measures and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAbout Image Sensing Systems\nImage Sensing Systems, Inc. is a global company dedicated to helping improve safety and efficiency for cities and highways by developing and delivering above-ground detection technology, applications and solutions.

Management believes non-GAAP income from operations is a useful indicator of our financial performance and our ability to generate cash flows from operations. Our definition of non-GAAP income from operations may not be comparable to similarly titled definitions used by other companies. The table below reconciles non-GAAP income from operations, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to comparable GAAP financial measures:\nThree-Month\nPeriods Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Income (loss) from operations $ (17) $ 198 Amortization of intangible assets 111 90 Depreciation 63 65 Non-GAAP income from operations $ 157 $ 353 Note – Our calculation of non-GAAP income (loss) from operations is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and is not in accordance with, or preferable to, “as reported”, or GAAP financial data. However, we are providing this information, as we believe it facilitates analysis of the Company’s financial performance by investors and financial analysts.\nContact:\nTodd Slawson, Interim Chief Financial Officer\nImage Sensing Systems\nPhone: 651.603.7700\nSource:Image Sensing Systems, Inc.",
