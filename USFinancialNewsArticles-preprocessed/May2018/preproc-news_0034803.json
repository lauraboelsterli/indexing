    "text": "FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, May 15 (Reuters) - Shareholder advisory and proxy voting firm ISS is recommending that investors in Uniper do not back a proposal to appoint a special auditor at the group’s annual general meeting, it said in a note to clients.\nThe proposal, filed by Cornwall Luxembourg S.a.r.l., a fund backed by activist investor Elliott, is aimed at investigating whether Uniper’s management worked against the planned sale of a 46.65 percent stake held by E.ON to Finnish peer Fortum.
