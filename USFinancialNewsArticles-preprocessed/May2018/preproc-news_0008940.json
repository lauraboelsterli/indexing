Reported GAAP results include Special Items, which are excluded from adjusted measures. Special Items are not allocated to any segment and therefore only impact reported GAAP results of Yum China. See \"Reconciliation of Reported GAAP Results to Adjusted Measures\" within this release.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nTotal revenues increased 15% year over year to $2.2 billion from $1.9 billion (6% year over year increase excluding foreign currency translation (\"F/X\")).

The strong operational and financial performance of KFC is particularly encouraging as it successfully lapped two strong first quarters in 2017 and 2016. During the quarter, while Pizza Hut had some challenges with same-store sales growth and restaurant margin, we remain committed to our revitalization plan and key focus areas to drive sales growth. We believe our focus on food innovation and customer experience, together with the execution of strategic priorities in digital and delivery, has enabled us, and will continue to enable us, to build a stronger Yum China,\" said Joey Wat, CEO of Yum China.\n\"As part of our capital allocation strategy to invest in and grow our core brands, we acquired an additional 36% interest in Wuxi KFC, increasing our total equity interest to 83%. In 2018, we now expect our annual new build to reach 600-650 units, increasing from the previously announced 550-600 units. We will continue to invest in digital and delivery, which we believe will drive long-term growth,\" remarked Jacky Lo, CFO of Yum China.\nDividend and Share Repurchase\nThe Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share on Yum China's common stock, payable as of the close of business on June 20, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 30, 2018.

amounts)\n(unaudited)\nIn this press release:\nThe Company provides certain percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation (\"F/X\"). These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the F/X impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. System sales growth reflects the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company-owned, franchise and unconsolidated affiliate restaurants that operate our Concepts, except for non-Company-owned restaurants for which we do not receive a sales-based royalty. Sales of franchise and unconsolidated affiliate restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise fees for the Company at a rate of approximately 6% of system sales. Franchise and unconsolidated affiliate restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise fees are included in the Company's revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company revised its definition of same-store sales growth to represent the estimated percentage change in sales of food of all restaurants in the Company system that have been open prior to the first day of our prior fiscal year. We refer to these as our \"base\" stores. Previously, same-store sales growth represented the estimated percentage change in sales of all restaurants in the Company system that have been open for one year or more, and the base stores changed on a rolling basis from month to month. This revision was made to align with how management measures performance internally and focuses on trends of a more stable base of stores. Prior period results have been recast accordingly. Company Restaurant profit (\"Restaurant profit\") is defined as Company sales less expenses incurred directly by our Company-owned restaurants in generating Company sales. Company restaurant margin percentage is defined as Restaurant profit divided by Company sales.\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") in this press release, the Company provides measures adjusted for Special Items, which include Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as net income including noncontrolling interests adjusted for income tax, interest income, depreciation, amortization and other items, including store impairment charges. The Special Item for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 represents a gain recognized from the re-measurement of our previously held equity interest at fair value upon acquisition, as described in the accompanying notes. The Company excludes impact from Special Items for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. Special Items are not included in any of our segment results. These adjusted measures are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these adjusted measures provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present results, excluding those items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to its nature. These adjusted measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial results, but should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income and other information presented herein. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures to adjusted measures follows.\nQuarter Ended\n3/31/2018\n3/31/2017\nDetail of Special Items\nGain from re-measurement of equity interest upon acquisition (b)\n98\nâ€”\nSpecial Items Income - Operating Profit\n98\nâ€”\nTax Expenses on Special Items (c)\n(24)\nâ€”\nSpecial Items Income, net of tax â€“ including noncontrolling interests\n74\nâ€”\nSpecial Items Income, net of tax â€“ noncontrolling interests\nâ€”\nâ€”\nSpecial Items Income, net of tax â€“Yum China Holdings, Inc.\n74\nâ€”\nWeighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding\n401\n395\nSpecial Items Diluted Earnings Per Common Share\n0.19\nâ€”\nReconciliation of Operating Profit to Adjusted Operating Profit\nOperating Profit\n395\n296\nSpecial Items Income - Operating Profit\n98\nâ€”\nAdjusted Operating Profit\n297\n296\nReconciliation of EPS to Adjusted EPS\nDiluted Earnings Per Common Share\n0.72\n0.52\nSpecial Items Diluted Earnings Per Common Share\n0.19\nâ€”\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share\n0.53\n0.52\nReconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Adjusted Effective Tax Rate\nEffective Tax Rate\n26.6\n%\n30.0\n%\nImpact on Effective Tax Rate as a result of Special Items\n(0.5)\n%\n(0.0)\n%\nAdjusted Effective Tax Rate\n27.1\n%\n30.0\n%\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\n(amounts in US$ million)\n(unaudited)\nNet income, along with the reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA, is presented below.\nQuarter Ended\n3/31/2018\n3/31/2017\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet Income â€“ Yum China Holdings, Inc.\n288\n204\nNet income â€“ noncontrolling interests\n$\n8\n$\n6\nIncome tax provision\n107\n90\nInterest income, net\n(8)\n(4)\nOperating Profit\n395\n296\nDepreciation and amortization\n118\n96\nStore impairment charges\n2\n4\nSpecial Items Income - Operating Profit\n(98)\nâ€”\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n417\n$\n396\nUnit Count by Brand\nKFC\n2017\nNew Builds\nClosures\nRefranchised\nOthers\n2018\nCompany-owned\n4,112\n108\n(22)\n(2)\n157\n4,353\nUnconsolidated affiliates\n891\n33\n(5)\nâ€”\n(157)\n762\nFranchise\n485\n3\n(3)\n2\nâ€”\n487\nTotal\n5,488\n144\n(30)\nâ€”\nâ€”\n5,602\nPizza Hut\n2017\nNew Builds\nClosures\nRefranchised\n2018\nCompany-owned\n2,166\n40\n(22)\n(1)\n2,183\nFranchise\n29\n1\nâ€”\n1\n31\nTotal\n2,195\n41\n(22)\nâ€”\n2,214\nAll Other Segments\n2017\nNew Builds\nClosures\n2018\nCompany-owned\n29\n1\n(3)\n27\nFranchise\n271\n17\n(19)\n269\nTotal\n300\n18\n(22)\n296\nYum China Holdings, Inc.\nSegment Results\n(amounts in US$ million)\n(unaudited)\nQuarter Ended 3/31/18\nKFC\nPizza Hut\nAll Other\nSegments\nCorporate\nand\nUnallocated (1)\nTotal\nCompany sales\n$\n1,444\n$\n564\n$\n8\n$\nâ€”\n$\n2,016\nFranchise fees and income\n37\n1\n2\nâ€”\n40\nRevenues from transactions with\nfranchisees and unconsolidated affiliates\n17\nâ€”\n7\n137\n161\nOther revenues\nâ€”\nâ€”\n3\n1\n4\nTotal revenues\n$\n1,498\n$\n565\n$\n20\n$\n138\n$\n2,221\nCompany restaurant expenses\n1,143\n504\n8\nâ€”\n1,655\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n46\n28\n7\n33\n114\nFranchise expenses\n19\n1\nâ€”\nâ€”\n20\nExpenses for transactions with\nfranchisees and unconsolidated affiliates\n17\nâ€”\n6\n137\n160\nOther operating costs\nâ€”\nâ€”\n3\n1\n4\nOther income, net\n(23)\n(2)\nâ€”\n(102)\n(127)\n1,202\n531\n24\n69\n1,826\nOperating Profit (Loss)\n$\n296\n$\n34\n$\n(4)\n$\n69\n$\n395\nQuarter Ended 3/31/17\nKFC\nPizza Hut\nAll Other\nSegments\nCorporate\nand\nUnallocated (1)\nTotal\nCompany sales\n$\n1,199\n$\n527\n$\n12\n$\nâ€”\n$\n1,738\nFranchise fees and income\n34\n1\n1\nâ€”\n36\nRevenues from transactions with\nfranchisees and unconsolidated affiliates\n17\nâ€”\n5\n125\n147\nOther revenues\nâ€”\nâ€”\n5\nâ€”\n5\nTotal revenues\n$\n1,250\n$\n528\n$\n23\n$\n125\n$\n1,926\nCompany restaurant expenses\n950\n423\n11\nâ€”\n1,384\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n39\n25\n3\n31\n98\nFranchise expenses\n17\n1\nâ€”\nâ€”\n18\nExpenses for transactions with\nfranchisees and unconsolidated affiliates\n17\nâ€”\n5\n125\n147\nOther operating costs\nâ€”\nâ€”\n3\nâ€”\n3\nOther income, net\n(18)\n(1)\nâ€”\n(1)\n(20)\nTotal costs and expenses, net\n1,005\n448\n22\n155\n1,630\nOperating Profit (Loss)\n$\n245\n$\n80\n$\n1\n$\n(30)\n$\n296\nThe above tables reconcile segment information, which is based on management responsibility, with our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n(1)\nCorporate and unallocated expenses comprise items that are not allocated to segments for performance reporting purposes.
