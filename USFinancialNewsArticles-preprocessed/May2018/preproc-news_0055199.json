    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, May 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Indiana Biosciences Research Institute (IBRI) today announced the appointment of Stephanie Grinage as vice president for Advancement. As IBRI’s top development officer, she will serve as the primary strategic partner in cultivating and maintaining new and existing relationships with major donors and oversee and manage all aspects of IBRI’s fundraising programs. She will assume this role with the IBRI June 4, 2018.\nGrinage currently serves as associate vice chancellor for Medical Advancement and associate dean for the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Medicine where she directs all advancement activities across the College of Medicine campuses to maximize private philanthropy . Prior to UIC, she served in fundraising positions as KU Endowment’s vice president for Medical Development supporting the University of Kansas Medical Center; associate vice president for the University of South Florida/USF Health, and in leadership development positions with Arizona State University and Wichita State University.\n“I look forward to being a critical resource in helping IBRI support its strategy of enabling discovery science and innovation within and beyond the state’s borders,” Grinage said. “IBRI’s focus on collaborating with academic and industry researchers combined with its continued growth provide a solid foundation for improving the health of diverse populations.”\nGrinage is a veteran of three significant endowment campaigns: the $1 billion Campaign Illinois initiative, the Campaign for Leadership at Arizona State University, and the $1.2 billion, “Far Above: The Campaign for Kansas”. During her tenure at KU Endowment, she was a member of the team that created the KU Institute for Advancing Medical Innovation, a model for philanthropy, industry and academia to collaborate in advancing university innovations in the life sciences. Most recently, she has been instrumental in launching the $750 million IGNITE campaign for UIC.\n“We are delighted to welcome Stephanie to the institute’s senior leadership team. We are convinced that Stephanie will assist us in securing the financial resources needed to achieve IBRI’s mission in developing innovative solutions to combat and/or ultimately cure diabetes and selected cardiometabolic diseases,” said Rainer Fischer, Ph.D., chief executive officer and chief scientific and innovation officer for IBRI. “With nearly 30 years of experience in advancement, Stephanie knows how to develop highly collaborative, strategic and sustainable donor relationships, which will support our significant growth plans and assist in achieving our strategic goals.”\nGrinage received her Bachelor of Arts degree in communications from Fort Hays State University in Hays, Kan., she also attended Arizona State University in Tempe, Ariz., and she is completing her Executive Masters in Health Administration from the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nAbout the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute\nThe Indiana Biosciences Research Institute (IBRI) is an independent, nonprofit discovery science and applied research institute focused on innovation targeting cardiometabolic diseases, diabetes and poor nutrition. Inspired by the state and Indiana’s leading life sciences companies, research universities and philanthropic community, the IBRI is building a world-class organization of researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs that will catalyze scientific discovery and its application, resulting in improved health outcomes for patients and consumers. Initial funding was provided by the State of Indiana, Lilly Endowment, Eli Lilly and Company, Corteva Agrisciences, Agriculture Division of DowDuPont, Roche Diagnostics, Indiana University Health and the Indiana University School of Medicine. IBRI is looking to expand partnerships with life sciences and IT companies and philanthropic organizations to increase the potential for research, discovery and collaboration.
