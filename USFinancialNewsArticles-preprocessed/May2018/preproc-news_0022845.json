Whitestone is a pure-play community-centered retail REIT that acquires, owns, manages, develops and redevelops high quality “E-Commerce Resistant” neighborhood, community and lifestyle retail centers principally located in the largest, fastest-growing and most affluent markets in the Sunbelt. Whitestone’s optimal mix of national, regional and local tenants provide daily necessities, needed services and entertainment to the communities in which they are located.\nHighlights\nAll per share amounts presented in this news release are on a diluted per common share and operating partnership (“OP”) unit basis unless stated otherwise.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017:\n18.9% growth in revenues to $33.6 million Increase in net income attributable to Whitestone REIT to $3.0 million and $0.07 per share vs. $1.4 million and $0.04 per share 23.2% growth in net operating income (“NOI”) to $23.2 million 3.9% same store NOI growth in wholly owned portfolio. 4.2% same store NOI growth including consolidated partnership properties 37.1% increase in Funds from Operations (“FFO”) to $10.0 million or $0.24 per share vs. $7.3 million or $0.23 per share 23.9% increase in FFO Core to $12.6 million or $0.31 per share vs. $10.2 million or $0.32 per share 6.6% increase in Annualized Base Rent (“ABR”) per leased square foot to $18.50 13.4% increase in rental rates on new and renewal leases blended on a GAAP basis for the quarter and 9.1% for the trailing twelve months Incurred professional fees of $0.7 million in 2018 for proxy contest\nJim Mastandrea, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Whitestone REIT commented, “2018 is off to a great start for Whitestone, evidenced by our best leasing quarter since the Company's public listing in 2010. Our team's efforts are delivering outstanding results including company records for leasing volume, total square footage leased, and total value of leases signed in the first quarter. We also ended the quarter approaching 91% occupancy in our community centered service oriented portfolio in high growth markets. Whitestone continues to drive long-term shareholder value through its differentiated, E-Commerce Resistant business model.”\nReal Estate Portfolio Update\nCommunity Centered Properties TM Portfolio Statistics:\nAs of March 31, 2018, Whitestone wholly owned 58 Community Centered Properties TM with 4.9 million square feet of gross leasable area (\"GLA\"). Whitestone’s Retail Community Centered Properties TM are located in Austin (4), San Antonio (3), Chicago (1), Dallas-Fort Worth (7), Houston (16) and the greater Phoenix metropolitan area (27). In addition to being business friendly, the Texas and Arizona markets are among the top in the country in terms of size, economic strength and population growth. Between 2017 and 2022, all of these cities are expected to experience significant population growth, led by Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth each at +9.7%, San Antonio at +8.6%, Houston at +8.0% and Phoenix at +6.6% (1) . Whitestone believes that the Company’s properties in these markets are located on the best retail corners embedded in affluent communities. The Company also owns a majority interest in and manages 14 properties containing 1.5 million square feet of GLA through its investment in Pillarstone Capital REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (\"Pillarstone\" or \"Pillarstone OP\").\nAt the end of the first quarter, the Company's diversified tenant base in our wholly-owned properties comprised 1,306 tenants, with the largest tenant accounting for only 3.0% of annualized base rental revenues. Lease terms range from less than one year for smaller tenants to over 15 years for larger tenants. The leases generally include minimum monthly lease payments and tenant reimbursements for payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance, and typically exclude restrictive lease clauses.\nLeasing Activity:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the leasing team signed 127 leases totaling 373,511 square feet in new, expansion and renewal leases, compared to 91 leases totaling 220,293 square feet in the first quarter of 2017. The total lease value was $29.7 million compared to $16.3 million during the same period last year\nThe Company's total operating portfolio occupancy stood at 90.9% at quarter end, up 233 basis points from 88.6% at March 31, 2017.\nDisposition Activity:\nIn February 2018, the Company completed the sale of Bellnott Square, in Houston, Texas, for $4.7 million. This disposition\nwas consistent with the Company's strategy of recycling capital by disposing of Non-Core Properties. A gain on sale of approximately $0.3 million was recorded for the sale.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nBalance Sheet:\nReflecting the Company’s acquisition and disposition activity during the quarter and selective development and redevelopment, undepreciated real estate assets increased $223.9 million, or 24.2%, to $1.148 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017.\nLiquidity, Debt and Credit Facility:\nAs of March 31, 2018, 49 of the Whitestone's wholly-owned 58 properties were unencumbered by mortgage debt, with an undepreciated cost basis of $751.5 million. The Company had total real estate debt, net of cash of $658.9 million, of which $428.13 million, or approximately 65%, was subject to fixed interest rates. The Company's weighted average interest rate on all fixed rate debt as of the end of the fourth quarter was 3.9% and the weighted average remaining term was 5.0 years.\nAt quarter end, Whitestone had $9.3 million of cash available on its balance sheet and $58.8 million of available capacity under its credit facility, before the $200 million accordion option.\nDividend\nOn March 6, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.285 per common share and OP unit for the second quarter of 2018, to be paid in three equal installments of $0.095 in April, May and June of 2018.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company reaffirms its previously released guidance for 2018 and expects net income attributable to Whitestone REIT for 2018 to range from $0.27 to $0.32 per share and FFO and FFO Core to range from $0.96 to $1.01 and $1.19 to $1.24 per share, respectively. This guidance reflects the Board’s and management’s view of current and future market conditions, as well as the earnings impact of events referenced elsewhere in this release and during the Company’s conference call. This guidance does not include the impact of expenses related to the 2018 Annual Meeting proxy contest or the operational or capital impact of any future unannounced acquisition or disposition activity. Please refer to the “2018 Financial Guidance” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - 2018 Financial Guidance” sections of the supplemental data package for the full list of guidance information.\nAccounting Treatment of Pillarstone\nIn November 2017, we received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC (the “Staff”) relating to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. In their letter, the Staff requested that we provide them with an analysis to support our determination that Pillarstone should be consolidated in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. After communicating our analysis and conclusions to the Staff and responding to additional questions from the Staff relating to this matter, the Staff did not object to or otherwise take exception to our determination that Pillarstone should be consolidated in our financial statements, but noted that the terms of the Management Agreements with Pillarstone may warrant a going forward evaluation of such matters and suggested we consider pre-clearing future accounting treatment of Pillarstone.\nIn connection with the preparation and review of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we concluded, in accordance with the Staff’s prior advice, and after consultation with our outside accounting advisors, that it would be prudent to seek the pre-clearance of the Staff of the Office of the Chief Accountant (the “OCA”) with respect to our determination that Pillarstone should continue to be consolidated in our financial statements. Notwithstanding the Staff’s prior decision that it would not object to or otherwise take exception to our financial statement presentation relating to Pillarstone, the Staff of the OCA informed us that it objects to the consolidation of Pillarstone in our financial statements since the transaction in December 2016. We and our independent registered public accounting firm continue to believe that our accounting treatment of Pillarstone is correct. As a result, we are seeking a formal appeal to the Chief Accountant of the SEC of the determination of the Staff of the OCA, which is pending as of this date.\nIf our appeal with the SEC is unsuccessful, we will not be permitted to consolidate Pillarstone in our financial statements under Variable Interest Entity accounting rules. While we believe the impact to net income, FFO and FFO Core resulting from this change would result in a nominal increase in these metrics, nonetheless, the changes to our financial statements may require us to restate or revise our historical financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the interim periods that are affected.\nConference Call Information\nIn conjunction with the issuance of its financial results, you are invited to listen to the Company’s earnings release conference call to be broadcast live on Monday, May 7, 2018 at 5:00 P.M.

The Company intends for all such to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as applicable. Such information is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as well as known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. Such can generally be identified by the Company's use of forward-looking terminology, such as “may,” “will,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “goals” or similar words or phrases that are predictions of future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters.\nThe following are some of the factors that could cause the Company's actual results and its expectations to differ materially from those described in the Company's : the outcome of our appeal regarding our accounting treatment of Pillarstone, the Company's ability to meet its long-term goals, its assumptions regarding its earnings guidance, including its ability to execute effectively its acquisition and disposition strategy, to continue to execute its development pipeline on schedule and at the expected costs, and its ability to grow its NOI as expected, which could be impacted by a number of factors, including, among other things, its ability to continue to renew leases or re-let space on attractive terms and to otherwise address its leasing rollover; its ability to successfully identify, finance and consummate suitable acquisitions, and the impact of such acquisitions, including financing developments, capitalization rates and internal rate of return; the Company’s ability to reduce or otherwise effectively manage its general and administrative expenses, including those in connection with the recent proposed nomination of trustees by a shareholder of the Company; the Company’s ability to fund from cash flows or otherwise distributions to its shareholders at current rates or at all; current adverse market and economic conditions; lease terminations or lease defaults; the impact of competition on the Company's efforts to renew existing leases; changes in the economies and other conditions of the specific markets in which the Company operates; economic, legislative and regulatory changes, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; the success of the Company's real estate strategies and investment objectives; the Company's ability to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and other factors detailed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) from time to time.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these , which speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any such contained , and the Company does not intend to publicly update or revise any , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release contains supplemental financial measures that are not calculated pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) including FFO, FFO Core, and NOI. Following are explanations and reconciliations of these metrics to their most comparable GAAP metric.\nFFO: Management believes that FFO is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance. The Company computes FFO as defined by NAREIT, which states that FFO should represent net income available to common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from sales of operating assets, impairment charges and extraordinary items, plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties, including the Company's share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships. FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions and service debt.\nManagement considers FFO a useful additional measure of performance for an equity REIT because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of its properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that FFO provides a more meaningful and accurate indication of the Company's performance and useful information for the investment community to compare Whitestone to other REITs since FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs.\nOther REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO, and accordingly, the Company's FFO may not be comparable to other REITs. The Company presents FFO per diluted share calculations that are based on the outstanding dilutive common shares plus the outstanding OP units for the periods presented.\nFFO Core: Management believes that the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition includes certain non-cash and non-comparable items that affect the Company's period-over-period performance. These items include, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash share-based compensation expense, rent support agreement payments received from sellers on acquired assets and acquisition costs. In addition, the Company believes that FFO Core is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing the Company to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO. However, other REITs may use different adjustments, and the Company's FFO Core may not be comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of other REITs.\nNOI: Management believes that NOI is a useful measure of the Company's property operating performance. The Company defines NOI as operating revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, involuntary conversion, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets and capital expenditures and leasing costs, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. The Company uses NOI to evaluate its operating performance since NOI allows the Company to evaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base, have on the Company's results, margins and returns. In addition, management believes that NOI provides useful information to the investment community about the Company's property and operating performance when compared to other REITs since NOI is generally recognized as a standard measure of property performance in the real estate industry. However, NOI should not be viewed as a measure of the Company's overall financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, involuntary conversion, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets, and the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company's properties. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, the Company's NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs.\nAdditional Information\nWhitestone REIT, its trustees and certain of its executive officers and Innisfree M&A Incorporated on their behalf may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from Company shareholders in connection with the matters to be considered at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting. The Company intends to file a proxy statement and WHITE proxy card with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with any such solicitation of proxies from Company shareholders.
