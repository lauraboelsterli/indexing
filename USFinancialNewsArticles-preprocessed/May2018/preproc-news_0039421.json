Medifirst is pleased to announce that Walter Molokie, RPh has joined the company as CEO of CCRx. Graduate of Long Island University, his expertise is in Specialty Pharmacy and Home Infusion. His background includes: Adjunct Professor of Alternate Site Pharmacy Practice-LIU, Regional Vice-President of Operations for Kabafusion, a national provider of Specialty Pharmacy and Home Infusion, Director of Pharmacy for Option Care, a Walgreens Company, Manager of Specialty Pharmacy for Direct Script, a wholly owned division of Oxford Health Care and Founder and President of Total Home Health Care.\nCommented Medifirst President Bruce J. Schoengood, “We are very excited to have Walter join Medifirst. He brings decades of experience and expertise to Medifirst and CCRx. Our Time Machine Infrared Laser is product driven which requires a purchaser to be a healthcare professional that can understand and see the benefits of our laser technology, and we believe Walter will be a great ambassador of our laser product. CCRx offers pharmacies increased revenue via business and billing solutions at no cost or expense to them.” Continued Schoengood, “This business diversification, we believe, will add great value to the company. It adds a balance of both products and services that fit very comfortably within the Company’s business strategy.”\nCCRx services of pharmacy consulting and revenue stream management, utilizing over 60 years of combined Specialty Pharmacy and Infusion Therapy experience, seek to increase profits for pharmacies. Our contracting services will include: sales, patient care, operations, and navigation of the complex landscape of major medical insurance billing. The CCRx division will provide key services to undervalued clients by securing reimbursement of overlooked revenue within the ever-expanding market of the specialty pharmacy market in today's healthcare system.\nSpecialty drugs, often described as prescription drugs that are difficult to manufacture and require special handling or administration, have limited distribution, target a narrow group of chronic diseases, and require ongoing clinical support. We believe that CCRx has the experience and expertise in Specialty Pharmacy and Infusion Therapy that many professional do not have. Industry analysts projects the total pharmaceutical industry to exceed $483 billion in 2020, with specialty pharmaceuticals making up 44% of the revenue.\nAbout Medifirst Solutions, Inc.\nMedifirst Solutions, Inc., in response to its Premarket Notification 510(k) submission for “The Time Machine” Series Laser, received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market its infrared Time Machine TTML-8102000 Laser Thermal Therapeutic Device.
