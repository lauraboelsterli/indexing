(NASDAQ:ECOL) (“the Company”) today reported total revenue of $120.1 million and net income of $9.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the quarter-ended March 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes a gain on the issuance of a property easement, foreign currency translation gains and losses, and business development expenses, was $0.36 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, up 57% from the first quarter of 2017.\n“Operating results and adjusted EBITDA were in line with our expectations for the first quarter,” commented Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Feeler. “Continued positive momentum in Event Business for the Environmental Services segment led to an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2017. We also saw our Base Business grow 2% on top of what was a very strong quarter a year ago. The Field and Industrial Services segment had a solid quarter, with revenues up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2017.”\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Environmental Services (“ES”) segment revenue was $86.5 million, up from $81.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase consisted of 5% growth in treatment and disposal (“T&D”) revenue and 12% growth in transportation revenue compared to the first quarter of 2017. Field and Industrial Services (“FIS”) segment revenue was $33.6 million 2018, up 16% from $28.9 million in the same period of 2017, reflecting continued growth in our Total Waste Management and Small Quantity Generation business lines as well as stronger overall market conditions.\nGross profit 2018 was $35.7 million, up 12% from $31.9 million in the same quarter last year. ES segment gross profit was $32.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $28.7 million in the same quarter of 2017. T&D gross margin for the ES segment was 40% 2018, compared to 38% 2017. Gross profit for the FIS segment in the first quarter of 2018 was $3.2 million up slightly from the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin for the FIS segment was 10% in first quarter of 2018, compared to 11% in the first quarter of 2017 on a less favorable service mix.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense 2018 was $22.2 million, compared with $19.7 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher labor and incentive compensation costs and higher consulting and professional services in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating income 2018 was $13.4 million compared to $12.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 11%.\nNet interest expense 2018 was $2.8 million, down from $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was the result of a lower interest rate on our new credit facility in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nOther income 2018 was $2.1 million compared to $137,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to a $2.0 million gain ($0.07 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2018 on the issuance of a property easement on a portion of unutilized Company-owned land at one of our operating facilities.\nThe Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate 2018 was 27.6%, down from 37.3% 2017. The decrease was primarily due to tax reform passed in the fourth quarter of 2017, which reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nNet income 2018 was $9.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Tax reform favorably impacted net income by approximately $0.04 per diluted share compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the gain on the issuance of a property easement, foreign currency translation gains and losses, and business development expenses, was $0.36 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.23 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA 2018 was $24.5 million, up 4% from $23.5 million in the same period last year.\nReconciliations of earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share and net income to adjusted EBITDA are attached as Exhibit A to this release.\n2018 OUTLOOK\n“Overall, business conditions continue to steadily improve, consistent with our expectations coming into the year,” added Feeler. “Our underlying Base Business remains strong and we continue to bid and secure our fair share of Event Business opportunities, further supporting our view of sequentially stronger quarterly financial performance as we progress through the year.”\nWith results in line with expectations, the Company reaffirms its previously issued 2018 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $122 million to $128 million and its diluted earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.34. The Company’s earnings guidance excludes the gain on the issuance of a property easement, business development expenses and foreign currency gains and losses.\nThe following table reconciles our projected net income to our adjusted EBITDA guidance range:\nFor the Year Ending December 31, 2018 (in thousands) Low High Net Income $ 48,441 $ 52,641 Income tax expense 17,949 19,449 Interest expense 10,400 10,400 Other income (2,290 ) (2,290 ) Depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment 29,400 29,700 Amortization of intangible assets 9,600 9,600 Stock-based compensation 4,200 4,200 Accretion of closure & post-closure obligations 4,300 4,300 Adjusted EBITDA $ 122,000 $ 128,000 DIVIDEND\nOn April 2, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per common share for stockholders of record on April 20, 2018. The $3.9 million dividend was paid on April 27, 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nUS Ecology, Inc. will hold an investor conference call on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (8:00 a.m. Mountain Daylight Time) to discuss these results and its current financial position and business outlook.

Because adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Items excluded from adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our business development expenses, which may vary significantly quarter to quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense/benefit, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, accretion of closure and post-closure liabilities, foreign currency gain/loss, and other income/expense, which are not considered part of usual business operations.\nPro Forma adjusted EBITDA\nThe Company defines Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA as adjusted EBITDA (see definition above) plus business development expenses incurred during the period. We believe Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA is helpful in understanding our business and how it relates to our 2018 guidance which does not include business development expenses.\nThe following reconciliation itemizes the differences between reported net income and adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Income $ 9,243 $ 5,185 Income tax expense 3,520 3,079 Interest expense 2,809 4,130 Interest income (24 ) (10 ) Foreign currency (gain) loss 14 (88 ) Other income (2,123 ) (137 ) Depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment 6,605 6,633 Amortization of intangible assets 2,302 2,670 Stock-based compensation 1,068 918 Accretion and non-cash adjustments of closure & post-closure obligations 1,074 1,073 Adjusted EBITDA $ 24,488 $ 23,453 Business development expenses 11 37 Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA $ 24,499 $ 23,490 Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share\nThe Company defines adjusted earnings per diluted share as net income adjusted for the after-tax impact of the gain on the issuance of a property easement, the after-tax impact of business development costs, and non-cash foreign currency translation gains or losses, divided by the number of diluted shares used in the earnings per share calculation.\nThe property easement gain relates to the issuance of an easement on a small portion of owned land at an operating facility which should not hinder our future use. The foreign currency translation gains or losses excluded from the earnings per diluted share calculation are related to intercompany loans between our Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent which have been established as part of our tax and treasury management strategy. These intercompany loans are payable in Canadian dollars (“CAD”) requiring us to revalue the outstanding loan balance through our consolidated income statement based on the CAD/United States currency movements from period to period. Business development costs relate to expenses incurred to evaluate businesses for potential acquisition or costs related to closing and integrating successfully acquired businesses.\nWe believe excluding the gain on issuance of a property easement, the after-tax impact of business development costs, and non-cash foreign currency translation gains or losses provides meaningful information to investors regarding the operational and financial performance of the Company.\nThe following reconciliation itemizes the differences between reported net income and earnings per diluted share to adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n(in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Income before\nincome taxes Income tax\nexpense Net income per share Income before\nincome taxes Income tax\nexpense Net income per share As Reported $ 12,763 $ (3,520 ) $ 9,243 $ 0.42 $ 8,264 $ (3,079 ) $ 5,185 $ 0.24 Adjustments: Less: TX land easement gain (1,990 ) 549 (1,441 ) (0.07 ) - - - - Plus: Business development costs 11 (3 ) 8 - 37 (14 ) 23 - Non-cash foreign currency translation (gain) loss 171 (47 ) 124 0.01 (145 ) 54 (91 ) (0.01 ) As Adjusted $ 10,955 $ (3,021 ) $ 7,934 $ 0.36 $ 8,156 $ (3,039 ) $ 5,117 $ 0.23 Shares used in earnings per diluted share calculation 21,957 21,845 For Immediate Release\nContact: Alison Ziegler, Darrow Associates (201)220-2678\naziegler@darrowir.com www.usecology.com\nSource:US Ecology, Inc.",
