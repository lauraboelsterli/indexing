GAAP net income attributable to Xcerra for the quarter was $11,754,000, or $0.21 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring and related provision charges of $452,000, amortization of purchased intangible assets of $128,000, and transaction related expenses of $778,000, non-GAAP net income attributable to Xcerra for the quarter was $13,112,000, or $0.24 per diluted share.\nAs a result of the pending acquisition of the company by Cohu, Inc., the company will not hold a quarterly conference call and webcast, and will not provide an outlook for its future financial results.\nInformation About Non-GAAP Measures\nXcerra supplements its GAAP financial results by providing non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of the company. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter ended April 30, 2018 excludes the amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring charges, and other one-time adjustments. Management of the company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful for internal comparison to historical operating results as well as to the operating results of the company’s competitors, and believes that this information is useful to investors for the same purposes. A reconciliation between the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the attached tables. Readers are reminded that non-GAAP information is merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.\nNo Offer or Solicitation\nThis communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval.
