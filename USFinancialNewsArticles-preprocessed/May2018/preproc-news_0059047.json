    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 10:28 AM / Updated 44 minutes ago Germany's Bayer reviewing R&D locations at pharma business Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Bayer ( BAYGn.DE ) is reviewing its research and development locations for its pharmaceuticals business, a spokesman for the German conglomerate said on Thursday. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Germany's largest drugmaker Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals is pictured on the front of its building in Berlin April 28, 2011. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch\nGerman magazine Wirtschaftswoche first reported that Bayer was screening its pharmaceutical locations and that employees in Germany feared up to 1,000 jobs could be cut. The magazine said Bayer’s board would look at the review at the start of June.\nThe spokesman for Bayer gave no details on the timeline for the review, given the title ‘Super Bowl’, and did not say how many jobs would be affected. He said Bayer routinely examined its R&D operations.\nBayer employs around 8,000 people worldwide in its pharmaceutical business. In November, it announced that it would combine its R&D operations into a new function.\nSome of the German group’s shareholders have voiced concern that Bayer risks neglecting its drugs business following its planed $63.5 billion (47.7 billion pounds) takeover of U.S. seeds group Monsanto ( MON.N ), which won U.S. approval on Tuesday.\nBayer’s pharmaceuticals business faces a threat to revenues when in 2024 when the blockbuster heart drug Xarelto loses its patent.
