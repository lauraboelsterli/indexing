    "text": "Yasmani Grandal, Enrique Hernandez and Yasiel Puig all homered as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Washington Nationals 7-2 Sunday afternoon at Nationals Park.\nLeft-hander Alex Wood gave the Dodgers a strong effort. He went six innings and gave up two runs on three hits and even helped on offense with his first career stolen base.\nWood (1-4) earned his first victory in his 10th start. He pitched effectively in eight of his nine starts but finally got a few breaks.\nJosh Fields got the final four outs for this second save.\nWashington right-hander Stephen Strasburg (5-4) allowed just five hits in 6 2/3 innings — but two of them were homers and gave the Dodgers three runs.\nGrandal gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead with a leadoff homer in the second inning.\nWashington took the lead in the third when Wilmer Difo singled and then scored on a Trea Turner homer.\nLos Angeles came back in the fifth when Logan Forsythe led off with a walk, and Hernandez followed with a two-run homer.\nThe Dodgers stretched the lead to 5-2 when Puig hit his two-run homer in the eighth off Wander Suero.\nJoc Pederson’s RBI double in the ninth made it 6-2, and Cody Bellinger drove him in with a groundout and wrapped up the three-game series sweep.\nInjuries have hit the Nationals hard in recent days. Matt Wieters told the media Sunday that, after surgery on his left hamstring last week, he could return in eight weeks.\nWashington also lost the versatile Howie Kendrick for the season Saturday due to a torn Achilles tendon in his right foot.\nThe Nationals also made some roster moves Sunday. They selected the contract of 19-year old outfielder Juan Soto from Double-A Harrisburg and optioned right-hander Jefry Rodriguez to that team. They also designated outfielder Moises Sierra for assignment.\nSoto is a highly-regarded prospect who got his first career at-bat on Sunday and struck out as a pinch hitter.\nThe Dodgers also are dealing with some pitching injury issues. MLB.com reported that manager Dave Roberts said Rich Hill, placed on the 10-day disabled Sunday (finger blister issues) after leaving Saturday’s game following just two pitches, could miss around four weeks.\nAlso, Clayton Kershaw (left biceps tendinitis) threw a 30-pitch bullpen session Sunday and did well.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
