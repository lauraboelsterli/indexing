    "text": "BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungaryâ€™s government will soon unveil new economic stimulus measures to ensure that economic growth remains above four percent in the years ahead, Economy Minister Mihaly Varga told the Magyar Idok newspaper in an interview published on Thursday.\nHungarian Economy Minister Mihaly Varga talks during a forum of the chamber of industry in Budapest, Hungary, March 6, 2018. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo Varga also said Hungary was satisfied with its agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development under which the two sides own 15-percent stakes each in the local unit of Austrian Erste Group Bank ( ERST.VI ).\nVarga said the government did not plan to review its ownership of the stake, and no further bank sector measures were in the pipeline apart from the privatization of state-owned Budapest Bank, which is still being prepared.\nReporting by Gergely Szakacs; Editing by Darren Schuettler\n ",
