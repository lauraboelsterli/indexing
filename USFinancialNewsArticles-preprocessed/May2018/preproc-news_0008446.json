    "text": "NOCTIVA™ launch underway across the U.S.\nFT 218 granted Orphan Drug Designation\nGenerated revenue of $33.3 million\nDUBLIN, Ireland, Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:AVDL) today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 highlights and financial overview:\nOn January 10, 2018 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Orphan Drug Designation to FT 218 for the treatment of narcolepsy.\nDivested pediatric products in February to Cerecor, Inc. and increased strategic focus on urology, hospital and CNS / sleep markets.\nCompleted a convertible debt offering with net proceeds of $138.4 million.\nLaunched NOCTIVA to the trade four weeks ahead of schedule.\nTotal revenues for the first quarter 2018 were $33.3 million, compared to $34.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $52.5 million in the first quarter 2017.\nGAAP net loss for the first quarter 2018 was $(12.2) million, or $(0.32) per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss of $(8.2) million, or $(0.21) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2017 and a GAAP net income of $25.9 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017.\nAdjusted net loss for the first quarter 2018 was $(13.0) million, or $(0.34) per diluted share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $(10.0) million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2017 and an adjusted net income of $11.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017. (1)\nCash and marketable securities at March 31, 2018 were $198.2 million, up from $94.1 million at December 31, 2017.\n“Our quarter overall was a series of positive events that continued to advance our company’s strategic objectives. We divested our pediatric products, and increased our focus for future growth across the urology, sleep and hospital markets. We received positive news from FDA at the outset of the quarter with receipt of Orphan Drug Designation for FT 218, maintained market leadership across each of our hospital products, executed our NOCTIVA launch plan well ahead of schedule, and successfully raised capital in an oversubscribed offering that will ultimately help us continue building long-term value,\" said Mike Anderson, Avadel's Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Anderson continued, “In addition to shipping NOCTIVA ahead of schedule, we have seen accelerated progress on the payer front. In less than 30 days since our trade launch, we have gone from 0 to approximately 100 million covered accessible lives, including our first two major preferred brand formulary wins with a top commercial and government payer, respectively. Our patient support programs are fully operational and will continue to serve as a bridge for patients as we secure additional preferred branded formulary coverage over the next 3-6 months.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues during the first quarter 2018 were $33.3 million, compared to $52.5 million during the same period last year. Revenue decline for Bloxiverz® and Akovaz® was driven by a loss of market share and lower net selling prices due to two new competitors for each product that entered the market during and subsequent to the first quarter of 2017. These declines were slightly offset by increased Vazculep® revenues due primarily to an increase in the volume of units sold in the first quarter 2018 compared to the same period last year.\nOn a GAAP basis, net loss was $(12.2) million during the first quarter 2018, or $(0.32) per diluted share, compared to net income of $25.9 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Included in GAAP net loss for the first quarter 2018 were $3.0 million of charges related to changes in the fair value of related party contingent consideration, compared to gains of $7.0 million in the same period last year.\nResearch and Development (R&D) expenses totaled $10.0 million for the first quarter, compared to $7.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in spending is primarily due to the Company's Phase III REST-ON trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a once-nightly version of sodium oxybate for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in patients suffering from narcolepsy. Also included in R&D was $1.3 million in expense related to NOCTIVA, which the Company acquired in September 2017. The Company expects spending on R&D to increase throughout the course of 2018 as it continues to open new clinical trial sites for REST-ON.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses were $24.5 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to $11.8 million in the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to $12.3 million in costs incurred during the quarter associated with the launch of NOCTIVA. Also included in SG&A for the first quarter 2018 was approximately $3.0 million of expense associated with the pediatric products, which the Company will not incur moving forward.\nAdjusted net loss for the first quarter 2018 was $(13.0) million, or $(0.34) per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $11.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the same period last year. (1) The decrease in adjusted net income is largely attributable to an decrease in revenues from Akovaz and higher SG&A expenses. Please see the Supplemental Information section within this document for a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS to the respective GAAP amounts.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company is reiterating full year 2018 guidance and expects revenues of between $105 - $125 million, R&D spend of between $40 to $50 million, and SG&A spend of between $80 to $90 million. Cash interest expense as a result of the Company's convertible notes offering in February 2018 is expected to be approximately $6 million, and a non-GAAP tax benefit of 0% to 10% is anticipated for the full year 2018.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss these results has been scheduled for Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET.

The words “will,” “may,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project” and similar expressions, and the negatives thereof, identify forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date the statement is made. Although we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, our business is subject to significant risks and as a result there can be no assurance that actual results of our research, development and commercialization activities and our results of operations will not differ materially from the results contemplated in such forward-looking statements. These risks include: (i) risks relating to our exchangeable senior notes including use of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes and other future events related to the notes; (ii) risks relating to the divestiture of our former pediatric business including whether such divestiture will be accretive to our operating income and cash flow; (iii) risks relating to our license agreement with Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC including that our internal analyses may overstate the market opportunity in the United States for the drug desmopressin acetate (the “Drug”) or we may not effectively exploit such market opportunity, that significant safety or drug interaction problems could arise with respect to the Drug, that we may not successfully increase awareness of nocturia and the potential benefits of the Drug, and that the need for management to focus attention on the development and commercialization of the Drug could cause our ongoing business operations to suffer; and (iv) the other risks, uncertainties and contingencies described in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, in particular disclosures that may be set forth in particular under the captions “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors,” including without limitation: our dependence on a small number of products and customers for the majority of our revenues; the possibility that our Bloxiverz®,Vazculep® and Akovaz® products, which are not patent protected, could face substantial competition resulting in a loss of market share or forcing us to reduce the prices we charge for those products; the possibility that we could fail to successfully complete the research and development for pipeline products we are evaluating for potential application to the FDA pursuant to our \"unapproved-to-approved\" strategy, or that competitors could complete the development of such products and apply for FDA approval of such products before us; the possibility that our products may not reach the commercial market or gain market acceptance; our need to invest substantial sums in research and development in order to remain competitive; our dependence on certain single providers for development of several of our drug delivery platforms and products; our dependence on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture our products and to deliver certain raw materials used in our products; the possibility that our competitors may develop and market technologies or products that are more effective or safer than ours, or obtain regulatory approval and market such technologies or products before we do; the challenges in protecting the intellectual property underlying our drug delivery platforms and other products; and our dependence on key personnel to execute our business plan.\nNon-GAAP Disclosures and Adjustments\nAvadel discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and loss and adjusted net income and loss per diluted share, as management believes that a comparison of its current and historical results would be difficult if the disclosures were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S. In addition to reporting its financial results in accordance with GAAP, Avadel reports certain non-GAAP results that exclude, if any, fair value remeasurements of its contingent consideration, GAAP interest expense on exchangeable notes, impairment of intangible assets, if any, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, foreign exchange gains and losses on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, unrealized gains/losses on equity marketable securities, non-cash license revenue adjustments and impacts of US tax reform, but includes the operating cash flows plus any unpaid accrued amounts associated with the contingent consideration and cash interest payments or related accruals on exchangeable notes, in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the Company's financial performance. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP measures internally for forecasting, budgeting and measuring its operating performance. Investors and other readers should review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most closely comparable GAAP measure set forth below and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table provided within the following “Supplemental Information” section reconciles GAAP net income and loss and diluted earnings or loss per share to the corresponding adjusted amounts.\n1 Non-GAAP financial measure: Descriptions of Avadel’s non-GAAP financial measures are included under the caption Non-GAAP Disclosures and Adjustments included within this press release and reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely applicable GAAP financial measures are found in the Supplemental Information section herein.\nContacts: Michael F.
