REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\nThe SBU is particularly concerned that critical infrastructure appears to be a target and believes Russia is behind the possible attack.\n“Security Service experts believe that the infection of hardware on the territory of Ukraine is preparation for another act of cyber-aggression by the Russian Federation, aimed at destabilising the situation during the Champions League final,” it said in a statement.
