    "text": "ROME, May 29 (Reuters) - Italyâ€™s Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli is considering giving up his mandate to form a government to open the way for an election as early as July 29, two party sources said on Tuesday.\nSuch a move would require President Sergio Mattarella to dissolve parliament in coming days. If there were to be a vote at the end of July, caretaker Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni will stay in power until the vote, party sources said.\nReporting by Steve Scherer, editing by Gavin Jones\n ",
