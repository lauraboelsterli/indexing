    "text": "TORONTO, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Changfeng Energy Inc., (TSXV:CFY) (“Changfeng” or the “Company”) announces that the Company has filed its unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (“Q1 2018”). The Company states that revenue from continuing operations for Q1 2018 was RMB104.1 million (approx. CAD20.7 million), an increase of RMB17.2 million (approx. CAD4.0 million), or 20%, from RMB86.9 million (approx. CAD16.7 million) for Q1 2017 (restated). Gross profit from continuing operations for Q1 2018 was RMB48.3 million (approx. CAD9.6 million), an increase of RMB2.4million (approx. CAD0.8 million), or 5%, as compared to RMB46.0 million (approx. CAD8.8 million) for Q1 2017. Profit for the period from continuing operations was RMB14.0 million (approx. CAD2.8 million), an increase of RMB1.9 million (approx. CAD0.5 million), or 16%, as compared to RMB12.1 million (approx. CAD2.3 million) for Q1 2017. EBITDA from continuing operations for Q1 2018 was RMB27.7 million (approx. CAD5.5 million), an increase of RMB2.6 million (approx. CAD0.7 million), or 10%, from RMB25.1 million (approx. CAD4.8 million) for Q1 2017.\nThis is the second year of Changfeng’s three-year plan to strategically shift its corporate focus to sustainable energy in combination with natural gas to become an integrated energy provider in the PRC. In line with this strategy, Changfeng has taken steps to divest part of its ownership stake (the “Disposal”) in Pingxiang Changfeng Gas Co., Ltd. (“Pingxiang CF”) to free up capital for other investment opportunities. The Disposal was completed on January 5, 2018 thereby recorded a net gain of RMB33.5 million (approximately CAD6.7million) in the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. After completion of the Disposal, the Group’s equity interest in Pingxiang CF reduced to 40% and such interest was re-classified as interest in associates of the Group.\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial results and Management’s Discussion and Analysis can be downloaded from www.SEDAR.com or from the Company's website at www.changfengenergy.com .\nAbout Changfeng Energy Inc.\nChangfeng Energy Inc. is a Canadian public company currently traded on the Toronto Venture Exchange (\"TSX-V\") under the stock symbol \"CFY\".
