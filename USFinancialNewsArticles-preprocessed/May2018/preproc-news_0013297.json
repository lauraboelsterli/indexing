    "text": "WYOMISSING, Pa., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (the “Company” or “GLPI”) (NASDAQ:GLPI) today announced that its operating partnership, GLP Capital, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”), and GLP Financing II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (“Capital Corp.” and, together with the Operating Partnership, the “Issuers”), have commenced an offering to sell $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the “Notes”) in a public offering. The Notes will be offered in two tranches, the first of which will be due 2025 and the second of which will be due 2028. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuers, guaranteed by the Company.\nThe Issuers intend to use (i) approximately $485.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering of Notes to prepay and extinguish the outstanding borrowings under the term loan A facility under their existing senior unsecured credit facility (the “Existing Credit Facility”), excluding any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the term loan A-1 facility under the Existing Credit Facility and (ii) approximately $504.4 million of the net proceeds from the offering and $56.4 million in borrowings under a new revolving credit facility to be entered into pursuant to an amendment to the Existing Credit Facility contemporaneously with the closing of the Notes offering (as amended, the “New Credit Facility”) to finance a cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase any and all of the $550 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers’ outstanding 4.375% Senior Notes due November 1, 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) and a related consent solicitation in respect of the indenture governing the 2018 Notes, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with amending the Existing Credit Facility. To the extent that not all holders of the 2018 Notes participate in the Tender Offer and there are any remaining net proceeds from the offering of Notes, the Issuers will use such remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes or to pay down borrowings under the New Credit Facility.\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Citizens Capital Markets, Inc., BofA Merrill Lynch, Fifth Third Securities, Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc. are serving as joint book-running managers for the offering. The offering will be made under an effective shelf registration statement of the Company, the Operating Partnership and Capital Corp. previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). When available, a copy of the preliminary prospectus supplement, final prospectus supplement and prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained from Wells Fargo Securities, LLC at 608 2nd Ave S, Suite 1000, Minneapolis, MN 55402, Attention: WFS Customer Service, or by calling (800) 645-3751, Opt 5 or by email at wfscustomerservice@wellsfargo.com ; or by visiting the EDGAR database on the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov .\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. Any offer or sale will be made only by means of the prospectus supplement and prospectus forming part of the effective registration statement relating to these securities.\nAbout Gaming and Leisure Properties\nGLPI is engaged in the business of acquiring, financing, and owning real estate property to be leased to gaming operators in triple-net lease arrangements, pursuant to which the tenant is responsible for all facility maintenance, insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. GLPI expects to grow its portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional gaming facilities to lease to gaming operators. GLPI also intends to diversify its portfolio over time, including by acquiring properties outside the gaming industry to lease to third parties. GLPI elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for United States federal income tax purposes commencing with the 2014 taxable year and is the first gaming-focused REIT in North America.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the proposed public offering.
