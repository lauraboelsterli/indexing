    "text": "BERLIN, May 25 (Reuters) - German business confidence was unchanged in May after falling for five straight months, a survey showed on Friday, suggesting the mood among company executives in Europe’s biggest economy is steady despite the spectre of a global trade war.\nThe Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index held steady at 102.2, slightly beating a Reuters consensus forecast for a reading of 102.0.\n“The declining trend in the Ifo Business Climate has stopped,” Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said. “The German economy is performing well in a difficult international situation.” (Reporting by Michelle Martin Editing by Paul Carrel)\n ",
