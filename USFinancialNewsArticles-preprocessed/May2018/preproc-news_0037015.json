    "text": "KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congo Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga late on Wednesday said in a statement that the country’s Ebola outbreak had entered “a new phase” after a case of the virus was detected in the northwest city of Mbandaka, with a population of about 1 million people.\nThe World Health Organization, which is deploying vaccines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, had expressed concern about the disease reaching Mbandaka, which would make the outbreak, already believed to have killed 23 people, far harder to tackle.\nReporting by Fiston Mahamba; Writing by Edward McAllister; Editing by Sandra Maler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
