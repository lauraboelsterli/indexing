    "text": "May 22 (Reuters) - Australian liver cancer treatment provider Sirtex Medical Ltd on Tuesday said it received a binding takeover offer from Chinese private equity firm CDH Investments.\nCDH Investments this month made a last-minute offer of $1.4 billion, or A$33.60 per share, for Sirtex Medical, topping Varian Medical Systems days before the U.S. firm was set to seal a takeover deal.\nSirtex would make a recommendation on which proposal it believed was in shareholdersâ€™ best interests after it assessed the CDH offer, the company said in a statement.\nIn January, Varian offered to buy Sirtex Medical for A$28 per share.
