They recouped part of their losses after the bank said only 0.1 percent of its total assets were linked to companies directly affected by the sanctions, but still trade roughly 2 euros lower.\n“We remain committed to the Russian market and high quality customer service as well as further development of our physical presence and digital capabilities,” RBI said in an investor presentation.\nRaiffeisen’s backlog of bad loans declined further. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio improved 0.3 percentage points to 5.4 percent of total loans at the end of March. The bank said it will reduce the ratio further in the medium term.\nIt released loan loss provisions of 83 million euros, 21 million of which in Russia in the first quarter, it said.\nRBI posted a fully loaded common equity tier 1 (CET 1) ratio, a measure of capital strength, of 12.8 percent and said it still aimed for the ratio to be around 13 percent in the medium term.\nStaff expenses and other administration expenses were flat compared to last year’s period.\n“The fact that Raiffeisen’s costs remained stable is very important,” said one trader. “It shows, that at a time when staff costs rise all over eastern Europe, Raiffeisen keeps costs under control.”\nThe lender’s shares traded 3.3 percent higher at 29.73 euros at 1033 GMT after temporarily reaching 30.70 euros in earlier trade. The European banking index was flat. $1 = 0.8391 euros Reporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Mark Potter and Alexandra Hudson",
