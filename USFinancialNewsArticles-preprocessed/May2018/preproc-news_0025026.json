    "text": "Company to Hold Conference Call Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 8:30 AM ET\nFUZHOU, China, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd. (Nasdaq: PME) (\"Pingtan\" or the \"Company\") , a global fishing company based in the People's Republic of China (PRC), today announced financial results for its first quarter .\nThe Company's recent notable events are as follows:\nApril 9, 2018: The Company announced that 27 fishing vessels received approval from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China to operate in the international waters of the Indian Ocean. As a result of this approval, the Company expects to significantly increase its current production capacity. April 16, 2018: The Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per ordinary share outstanding, which will be paid on or about May 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on April 30, 2018. This marked the fourteenth consecutive quarterly dividend paid by the Company. April 17, 2018: The Company announced it has signed an agreement with Huanghai Shipbuilding Co., Ltd regarding the above-mentioned 27 fishing vessels, and officially commenced the modification and rebuilding project for these vessels.\nManagement Comments\nMr. Xinrong Zhuo, Chairman and CEO of the Company, commented, \"The first quarter 2018 was a time of good news for Pingtan. In early January, we began sales in one of China's largest e-commerce retailers, JD.com, and achieved nationwide retail sales, which increased our profit margin by selling directly to end consumers. Also, during the first quarter 2018, 27 of our fishing vessels received approvals to operate in the international waters of the Indian Ocean from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, and we immediately began the modification and rebuilding of these vessels. Some of these vessels are expected to start fishing operations by the end of this year and all of the 27 vessels will be in operation in the first half of 2019.\"\nFactors Affecting Pingtan's Results of Operation – Indonesia Moratorium\nAs previously disclosed in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed since 2015, in early December 2014, the Indonesian government introduced a six-month moratorium on issuing new fishing licenses and renewals so that the country's Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (\"MMAF\") could combat illegal fishing and rectify ocean fishing order. In February 2015, the Company ceased all fishing operations in Indonesia. During the moratorium, the Company was informed that fishing licenses of four vessels operated through PT. Avona, one of the local companies through which Pingtan conducts business in Indonesia, and the fishery business license of PT. Dwikarya, the other local company through which Pingtan conducts business in Indonesia, were revoked. As a result, and because license renewal was prohibited due to the general moratorium, all local fishing licenses of the Company's vessels in Indonesia are presently inactive.\nIn November 2015, the Indonesian government announced that the moratorium had concluded. However, since the MMAF has not implemented new fishing policies and resumed the license renewal process, the Company does not know when exactly licensing and renewal will start. Since the Company derived a majority of its revenue from this area, this ban has caused a significant drop in production.\nIn September 2017, the Company was informed that the fishing licenses of 13 vessels deployed to the Indo-Pacific waters were suspended and the vessels were docked in the port by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (\"MAF\") of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. The MAF is alleging and is investigating whether false statements were made during the licensing process and the vessels were simultaneously registered in Indonesia. The Company disputes these allegations.\nAs of March 31, 2018, among the Company's 140 vessels, 12 are located in the Bay of Bengal in India; 11 are located in international waters (including 1 refrigerated transport vessel); and 13 are located in the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste but are currently not operating as described above. 27 vessels are under modification and rebuilding. The remaining 77 vessels are licensed by the MOA to operate in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia. The vessels in Indonesian waters, however, are not in operation because the licenses are currently inactive due to either the moratorium discussed above, the revocation of the fishery business license of the local entity through which the vessels operate, or, with respect to four vessels, the revocation of the local fishing licenses.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights (all results are compared to prior year period )\nRevenue increased by 92.3% to $10.9 million from $5.7 million as a result of increase in fishing activities. Gross profit increased by 8,743.0% to $5.6 million from gross profit of $63,333. Net income was $1.0 million, compared to net income of $10.8 million. Excluding the one-off effect of loss on 27 fishing vessels, which were dismantled for modification and rebuilding, net income would be $3.2 million for this quarter. Net income attributable to owners of the Company was $0.9 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income attributable to owners of the Company of $9.9 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Selected Financial Highlights\n($ in millions, except shares and per share) data )\nThree Months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$10.9\n$5.7\nCost of Revenue\n$5.3\n$5.6\nGross Profit\n$5.6\n$0.06\nGross Margin\n51.5%\n1.1%\nNet Income\n$1.0\n$10.8\nBasic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares\n79.1\n79.1\nEPS (in $)\n$0.01\n$0.13\nNet Income excluding one-off item*\n$3.2\n$10.8\nBasic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares\n79.1\n79.1\nEPS (in $)\n$0.04\n$0.13\n* One-off item refers to loss on fixed assets disposal of $2.2 million, which resulted from 27 fishing vessels being dismantled for modification and rebuilding project.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\n($ in millions, except for book value per share)\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n$3.8\n$2.0\nTotal Current Assets\n$23.6\n$20.8\nTotal Assets\n$205.5\n$201.1\nTotal Current Liabilities\n$34.3\n$36.4\nTotal Long-term Debt, net of current portion\n$17.9\n$17.2\nTotal Liabilities\n$52.2\n$53.6\nShareholders' Equity\n$153.3\n$147.5\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity\n$205.5\n$201.1\nBook Value Per Share (in $)\n$1.94\n$1.87\nConsolidated Financial and Operating Review\nRevenues\nRevenues for the three months was $10.9 million, an increase of $5.2 million, or 92.3%, from $5.7 million for the same period in 2017.\nThe increase was mainly attributable to more fishing vessels deployed to international waters for operation.\nGross Margin\nThe Company's gross margin was 51.5% for the three months , compared to 1.1% in the prior year period.\nThe increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in unit sales costs of fish resulting from deploying more fishing vessels to international waters for operation.\nSelling Expenses\nFor the three months , selling expenses for the fishing business was $0.5 million compared to $0.4 million in the prior year period. The increase was mainly due to the different insured fishing vessel mix, and the Company purchased insurance for the new fishing vessels deployed in late 2017.\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\nFor the three months , general and administrative expenses for the fishing business was $3.1 million, compared to $1.1 million in the prior year period. The increase is due to recording the depreciation of approximately $1.6 million as operating expense rather than cost of revenue for vessels located in Indonesian and Indo-Pacific waters that are not operating as a result of the reasons mentioned above.\nNet Income\nNet income the three months was $1.0 million, compared to net income of $10.8 million in the same period of 2017, a decrease of $9.9 million. Excluding the one-off effect of a loss on fixed assets disposal of $2.2 million, which resulted from 27 fishing vessels being dismantled for modification and rebuilding, the net income would be $3.2 million for the three months .\nNet Income Attributable to Owners of the Company\nNet income attributable to owners of the Company for the three months was $0.9 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income attributable to owners of the Company of $9.9 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, in the same period of 2017.\nConference Call Details\nPingtan also announced that it will discuss financial results in a conference call Thursday, May 10, 2018 – 8:30 a.m. ET.\nThe dial-in numbers are:\nLive Participant Dial-in (Toll Free): +1 877-407-0310\nLive Participant Dial-in (International): +1 201-493-6786\nTo listen to the live webcast, please go to http://www.ptmarine.com and click on the conference call link at the top of the page, or go to: http://ptmarine.equisolvewebcast.com/q1-2018 .
