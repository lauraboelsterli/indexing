    "text": "April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. oil refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp, which has agreed to buy rival Andeavor, reported an increase in first-quarter profit, helped by higher refining and marketing margins.\nNet income attributable to Marathon rose to $37 million or 8 cents per share in the three months ended March 31, from $30 million or 6 cents per share a year earlier.\nRevenue rose to $18.98 billion from $16.39 billion.\nMarathon said earlier on Monday it would buy Andeavor for more than $23 billion to form a company that would leapfrog Valero Energy Corp as the largest U.S. refiner by capacity.
