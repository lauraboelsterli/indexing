    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta and SAN DIEGO, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oncolytics Biotech ® Inc. (TSX:ONC) (OTCQX:ONCYF), currently developing REOLYSIN ® (pelareorep), an intravenously delivered immuno-oncolytic virus turning cold tumors hot, today announced financial results and operational highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. All dollar amounts are Canadian unless otherwise noted.\n“The rapid and exciting evolution of Oncolytics has continued in 2018. We have presented exciting immuno-oncology data at a number of medical meetings which supports both our rationale for a phase 3 registration study of pelareorep in metastatic breast cancer and additional collaborations using checkpoint inhibitors,” said Dr. Matt Coffey, President and CEO of Oncolytics Biotech. “With this momentum we have begun to lay the groundwork for value driving catalysts over the next 18 months, including multiple near-term clinical programs evaluating the efficacy of pelareorep in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in a variety of cancer indications. Finally, management also advanced plans to relist Oncolytics’ shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market exchange and we continue to carefully evaluate the timing of this action.”\nSelected highlights since January 1, 2018\nClinical Updates\nPresented posters highlighting data from pelareorep studies at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2018. The presentations showed preclinical models demonstrating pelareorep increased PD-L1 expression in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer cells (CRC) and demonstrated efficacy for pelareorep and anti-PD1 agent combination. Presented positive pelareorep data in combination with Keytruda ® and anti-CD73 at the International Oncolytic Virus Conference 2018. The poster highlighted the effectiveness of pelareorep in combination with Keytruda ® and/or an anti-CD73 immunotherapy in prostate cancer cell lines. Presented poster highlighting results from the REO 024 study at the 2018 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium sponsored by ASCO. The poster described six efficacy evaluable, second-line, pancreatic cancer patients, including two with stable disease of 126 and 277 days and remarkably, one patient that had a partial response and remained on study for 504 days, through 35 cycles of treatment. Reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analysis approach for the company's phase 3 study evaluating pelareorep for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.\nCorporate Updates\nReceived shareholder approval for the consolidation of the Company's common shares, which will enable Oncolytics to meet requirements for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAnticipated Milestones\nInitiate a phase 3 registration study of pelareorep in combination with paclitaxel, for the treatment HR+/HER2- mBC patients. Initiate a phase 2 partner-sponsored window of opportunity study of pelareorep in combination with standard of care therapy in the neoadjuvant setting in mBC in 2H 2018. Initiate multiple phase 2 partner-sponsored studies to generate important biomarker and efficacy data of pelareorep in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in 2H 2018. Expand the findings of REO 024 by initiating a phase 2 study examining pelareorep in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA ® ) in patients with relapsed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Re-list on NASDAQ.\nFinancial\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company reported $7.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. As at May 3, 2018, we had an unlimited number of authorized common shares with 142,334,722 common shares issued and outstanding, 16,445,000 warrants with a $0.95 strike price and 11,339,608 options and share units.\nONCOLYTICS BIOTECH INC.\nINTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(unaudited) As at March 31,\n2018\n$ December 31,\n2017\n$ Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 7,745,255 11,836,119 Contract receivable 4,899,720 4,767,100 Other receivables 38,888 37,726 Prepaid expenses 1,087,013 1,176,063 Total current assets 13,770,876 17,817,008 Non-current assets Property and equipment 356,281 333,441 Total non-current assets 356,281 333,441 Total assets 14,127,157 18,150,449\nLiabilities And Shareholders’ Equity Current Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 3,201,351 3,684,023 Contract liability 927,400 1,545,645 Total current liabilities 4,128,751 5,229,668 Non-current liabilities Contract liability 5,255,180 4,636,935 Total non-current liabilities 5,255,180 4,636,935 Total liabilities 9,383,931 9,866,603\nShareholders’ equity Share capital\nAuthorized: unlimited\nIssued:\nMarch 31, 2018 – 142,325,222\nDecember 31, 2017 – 141,805,722 272,230,453 271,710,138 Warrants 3,617,900 3,617,900 Contributed surplus 27,567,356 27,028,238 Accumulated other comprehensive income 444,351 373,730 Accumulated deficit (299,116,834 ) (294,446,160 ) Total shareholders’ equity 4,743,226 8,283,846 Total liabilities and equity 14,127,157 18,150,449\nONCOLYTICS BIOTECH INC.\nINTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF LOSS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(unaudited) For the three month period ending March 31, 2018\n$ 2017\n$ Expenses Research and development 2,934,891 2,268,071 Operating 1,762,553 1,300,300 Loss before the following (4,697,444 ) (3,568,371 ) Interest 26,890 50,715 Loss before income taxes (4,670,554 ) (3,517,656 ) Income tax expense (120 ) (63 ) Net loss (4,670,674 ) (3,517,719 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) items that may be\nreclassified to net loss Translation adjustment 70,621 (20,748 )\nNet comprehensive loss (4,600,053 ) (3,538,467 ) Basic and diluted loss per common share (0.03 ) (0.03 ) Weighted average number of shares (basic and diluted) 142,249,733 121,258,222\nONCOLYTICS BIOTECH INC.\nINTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\n(unaudited) Share Capital\n$ Warrants\n$ Contributed\nSurplus\n$ Accumulated\nOther\nComprehensive\nIncome\n$ Accumulated\nDeficit\n$ Total\n$ As at December 31, 2016 262,321,825 — 26,643,044 554,060 (278,829,309 ) 10,689,620 Net loss and other comprehensive loss — — — (20,748 ) (3,517,719 ) (3,538,467 ) Share based compensation — — 133,889 — — 133,889 Share issue costs (10,500 ) — — — — (10,500 ) As at March 31, 2017 262,311,325 — 26,776,933 533,312 (282,347,028 ) 7,274,542 As at December 31, 2017 271,710,138 3,617,900 27,028,238 373,730 (294,446,160 ) 8,283,846 Net loss and other comprehensive income — — — 70,621 (4,670,674 ) (4,600,053 ) Issued pursuant to \"At the Market\" Agreement 553,650 — — — — 553,650 Share based compensation — — 539,118 — — 539,118 Share issue costs (33,335 ) — — — — (33,335 ) As at March 31, 2018 272,230,453 3,617,900 27,567,356 444,351 (299,116,834 ) 4,743,226\nONCOLYTICS BIOTECH INC.\nINTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(unaudited) For the three month period ending March 31, 2018\n$ 2017\n$ Operating Activities Net loss for the period (4,670,674 ) (3,517,719 ) Amortization - property and equipment 19,858 24,036 Share based compensation 539,118 133,889 Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss (4,513 ) 52,032 Net change in non-cash working capital (492,547 ) (637,646 ) Cash used in operating activities (4,608,758 ) (3,945,408 )\nInvesting Activities Acquisition of property and equipment (42,619 ) (5,836 ) Redemption of short-term investments — 2,088,800 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (42,619 ) 2,082,964\nFinancing Activities Proceeds from \"At the Market\" equity distribution agreement 520,315 (10,500 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 520,315 (10,500 )\nDecrease in cash (4,131,062 ) (1,872,944 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 11,836,119 12,034,282 Impact of foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents 40,198 (58,945 ) Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 7,745,255 10,102,393 To view the Company's Fiscal 2018 First Quarter Consolidated Financial Statements, related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Management's Discussion and Analysis, please see the Company's annual filings, which will be available under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com and on Oncolytics' website at http://www.oncolyticsbiotech.com/investor-centre/financials/ .\nAbout REOLYSIN/Pelareorep\nREOLYSIN, also known as pelareorep, is a non-pathogenic, proprietary isolate of the unmodified reovirus: a first-in-class intravenously delivered immuno-oncolytic virus for the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies.
