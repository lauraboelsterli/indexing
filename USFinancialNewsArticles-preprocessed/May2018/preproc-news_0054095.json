A damaged missile is displayed during a news conference in Bunnik, Netherlands, by members of the Joint Investigation Team, comprising of authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine, as they present interim results in the ongoing investigation of the 2014 MH17 crash that killed 298 people over eastern Ukraine. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\nThe Malaysian Airways jet was shot down over territory held by pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 aboard. The Netherlands and Australia said last week they held Moscow responsible. Russia denies involvement.
