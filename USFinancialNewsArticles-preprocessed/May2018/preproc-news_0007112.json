    "text": "EMERYVILLE, Calif., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NMI Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:NMIH) today reported GAAP net income of $22.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $22.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share exclude a pre-tax non-cash gain of $0.4 million related to the change in fair value of the company’s warrant liability. This compares with a net loss of $1.8 million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $14.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, after adjusting for the one-time non-cash expense primarily related to the re-measurement of the company’s net deferred tax asset as a result of tax reform and the change in fair value of the warrant liability, in the prior quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, the company reported net income of $5.5 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $5.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, after adjusting for the change in fair value of the warrant liability. The non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are presented to increase the comparability of financial results between periods. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nBradley Shuster, Chairman and CEO of National MI, said, \"National MI delivered record first quarter financial results, including new insurance written of $6.5 billion, record net premiums earned of $54.9 million, record net income of $22.4 million, and record return-on-equity of 16.1%. We continued to build our portfolio of high-quality insurance-in-force at a rate that leads our industry. We also continued to make significant strides in customer development, activating 21 new customers in the first quarter and continuing to increase our volume with existing customers.”\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had primary insurance-in-force of $53.4 billion, up 10% from $48.5 billion at the prior quarter end and up 54% over $34.8 billion as of March 31, 2017.\nNet premiums earned for the quarter were $54.9 million, including $2.8 million attributable to cancellation of single premium policies, which compares with $50.1 million, including $4.2 million related to cancellations, in the prior quarter. Net premiums earned in the first quarter of 2018 were up 65% over net premiums earned of $33.2 million in the same quarter a year ago, which included $2.5 million related to cancellations.\nNIW mix was 84% monthly premium product, which compares with 83% in the prior quarter and 81% in the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the quarter, the company completed the sale of 4.3 million shares of common stock, raising proceeds of $79.2 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other direct offering expenses.\nAt quarter-end, cash and investments were $826 million, including $123 million at the holding company, and book equity was $602 million, equal to $9.18 per share.\nAt quarter-end, the company had total PMIERs available assets of $555 million, which compares with risk-based required assets under PMIERs of $522 million. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, the company contributed $70 million to National Mortgage Insurance Corporation, its primary mortgage insurance subsidiary.\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Change Change 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Q/Q Y/Y Primary Insurance-in-Force ($billions) 53.43 48.47 34.78 10 % 54 % New Insurance Written - NIW ($billions) Monthly premium 5.44 5.74 2.89 (5 )% 88 % Single premium 1.02 1.14 0.67 (11 )% 52 % Total 6.46 6.88 3.56 (6 )% 82 % Premiums Earned ($millions) 54.91 50.08 33.23 10 % 65 % Underwriting & Operating Expense ($millions) 28.45 28.30 25.99 1 % 9 % Loss Expense ($millions) 1.57 2.37 0.64 (34 )% 145 % Loss Ratio 2.9 % 4.7 % 1.9 % Cash & Investments ($millions) 826 735 671 12 % 23 % Book Equity ($millions) 602 509 484 18 % 24 % Book Value per Share 9.18 8.41 8.09 9 % 13 % Conference Call and Webcast Details\nThe company will hold a conference call and live webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time / 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

These risks and uncertainties also include, but are not limited to, those set forth under the heading \"Risk Factors\" detailed in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as subsequently updated through other reports we file with the SEC. All subsequent written and oral attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, which speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect new information, future events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that use of the non-GAAP measures of adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and adjusted return-on-equity facilitate the evaluation of our fundamental financial performance, thereby providing relevant information to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures align with the way the company's business performance is evaluated by management. These measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our fundamental operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers.\nAdjusted pre-tax income is defined as GAAP income before tax, excluding the effects of the non-cash loss or gain related to the change in fair value of our warrant liability.\nAdjusted net income is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of the aforementioned change in the fair value of our warrant liability and other discrete tax (benefits) expense which are infrequent and unusual non-operating items, such as the one-time non-cash charge due to a re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") in 2017. The amounts of adjustments to components of pre-tax income are tax effected using the applicable federal statutory tax rate for the respective periods.\nAdjusted net income per diluted share is calculated in a manner consistent with the accounting standard regarding earnings per share by dividing (i) adjusted net income by (ii) diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, which reflects share dilution from non-vested restricted stock units and from warrants when dilutive.\nAdjusted return-on-equity is calculated by dividing the adjusted income on an annualized basis by the average shareholders’ equity for the period.\nAlthough adjusted pre-tax income and adjusted net income exclude certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent items that are: (1) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities; or (2) impacted by market, economic or regulatory factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends, or both. These adjustments, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described below. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these adjustments. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by us.\n(1) Change in fair value of warrant liability . Outstanding warrants at the end of each reporting period are revalued, and any change in fair value is reported in the statements of operations in the period in which the change occurred. The change in the fair value of our warrant liability can vary significantly across periods and is influenced principally by equity market and general economic factors which may not impact or reflect our current period operating results. Trends in our operating performance can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of the change in fair value of our warrant liability. (2) Infrequent or unusual non-operating items. Our income tax expense for 2017 reflects a one-time non-cash charge due to a re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInvestor Contact\nJohn M.
