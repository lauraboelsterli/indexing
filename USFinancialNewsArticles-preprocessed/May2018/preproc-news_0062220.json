    "text": "Employee-Owned Firm Adds Multi-Market Professional Kevin Hildebrandt\nMANKATO, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ISG recently welcomed seasoned facility, health/safety, and planning professional Kevin Hildebrandt, CPE, CPS to the firm, strategically enhancing services focused in the education, public works, and government markets, to name a few. Kevin brings nearly 40 years of experience, most recently as the 20-year Director of Buildings and Grounds for Faribault Public Schools in Minnesota. Through certifications from the Association of Facility Engineering (AFE) , Kevin’s noted designations include Certified Plant Engineer (CPE) and Certified Professional Supervisor (CPS).\nAs a previous long-standing partner and client, Kevin provides a boots-on-the-ground perspective into the day-to-day operations of client sites and facilities to help solve challenging budget, operational, and long-term planning needs. “Kevin has been an integral partner over the years and we are beyond excited to have him sitting on the same side of the table to roll up his sleeves and help clients plan for the future,” exclaims Brian Gjerde, PE, Vice President, Project Delivery. “Kevin is no stranger to obstacles that can occur in both small remodels and multi-million dollar maintenance projects/new construction. The devil is in the details and the right solutions require a keen eye for day-to-day maintenance, health, and safety needs. Kevin will be a proactive partner and advocate for clients across the Midwest and beyond, while also adding to our culture of safety,” notes Brian.\nKevin was named Facility Management Professional of the Year in 2007 by Minnesota Educational Facilities Management Professionals (MASMS) , where he served as Southern Chapter President, State Treasurer, and State President. Similarly, he served on the National Board for the National School Plant Management Association (NSPMA) and numerous other boards and steering committees for his previous employers and local community. He is also presently active in a similar capacity.\n“The future of a building is determined by its daily care and end user needs, not by random efforts of repair,” states Kevin, pointing to the importance of practical, strategic design. “A well mapped out plan offers owners both aesthetic and financial benefits that put users first, and I’m looking forward to working with ISG project managers to empower clients with the knowledge to properly care for and maintain their facility investments.”\nKevin will be presenting this fall at the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials (WASBO) Midwest Facilities Masters Conference and MASMS Annual Conference .
