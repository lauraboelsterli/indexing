LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CDW Corporation (Nasdaq:CDW), a leading multi-brand technology solutions provider to business, government, education and healthcare in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, today announced first quarter results. The company also announced the approval by its Board of Directors of a quarterly cash dividend to be paid in June 2018.\n\"We are off to an excellent start to the year as we successfully addressed customer priorities and delivered strong topline growth and profitability while continuing to invest in our future,\" said Thomas E. Richards, chairman and chief executive officer of CDW. \"These results demonstrate the combined strength of our business model - underpinned by our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets, broad product and technology portfolio, and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy for growth. Adjusting for currency and excluding the shipment of orders impacted by supply chain delays at year-end, we delivered high-single digit sales growth.\"\n\"Excellent operating results were amplified by a lower tax rate and share repurchases, delivering a 41 percent increase in non-GAAP net income per diluted share,\" said Collin B. Kebo, CDW's chief financial officer. \"Given this quarter's results and our expectations for the balance of the year, we are now targeting 2018 constant currency non-GAAP net income per diluted share growth in the mid-to-high twenty percent range.\"\n“We expect to exceed our annual target to outpace US IT market growth by 200 to 300 basis points in 2018. To accomplish this, we will continue our laser-focus on meeting the needs of our more than 250,000 customers in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada and remaining the partner of choice for more than 1,000 leading and emerging technology brands as the technology market continues to evolve,\" concluded Richards.\nA quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share, which is 31 percent higher than the prior year period, will be paid on June 11, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 25, 2018.\nFirst Quarter of 2018 Highlights:\nTotal net sales in the first quarter of 2018 were $3,606 million, compared to $3,256 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 10.8 percent. There were 64 selling days for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. On an average daily sales basis, net sales growth versus the first quarter of 2017 was 10.8 percent and on a constant currency basis was 9.6 percent. Currency impact to net sales growth was driven by favorable translation of the British pound to US dollar and favorable translation of the Canadian to US dollar. First quarter performance included:\nTotal Corporate segment net sales in the first quarter of 2018 were $1,566 million, 8.7 percent higher than the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal Small Business segment net sales in the first quarter of 2018 were $328 million, 12.2 percent higher than the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal Public segment net sales in the first quarter of 2018 were $1,230 million, 6.6 percent higher than the first quarter of 2017. Public results were led by sales to both Government and Healthcare customers, which increased 11.7 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively. Sales to Education customers increased 1.0 percent.\nNet sales for CDW's UK and Canadian operations, combined as “Other” for financial reporting purposes, were $483 million, 30.6 percent higher than the first quarter of 2017. Both UK and Canada results were also up double digits in local currency.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $604 million, compared to $554 million for the same period in 2017, representing an increase of 9.1 percent. Gross profit margin was 16.7 percent for the first quarter of 2018 versus 17.0 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Increases in net service contract revenue and other netted down revenues, which includes software as a service and warranties, were not enough to fully offset the impact of ongoing hardware strength on product margin and increases in partner funding being outpaced by increases in net sales.\nTotal selling and administrative expenses and advertising expense were $400 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $383 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 4.4 percent. This increase was primarily driven by sales compensation.\nInterest expense was $38 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $40 million in the comparable period of 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 23.4 percent, which resulted in tax expense of $39 million, compared to a 21.9 percent tax rate and tax expense of $16 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in effective tax rate primarily reflects the year-over-year impact of lower excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation in the first quarter of 2018, which was partially offset by a lower Federal tax rate.\nNet income was $127 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $58 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 118.3 percent. The first quarter of 2017 included a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $57 million. Non-GAAP net income, which excludes, among other things, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation and the associated tax benefits, integration expenses, and certain other items, was $163 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $122 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 33.6 percent.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which excludes expenses related to equity-based compensation, income from equity investment, integration expenses, and certain other items, was $280 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $250 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 11.9 percent. For the first quarter of 2018, the Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.8 percent compared to 7.7 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding were 155 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 163 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.82, compared to $0.36 for the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 129.6 percent. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.05, compared to $0.75 for the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 40.5 percent.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this release that are not statements of historical fact are within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including without limitation statements regarding the future financial performance of CDW. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to those described in such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, global and regional economic and political conditions; decreases in spending on technology products and services; CDW's relationships with vendor partners and availability of their products; continued innovations in hardware, software and services offerings by CDW's vendor partners; substantial competition that could reduce CDW's market share; CDW's substantial indebtedness and ability to generate sufficient cash to service such indebtedness; restrictions imposed by agreements relating to CDW's indebtedness on its operations and liquidity; changes in, or the discontinuation of, CDW's share repurchase program or dividend payments; the continuing development, maintenance and operation of CDW's information technology systems; potential breaches of data security and failure to protect our information technology systems from cybersecurity threats; potential failures to comply with Public segment contracts or applicable laws and regulations; potential failures to provide high-quality services to CDW's customers; potential losses of any key personnel; potential interruptions of the flow of products from suppliers; potential adverse occurrences at one of CDW's primary facilities or customer data centers; increases in the cost of commercial delivery services or disruptions of those services; CDW's exposure to accounts receivable and inventory risks; fluctuations in foreign currency; future acquisitions or alliances; fluctuations in CDW's operating results; current and future legal proceedings and audits; changes in laws, including the recent U.S. tax legislation, regulations or interpretations thereof; and other risk factors or uncertainties identified from time to time in CDW's filings with the SEC. Although CDW believes that the expectations reflected in such are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Reference is made to a more complete discussion of and applicable risks contained under the captions \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" in CDW's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and subsequent filings with the SEC. CDW undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nEBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in the Company’s credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the financial statement tables that accompany this press release. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated tax benefits, integration expenses, and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. Consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company believes these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of the Company’s business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. The Company uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (“Term Loan”) used to evaluate the Company’s ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether the Company is required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.\nOur annual targets are provided on a non-GAAP basis because certain reconciling items are dependent on future events that either cannot be controlled, such as currency impacts or interest rates, or reliably predicted because they are not part of the Company's routine activities, such as refinancing activities or acquisition and integration expenses.\nThe financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the applicable most comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP measures used by the Company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nAbout CDW\nCDW is a leading multi-brand technology solutions provider to business, government, education and healthcare organizations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
