    "text": "0 COMMENTS The grave marker of F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda Fitzgerald is seen at St. Mary's Church Cemetery May 9, 2013 in Rockville, MD. Photo: Matt McClain / Associated Press\nEvery week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications.\nIntroducing the F. Scott Fitzgerald test for AI. Quartz’s Paul Sonderegger says he found the perfect test for artificial intellegence from some lines written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1936: “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.” Mr. Fitzgerald ended up failing the test, washing out in Hollywood. And much of today’s AI may be heading along the same path, minus the martinis. “They offer a cheap imitation of a life well-lived, but only from a narrow perspective,” Mr. Sonderegger writes. “They are unable to hold two opposing thoughts at once, instead needing to exist in a state where decisions are made with one model or another, but not debate between the two.”\nBill Gates has your summer reading. Hide that copy of Vanity Fair you saved for the beach. Here comes the Microsoft Corp . co-founder with a ton–literally a ton– of summer beach reads , including “Leonardo da Vinci”, by Walter Isaacson and “Origin Story: A Big History of Everything,” by David Christian, “which tells the story of the universe from the big bang to today’s complex societies, weaving together insights and evidence from various disciplines into a single narrative.” Looks like it’s going to be another summer spent indoors.\nFace-fashion must-have for open-office alpha-dogs. Funny how most stories on the deconstructed, espresso-machine-outfitted, zeppelin-hanger-sized open office plan fail to mention the cacophony of noise from employees yammering on their iPhones. Introducing Bloxvox, a new “voice privacy tool” worn on the face that lets employees carry on conversations without annoying everyone else. The muzzle-like design may take some getting used to. “Yes, it sounds weird, and I’m not going to spend any more time explaining it,” David Carnoy writes in CNet . “However, I will point out that there’s a little air hole in the front that allows you to breathe and have some air circulate in the muzzle.”\nShare this: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BILL GATES Previous Human-Machine Work Teams: The Promise and Today's Reality",
