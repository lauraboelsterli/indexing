    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LP) (NYSE: LPX) reported results today for the first quarter of 2018, which included the following:\nSales for the first quarter of $691 million were higher by 13 percent compared to the year ago quarter. Income from continuing operations was $95 million ($0.65 per diluted share) compared to $55 million ($0.38 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted income from continuing operations was $93 million ($0.63 per diluted share). Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the first quarter was $159 million compared to $114 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n“We continued to make progress on our key strategic objectives in the first quarter,” said Brad Southern, LP Chief Executive Officer. “Our results benefited from higher OSB prices and we delivered strong performances in our engineered wood products and South American operations. However, recent rail transportation system issues in Canada caused unplanned downtime at our operations, increased inventory and late shipments, which negatively affected our reported results. In our Siding business, we believe underlying demand for our products remains strong, and we continue to be on track to achieve our targeted 12-14% full year revenue growth for SmartSide.”\nFIRST QUARTER RESULTS\nFor the first quarter of 2018, LP reported net sales of $691 million, up from $611 million in the first quarter of 2017.

For the first quarter of 2018, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for this segment was $54 million compared to $49 million in the first quarter of 2017.
