    "text": "DENVER, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ: HNRG) reports financial and operating results for the first quarter Hallador filed its Form 10-Q after the markets closed today.\nHighlights include:\nNet income was $2.1 million, $0.07 per share for Q1 2018. Operating cash flow was $13.2 million. Bank debt was reduced by $11 million to $191 million in Q1 2018. Leverage was reduced to 2.37X. The Princeton Rail Loop loaded its first unit train in May 2018 and continues to attract new sales opportunities. Sales forecast increased from 6.8 to 7.0 million tons for 2018. Hourglass Sands made significant progress and anticipates shipping sand to customers in the DJ Basin in Q3 2018. We believe Hourglass to be the only frac sand mining company in the State of Colorado.\nThe table below represents some of our critical metrics (in thousands except for per ton data):\n 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet Income\n$\n2,132\n$\n7,414\nTotal Revenues\n$\n66,864\n$\n63,553\nTons Sold\n1,707\n1,555\nAverage Price per Ton\n$\n39.13\n$\n40.23\nBank Debt\n$\n190,737\n$\n232,055\nOperating Cash Flow\n$\n13,189\n$\n14,894\nAdjusted EBITDA*\n$\n18,851\n$\n23,926\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow **\n$\n10,722\n$\n17,968\n*Defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation plus ARO accretion.\n**Defined as net income plus deferred income taxes, DD&A, ARO accretion, and stock compensation, less maintenance capex.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our method of computing EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies.\nManagement believes that the presentation of such additional financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provide additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial and analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operation, compensation, and planning decisions and (iii) present measurements that investors, rating agencies, and debt holders have indicated are useful in assessing our results.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced our earnings conference call for financial analysts and investors will be held on Tuesday, May 8, 2018, at 2:00pm eastern time.
