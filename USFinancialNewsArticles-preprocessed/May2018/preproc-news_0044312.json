REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo\nParliament President Antonio Tajani, who was criticized by legislators and some senior EU officials over arrangements for the discussion on public privacy concerns, tweeted that it was “great news” that Zuckerberg had agreed to a live web stream.\nA Facebook spokeswoman said: “We’re looking forward to the meeting and happy for it to be live streamed.”\nZuckerberg, who founded the U.S. social media giant, will be in Europe to defend the company after scandal over its sale of personal data to a British political consultancy which worked on U.S. President Donald Trump’s election campaign, among others.\nHe will meet Tajani and leaders of parties in the European Parliament in Brussels from 6:15 p.m. (12.15 p.m. ET/1615 GMT) on Tuesday.\nHe is also due to meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday.
