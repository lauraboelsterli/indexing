    "text": "TRIER, Germany (Reuters) - Protesters held banners reading “Down with capitalism” and “Father of all dictators” at Saturday’s unveiling of a statue of Karl Marx in the German city of Trier, reflecting the polarising legacy of the philosopher in his birthplace and beyond.\nThe 4.4 metres (14 feet) high bronze statue of Karl Marx, created by Chinese artist Wu Weishan and donated by China to mark the 200th birth anniversary of the German philosopher, is seen in his hometown Trier, Germany May 5, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay The bronze sculpture, which towers over 5 metres (16 feet) high including the plinth, is a gift from China to mark Saturday’s 200th birthday of the founder of Communism.\nMarx spent the first 17 years of his life in Trier, a small town on the Moselle River in Germany’s far west.\nMany see the post-World War Two division of Germany and the erection of the Berlin Wall to divide the Communist east from the capitalist West as a result of his ideas, but Trier mayor Wolfram Leibe said historical controversies should be acknowledged.\n“In Germany, we have this situation again and again with difficult, complex personalities of history - we want to hide them in the woods,” he said. “So it was a conscious act to bring Karl Marx into the city ... We don’t have to hide him.”\nThe city council voted to accept the gift from the Chinese government by 42 members to seven in March 2017.\nWhile some see it as recognition of Trier’s most famous son, others argue that accepting the gift from China is not compatible with criticising human rights abuses there.\nSince 2015, China’s President Xi Jinping has presided over a widespread crackdown on human rights activists.\nThe statue depicts a thoughtful Marx, holding a book in one hand.\n“Yes, we stand by the child of our city. And we deal with Karl Marx in a constructive and active way,” said Malu Dreyer, premier of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, to which Trier belongs. “We are glad to receive this present, this gesture of friendship.”\nPeople pose in front of the 4.4 metres (14 feet) high bronze statue of Karl Marx, created by Chinese artist Wu Weishan and donated by China to mark the 200th birth anniversary of the German philosopher, in his hometown Trier, Germany May 5, 2018.
