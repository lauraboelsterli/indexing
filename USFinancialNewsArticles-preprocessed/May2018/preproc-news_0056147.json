    "text": "Mike Trout went 5-for-5, his first career five-hit game, leading the Los Angeles Angels to an 11-4 victory over the New York Yankees on Saturday night at Yankee Stadium.\nTrout doubled in his first two at-bats off Sonny Gray (3-4), hit a go-ahead two-run home run in his third at-bat in the fourth and hit his second RBI double of the game in the sixth off Tommy Kahnle. He reached five hits with an infield single in the seventh off Chasen Shreve.\nTrout also became the first Angel to get five hits in a game since Cameron Maybin went 5-for-6 on May 16, 2017, against the Chicago White Sox.\nTrout recorded his first career game with four extra-base hits. He homered for the third straight game and drove in at least four runs for the first time since Aug. 25, 2016, at Toronto and 18th time overall.\nHis first hit also made him the seventh player in team history to get to 600 career RBIs as the Angels went on to score 10 unanswered runs.\nTrout tied a team record for extra-base hits. He became the first Angel to get four since Mark Trumbo also hit three doubles and a homer on Sept. 10, 2013, at Toronto.\nTrout became the first visiting center fielder to get four extra-base hits at any version of Yankee Stadium. He also became the second visiting player to post a five-hit game at the current Yankee Stadium, joining Hideki Matsui, who did it for Oakland on July 24, 2011.\nRookie Shohei Ohtani went 0-for-4 in his second appearance at Yankee Stadium. He drove in a run with a bases-loaded walk and hit into a run-scoring double play in the sixth.\nAndrelton Simmons lifted a sacrifice fly while Albert Pujols added an RBI single. Jose Briceno capped the scoring by hitting a two-run homer in his third career at-bat in the seventh.\nBrett Gardner and Aaron Judge opened the game with a bang for the Yankees by hitting back-to-back homers off Jaime Barria. Austin Romine added a two-run homer for the Yankees, who lost for the third time in their last 17 home games.\nBarria (4-1) began his fourth stint with the Angels by allowing four runs on six hits in five innings.\nGray followed up eight strong innings Sunday in Kansas City by allowing 11 of the 21 hitters he faced to reach. He was tagged for five runs on seven hits in 3 2/3 innings.\nFacing his final batter, Gray hit Angels left fielder Justin Upton with a pitch. Upton would leave the game with a left forearm contusion. X-rays were negative, the Angels announced.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ",
