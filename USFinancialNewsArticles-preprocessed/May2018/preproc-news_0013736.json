    "text": "8 COMMENTS Thursday’s local elections in England proved as muddy as last year’s parliamentary vote. You’d think that eventually one of Britain’s two main parties would want to rack up an unambiguous win.\nEnglish voters elected the local councilors responsible for road maintenance, trash collection, some social-service provision and the like. Conservatives and Labour both won council seats from the pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party, but neither major party swung control of a large number of councils or grabbed a large number of council seats from the other.\nPotomac Watch Podcast Potomac Watch Podcast\nPotomac Watch podcast: Nancy Pelosi’s campaign to return as House Speaker, plus Rod Rosenstein vs. House Republicans. The embarrassment is most acute for Labour, which had expected a big win but failed to take several high-profile councils in metropolitan London. An ethnically diverse, cosmopolitan, left-leaning urban area with a charismatic Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, ought to have been a prime stomping ground for a party that has marched further left under national leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nInstead, Mr. Corbyn proved a liability—especially in Barnet, a borough in northern London that switched to Conservative control this time after the 2014 local election had denied any party a majority. The borough is home to a substantial Jewish minority, and this defeat is the price Labour pays for tolerating Mr. Corbyn’s anti-Semitic sympathies and sympathizers.\nLabour also failed to capture other Tory-led councils, such as Kensington and Chelsea, where Labour candidates performed better than expected in last year’s parliamentary election. It’s too soon to say, as some commentators have, that Britain has reached “peak Corbyn.” But the limits to his appeal are becoming clearer the better voters get to know him and his agenda.\nWhich is why the Conservatives under Theresa May should be worried that they haven’t made more of a dent in Labour’s support. Some pollsters have estimated that if the number and geographic distribution of Thursday’s local votes were transposed onto a map of parliamentary districts, the result would be another hung parliament.\nA year after one of the most humiliating election outcomes in recent British history, Mrs. May’s Tories remain divided by Brexit and are struggling to offer voters a compelling vision on such domestic anxieties as slow wage growth and regional economic divergence. As long as the Tories leave Labour to run unopposed on those issues, voters may still decide to take a risk on Mr. Corbyn in the future.",
