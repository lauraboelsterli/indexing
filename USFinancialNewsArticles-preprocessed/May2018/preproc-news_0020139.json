    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 2:22 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX gains as energy stocks rise with oil prices Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nMay 9 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index climbed higher on Wednesday, as oil prices hit 3-1/2-year highs after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran.\n* At 9:42 a.m. ET (1342 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 38.91 points, or 0.25 percent, to 15,881.62.\n* The U.S. withdrawal from the deal with Iran cast uncertainty over global oil supplies at a time when the crude market is already tight.\n* The energy sector, the biggest boost to the main index, was up 1.9 percent.\n* Enbridge Inc gained 2.5 percent after the pipeline operator said it will sell a 49 percent stake in some of its renewable power assets in order to reduce its massive debt, pushing the energy group higher.\n* Also helping the sentiment was progress made on the NAFTA front, as Mexico has launched a counterproposal to U.S. demands to toughen automotive industry content rules under the Agreement, officials said on Tuesday.\n* Six of Canada’s 10 main index sectors were higher.\n* The TSX posted seven new 52-week highs and three new lows. Across all Canadian issues, there were 23 new 52-week highs and 21 new lows.\n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Maxar Technologies Ltd, which rose 15.3 percent after the company’s quarterly results topped analysts’ estimates.\n* Kinross Gold, the largest decliner, was down 8.6 percent after the company reported first-quarter results on Tuesday.\n* Shares of Sun Life Financial Inc were down 1.1 percent after the insurance company reported its quarterly results on Tuesday.\n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Kinross Gold, Bank Of Montreal and Baytex Energy Co .\n* Volume on the TSX index was 24.08 million shares. Total volume on Wednesday was 38.93 million shares.\n* Economic data showed the value of Canadian building permits rose more than expected in March on increased plans to build apartment buildings in the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia.
