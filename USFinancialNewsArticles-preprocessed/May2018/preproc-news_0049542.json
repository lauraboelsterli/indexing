    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 1:02 AM / Updated 14 hours ago Motor racing-Formula One statistics for the Monaco Grand Prix Reuters Staff\nMay 23 (Reuters) - Statistics for Sunday’s Monaco Formula One Grand Prix:\n- - - -\nLap distance:3.337km. Total distance: 260.286 km (78 laps)\n2017 pole: Kimi Raikkonen (Finland) Ferrari, One minute 12.178 seconds.\n2017 winner: Sebastian Vettel (Germany) Ferrari\nRace lap record: Sergio Perez (Mexico) Force India 1:14.820 (2017)\nStart time: 1310 GMT (1510 local) RACE WINS\nHamilton is going for his third win in a row, after Azerbaijan and Spain.\nThe Briton has 64 victories from 213 races and is second in the all-time list behind seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher (91). Vettel has 49.\nFerrari have won 231 races since 1950, McLaren 182, Williams 114, Mercedes 78 and Red Bull 56. Former champions McLaren and Williams have not won since 2012. POLE POSITION\nHamilton has a record 74 career poles. Vettel has 53.\nMax Verstappen, at 20 years old, can become the youngest ever pole sitter this season. The current youngest is Vettel, who did it at the age of 21 years and 72 days. PODIUM\nHamilton has 121 career podiums and is second on the all-time list behind Schumacher (155). Vettel has 101, Kimi Raikkonen 94. POINTS\nHamilton has had a record 30 successive scoring finishes to date. He leads Vettel by 17 points after five races.\nMercedes are 27 points ahead of Ferrari in the constructors’ championship.\nRussian rookie Sergey Sirotkin (Williams) is the only driver on the starting grid yet to score a point in his career.\nHaas’s Romain Grosjean has yet to open his account for 2018 and including last season the Frenchman has not scored for nine races in a row.\nSauber have already scored more points (11) than in all of last year (five), with Charles Leclerc scoring in his last two races. The last time Sauber took points from three successive races was in 2015. MONACO\nThis year’s race is the 65th edition.\nThe last six races have seen the safety car deployed.\nMercedes have won four of the last five Monaco Grands Prix, but Ferrari ended that streak last year with their first in the principality since 2001.\nThe driver on pole has won 10 of the last 17 races in Monaco. In 1996, Frenchman Olivier Panis won from 14th on the starting grid — the lowest winning start position to date.\nSince 1950, only 10 times has the race been won by a driver starting lower than third.\nFour former Monaco winners will be on Sunday’s grid: Alonso (2006, 2007), Vettel (2011), Hamilton (2008, 2016), Raikkonen (2005).\nAlonso missed last year’s race to compete in the Indianapolis 500.\nLeclerc will be the first Monegasque to compete in his home race since Olivier Beretta in 1994. MILESTONE\nHamilton’s victory in Spain was his 41st from pole position, one more than the record he had previously shared with Schumacher.\nMax Verstappen’s third place in Spain was Red Bull’s 150th podium finish.\nMonaco also sees Red Bull celebrating their 250th race start. They won their 100th and 150th races.\nVettel can take his 50th win on Sunday. (Reporting Toby Davis)",
