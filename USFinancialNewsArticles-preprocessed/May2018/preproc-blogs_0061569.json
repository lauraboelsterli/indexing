Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Encryption can be a remarkably powerful tool used to keep data safe from hackers and spies. It’s now commonly used to protect websites, as its adoption is all but enforced by big companies such as Alphabet .’s Google. Yet the encryption of corporate data occurs at a much lower rate. Why? CIO Journal’s Sara Castellanos explores the complex reasoning behind that fact in a story for Journal Reports. (More on the report below.)\nLimited adoption . Only about a third of all sensitive corporate data stored in cloud-based applications is encrypted, according to a 2016 survey by security company Gemalto Inc. of about 3,500 IT staff world-wide.\nEncryption comes with trade-offs . “Companies can’t easily perform analysis or machine learning on encrypted data. So at a time when artificial intelligence and real-time data analysis is crucial for competitive advantage, executives must decide what to encrypt and for how long,” Ms. Castellanos writes. When encryption is on by default, applications could be as much as 7% slower, says Rohan Kumar, corporate vice president of Azure Data Group, a division of Microsoft Corp .’s cloud service.\nEncryption is evolving, though . New York-based startup Inpher Inc., has developed technology that enables data to be processed while it remains encrypted, allowing machine learning and analytics to be run without ever exposing the data, says co-founder and Chief Executive Jordan Brandt. Do you encrypt corporate data? Leave and comment and let us know.\nSoftware bots will break. What to do? software problems. Kenan Corp., tells CIO Journal’s Kim S. Nash .\nWSJ SPECIAL REPORT: CYBERSECURITY\nThreats from criminal groups, nation-states, activists and independent digital malcontents have converged, making it harder for companies to plan their defenses. ILLUSTRATION: BRIAN STAUFFER FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nWhat keeps CIOs up at night? Pretty much everything these days. Cybersecurity threats are relentless, they’re getting stronger, and they’re coming from more directions than ever. From vetting third-party vendors to accurately quantifying risk, CIOs and CISOs weigh in on the security topics that have them losing sleep.\nCould blockchain be the answer? The technology’s key features—decentralization, immutability and cryptography-based authentication—make it a powerful cybersecurity tool. But several challenges need to be addressed before it’s ready for prime time, Nir Kshetri writes .\nMaking security part of corporate culture . We’ve long been told that the weakest cybersecurity link in many companies is the people who work there. To make progress, it’s crucial that support and enthusiasm for increasing cybersecurity be visible at every level of the organization, and integrated into how employees are trained, managed, and rewarded, MIT Sloan School of Management professor Stuart Madnick writes .\nNeed a job? Cybersecurity is hiring . The current demand for cybersecurity workers is outpacing supply by so much that by 2022, North America will have 265,000 more data-security jobs than skilled workers, a 2017 report by consultants Frost & Sullivan projected. The Journal’s John Simons has more .\nThe future of elections is here, and it is paper . While security advocates have long considered use of paper a best practice for election integrity, the pace of its adoption has accelerated in the wake of Russian meddling in the U.S. election in 2016, according to WSJ’s Byron Tau . City and county governments around the country and a handful of states, so far, have moved to replace electronic voting methods with paper ballots or to adopt electronic-voting machines that generate paper receipts.\nFor more cybersecurity news, check out the Journal’s special report .\nMORE TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nHP Inc. expects 2018 to be a good year, with a forecast beating Wall Street expectations.

AI-powered robots used to detect criminals, DNA database software and an array of drones were just a few things Reuters found when it attended the China International Exhibition on Police Equipment, the security fair where China’s police force looks for the latest in cutting-edge surveillance technology.\nTrump campaign aides start voter-data venture . President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale, helped a former Trump data analyst start a new venture that could become a major provider of voter data in the run-up to 2020, the Journal reports .
