    "text": "DANVERS, Mass., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Recovery Centers of America (RCA) announced today that Christine Turner has joined the Danvers facility as clinical director. Turner, who has more than 20 years of experience leading human service organizations, will manage all aspects of clinical programming and services at the 207-bed drug and rehabilitation center.\n\"We're thrilled to welcome Chris to our team,\" said Recovery Centers of America-Danvers Chief Executive Officer Laura Ames. \"Her passion for helping others, paired with her extensive experience developing, supervising and leading top-performing inpatient and outpatient clinical treatment programs, allows us to continue to enhance and expand the services we provide to those in need.\"\n\"I'm excited to start the next chapter of my career here at RCA,\" said Turner. \"I've devoted my entire professional career to helping patients and their families transition from a life of addiction to a life of recovery, so it is extremely rewarding to be part of a company that is 100 percent committed to doing the same.\"\nPrior to joining RCA, Turner held a number of leadership positions at Lowell House Inc., an addiction treatment and recovery center serving communities in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts. Most recently, Turner was responsible for supervising all clinical programming and services as the center's clinical director. She was also instrumental in procuring more than $10,000,000 in grant funding for the development of specialized addiction treatment programming for women. Additional roles during her time at Lowell House Inc. included executive director of residential programs, director of the women's substance abuse program and interim CEO. Turner also worked at The Psychological Center in Lawrence, Mass., as director of department of public health community and residential substance abuse services.\nTurner is both a Licensed Alcohol Drug Abuse Counselor and Certified Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselor. She is also board certified by The American Academy of Experts in traumatic stress and is a master addiction counselor with the National Association for Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors.\nTurner earned a bachelor's degree in education from Bedford College (Bedford, UK) and a master's degree in community counseling psychology from Springfield College.\nRCA provides quality addiction treatment that is accessible and affordable – including medically-monitored detoxification, inpatient treatment and outpatient treatment – throughout Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Maryland. The company is based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\nAbout Recovery Centers of America\nRecovery Centers of America provides a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to addiction treatment.
