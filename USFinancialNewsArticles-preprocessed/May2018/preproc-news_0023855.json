As a result of our businesses’ strong performance during the first nine months, we are tightening our fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA outlook for growth from a range of 8% to 11% to a range of 9% to 11%. We remain confident in our full-year outlook and our strategies for future growth.”\n1 This earnings release includes several metrics, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share that are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Please see Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this release for definitions of such non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to their respective most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThird-Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Summary\nTotal case volume increased 0.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period, with underlying organic growth of 0.1%. Total case volume included a 4.8% increase in independent cases, growth in Performance Brands cases and broad-based growth in Vistar’s sales channels, partially offset by declines in the casual dining segment within Customized and the impact of an unusually large number of snow storms.\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 grew 2.7% to $4.3 billion versus the comparable prior year period. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation and mix. Overall food cost inflation was approximately 2.1% in the third quarter. The increase in net sales was also attributable to growth in Vistar and case growth in Performance Foodservice (“PFS”), specifically in the independent restaurant channel, and recent acquisitions.\nGross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 grew 7.2% compared to the prior year period, to $558.7 million. The gross profit increase was led by case growth and from selling an improved mix of customer channels and products, specifically to the independent restaurant channel. Gross profit per case increased 26 cents, while gross margin as a percentage of net sales was up 50 basis points over the prior year period to 12.8%.\nOperating expenses rose by 5.0% to $498.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to acquired case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational expenses, higher fuel prices, acquisition integration costs within Vistar, as well as an accelerating increase in the number of sales personnel within Performance Foodservice.\nOperating profit was up 28.7% driven by a strong gross profit increase of 7.2%. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 grew 62.0% year-over-year to $33.7 million. The growth was primarily a result of an increase in operating profit and a decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by interest and other expenses. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily a result of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 24.8% compared to 36.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nEBITDA increased 15.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period to $92.1 million. For the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA rose 6.7% to $95.6 million compared to the prior year period.\nDiluted EPS grew 60.0% to $0.32 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 over the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 25.9% to $0.34 per share in the third quarter over the prior year period.\nFirst-Nine Months Fiscal 2018 Financial Summary\nTotal case volume increased 2.8% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period, with underlying organic growth of 1.4%.\nNet sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $13.0 billion, an increase of 5.6% versus the comparable prior year period. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to case growth in Performance Foodservice, specifically in the independent restaurant channel, a higher selling price per case, sales growth in Vistar, and recent acquisitions.\nGross profit rose 8.5% compared to the prior year period, to $1.7 billion. The gross profit increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was led by case growth and an improved sales mix of customer channels and products, specifically to the independent restaurant channel. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was up 30 basis points over the prior year period to 12.9%.\nOperating expenses increased 7.1% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period, to $1.5 billion. The increase was primarily due to case volume growth and the resulting impact on variable operational expenses, one-time costs primarily related to the exit of the Company’s private-equity shareholders and acquisition integration costs within Vistar, partially offset by decreases in insurance and professional, legal, and consulting expenses within Corporate.\nOperating profit was up 23.2% to $159.7 million driven by strong top-line and gross profit growth and mix of business specifically within the independent restaurant channel. Net income was up 140.3% to $134.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period. The significant increase in net income was a result of the Company’s strong operating profit performance combined with the $53.9 million decrease in income tax expense. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by non-cash gains as a result of the Act and the excess tax benefit of $15.4 million associated with the performance vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards.\nEBITDA grew 14.3% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period to $255.8 million. For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, Adjusted EBITDA increased 12.4% to $291.3 million compared to the prior year period.\nDiluted EPS increased 138.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 over the prior year period, to $1.29. Adjusted diluted EPS rose 32.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 over the prior year period, to $1.01 per share.\nCash Flow and Capital Spending\nIn the first nine months of fiscal 2018, PFG generated $229.6 million in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of $127.6 million versus the prior year period. The improvement in cash flow from operating activities was largely driven by higher operating income and improvements in working capital. The Company delivered free cash flow of $156.4 million through the first nine months of fiscal 2018.\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company invested $73.2 million in capital expenditures. PFG now expects capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 will be between $115 million and $140 million. The fiscal 2018 capital expenditures estimate is lower than the Company’s previously provided estimate due to the timing of projects.\nThird-Quarter Fiscal 2018 Segment Results\nPerformance Foodservice\nPFS net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 4.7% to $2.5 billion compared to the prior year period. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation. Net sales growth was also driven by an increase in cases sold, including independent case growth and solid independent customer demand for Performance Brands. For the quarter, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales was up 80 basis points to 44.1%.\nEBITDA for PFS increased 4.5% to $69.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period. EBITDA growth was driven by a 6.2% increase in gross profit, offset slightly by an increase in fuel expense. The increase in gross profit per case resulted from a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold to independent customers and increased sales of Performance Brands.\nVistar\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Vistar net sales grew 9.3% to $820.2 million compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by broad-based growth in Vistar's sales channels and as a result of recent acquisitions.\nThird-quarter EBITDA for Vistar was up 14.0% versus the prior year to $32.5 million. Gross profit dollar growth of 16.9% for the third quarter was fueled by an increase in the number of cases sold and a favorable change in sales mix. Third quarter EBITDA was impacted by higher variable operating costs associated with higher case volume and integration costs related to recent acquisitions.\nPFG Customized\nNet sales for PFG Customized decreased 7.3% to $960.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period. This decrease was primarily a result of the Georgia facility that was closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nPFG Customized EBITDA decreased 1.0% to $10.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in EBITDA was driven by higher operating expenses, including higher warehouse personnel costs and fuel expense, partially offset by an increase in gross profit, which was primarily the result of a favorable shift in customer mix.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nFor fiscal 2018, PFG tightens its fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA outlook for growth to a range of 9% to 11%. The previous fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA range was 8% to 11%. The Company’s fiscal 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $390.7 million.\nPFG reaffirms its Adjusted Diluted EPS outlook representing growth in the range of 24% to 30% to $1.54 to $1.61 over its fiscal 2017 Adjusted Diluted EPS of $1.24.\nPFG’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS outlook and full-year forecast for its effective tax rate on operations exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, but are not limited to, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, certain tax items, and charges associated with non-recurring professional and legal fees associated with acquisitions. PFG’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these income and expense items on its reported net income, its reported Diluted EPS, and its reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, PFG does not provide a reconciliation to the closest corresponding GAAP financial measure for its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS outlook or its effective tax rate on operations forecast. Please see the “Forward-Looking Statements” section of this release for a discussion of certain risks to PFG’s outlook.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, a conference call with the investment community and news media will be webcast on May 9, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

Such measures are not recognized terms under GAAP, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and are not indicative of net income as determined under GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate the Company’s liquidity or financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because of varying methods of calculation.\nManagement measures operating performance based on PFG’s EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\nPFG believes that the presentation of EBITDA enhances an investor’s understanding of PFG’s performance. PFG believes this measure is a useful metric to assess PFG’s operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that PFG believes are not representative of PFG’s core business. PFG also uses this measure to evaluate the performance of its segments and for business planning purposes.\nIn addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items we do not consider part of our core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the Company’s credit agreement and indenture (other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date). Under PFG’s credit agreement and indenture, the Company’s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement and indenture).\nManagement also uses Free Cash Flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (purchases of property, plant and equipment). PFG also believes that the presentation of Free Cash Flow enhances an investor’s understanding of PFG’s ability to make strategic investments and manage debt levels.\nManagement also uses Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, which is calculated by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure by excluding the same items excluded in PFG’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, as well as certain one-time income tax items, to the extent that each such item was included in the applicable GAAP financial measure.\nPFG believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is useful to investors because these metrics provide insight into underlying business trends and year-over-year results and are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in PFG’s industry.\nThe following tables include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the applicable most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nPERFORMANCE FOOD GROUP COMPANY\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)\nThree months ended ($ in millions, except per share data) March 31,\n2018\nApril 1,\n2017\nChange % Net income (GAAP) $ 33.7 $ 20.8 $ 12.9 62.0 Interest expense 15.2 14.0 1.2 8.6 Income tax expense 11.1 12.1 (1.0 ) (8.3 ) Depreciation 24.6 23.3 1.3 5.6 Amortization of intangible assets 7.5 9.4 (1.9 ) (20.2 ) EBITDA 92.1 79.6 12.5 15.7 Impact of non-cash items (A) 2.1 4.1 (2.0 ) (48.8 ) Impact of acquisition, integration & reorganization charges (B) 0.6 3.3 (2.7 ) (81.8 ) Impact of productivity initiatives (C) 0.5 2.2 (1.7 ) (77.3 ) Impact of other adjustment items (D) 0.3 0.4 (0.1 ) (25.0 ) Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) $ 95.6 $ 89.6 $ 6.0 6.7 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 0.32 $ 0.20 $ 0.12 60.0 Impact of non-cash items 0.02 0.04 (0.02 ) (50.0 ) Impact of acquisition, integration & reorganization charges 0.01 0.03 (0.02 ) (66.7 ) Impact of productivity initiatives — 0.02 (0.02 ) (100.0 ) Impact of other adjustment items — 0.01 (0.01 ) (100.0 ) Tax impact of above adjustments — (0.03 ) 0.03 (100.0 ) Tax impact of revaluation of net deferred tax liability (E) (0.01 ) — (0.01 ) NM Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share (Non-GAAP) $ 0.34 $ 0.27 $ 0.07 25.9 A.

Management evaluates the performance of these segments based on their respective sales growth and EBITDA. For PFG Customized, EBITDA includes certain allocated corporate expenses that are included in operating expenses. The allocated corporate expenses are determined based on a percentage of total sales. This percentage is reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that the allocation reflects a reasonable rate of corporate expenses based on their use of corporate services.\nCorporate & All Other is comprised of corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense, as well as the operations of certain recent acquisitions.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reorganized its information technology department, and expenses associated with business application teams are now included in the segments results. The EBITDA for Performance Foodservice, Vistar, and Corporate & All Other for the three and nine months ended April 1, 2017 has been adjusted to reflect this change.\nThe following tables set forth net sales and EBITDA by segment for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):\nNet Sales\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Performance Foodservice $ 2,522.2 $ 2,408.2 $ 114.0 4.7 PFG Customized 960.3 1,036.3 (76.0 ) (7.3 ) Vistar 820.2 750.5 69.7 9.3 Corporate & All Other 112.0 99.4 12.6 12.7 Intersegment Eliminations (65.5 ) (59.4 ) (6.1 ) (10.3 ) Total net sales $ 4,349.2 $ 4,235.0 $ 114.2 2.7 Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 April 1, 2018 Change % Performance Foodservice $ 7,684.6 $ 7,202.8 $ 481.8 6.7 PFG Customized 2,744.6 2,837.1 (92.5 ) (3.3 ) Vistar 2,455.9 2,229.9 226.0 10.1 Corporate & All Other 330.7 236.2 94.5 40.0 Intersegment Eliminations (190.6 ) (173.1 ) (17.5 ) (10.1 ) Total net sales $ 13,025.2 $ 12,332.9 $ 692.3 5.6 EBITDA\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Performance Foodservice $ 69.7 $ 66.7 $ 3.0 4.5 PFG Customized 10.2 10.3 (0.1 ) (1.0 ) Vistar 32.5 28.5 4.0 14.0 Corporate & All Other (20.3 ) (25.9 ) 5.6 21.6 Total EBITDA $ 92.1 $ 79.6 $ 12.5 15.7\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Performance Foodservice $ 231.5 $ 214.8 $ 16.7 7.8 PFG Customized 21.3 20.9 0.4 1.9 Vistar 92.3 83.3 9.0 10.8 Corporate & All Other (89.3 ) (95.3 ) 6.0 6.3 Total EBITDA $ 255.8 $ 223.7 $ 32.1 14.3\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509005209/en/\nPerformance Food Group Company\nMedia:\nJoe Vagi\nManager, Corporate Communications\n(804) 484-7737\njoe.vagi@pfgc.com\nor\nInvestors:\nMichael D.
