    "text": "LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Britain is set to demand the European Union repays up to 1 billion pounds ($1.34 billion) if the bloc continues to force British companies out of the Galileo satellite navigation system, the Telegraph newspaper reported.\nThe Brexit ministry, officially known as Department for Exiting the European Union, will publish a paper on Thursday raising the prospect of Britain recovering its investment in the project, the newspaper said.\nGalileo is the EU rival to the global positioning system (GPS) developed and controlled by the United States and used by millions of consumer devices globally. It was commissioned in 2003 and is due for completion by 2020.\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive, has started to exclude Britain and its companies from sensitive future work on Galileo ahead of the country’s exit from the bloc in a year’s time.\nThe Brexit ministry declined to comment.\n$1 = 0.7483 pounds Reporting By Andrew MacAskill, editing by Estelle Shirbon\n ",
