    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah ally Elie Ferzli won at least half the votes in Lebanon’s parliament on Wednesday, securing his election as deputy speaker.\nThe post is reserved for a Greek Orthodox under the country’s sectarian power-sharing system. It has been held by an opponent of the Iran-backed Shi’ite Hezbollah movement since 2005, the year Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon.\nFerzli is one of a number of pro-Damascus politicians whom the May 6 election returned to public office for the first time since then.\nReporting by Ellen Francis and Laila Bassam; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
