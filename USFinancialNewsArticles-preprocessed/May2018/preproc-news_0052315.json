    "text": "Ireland votes in once-in-a-generation abortion referendum Ireland votes in once-in-a-generation abortion referendum Fatma Schwarz | May 25, 2018 |\nDUBLIN (Reuters) – Ireland started voting on Friday in an abortion referendum that could possibly be a milestone on a path of change in a rustic that, solely 20 years in the past, was one in every of Europe’s most socially conservative.\nPolls counsel Irish voters are set to overturn one of many world’s strictest bans on terminations. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, in favour of change, has referred to as the referendum a “once-in-a-generation” probability.\nVoters within the as soon as deeply Catholic nation shall be requested in the event that they want to scrap a prohibition that was enshrined within the structure by referendum 35 12 months in the past, and partly lifted in 2013 just for instances the place the mom’s life is in peril.\nIreland has been altering quick. It legalised divorce by a razor-thin majority solely in 1995, however three years in the past turned the primary nation on the planet to undertake homosexual marriage by widespread vote.\nA decades-old battle over abortion has performed out in a fiercely contested debate that divided political events, noticed the as soon as mighty church take a again seat and have become a take a look at case for the way international web giants cope with social media promoting in political campaigns.\nUnlike in 1983, when faith was entrance and centre and abortion was a taboo topic for most individuals, the marketing campaign was as a substitute outlined by ladies on each side publicly describing their private experiences of terminations.\n“I think it’s the right thing for the women of Ireland – care, compassion, dignity and safety. Equal healthcare is why I’m voting ‘Yes’,” mentioned Joanna Faughan, 33, voting within the north Dublin suburb of Castleknock the place queues fashioned earlier than polls opened at 0600 GMT.\n“Yes” campaigners have argued that with over 3,000 ladies travelling to Britain every year for terminations – a proper enshrined in a 1992 referendum – and others ordering drugs illegally on-line, abortion is already a actuality in Ireland.\nWriting within the Times Ireland newspaper, Varadkar urged voters to place themselves within the sneakers of an Irish lady coping with a disaster being pregnant. HOME TO VOTE\nAlthough not on the poll paper, the “No” camp has seized on authorities plans to permit terminations with no restriction as much as 12 weeks right into a being pregnant if the referendum is carried, calling it a step too far for many voters.

I’ve a family myself and I think it’s really important,” mentioned John Devlin, a advertising employee in his early 50s voting ‘No’ close to Dublin’s metropolis centre.\nOpinion polls have put those that favour altering the regulation in a transparent lead. The two most up-to-date surveys confirmed the “Yes” aspect pulling additional forward.\nPolling stations shut at 2100 GMT and nationwide broadcaster RTE plans to publish an exit ballot at 2230 GMT. The first indications of the outcome are anticipated mid-morning on Saturday, after the depend begins at 0800 GMT.\nAnalysts mentioned a excessive turnout just like the 62 % who voted to undertake homosexual marriage, significantly in city areas, would doubtless favour the “Yes” aspect.\nMany expatriate Irish have travelled house to vote in one of many few European Union nations that doesn’t enable these overseas to vote by way of submit or in embassies.\nThe hashtag #hometovote was the highest trending points on Twitter, because it was for the homosexual marriage vote.\nThose away for lower than 18 months stay eligible to vote at their former native polling station, and an awesome majority appeared to again change.\nMany posted photographs of themselves carrying sweatshirts bearing the “Yes” aspect’s “Repeal” slogan and associates shared movies of scores of voters being welcomed house at Irish airports.
