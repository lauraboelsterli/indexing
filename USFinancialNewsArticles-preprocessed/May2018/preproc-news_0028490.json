    "text": "ALAMEDA, Calif., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQMS), (“Aqua Metals” or the “Company”), which is proceeding to commercialize its proprietary electrochemical lead recycling technology called AquaRefining™, has provided a corporate update and announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRecent Company Highlights:\n• Four Aqua Refining modules now in production; currently working to achieve 24-hour operations on four modules\n• Shipped first 20 tonne batch of refined lead bullion blocks to Johnson Controls (JCI)\n• Reached an agreement with Johnson Controls (“JCI”) to extend the timelines of entering and executing their Equipment Supply Agreement by one year\n• Entered settlement with Kanen Wealth Management to strengthen company’s board and management team\n• New Board and management members include:\nSteve Cotton as President Frank Knuettel II as Chief Financial Officer Shariq Yosufzai, Sushil (\"Sam\") Kapoor, and Eric Prouty as independent directors\nCompany Update\nAqua Metals continues to work towards scaling up operations at the world’s first AquaRefinery at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) in McCarran, Nevada.\nAs anticipated from a previous communication, a fourth AquaRefining module has completed the conditioning period and has been transferred from technical control to production. The Company now has four AquaRefiners in production on one shift. The immediate focus is to achieve 24-hour operations with the four modules before bringing additional modules on line. The goal remains to have all 16 modules running for 24 hours; however, the Company believes that initial operation of four modules for 24 hours a day will allow the Company to reach full scale operations more rapidly. In addition, this operational strategy allows the company to maximize lead production, while enabling the remaining components of the plant to be synchronized in support of increased AquaRefining. Once the Company is satisfied with the operation of the first four modules, four more modules will be brought into production. This process will be repeated until full production is reached with all 16 modules. The company is currently adding staff and training for the additional shifts.\nAs announced previously, all AquaRefined lead produced is being melted in the refinery and cast into 2½ tonne blocks as refined bullion. The bullion is an alloy of AquaRefined lead and priming lead bullion previously purchased for the refinery start-up at TRIC. The first 20 tonne batch of refined lead bullion blocks was shipped from the plant in Reno, Nevada on May 7, 2018 and is currently en route to JCI. The Company expects shipments of lead to JCI to continue.\nOn April 12, 2018, Aqua Metals reached an agreement with JCI to extend the timelines for entering and executing their Equipment Supply Agreement by one year to April 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The Equipment Supply Agreement details installation of new greenfield builds, as well as conversion of existing JCI’s (and certain strategic partners of JCI) existing lead smelters to a lead recycling process utilizing the Company’s proprietary and patented AquaRefining technology and equipment, know-how and services.\nManagement Changes and Board Enhancement\nOn May 2, 2018, Aqua Metals entered into a settlement agreement with Kanen Wealth Management, LLC (“Kanen”). Under the agreement, Aqua Metals has expanded the Board from five to seven directors—all of which are independent—and has appointed Kanen nominees S. Shariq Yosufzai and Sushil (\"Sam\") Kapoor to the Board, effective May 2, 2018. Mr. Yosufzai will serve as Aqua Metal’s new Non-Executive Chairman and lead independent director.\nIn the first quarter, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and was in the process of implementing a plan for CEO succession and board refreshment. As part of this process, Stephen Clarke resigned as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. The Board also agreed to separate the roles of CEO and Board Chairman, and subsequently, elected Eric Prouty, an experienced sustainability-focused analyst and successful business development consultant, as an independent director.\nAs part of the settlement agreement with Kanen, Steve Cotton—the Company's former Chief Commercial Officer (from January 2015 to June 2017)—has rejoined Aqua Metals as the President. Selwyn Mould who has served briefly as the Company’s interim CEO, will resign from that position after the filing of the Company’s first quarter Form 10-Q and will remain with Aqua Metals as Chief Operating Officer.\nIn April 2018, Aqua Metals appointed Frank Knuettel II as Chief Financial Officer, and he will assume the role immediately following the filing of the Company’s first quarter Form 10-Q. Mr. Knuettel will succeed Thomas Murphy, who was named interim CFO on March 5, 2018. Mr. Knuettel joins Aqua Metals with extensive strategic and operational financial leadership, with over 20 years of management and business experience in public and venture-backed firms.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financials\nTotal revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $1.7 million, compared to $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and no revenue in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company incurred an operating loss of $7.0 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to an operating loss of $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.5 million, or ($0.27) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.9 million, or ($0.26) per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company had $17.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018, compared to $30.6 million as of March 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company raised approximately $13.8 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering. In January 2018, the Company received an additional $2.1 million in net proceeds from the underwriter exercising its overallotment option from the December 2017 capital raise.\nConference Call and Webinar\nAqua Metals will host a conference call today, Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight time) to discuss its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSelwyn Mould, Chief Operating Officer, and Thomas Murphy, Chief Financial Officer, will host the call, followed by a question and answer session.\nTo access the call, please use the following information:\nDate: Wednesday, May 9, 2018\nTime: 1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight time)\nDial-in: 1-855-327-6837\nInternational Dial-in: 1-631-891-4304\nPasscode: 10004831\nWebcast: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129640\nA telephone replay will be available approximately two hours after the call and will run through June 9, 2018 by dialing 1-844-512-2921 from the U.S., or 1-412-317-6671 from international locations, and entering replay pin number: 10004831.\nThe webcast will be available for replay for 60 days on the investor relations section of the company's website at www.aquametals.com .\nAbout Aqua Metals\nAqua Metals, Inc.
