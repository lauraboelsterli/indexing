    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Deadpool and his foul-mouthed crew of misfits and malcontents have taken down the Avengers.\nFox's \"Deadpool 2\" brought in $125 million according to studio estimates Sunday and ended the three-week reign of Disney's \"Avengers: Infinity War\" at the top of the North American box office.\n\"Deadpool 2\" fell somewhat short of the $130 million the studio predicted and the $132.4 million that its predecessor earned two years ago.\nBut the total still made for the second-highest opening weekend ever for an R-rated movie, and signaled that R-rated superhero films could become franchises and not just one-off successes.\nThe Avengers are hardly hurting. Disney and Marvel's \"Avengers: Infinity War\" brought in an estimated $29 million in North America for a four-week domestic take of nearly $600 million.",
