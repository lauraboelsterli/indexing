    "text": "EditorsNote: new headline\nJosh Bell drove in three runs with two doubles, and right-hander Trevor Williams combined with two Pittsburgh Pirates relievers Tuesday to shut out the visiting Chicago White Sox 7-0.\nThe Pirates lead the major leagues with seven shutouts.\nPittsburgh won both games of a short series last week in Chicago and on Wednesday will go for a sweep of this two-game set and all four interleague games between the clubs.\nWilliams (5-2) pitched seven innings, allowing six hits, striking out six and walking none. Kyle Crick pitched the eighth, Richard Rodriguez the ninth.\nChicago starter Reynaldo Lopez (0-3) gave up six runs and seven hits in two innings, with two walks and no strikeouts.\nIt was a rematch of the starters last Wednesday in Chicago when Williams allowed four runs in five innings and did not get a decision as the Pirates came back for a 6-5 win. Lopez outpitched Williams that game, holding the Pirates to three hits (two of them solo homers) in a career-high 7 1/3 innings, with six strikeouts.\nThe Pirates rocked Lopez early this time.\nAdam Frazier led off the first with his third homer, to right. Gregory Polanco followed with a single, moved to third on Starling Marte’s double, and both scored on Bell’s double for a 3-0 lead.\nColin Moran later drove in Bell with a two-out double to make it 4-0.\nIn the second, Polanco drew a two-out walk. Sean Rodriguez, who replaced Marte (right side discomfort) in center field, tripled Polanco home to make it 5-0. Bell followed with an RBI double for a 6-0 lead.\nIn the third, Pittsburgh catcher Francisco Cervelli got hit in the right forearm by a pitch from reliever Chris Beck. Cervelli left the game after that inning.\nThe Pirates added another run in the sixth. Beck was pulled after hitting Frazier with two outs. Polanco greeted Aaron Bummer with a double off the wall in right-center, and Frazier raced home to make it 7-0.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. ",
