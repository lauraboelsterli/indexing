    "text": "May 12, 2018 / 5:50 AM / Updated 11 hours ago Sunwolves make it 10th time lucky with thumping win over Reds Jack Tarrant 3 Min Read\nTOKYO (Reuters) - The Sunwolves picked up their first win of the Super Rugby season at the 10th attempt when Hayden Parker and Hosea Saumaki led the way in a rousing 63-28 victory over the slumping Queensland Reds in the Japanese capital on Saturday.\nIn the final match to be held in Tokyo this season — with the last two Sunwolves home games in Hong Kong and Singapore — flyhalf Parker amassed 36 points and winger Saumaki scored a hat-trick of tries to inspire a much-needed victory.\nTries from Parker and lock Grant Hattingh, as well as five penalties from the former, gave the Sunwolves a 15-point lead at halftime and Jamie Joseph’s men continued to punish the 2011 Super Rugby champions after the break.\nThree second half scores from Saumaki and a penalty try sealed the comfortable victory.\n“For me, as the coach of this team, this result wasn’t a surprise,” stressed Joseph.\n“Every week we had been improving but we hadn’t been able to get over the line and get a win so today, for me, the team put everything together in the same match.”\nJoseph made five changes to the side that lost to the Wellington Hurricanes two weeks ago, including a return for talismanic Brave Blossoms skipper Michael Leitch from injury.\nHowever, it took some time for the revamped lineup to make an impact as converted tries from Brandon Paenga-Amosa and Ben Lucas in the first 22 minutes gave the Reds a 14-9 lead.\nParker slotted home four penalties in the first 28 minutes to keep the Sunwolves in the contest before the match turned on the half hour mark when Hattingh went over for the home side’s first try of the day.

To dish that sort of performance up is pretty damn frustrating,” he added. Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by John O'Brien/Peter Rutherford",
