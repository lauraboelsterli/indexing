    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Camden Property Trust (NYSE:CPT) announced today operating results for 2018. Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders (“EPS”), Funds from Operations (“FFO”), and Adjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”) for 2018 are detailed below. A reconciliation of EPS to FFO is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nThree Months Ended March 31 Per Diluted Share 2018 2017 EPS $0.41 $0.39 FFO $1.15 $1.09 AFFO $1.04 $0.99 Quarterly Growth Sequential Growth Same Property Results 1Q18 vs. 1Q17 1Q18 vs. 4Q17 Revenues 3.3% 0.3% Expenses 2.1% 3.7% Net Operating Income (\"NOI\") 4.0% (1.5)% Same Property Results 1Q18 1Q17 4Q17 Occupancy 95.4% 94.7%\n95.7% “We are pleased to report another quarter of strong performance, with same property growth and FFO per share slightly better than anticipated,” said Richard J. Campo, Camden’s Chairman and CEO. “We now expect 2018 same property NOI growth to be 2.7% at the midpoint of our guidance range, compared to our original outlook of 2.5%, primarily as a result of lower than expected operating expenses during the first quarter. Camden’s 2018 guidance for FFO per share is unchanged, as the slight improvement in our outlook for same property NOI is offset by revised assumptions regarding the timing of additional 2018 acquisitions and initial occupancy at one of our new development communities.”\nThe Company defines same property communities as communities owned and stabilized since January 1, 2017, excluding communities under redevelopment and properties held for sale. A reconciliation of net income to NOI and same property NOI is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nDevelopment Activity\nDuring the quarter, construction was completed at Camden Shady Grove in Rockville, MD. Subsequent to quarter-end, leasing began at Camden McGowen Station in Houston, TX and Camden North End I in Phoenix, AZ.\nDevelopment Communities - Construction Completed and Projects in Lease-Up ($ in millions)\nTotal Total % Leased Community Name Location Units Cost as of 5/1/2018\nCamden NoMa II Washington, DC 405 $107.6 78% Camden Shady Grove Rockville, MD 457 113.0 70% Total 862 $220.6 Development Communities - Construction Ongoing ($ in millions)\nTotal Total % Leased Community Name Location Units Budget as of 5/1/2018\nCamden McGowen Station Houston, TX 315 $90.0 6% Camden North End I Phoenix, AZ 441 105.0 9% Camden Washingtonian Gaithersburg, MD 365 90.0 Camden Grandview II Charlotte, NC 28 21.0 Camden RiNo Denver, CO 233 75.0 Camden Downtown I Houston, TX 271 132.0 Total 1,653 $513.0 Acquisition/Disposition Activity\nDuring the quarter, the Company acquired Camden Pier District, a 358-home apartment community located in St. Petersburg, FL, for $126.9 million and Camden North Quarter, a 333-home apartment community located in Orlando, FL, for $81.4 million.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, Camden acquired a 1.78-acre land parcel in Orlando, FL, for $11.4 million for the future development of approximately 360 wholly-owned apartment homes.\nShare Repurchase\nDuring the quarter, Camden repurchased 3,222 shares at an average price of $78.72 per share for $0.3 million.

This new presentation has been applied prospectively as this reclassification will not have an impact upon total property revenues. Approximately $5.6 million of rental revenue is related to this presentation for 2018. Had ASU 2014-09 been effective as of January 1, 2017, we would have reclassified approximately $5.3 million from other property revenues to rental revenue for 2017.\nNote: Please refer to the following pages for definitions and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document.\nCAMDEN\nFUNDS FROM OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share and property data amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 39,395 $ 34,861 Real estate depreciation and amortization 68,595 62,153 Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 2,247 2,213 Income allocated to non-controlling interests 1,130 1,128 Funds from operations $ 111,367 $ 100,355 Less: recurring capitalized expenditures (a) (9,999 ) (9,694 ) Adjusted funds from operations - diluted $ 101,368 $ 90,661 PER SHARE DATA\nFunds from operations - diluted $ 1.15 $ 1.09 Adjusted funds from operations - diluted 1.04 0.99 Distributions declared per common share 0.77 0.75 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: FFO/AFFO - diluted 97,124 92,029 PROPERTY DATA\nTotal operating properties (end of period) (b) 158 153 Total operating apartment homes in operating properties (end of period) (b) 54,181 53,116 Total operating apartment homes (weighted average) 46,353 45,710 (a) Capital expenditures necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities.\n(b) Includes joint ventures and properties held for sale, if any.\nNote: Please refer to the following pages for definitions and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document.\nCAMDEN\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nMar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 ASSETS Real estate assets, at cost Land $ 1,053,578 $ 1,021,031 $ 1,016,097 $ 1,008,459 $ 984,523 Buildings and improvements 6,494,229 6,269,481 6,269,561 6,199,435 6,071,203 7,547,807 7,290,512 7,285,658 7,207,894 7,055,726 Accumulated depreciation (2,185,452 ) (2,118,839 ) (2,080,989 ) (2,016,259 ) (1,952,809 ) Net operating real estate assets 5,362,355 5,171,673 5,204,669 5,191,635 5,102,917 Properties under development, including land 399,903 377,231 363,481 373,294 377,107 Investments in joint ventures 26,863 27,237 28,420 29,665 30,062 Total real estate assets 5,789,121 5,576,141 5,596,570 5,594,594 5,510,086 Accounts receivable – affiliates 23,397 24,038 23,620 23,592 23,634 Other assets, net (a) 199,420 195,764 189,253 155,784 147,922 101,401 368,492 350,274 16,318 245,529 Restricted cash 15,036 9,313 9,178 8,312 8,175 Total assets $ 6,128,375 $ 6,173,748 $ 6,168,895 $ 5,798,600 $ 5,935,346 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Liabilities Notes payable Unsecured $ 1,339,142 $ 1,338,628 $ 1,338,117 $ 1,437,608 $ 1,583,819 Secured 865,798 865,970 866,134 866,292 866,476 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 123,706 128,313 127,557 116,754 120,086 Accrued real estate taxes 29,061 51,383 70,027 48,559 24,682 Distributions payable 75,083 72,943 72,962 69,347 69,326 Other liabilities (b) 157,002 154,567 154,506 134,851 123,654 Total liabilities 2,589,792 2,611,804 2,629,303 2,673,411 2,788,043 Commitments and contingencies Non-qualified deferred compensation share awards 76,174 77,230 73,015 84,050 75,704 Equity Common shares of beneficial interest 1,026 1,028 1,028 978 978 Additional paid-in capital 4,132,056 4,137,161 4,134,206 3,678,660 3,675,737 Distributions in excess of net income attributable to common shareholders (396,596 ) (368,703 ) (383,584 ) (351,910 ) (317,642 ) Treasury shares, at cost (356,687 ) (364,066 ) (364,736 ) (364,785 ) (365,923 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (c) 3,579 (57 ) (7 ) (1,795 ) (1,829 ) Total common equity 3,383,378 3,405,363 3,386,907 2,961,148 2,991,321 Non-controlling interests 79,031 79,351 79,670 79,991 80,278 Total equity 3,462,409 3,484,714 3,466,577 3,041,139 3,071,599 Total liabilities and equity $ 6,128,375 $ 6,173,748 $ 6,168,895 $ 5,798,600 $ 5,935,346 (a) Includes: net deferred charges of: $ 929 $ 1,125 $ 1,312 $ 1,487 $ 1,683 net fair value adjustment of derivative instruments: $ 5,291 $ 1,690 $ 1,754 $ — $ — (b) Includes deferred revenues of: $ 536 $ 426 $ 1,463 $ 513 $ 1,455 (c) Represents the unrealized net loss and unamortized prior service costs on post retirement obligations, and unrealized net gain on cash flow hedging activities. CAMDEN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DEFINITIONS & RECONCILIATIONS (In thousands, except per share amounts) (Unaudited)\nThis document contains certain non-GAAP financial measures management believes are useful in evaluating an equity REIT's performance. Camden's definitions and calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other REITs, and thus may not be comparable. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance, or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\nFFO\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) currently defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\")), excluding gains (or losses) associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties, real estate depreciation and amortization, impairments of depreciable assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Our calculation of diluted FFO also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including certain non-controlling interests, which are convertible into common shares. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties, and depreciation, FFO can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies. A reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO is provided below:\nAdjusted FFO\nIn addition to FFO, we compute Adjusted FFO (\"AFFO\") as a supplemental measure of operating performance. AFFO is calculated utilizing FFO less recurring capital expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities. Our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other REITs, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other REITs. A reconciliation of FFO to AFFO is provided below:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 39,395 $ 34,861 Real estate depreciation and amortization 68,595 62,153 Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 2,247 2,213 Income allocated to non-controlling interests 1,130 1,128 Funds from operations $ 111,367 $ 100,355 Less: recurring capitalized expenditures (9,999 ) (9,694 ) Adjusted funds from operations $ 101,368 $ 90,661 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: EPS diluted 96,046 90,949 FFO/AFFO diluted 97,124 92,029 Total earnings per common share - diluted $ 0.41 $ 0.39 FFO per common share - diluted $ 1.15 $ 1.09 AFFO per common share - diluted\n$ 1.04 $ 0.99 Expected FFO\nExpected FFO is calculated in a method consistent with historical FFO, and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected earnings per common share (EPS). Guidance excludes gains, if any, on properties not currently held for sale due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales. A reconciliation of the ranges provided for diluted EPS to expected FFO per diluted share is provided below:\n2Q18 Range 2018 Range Low High Low High Expected earnings per common share - diluted $ 0.45 $ 0.49 $ 1.68 $ 1.88 Expected real estate depreciation and amortization 0.68 0.68 2.81 2.81 Expected adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 0.02 0.02 0.09 0.09 Expected income allocated to non-controlling interests 0.01 0.01 0.04 0.04 Expected FFO per share - diluted $ 1.16 $ 1.20 $ 4.62 $ 4.82 Note: This table contains Please see the paragraph regarding earlier in this document.\nCAMDEN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DEFINITIONS & RECONCILIATIONS (In thousands, except per share amounts) (Unaudited)\nNet Operating Income (NOI)\nNOI is defined by the Company as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes. NOI is further detailed in the Components of Property NOI schedules on page 11 of the supplemental. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income attributable to common shareholders because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. A reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders to net operating income is provided below:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 40,525 $ 35,989 Less: Fee and asset management income (1,998 ) (1,748 ) Less: Interest and other income (793 ) (634 ) Less: Income/(loss) on deferred compensation plans 205 (4,617 ) Plus: Property management expense 6,639 7,027 Plus: Fee and asset management expense 965 884 Plus: General and administrative expense 12,223 12,868 Plus: Interest expense 20,374 22,956 Plus: Depreciation and amortization expense 70,224 63,734 Plus: Expense/(benefit) on deferred compensation plans (205 ) 4,617 Plus: Loss on Early Retirement of Debt —\n323 Less: Equity in income of joint ventures (1,829 ) (1,817 ) Plus: Income tax expense 388 471 Net Operating Income (NOI) $ 146,718 $ 140,053 \"Same Property\" Communities $ 128,604 $ 123,681 Non-\"Same Property\" Communities 14,665 11,424 Development and Lease-Up Communities 2,048 42 Dispositions/Other 1,401 4,906 Net Operating Income (NOI) $ 146,718 $ 140,053 Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including net operating income from discontinued operations, excluding equity in (income) loss of joint ventures, (gain) loss on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests, gain on acquisition of controlling interest in joint ventures, gain on sale of operating properties including land, net of tax, loss on early retirement of debt and income (loss) allocated to non-controlling interests. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income attributable to common shareholders because it represents income before non-cash depreciation and the cost of debt, and excludes gains or losses from property dispositions. A reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 39,395 $ 34,861 Plus: Interest expense 20,374 22,956 Plus: Depreciation and amortization expense 70,224 63,734 Plus: Income allocated to non-controlling interests from continuing operations 1,130 1,128 Plus: Income tax expense 388 471 Plus: Loss on early retirement of debt\n—\n323\nLess: Equity in income of joint ventures (1,829 ) (1,817 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 129,682 $ 121,656\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006582/en/\nCamden Property Trust\nKim Callahan, 713-354-2549\nSource: Camden Property Trust",
