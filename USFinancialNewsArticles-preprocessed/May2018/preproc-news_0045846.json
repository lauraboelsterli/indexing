We have significantly increased volumes in most of our products and the newly acquired assets will start to contribute to our shipment volumes and financials in Q2. All of our end markets are showing strong demand and high capacity utilizations,” said Pedro Larrea, CEO of Ferroglobe. “Prices in all of our products have continued to increase, and supply/demand dynamics in our industry provide a good support for continued healthy pricing levels.”\nCash flow generation affected by acquisition of new assets\nWorking capital increased by $57.5 million during the period. The new assets acquired from Glencore AG on February 1, 2018 have contributed $55.5 million to this working capital increase.\nFerroglobe continued to generate positive cash flows. During the first quarter, cash flows used for operations was $20.4 million. Excluding the cash flows related to Glencore AG, the Company generated operating cash flows of $35.5 million.\nFerroglobe’s net debt was $449.3 million as of March 31, 2018, up from $386.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase in net debt is mainly due to the $55.5 million working capital increase from the acquisition of the new assets from Glencore AG on February 1, 2018, including the build-up of inventories of raw materials (mostly manganese ore) and finished goods (ferromanganese and silicomanganese) of the new plants.

Net of one-off items, the Company generated over $35 million of cash during Q1.\nThe Company has decided to reinstate a dividend payment\nThe Board of Ferroglobe has decided to declare an interim dividend of $0.06 per share, reflecting the confidence in the underlying strength of the business and the Company’s long-term outlook. The dividend will have a record date of June 8, 2018 and a payment date of June 29, 2018.\nAbout the Board’s decision, Javier López Madrid, Executive Chairman of Ferroglobe, said, “As we balance our capital allocation alternatives, we believe this level of dividend is an effective way of returning value to shareholders, while continuing to focus on strengthening our balance sheet.”\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Year Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Profit (loss) attributable to the parent $ 36,680 $ 6,364 $ (6,554 ) $ (678 ) Loss attributable to non-controlling interest (1,066 ) (84 ) (1,561 ) (5,144 ) Income tax (benefit) expense 15,668 (26,022 ) (1,214 ) (14,821 ) Net finance expense 13,156 19,659 12,970 61,704 Financial derivatives loss 1,765 956 — 6,850 Exchange differences (729 ) (2,500 ) 20 (8,214 ) Depreciation and amortization charges, operating allowances and write-downs 28,016 23,830 27,222 104,529 EBITDA 93,490 22,203 30,883 144,226 Non-controlling interest settlement — — — 1,751 Power credit — — — (3,696 ) Long lived asset charge due to reclassification of discontinued operations to\ncontinuing operations — — — 2,608 Accrual of contingent liabilities — 6,044 — 12,444 Impairment loss — 30,618 — 30,618 Business interruption — — — (1,980 ) Revaluation of biological assets — (5,195 ) — (5,195 ) Step-up valuation adjustment — — — 3,757 Share-based compensation (3,886 ) — — — Adjusted EBITDA $ 89,604 $ 53,670 $ 30,883 $ 184,533\nAdjusted profit (loss) attributable to Ferroglobe:\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Year Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Profit (loss) attributable to the parent $ 36,680 $ 6,364 $ (6,554 ) $ (678 ) Tax rate adjustment (742 ) (19,705 ) 1,771 (8,215 ) Non-controlling interest settlement — — — 1,191 Power credit — — — (2,513 ) Long lived asset charge due to reclassification of discontinued operations to\ncontinuing operations — — — 1,773 Accrual of contingent liabilities — 4,110 — 8,462 Impairment loss — 20,820 — 20,820 Business interruption — — — (1,346 ) Revaluation of biological assets — (3,533 ) — (3,533 ) Step-up valuation adjustment — — — 2,555 Share-based compensation (2,642 ) — — — Adjusted profit (loss) attributable to the parent $ 33,296 $ 8,056 $ (4,783 ) $ 18,516\nAdjusted diluted profit (loss) per share:\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Year Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Diluted profit (loss) per ordinary share $ 0.21 $ 0.04 $ (0.04 ) $ — Tax rate adjustment — (0.11 ) 0.01 (0.05 ) Non-controlling interest settlement — — — 0.01 Power credit — — — (0.01 ) Long lived asset charge due to reclassification of discontinued operations to continuing operations — — — 0.01 Accrual of contingent liabilities — 0.02 — 0.05 Impairment loss — 0.12 — 0.12 Business interruption — — — (0.01 ) Revaluation of biological assets — (0.02 ) — (0.02 ) Step-up valuation adjustment — — — 0.01 Share-based compensation (0.02 ) — — — Adjusted diluted profit (loss) per ordinary share $ 0.19 $ 0.05 $ (0.03 ) $ 0.11 Conference Call\nFerroglobe will review the first quarter results of 2018 during a conference call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 22, 2018.\nThe dial-in number for the call for participants in the United States is 877‑293‑5491 (conference ID 7495697).
