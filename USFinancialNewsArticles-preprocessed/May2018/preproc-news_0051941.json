    "text": "LEBANON, Tenn., May 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (\"Cracker Barrel\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: CBRL) today reported its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended April 27, 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nComparable restaurant sales growth of 1.5% and traffic of -1.3% outperformed the casual dining industry. Net income was $48.7 million, a 3.9% increase over prior year third quarter net income of $46.9 million. Diluted earnings per share were $2.03, a 4.1% increase compared to $1.95 in the prior year third quarter. The Company announced that its Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $1.25 per share on the Company's common stock, which represents a 4.2% increase over the Company's previous quarterly dividend of $1.20. The Board of Directors also declared a special dividend of $3.75 per share on the Company's common stock.\nCommenting on the third quarter, Cracker Barrel President and Chief Executive Officer Sandra B. Cochran said, \"I am pleased that we again delivered positive comparable store sales growth in both restaurant and retail and that the sales trend reflected sequential improvement versus previous quarters. Higher commodity inflation and expenses related to our strategic initiatives pressured operating margins, but I'm pleased with the progress we're making. Our confidence in the strength of our business is reflected in our increased regular dividend and our declared special dividend.\"\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nRevenue\nThe Company reported total revenue of $721.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, representing an increase of 3.0% over the third quarter of the prior year. Cracker Barrel comparable store restaurant sales increased 1.5%, including a 2.8% increase in average check partially offset by a 1.3% decrease in comparable store restaurant traffic. The average menu price increase for the quarter was approximately 2.5%. Comparable store retail sales increased 0.9% from the prior year quarter.\nCracker Barrel comparable store restaurant traffic, average check, and comparable store restaurant sales and retail sales for the fiscal months of February, March, and April and the third quarter were as follows:\nFebruary\nMarch\nApril\nThird\nQuarter (1)\nComparable restaurant traffic\n-3.2%\n-0.9%\n-0.3%\n-1.3%\nAverage check\n2.3%\n2.5%\n3.6%\n2.8%\nComparable restaurant sales\n-0.9%\n1.6%\n3.3%\n1.5%\nComparable retail sales\n0.8%\n4.7%\n-1.7%\n0.9%\n(1) The Company estimates third quarter inclement weather reduced traffic and\nsales by approximately 0.4%.\nOperating Income\nOperating income in the third quarter was $63.3 million, or 8.8% of total revenue, a decrease from the prior year quarter result of $71.5 million, or 10.2% of total revenue. As a percentage of total revenue, increases in other store operating expenses and cost of goods sold were partially offset by reductions in labor and related expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nDiluted Earnings per Share\nDiluted earnings per share were $2.03, an $0.08 increase over the prior year third quarter.\nQuarterly Dividend Increase and Special Dividend\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $1.25 per share on the Company's common stock, which represents a 4.2% increase over the Company's previous quarterly dividend of $1.20. The quarterly dividend is payable on August 6, 2018 to shareholders of record on July 13, 2018.\nThe Board of Directors also declared a special dividend of $3.75 per share on the Company's common stock. This is the Company's fourth special dividend declaration. The special dividend is payable on August 3, 2018 to shareholders of record on July 13, 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nThe Company now expects to report earnings per diluted share for the 2018 fiscal year of between $10.35 and $10.45 and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the 2018 fiscal year of between $9.30 and $9.40. The Company continues to anticipate total revenue of approximately $3.1 billion, reflecting the expected opening of eight new Cracker Barrel stores and three new Holler & Dash Biscuit House restaurants. The Company continues to anticipate comparable store restaurant sales growth of between 1.0% and 2.0% and approximately flat comparable store retail sales growth. The Company now expects food commodity inflation of approximately 3.25% for the year. The Company now projects an operating income margin of approximately 9.5% of total revenue for fiscal 2018. The Company expects depreciation expense of approximately $95 million; net interest expense in the range of $15 million and $16 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $150 million. The Company now estimates a blended effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 of approximately 11%.\nThe Company's 2018 fiscal year is a 53-week year. The Company estimates the impact of the 53 rd week, which is included in its guidance, to contribute earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.35.\nThe Company reminds investors that its outlook for fiscal 2018 reflects a number of assumptions, many of which are outside the Company's control.\nFiscal 2018 Third Quarter Conference Call\nAs previously announced, the live broadcast of Cracker Barrel's quarterly conference call will be available to the public on-line at investor.crackerbarrel.com today beginning at 11:00 a.m. (ET).

Company makes reference to adjusted earnings per share when excluding a one-time non-cash revaluation of a net deferred tax liability. The Tax Act, which became effective on January 1, 2018 and prior to the end of our second quarter, lowered the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a provisional tax benefit for re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities due to this rate change, of approximately $25 million. The Company believes that excluding this item and its related tax effects from its financial results reflects the current cash impact of tax reform for the Company's current fiscal year, and, as such may provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the Company's financial results. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income or earnings per share information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFY 2018\nFirst Nine Months\nGAAP Reported Earnings per Diluted Share\n$7.74\nOne-time Non-Cash Revaluation of Net Deferred Tax Liability\n($1.06)\nAdjusted Earnings per Diluted Share\n$6.68\nInvestor Contact:\nAdam Hanan\n(615) 443-9887\nMedia Contact:\nJanella Escobar\n(615) 235-4618\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cracker-barrel-reports-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2018-increases-quarterly-dividend-and-declares-special-dividend-300652294.html\nSOURCE Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.",
