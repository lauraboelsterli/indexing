    "text": "RIYADH, May 14 (Reuters) - Yemen’s armed Houthi movement launched a missile at a distribution centre belonging to oil giant Saudi Aramco in Saudi Arabia’s southwestern Jizan province on Monday, the group’s al-Masirah TV reported.\nThe Houthis, an Iran-allied group that holds much of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, have fired a series of missiles into the kingdom in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict in Yemen widely seen as a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nThere was no immediate confirmation of the report from Saudi authorities.
