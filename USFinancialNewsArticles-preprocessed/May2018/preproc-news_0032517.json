    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will release more details in the weeks ahead on its planned ban of the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040, business minister Greg Clark said on Tuesday.\nThere is particular uncertainty as to whether hybrid cars, vehicles that have both an electric and combustion engine, will be included or not.\n“We’re going to publish a strategy paper on this in the weeks ahead,” said Clark.\n“It is very much designed to be a transition that is industry-led.”\nReporting by Costas Pitas, editing by James Davey\n ",
