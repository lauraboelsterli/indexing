    "text": "(Reuters) - ANZ Bank New Zealand agreed to sell its New Zealand life insurance business to U.S-listed Cigna Corp ( CI.N ) for NZ$700 million ($482.4 million), as its parent boosts its capital base by hiving off non-core businesses.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) is pictured on a local branch in Sydney in this April 30, 2014 file photo. REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo ANZ Bank New Zealand said the deal to sell OnePath Life NZ would add about 5 basis points to the level 1 CET ratio of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ( ANZ.AX ).\nThe deal would generate a gain on sale of around NZ$50 million, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.\nThe transaction marks ANZ’s second disposal this month, after it sold a majority stake in a Cambodian joint venture to Japan’s J Trust ( 8508.T ).\nThis follows a trend among major Australian banks to offload non-core businesses to trim their capital requirements and simplify business structure. National Australia Bank ( NAB.AX ) said earlier this month it was looking to exit part of its wealth management arm by 2019.\nANZ New Zealand said the deal included a 20-year strategic alliance for Cigna to provide insurance to ANZ Bank customers. It added that current policy holders would continue with existing coverage.\nReporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ",
