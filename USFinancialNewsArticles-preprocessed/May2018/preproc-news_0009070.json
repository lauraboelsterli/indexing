FILE PHOTO - Angela Leong On Kei (L), Managing Director of SJM Holdings Limited, and Chairman of the Board of Directors Ambrose So, sit in front of a model of Lisboa Palace, an upcoming resort during a news conference in Macau February 13, 2014. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo\nSJM, which is controlled by the family of tycoon Stanley Ho, is faced with challenges including an unclear future leadership structure and the delayed opening of its planned $4.6 billion casino resort in the former Portuguese colony of Macau.\nSJM is lagging behind other companies, including Sands China and Wynn Macau, which have already completed casino resorts on Macauâ€™s fast growing Cotai strip.\nNet profit in the first quarter came in at HK$730 million ($93.0 million), while net gaming revenues increased by 6.7 percent to $HK8.4 billion.\n($1 = 7.8497 Hong Kong dollars) Reporting by Farah Master; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri",
