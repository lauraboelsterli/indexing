    "text": "May 10 (Reuters) - File hosting service provider Dropbox Inc topped analysts' estimates for paying subscribers in its first financial report as a publicly traded company.\nDropbox said it had 11.5 million subscribers at the end of March, up 23.7 percent from the year-ago quarter. That compared with analysts' average estimate of 11.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nDropbox reported average revenue per user of $114.3, beating estimates of $110.\nThe company's quarterly loss widened to $465.5 million, largely due to IPO-related expenses.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 8 cents per share.\nTotal revenue rose 28 percent to $316.3 million.\nDropbox had a blockbuster market debut on March 23, with shares ending the day up more than 35 percent.
