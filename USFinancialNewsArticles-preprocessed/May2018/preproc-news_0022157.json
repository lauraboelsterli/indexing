    "text": "Carlos Carrasco dominated on the mound with a season-high 14 strikeouts and Tyler Naquin and Francisco Lindor each homered to help the Cleveland Indians snap a four-game slide with a 6-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday at Miller Park.\nCarrasco (5-1) went the distance for his 10th career complete game and second this season. He allowed five hits and walked only one. He struck out the side in the third and fourth inning and induced inning-ending double plays in the second and sixth.\nNaquin delivered the big blast in the fourth inning, hammering a 3-2 slider from Milwaukee starter Junior Guerra over the center field wall for a three-run shot that gave the Indians a 4-0 lead. It was Naquin’s second home run of the season.\nGuerra (2-3) gave up four runs on six hits, with nine strikeouts and two walks in five innings.\nLindor led off the seventh inning with a home run off Brewers reliever Corey Knebel, who returned to the mound for the first time since being put on the disabled list with a hamstring injury in early April.\nDown 5-0, the Brewers finally mounted a threat in the seventh inning. Christian Yelich and Jesus Aguilar led off the inning with back-to-back singles to give Milwaukee runners on first and third with no outs. The Brewers only came away with one run, though, on Travis Shaw’s RBI groundout that brought home Yelich. Carrasco struck out the final two batters of the inning to get out of the jam.\nCarrasco delivered at the plate in the ninth inning, singling home Roberto Perez, who led off the inning with a triple.\nCarrasco gave up a leadoff double to Lorenzo Cain in the ninth inning. Cain scored on Aguilar’s deep sacrifice fly, which took Naquin all the way to the wall in right field.\nThe Indians return home to host the Kansas City Royals in a three-game series beginning Friday.\nThe Brewers head out on a 10-game road trip, starting Thursday at Colorado.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
