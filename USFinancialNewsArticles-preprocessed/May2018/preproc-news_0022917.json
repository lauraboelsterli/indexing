The Company considers EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Corporate EBITDA to be important measures of performance because they:\nare key operating metrics of the Company's business; are used by management in its planning and budgeting processes and to monitor and evaluate its financial and operating results; and provide stockholders and potential investors with a means to evaluate the Company's financial and operating results against other companies within the Company's industry.\nThe Company's calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be consistent with similar calculations by other companies in the Company's industry. The Company calculates EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company calculates “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA plus foreign exchange gain/loss plus gain/loss from unconsolidated affiliate plus share-based payment expense and certain significant non-recurring items that the Company may include from time to time. The Company calculates “Pre-Corporate EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA plus corporate overhead expense, which includes director compensation, SEC compliance costs, audit and professional fees, and other public company costs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net and operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nForm 10-Q Filing\nAdditional information concerning the Company's results of operations and financial position is included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 11, 2018.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relating to the Company are based on the beliefs of the Company’s management as well as information currently available to the Company’s management.
