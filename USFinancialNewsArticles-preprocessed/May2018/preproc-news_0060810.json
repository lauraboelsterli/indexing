FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final First Leg - Sevilla vs Bayern Munich - Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, Seville, Spain - April 3, 2018 Sevilla fans display a banner before the match REUTERS/Sergio Perez\nMachin, 43, guided Girona to 10th place in their first La Liga campaign, capping a successful spell with the team he took over in 2014.\n“With his characteristic 3-5-2 system and a notable approach to set-pieces, Machin has created his own stamp which he’ll now try to use to strengthen a team settled in Europe and designed to fight for the biggest prizes,” Sevilla said in a statement.\nItalian Vincenzo Montella, who led Sevilla to the Champions League quarter-finals, was sacked in April after they lost 5-0 to Barcelona in the King’s Cup final.\nJoaquin Caparros was reappointed on an interim basis and steered the Andalusians into Europe with a seventh-place La Liga finish, before accepting a role as director of football.\nMachin was forced to retire as a player at the age of 23 with Numancia but soon moved into coaching, taking over at his home-town team before joining Girona.
