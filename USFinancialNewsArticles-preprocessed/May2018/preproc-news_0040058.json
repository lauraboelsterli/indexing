REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n“A transition period could be instrumental in smoothing the process of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU,” the ECB said.\n“It could help mitigate the execution risks banks face in implementing their Brexit plans, given the scope and complexity of their planned activities in the euro area and the operational and information technology-related changes required to support those activities.” Reporting By Francesco Canepa",
