    "text": "MILWAUKEE, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- At WEC Energy Group's (NYSE: WEC) annual meeting of stockholders today, Chairman and Chief Executive Gale Klappa described 2017 as \"another year of progress,\" pointing to significant achievements in financial performance, network reliability, infrastructure upgrades and a reshaping of its generation fleet.\nKlappa cited the following 2017 highlights:\nCompany performance\nWEC Energy Group's subsidiary, We Energies, was named the most reliable utility in America and for the seventh consecutive year, the best in the Midwest. WEC Energy Group was named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in the nation by Corporate Responsibility Magazine.\nEarnings, financial strength and dividend growth\nNet income and earnings per share were highest in company history. Dividends increased in January 2018 by 6.25 percent to an annual rate of $2.21 per share. This marks the 15 th consecutive year of higher dividends. Dividend target is a payout ratio of 65 to 70 percent of earnings – a level competitive with peers in the regulated utility sector.\nShareholder return\nOver the past 15 years:\nTotal return to shareholders has significantly outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, NASDAQ, S&P Electric Index, Dow Jones Utility Average and Philadelphia Utility Index. Total shareholder return, assuming reinvested dividends, was 724.2 percent. Total return has averaged 15.1 percent a year.\nInfrastructure improvements\nModernizing the city of Chicago's natural gas pipelines, ultimately replacing 2,000 miles of piping – some more than a century old. Moving more than 2,000 miles of power lines underground in northern Wisconsin to improve electric reliability. This initiative is now more than 50 percent complete. Extending natural gas infrastructure in Wisconsin to help meet growing customer demand.\nReshaping generation fleet\nBuilding two new state-of-the-art power stations fueled with natural gas in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Pursuing 350 megawatts of utility-scale solar development in Wisconsin.

Approve the compensation of WEC Energy Group's named executive officers (say-on-pay).\nWEC Energy Group (NYSE: WEC), based in Milwaukee, is one of the nation's premier energy companies, serving 4.5 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota.\nThe company's principal utilities are We Energies, Wisconsin Public Service, Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas, Michigan Gas Utilities, Minnesota Energy Resources and Upper Michigan Energy Resources.
