    "text": "May 26, 2018 / 5:12 PM / Updated 34 minutes ago McIlroy and Molinari tied for lead at PGA Championship Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy’s challenge for the BMW PGA Championship faltered as the four-times major champion suffered an off-day and was caught by charging Italian Francesco Molinari on Saturday. Golf - European Tour - BMW PGA Championship - Wentworth Club, Virginia Water, Britain - May 26, 2018 Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy during the third round Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs\nThe Northern Irishman began his third round three shots clear of the field on 12-under but found the Wentworth course far less obliging and dropped three shots in his opening six holes before dragging his round back together.\nMcIlroy, who double bogeyed the sixth hole, finished with birdies on 17 and 18 for a one-under 71 to share the lead with Molinari on 13-under going into the Sunday’s final round. Golf - European Tour - BMW PGA Championship - Wentworth Club, Virginia Water, Britain - May 26, 2018 Italy's Francesco Molinari during the third round Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs\nMolinari, 35, began the day five shots behind the 29-year-old McIlroy but produced a majestic six-under 66. Golf - European Tour - BMW PGA Championship - Wentworth Club, Virginia Water, Britain - May 26, 2018 Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy in action during the third round Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs\nAfter parring the first seven holes, Molinari produced a superb approach to the eighth for a tap-in birdie and followed that with another birdie on the ninth.\nThe putts continued to drop on the inward nine as he picked up four more shots, including a chip-in from the fringe on the par-three 14th, to move to the top of the leaderboard.\nMcIlroy was not done though and his fighting finish sets up what should be an intriguing final day at the European Tour’s flagship tournament.\nMolinari said patience had been the key on a day of tricky pin positions and zippy greens.\n“It was a tough day and nice to see a clean scorecard on a day like that,” he said. “I missed a few short puts at the beginning but stayed patient and the birdies at eight and nine kick-started me for the back nine.”\nTwenty-one-year-old Englishman Sam Horsfield, playing with McIlroy in the final group, struggled initially but also finished with two birdies to join a group of players on nine-under, including Swedish defending champion Alex Noren.
