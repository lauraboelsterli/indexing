Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad gives a news conference after a cabinet meeting in Putrajaya, Malaysia May 23, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer\nMahathir led an opposition coalition to a shock victory in elections this month after campaigning on rising living costs and a promise to clean up corruption and on Wednesday vowed to cut the national debt of 1 trillion ringgit ($251.67 billion).\nHe has barred former premier Najib Razak and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, from leaving the country, and ordered the anti-graft agency to investigate the disappearance of billions of dollars from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).\nInvestigators have already searched Najib’s home and several properties, seizing cash, jewelry and luxury items estimated to be worth millions of dollars.\nThe Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) will finish taking a statement from Najib, who ruled the country for almost a decade, on Thursday.\nIn a separate development, police on Tuesday raided five sites linked to Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim, the former government-appointed chairman of Tabung Haji, a fund for Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, an MACC official told Reuters.\nA number of documents, jewelry and cash were confiscated, said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. The Star newspaper reported on its website that the cash found totaled 120 million Malaysian ringgit ($30 million). Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim was not immediately available for comment.\nNajib has consistently denied any wrongdoing at 1MDB.\nNew Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said on Wednesday that he has asked for PricewaterhouseCoopers to be appointed for a review and audit of 1MDB.
