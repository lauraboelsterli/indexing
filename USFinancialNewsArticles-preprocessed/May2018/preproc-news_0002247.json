The financial results for the previous periods/year have been restated to give effect of the same\n4. Previous period figures have been regrouped or re-arranged wherever necessary to conform to current period's presentation\nRevenues\nRevenue for Q4 at ₹ 27,630 crore, was up 13% sequential basis, primarily on account of higher volumes and improved commodity prices.\nOn y-o-y basis, revenue was higher by 17% primarily on account of higher volume from Oil & Gas, Aluminium, Copper India business and improved commodity prices, partially offset by currency appreciation and lower volume at Zinc India as per mine plan\nRevenues for FY 18 were at ₹ 92,923 crore up 22% y-o-y. The increase was mainly on account of ramp-up of capacities at Aluminium, record production from Zinc India and improved commodity prices partly offset by currency appreciation and lower sales at Iron ore.\nEBITDA and EBITDA Margins\nEBITDA for Q4 at ₹ 7,929 crore, was up 17% on sequential basis, primarily on account of higher volumes from Zinc India and Aluminium business, capitalisation of pot relining expenses at Aluminium business and improved commodity prices. This was partially offset by input commodity inflation mainly Alumina, Carbon and Coal.\nOn y-o-y basis, it was up 9% primarily on account of record production at Aluminium business, capitalisation of pot relining expenses and improved commodity prices partly offset by input commodity inflation and currency appreciation.\nEBITDA for the year was ₹ 25,470 crore up 19% on account of record production from Zinc India and Aluminium and improved commodity prices. This was partially offset by input commodity inflation, currency appreciation, lower sales at Iron ore Goa.\nWe maintained industry leading robust EBITDA margin 1 of 36% for the year (FY 2017: 39%)\nDepreciation & Amortization\nDepreciation for Q4 FY 2018 at ₹ 1,683 crore was higher q-o-q basis by ₹ 38 crore primarily on account of higher capitalisation at Aluminium business, higher production at Zinc India partially offset by lower depreciation at Oil and Gas due to change in reserve estimates\nOn y-o-y basis, it was higher by ₹ 79 crore mainly due to higher capitalisation at Aluminium business offset by lower charge at Oil & Gas business due to change in method of calculation of Unit of production (UOP) charge to \"Proved and Developed Oil and Gas Reserves\" (1P) and change in reserves estimation.\nDepreciation and amortisation for FY2018 was ₹ 6,283 crore flat compared to FY17.\nFinance Cost and Other Income\nFinance cost for Q4 FY 2018 was at ₹ 1,424 crore, 9% higher q-o-q basis primarily due to capitalisation at Aluminium business. On y-o-y basis, it was lower by 5% mainly on account of deleveraging during FY 2018 partially offset by dividend payments on preference shares issued to the shareholders of Cairn India pursuant to the merger with the Company in April and capitalisation of pots at Aluminium business.\nFinance cost for FY 2018 was ₹ 5,783 crore was marginally lower compared to ₹ 5,855 crore in FY 2017 on account of de-leveraging during the year and lower interest rates, partially offset by dividends on preference shares issued to the shareholders of Cairn India pursuant to the merger with the Company in April, interest cost on temporary borrowings at Zinc India and capitalization of pots at Aluminium business.\nOther Income was at ₹ 993 crore, higher on a q-o-q basis by ₹ 420 crore. Q3 FY18 other income was lower on account of lower return on investments due to sharp rise in G-Sec yields resulting in mark-to-market losses on investments. On y-o-y basis, other income was higher by ₹ 72 crore.\nOther Income for FY 2018 was at ₹ 3,574 crore lower by ₹ 1,007 crore primarily owing to lower investment due to special dividend payments by Zinc India and Vedanta Limited and deleveraging during the year, lower return on investments due to sharp rise in G-Sec yields resulting in mark-to-market losses on investments.\nExceptional Items\nThe exceptional gains in Q4 was ₹ 2,869 crore mainly on account of reversal of previously recorded impairment of ₹ 7,016 crore at our Oil and Gas business following the progress on the key growth projects which are expected to result in enhanced recovery of resources; partially offset by impairment of Iron ore Goa assets of ₹ 2,329 crore due to suspension of mining operations from March 16, 2018 pursuant to Supreme Court Order dated February 7, 2018 and reclassification of FCTR relating to subsidiary investment companies under liquidation of ₹ 1,485 crore.\nTaxes\nTax expense (before exceptional items & DDT) was at ₹ 5,339 crore during the year, resulting in a tax rate of 32% higher compared to 15% in FY 2017 mainly due to phasing out of investment allowance claims, change in cess rate from 3% to 4% as per the Finance Act 2018 and change in profit mix.\nAttributable Profit after Tax and Earnings per Share (EPS)\nAttributable PAT before exceptional items and DDT for the quarter was at ₹ 2,420 crore 15% higher q-o-q.\nFor FY 18, attributable PAT before exceptional items and DDT was at ₹ 8,025 crore 10% higher y-o-y.
