    "text": "ATLANTA, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DEKRA, one of the leading global expert organizations, has acquired the emission-check business of Jiffy Smog, based in Las Vegas and Henderson, Nevada. The 24 stations included in the acquisition are the first for DEKRA in the state. DEKRA, the world's No. 1 in vehicle inspections now operates stations for safety and emission checks in six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada.\n\"DEKRA has been active in the field of vehicle inspections for more than 90 years. Our goal is to bring our international experience and our expertise to Nevada in order to give vehicle owners the best service possible\", said Eric Labe, President of DEKRA North America, Inc. \"We are also looking at a significant potential for growth in the state beyond Clark County.\"\n\"Jiffy Smog has been in the market for decades and has been doing well in a very competitive environment. We are aiming to build on this success\", says Pete Villari, Executive Vice President in charge of vehicle inspections at DEKRA North America, Inc. \"We are looking forward to working with the former employees of Jiffy Smog who have joined DEKRA following the close of the acquisition.\"\nThe regulatory environment in Nevada requires most vehicle owners to have emissions checked annually. Jiffy Smog is the largest \"Test Only\" business in the state, which means that the stations are authorized to check emissions, but not to perform repairs. \"This fits DEKRA's general focus on neutral and independent third-party expert services and a clear distinction between inspection and repair,\" says Eric Labe.\nAbout DEKRA\nDEKRA has been active in the field of safety for more than 90 years. Founded in 1925 in Berlin as Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-Ãœberwachungs-Verein e.V., it is today one of the world's leading expert organizations. DEKRA SE is a subsidiary of DEKRA e.V. and manages the Group's operating business. In 2017, DEKRA estimates to have generated sales totaling approximately 3.1 billion Euros.
