    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said a follow-on agreement could be built around the core of the JCPOA nuclear accord with Iran that would address President Trump’s concerns.\nHe was speaking in parliament after he was asked by an opposition Labour lawmaker what his suggestion would be to the U.S, after Trump pulled out of the 2015 accord.\nJohnson said: “The central idea is that around the core of the JCPOA you build a super-structure, a follow-on agreement that would address the problems of the sunset clauses, address the issue of the ICBMs (inter-continental ballistic missiles) and satisfy the president’s anxieties.”\nReporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
