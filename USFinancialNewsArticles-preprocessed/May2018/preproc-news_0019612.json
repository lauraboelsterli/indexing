(NASDAQ:AFH) (“Atlas” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nManagement Comments\nScott D. Wollney, Atlas’ President and CEO, stated, “We achieved a solid start to 2018 with a focus on underwriting profitability. Our expectation is that the conservative approach we’ve taken with respect to current year loss ratio coupled with incremental rate increases and our continued stringent evaluation of claims inventory and subsequent closure levels will optimize retained earnings over time. By leveraging analytics to amplify the core expertise we’ve established as a specialist, our team works diligently to identify challenging claims, with the goal of ensuring that we defend our clients against non-meritorious claims but also proactively settle appropriate claims as quickly and accurately as possible. In addition to overall rate activity, we are confident that our investment in technology and analytics is also having a positive impact on underwriting activities. The first quarter illustrates the earnings power of our business with an annualized return on equity of 24.3% in the first quarter compared to 14.9% in the prior year quarter.”\nFinancial and Operational Review\nPremiums Written: For the three month period ended March 31, 2018, gross premiums written was $95.6 million compared to $98.5 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, representing a 3.0% decrease. Gross premiums written decreased primarily due to the non-renewal of one large Illinois taxi fleet as a result of disciplined underwriting practices.\nGeographic Distribution: The Company is licensed in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Atlas actively writes its core business in 42 of these states plus the District of Columbia. Compared to the three month period ended March 31, 2017, Atlas experienced growth in gross premiums written in its core business in 24 states for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. Based on the Company’s commitment to optimize return on deployed capital, the Company utilizes predictive analytics based pricing coupled with its strong value proposition to grow market share in environments that are favorable and is prepared to reduce exposure to those that are more challenging.\nCombined Ratio: Atlas’ combined ratio increased for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 to 89.3%, compared to 86.9% in the prior year period.\nLoss Ratio: The loss ratio relating to claims incurred for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 was 62.7%, compared to 60.5% for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The loss ratio increased over the prior year period primarily as a result of the Company’s continued review of underwriting profitability by product and state and higher than expected claim cost associated with Atlas’ participation in non-voluntary assigned risk pools and run-off commercial auto. For reference, 1.4 percentage points of the year-over-year difference is attributable to assigned risk business, reflecting the challenges facing broader commercial auto, with the remainder of the change attributable to a more conservative current year loss ratio selection. As previously announced, the Company is utilizing machine learning based predictive analytics in the claim area, in addition to using it as an underwriting tool, to further benefit from the data and experience within its organization. Atlas believes this approach amplifies the value of the assets accumulated over its operating subsidiaries’ many years spent focusing on niche target markets to model potential risk and deliver value for both customers and stakeholders. On a year over year basis, the Company expects its loss ratio to continue to generally trend in a positive direction based on prior year and potential future pricing, underwriting and claims activities. Underwriting Expense Ratio: The underwriting expense ratio for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 was 26.6% compared to 26.4% for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The ratio increased mainly because of higher than average acquisition costs in the quarter. The average was higher due to the non-renewal of the one large taxi fleet in Illinois which had been historically underwritten at zero commissions. As previously indicated, due to seasonality and the timing of certain expenses, the Company believes the full year expense ratio is a more indicative measure of efficiency that the ratio in any given quarter. Atlas remains focused on continually enhancing its value proposition through re-investment into research and development to ensure that its organization is able to continue leading the industry in terms of existing and developing niche markets on which Atlas focuses.\nThe table below details the comparisons of each component of the Company’s combined ratio for the periods indicated (after accounting for the effect of quota share reinsurance):\nThree Month Periods Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Loss Ratio: Current accident year 60.7 % 59.9 % Prior accident years 2.0 % 0.6 % Loss Ratio 62.7 % 60.5 % Underwriting Expense Ratio: Acquisition cost ratio 10.7 % 10.5 % Other underwriting expense ratio 16.8 % 16.0 % DPAC amortization ratio (0.5 ) % (0.8 ) % Underwriting expense ratio before expenses related to stock purchase agreements and share-based compensation expenses 27.0 % 25.7 % Expenses recovered related to stock purchase agreement ratio (0.9 ) % — % Share-based compensation expense ratio 0.5 % 0.7 % Underwriting expense ratio 26.6 % 26.4 % Total combined ratio 89.3 % 86.9 % As the Company continues the use of quota share reinsurance, and potentially changes the percentage of ceded premiums under its contract, the impact on the individual ratios of acquisition cost and other underwriting expense will vary. On a pro-forma basis, as if there was no quota share reinsurance in place, the components of the underwriting expense ratio for the periods indicated would have been as follows:\nThree Month Periods Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Acquisition costs 13.3 % 13.7 % Other insurance general and administrative expenses 15.1 % 14.0 % DPAC amortization (0.5 )% (0.7 )% Expenses recovered related to stock purchase agreements (0.8 )% — % Share-based compensation expense 0.5 % 0.6 % Total underwriting expense ratio 27.6 % 27.6 % Underwriting Results: Underwriting profit decreased to $6.0 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.3 million in the same period of the prior year, representing a 5.8% decrease.\nNet Income before Income Taxes: Net income before income taxes decreased to $6.8 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to $7.5 million in the same period of the prior year, representing a 8.7% decrease.\nIncome Taxes: Atlas recognized tax expense of $1.3 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to a tax expense of $2.6 million in the same period of the prior year.\nNet Income: Atlas reported net income of $5.5 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to $4.9 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.\nEarnings per common share (“EPS”): Atlas generated $0.45 earnings per common share diluted for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. This compares to $0.40 earnings per common share diluted as reported for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.\nShare Count: The following chart illustrates Atlas’ potential dilutive common shares for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Month Periods Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Weighted average common shares outstanding 12,140,587 12,045,519 Dilutive potential ordinary shares: Dilutive stock options 57,474 155,049 Dilutive average common shares outstanding 12,198,061 12,200,568 The effects of convertible instruments are excluded from the computation of earnings per common share diluted in periods in which the effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, all exercisable stock options were deemed to be dilutive.\nBalance Sheet/Investment Overview\nBook Value: Book value per common share was $7.62 based on 11,944,378 common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018, compared to $7.42 based on 12,178,857 common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Book value per common share of $7.62 increased by $0.20 relative to December 31, 2017 as follows:\n$ 0.44 increase related to net income after tax and before items indicated below; (0.01 ) decrease related to the loss from change in fair value of equity securities; 0.02 increase related to the change in net realized investment gains after tax; (0.17 ) decrease related to the change in unrealized gains/losses after tax; (0.09 ) decrease related to stock repurchases; and 0.01 increase related to share-based compensation. $ 0.20 total increase from December 31, 2017 book value per common share Cash and Invested Assets: Cash and invested assets as of March 31, 2018 totaled $239.3 million as compared to $243.5 million as of December 31, 2017.\nInvestment Strategy: Atlas aligns its securities portfolio to support the liabilities and operating cash needs of its insurance subsidiaries, to preserve capital and to generate investment returns. Atlas invests predominantly in fixed income securities with overall maturities that correlate with the payout patterns of Atlas’ claims liabilities and other liquidity needs. Other than fixed income investments are limited to an appropriately small percentage of its portfolio and are generally opportunities identified through the Company’s specialty focus or by leveraging the resources of its business partners. As of March 31, 2018, the average life on the Company’s portfolio was 5.2 years with a duration of 4.0 years. The Company’s investment allocations will be regularly reviewed based on market conditions with a continued emphasis on capital preservation to support growth in its operating business.\nNet Investment Income / Net Investment Realized Gains: Atlas generated net investment income of $964,000 and $1.1 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as $293,000 and $134,000 of net realized gains, respectively. The decrease in net investment income from the prior year period was primarily the result of lower returns on equity method investments and higher investment expenses, partially offset by higher interest income on the Company’s fixed income securities portfolio. The higher interest income on fixed income securities resulted from increased yields on the fixed income securities portfolio. The gross annualized investment yield on the Company’s fixed income securities was 2.6% and 2.2% for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the gross annualized yield was due to management’s decision to use the proceeds from the maturity and sales of certain fixed income securities to purchase fixed income securities with higher yields. The gross annualized investment yield on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents was 0.5% and 0.2% for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in gross yield on cash investments was due to higher interest rates on certain accounts and higher balances in accounts earning greater interest. The increase in net realized gains was primarily comprised of gains from the sale of equity securities, partially offset by losses from the sale of fixed income securities.\nBeginning January 1, 2018, Atlas adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, which requires changes in the unrealized market value of equities held at fair value to be recorded through net income. Atlas recorded a loss of $128,000 through net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 related to the changes in unrealized amounts on equities held at fair value.\nOutlook for 2018\nAtlas expects to write in excess of $300 million in premiums in 2018, which is a consistent rate of growth relative to last year, subject to market conditions. Based on recent commercial auto industry results, the Company expects further market hardening through 2018. As always, underwriting profit will take precedent over top line growth.\nAt that level of premium and expected use of the Company’s existing reinsurance programs, with a full year combined ratio in the mid-80s, it is reasonable to expect annual net earnings per share to exceed $2.00.\nMr. Wollney concluded, “We continued to emphasize bottom line performance over top line growth, with written premiums coming in as expected in the first quarter following rate enhancements. We do expect to write in excess of $300 million in premiums in 2018, but remain focused on utilizing the repository of data specific to our niche and integrating predictive analytics to achieve returns on equity over the broader P&C universe.”\nConference Call Details\nDate/Time: Tuesday, May 8, 2018 - 8:30 a.m. ET Participant Dial-In Numbers: (United States): 877-423-9817 (International): 201-493-6770 To access the call, please dial-in approximately five minutes before the start time and, when asked, provide the operator with passcode “Atlas”.\nAn accompanying slide presentation will be available in .pdf format on the investor relations page of the Company’s website after issuance of the earnings release.\nWebcast\nThe call will also be simultaneously webcast over the Internet via the “Investor Relations” section of Atlas’ website at www.atlas-fin.com/investorrelations or by clicking on the conference call link: http://atlas-fin.equisolvewebcast.com/q1-2018 .
