(Nasdaq: SBOT, \"Stellar\" or the \"Company\"), a leading manufacturer of a key protein utilized in multiple immunotherapy development pipelines targeting Alzheimer's, lupus and cancers, among other diseases, today announced the agreement by certain holders of its common share purchase warrants to exercise and purchase 1,122,076 shares of its Common Shares at the existing exercise price of $2.65 per share. The Common Shares issued upon exercise are registered pursuant to its registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-224314) relating to such Common Shares, which registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 10, 2018 (the \"Registration Statement\"). The gross proceeds from the exercise of the warrants are expected to be approximately $3.0 million, prior to deducting placement agent discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Stellar intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include research and development activities, capital expenditures and working capital.\nIn consideration for the immediate exercise of the warrants and in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the exercising holders will receive two series of unregistered warrants. The Series A common share warrant will be exercisable into, in the aggregate, 1,122,076 common shares at an exercise price of $2.65 and have a term of exercise equal to 5 years. The Series B common share warrants will be exercisable into, in the aggregate, 2,244,152 common shares at an exercise price of $2.65 and have a term of exercise equal to 7 months.\nH.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the exercise of the warrants.\nThe new warrants being issued to the holders have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the SEC or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. The securities were offered only to accredited investors. The Company has agreed to use best efforts to file one or more registration statements with the SEC covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout Stellar Biotechnologies\nBased north of Los Angeles at the Port of Hueneme, Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc. is the leader in sustainable manufacture of Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) , an immune-stimulating protein utilized as a carrier molecule in therapeutic vaccine pipelines (targeting cancers, immune disorders, Alzheimer's and inflammatory diseases) and for assessing immune system function.
