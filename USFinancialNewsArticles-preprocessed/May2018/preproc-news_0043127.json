    "text": "2 COMMENTS NJ Transit’s new chief executive will visit New York Penn Station on Tuesday to listen to customer concerns, ahead of the agency reducing rail services in early June as part of its effort to install safety equipment faster.\nExecutive Director Kevin Corbett will appear with other senior NJ Transit officials from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m.\nThe visit is the second and final stop on a listening tour for Mr. Corbett, who took over as head of one of the nation’s largest bus and rail operators earlier this year.\nLast week, Mr. Corbett spent two hours at Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey, where he took comments and questions from passengers, several of whom were frustrated or confused by service delays and cancellations.\nAt the time, Mr. Corbett said his priorities include improving on-time performance and ramping up hiring to end a shortage of train engineers. But he cautioned that improvements would take time. “There is no magic wand,” he said.\nNJ Transit, which carries more than 900,000 passengers on trains and buses each weekday, faces myriad challenges following years of financial cuts and deteriorating service.\nMost immediately, the agency must meet a federally mandated deadline to install safety equipment called positive train control by the end of the year. The system uses sensors placed alongside tracks and aboard locomotives to automatically slow or stop trains, preventing derailments and train-to-train crashes.\nRailroads have had a decade to install the equipment. NJ Transit lags behind most of its peers nationwide.\nBy the end of March, the agency had installed the equipment on just 35 of 440 locomotives, according to federal data. It is also behind on installing radio-tower equipment and on training staff to use the system.\nBeginning June 4, the agency will temporarily suspend some rail services on several lines and alter other services so it can speed up locomotive installation. In June alone, according to an NJ Transit spokeswoman, the agency expects to take between 50 and 60 locomotives out of service.\nThe agency says the service changes will affect about 2,000 of its approximately 300,000 weekday passenger rail trips. It expects to restore full service in early 2019.\nJanna Chernetz, director of New Jersey policy at the nonprofit Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said she was concerned that diverted passengers could cause crowding on existing services.\nThe NJ Transit spokeswoman, Nancy Snyder, said the agency would alter rail schedules to increase passenger capacity and would “add cars to train sets where we can.”\nWrite to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com",
