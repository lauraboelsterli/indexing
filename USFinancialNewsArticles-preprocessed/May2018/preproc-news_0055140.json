    "text": "SINGAPORE, May 25 (Reuters) - Singaporeâ€™s factory output grew more than expected in April, accelerating from March, helped by an upswing in pharmaceuticals production, data showed on Friday.\nManufacturing output in April rose 9.1 percent compared with a year earlier, up from the revised 6.1 percent rise in March, data from the Singapore Economic Development Board showed.\nThe median forecast in a Reuters survey was for an on-year 8.3 percent expansion.\nOn a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production rose slower than expected at 0.2 percent in April, lower than the revised 0.5 percent rise in March.\nThe poll called for a seasonally adjusted, month-on-month rise of 1.2 percent.\nPharmaceuticals production in April jumped 10.7 percent, accelerating sharply from the 7.2 percent contraction in March.\nElectronics output growth in April eased to 11.3 percent from a year earlier compared with an increase of 12.6 percent in March.
