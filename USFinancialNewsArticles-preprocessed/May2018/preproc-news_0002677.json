The Company will broadcast its first quarter 2018 earnings conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 7:00 am PDT.\nOutlook\n“With the recent improvement in bidding activity and major programs scheduled to bid over the next several months, we expect 2018 to be a very strong bidding year. The improving demand along with a stable competitive landscape should lead to improving revenue and margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2018,” said Scott Montross, President and CEO of the Company. “We saw a lull in the bidding activity beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 continuing into March 2018. It was only in the last ten days of March that we saw bidding activity begin to improve. As a result, we have experienced a very small revenue first quarter of 2018, and expect a very small second quarter.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nNet sales increased 12.5% to $33.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $29.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 due predominantly to increased tons produced. The increase in tons produced was due to project timing.\nGross profit was $1.3 million (4.0% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a gross profit of $1.2 million (4.2% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit increased due to increased sales.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $2.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 which included $0.3 million, or $0.2 million net of taxes (using a statutory tax rate) in restructuring expense. Net loss from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2017 was $3.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, which included $0.9 million, or $0.6 million net of taxes (using a statutory tax rate) in restructuring expense.\nBacklog represents the balance of remaining performance obligations under signed contracts (“Backlog”). The Company also has projects for which it has been notified that it is the successful bidder, but a binding agreement has not been executed (“Confirmed Orders”). Beginning in 2018, accounting guidance requires disclosure of Backlog, which was $41 million as of March 31, 2018. Backlog including Confirmed Orders, which is the metric the Company has traditionally reported, was $87 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $88 million as of December 31, 2017 and $77 million as of March 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold its first quarter 2018 earnings conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 7:00 am PDT.
