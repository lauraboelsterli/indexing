Amazon and the Postal Service declined to comment.\nTrump has criticized both Amazon and Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive officer of the online retailer. Bezos also privately owns The Washington Post, which has published stories that have angered the president.\nTrump has repeatedly said without evidence that deliveries for Amazon were costing the service money. Last month, he ordered the creation of a task force to study the Postal Service and its financial difficulties.\nBig increases in its parcel delivery rates could cost Amazon and other businesses billions, leading to higher prices for consumers.
