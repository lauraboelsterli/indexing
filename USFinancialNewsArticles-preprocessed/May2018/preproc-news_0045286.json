Google is set to be featured on CBS News’ “60 minutes” this weekend.\nApplied Materials dropped 9.9 percent after the chip gear maker’s disappointing forecast renewed concerns over slowing smartphone demand.\nThe warning dragged down Philadelphia chipmaker index by 1.45 percent, while the broader technology sector dropped 0.31 percent.\nThe industrial sector jumped 0.42 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, with Boeing’s near 2 percent rise giving the biggest lift.\nAt 10:11 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.44 points, or 0.01 percent, at 24,717.42, kept afloat by Boeing and other industrial stocks.\nThe S&P 500 was down 6.53 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,713.60 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 27.41 points, or 0.37 percent, at 7,355.06.\nWith 10-year Treasury yields, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, holding above the key 3-percent level and oil prices hovering around the $80 per barrel mark, investors have been fretting about their impact on corporate results.\nCampbell Soup and tractor maker Deere & Co joined a long list of companies that blamed higher raw material and freight costs for a drop in profit margins.\nCampbell Soup fell 11.5 percent after its chief executive officer decided to step down and a cut in full-year profit forecast. Shares of a host of other food companies also declined.\nDeere jumped 4.2 percent after the company raised its full-year earnings estimate.\nNordstrom declined 10.5 percent after the upscale department store operator reported same-store sales that missed analysts’ expectations.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.00-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.08-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 99 new highs and 13 new lows.
