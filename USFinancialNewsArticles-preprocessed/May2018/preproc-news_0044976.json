    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 8:59 AM / Updated 20 minutes ago Malaysia says finance ministry has been bailing out 1MDB Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nKUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Reuters) - Malaysia has been “bailing out” 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) debt obligations since April 2017 and payments on behalf of the state fund amounted to 6.98 billion ringgit ($1.8 billion), the newly appointed finance minister said on Tuesday.\nThe sum included payments made to Abu Dhabi fund IPIC as part of a settlement agreement amounting to 5.05 billion ringgit, Lim Guan Eng said in a statement.\n“The above confirms the public suspicion that 1MDB had essentially deceived Malaysians by claiming that they have been paid via a “successful rationalisation exercise,” he said. “All these while it has been the MoF (finance ministry) who has bailed out 1MDB.” ($1 = 3.9650 ringgit) (Reporting by Praveen Menon)",
