Mr. McLean is a professional geologist with over 20 years of exploration and management experience, having worked on numerous projects within Canada and internationally and in a wide range of commodities. Mr. McLean is a graduate of the University of Alberta and is a registered professional geologist with the Association of Professional Geologists of Ontario.\nPrior to joining New Dimension, Mr. McLean led the exploration team at North American Palladium's Lac des Iles Mine in Northern Ontario.

Cameron has extensive experience in both gold and base metal exploration, and his skill set will be key in assisting us with our goal of discovering high grade precious metal resources on our projects in Argentina and Canada. Cameron has already been involved, in a consulting capacity, in the planning phase of our Las Calandrias and Los Cisnes drill programs, and will therefore be able to contribute proactively from the moment we initiate these drill programs.\nGoing forward, I look forward to keeping the market informed on progress at our key projects\".\nOn Behalf of the Board of New Dimension Resources Ltd.\n\"Eric Roth\"\nEric Roth, Ph.D., FAusIMM\nPresident & CEO\nAbout New Dimension Resources\nNew Dimension is engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of quality mineral resource properties throughout the Americas, with a focus on precious metals.
