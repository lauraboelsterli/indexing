Britain Soccer Football - Manchester City v Manchester United - Premier League - Etihad Stadium - 27/4/17 Manchester United assistant manager Rui Faria before the match Action Images via Reuters / Jason Cairnduff Livepic\nBritish media reported that the 42-year-old Faria is on Arsenal’s shortlist to replace Arsene Wenger, who will leave the north London club after almost 22 years in charge.\nPortuguese Faria has worked with United manager Jose Mourinho since 2001 and they have won 25 trophies together with six clubs.\n“After a lot of consideration, and with a very heavy heart, I have decided the time is right for me to move on,” Faria told United’s website.\n“I have had 17 years of incredible and unforgettable experiences. However, I have felt for some time that I would like to spend much more quality time with my family before pursuing any new challenge in my professional life.”\nWhen asked if Faria would be a contender for the Arsenal job, Mourinho said: “I think so, yes. You ask me if I think it would be a good fit and I say ‘yes’.” Reporting by Peter Hall, editing by Ed Osmond",
