    "text": "VANCOUVER, B.C., Novelion Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:NVLN), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing therapies for individuals living with rare diseases (“Novelion” or the “Company”), today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an overview of business activities.\nChief Operating Officer Jeff Hackman said, “Thus far in 2018 we have executed a number of important initiatives, including finalizing the settlements with the DOJ, reducing costs, strengthening our balance sheet with a $20 million term loan, and reviewing our holding and capital structure with a goal of optimizing our assets for shareholders. We have a strong rare disease product portfolio that carries the opportunity to expand metreleptin into new disease areas, and which we believe will deliver meaningful future sales growth. We remain focused on continuing to market important therapies that will bring value to our patients.”\nBusiness Update\nJUXTAPID : Novelion reported net revenues of JUXTAPID of $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, $8.6 million, or 64%, of which were from prescriptions written in the U.S.\nMYALEPT : Novelion reported net revenues of MYALEPT of $14.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, $9.8 million, or 69%, of which were from prescriptions written in the U.S.\nNovelion reported total consolidated net revenues of $27.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nNovelion ended the first quarter of 2018 with $52.0 million in unrestricted cash, compared with $55.4 million at the end of 2017. The $52.0 million includes proceeds from a $20.0 million term loan to Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Aegerion\") provided by affiliates of Sarissa Capital Management and Broadfin Capital LLC, as announced in March 2018.\nThe Company expects the opinion of the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) on the metreleptin marketing authorization application in the second quarter of 2018, followed by a mid-2018 European Commission approval decision.\nNovelion announced that a poster describing the results of a metreleptin study for weight loss in overweight and obese adults with low leptin levels will be presented at the American Diabetes Association’s 78 th Annual Scientific Sessions, which is being held from June 22 to June 26, 2018 in Orlando, Florida.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nGAAP total net revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $27.5 million compared to $30.0 million for the same period of 2017. GAAP net revenues for JUXTAPID in the first quarter of 2018 were $13.4 million compared to $16.0 million for the same period in 2017.

GAAP SG&A expenses were $23.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $24.5 million for the same period in 2017. GAAP R&D expenses were $11.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $9.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nOn a pro forma basis, during the first quarter of 2018, SG&A expenses were $21.6 million compared to $23.0 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in pro forma SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same period in 2017 was primarily related to a reduction in headcount and legal and consulting fees.\nOn a pro forma basis, during the first quarter of 2018, R&D expenses were $11.6 million compared to $9.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in pro forma R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same period in 2017 was primarily related to additional spending in certain clinical activities.\nGAAP net loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $32.8 million compared to GAAP net loss of $31.0 million during the same period in 2017.\nOn a pro forma basis, net loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $13.5 million, compared to a loss of $8.7 million for the same period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s consolidated unrestricted cash balance was $52.0 million, compared to $55.4 million at December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, there were18.7 million shares outstanding.

Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally, and to manage the Company's business and evaluate its performance. The non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning under GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release constitute “forward-looking statements” of Novelion within the meaning of applicable laws and regulations and constitute “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
