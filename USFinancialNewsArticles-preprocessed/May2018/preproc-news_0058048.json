GLOBAL MARKETS • The S&P 500 and the Dow eased on Friday after a steep drop in oil prices pressured energy stocks, but losses were limited by gains in chipmakers and retail stocks. • Asian shares fell and the euro slipped back to 6-1/2 month lows as early elections loomed in Italy, but a revival in diplomatic talks with North Korea and a retreat in oil prices from recent highs supported sentiment. • The euro struggled near a 6-1/2-month low against the dollar, as the bounce seen at the start of the week faded and investors took a grim view on the prospect of fresh elections in Italy. • U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest level in three weeks on Friday as concerns about Italy’s new government and a leadership challenge in Spain boosted demand for low-risk debt. • Oil prices were mixed in Asian trading, but remained under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more crude to ease a potential shortfall in supply. • Gold prices inched up after falling for the two previous sessions, but remained under pressure on hopes a U.S.- North Korean summit was back on track and as the U.S. dollar hovered near 6-1/2-month peaks.
