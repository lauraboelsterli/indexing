    "text": "(Reuters) - The European Union’s top diplomat said on Tuesday Communist-run Cuba could help broker fresh dialogue between the government and opposition in Venezuela, despite Havana’s frequent assurances the crisis afflicting its leftist ally was a sovereign matter.\nCuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini address a joint news conference after their meeting at the EU Council in Brussels, Belgium May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Federica Mogherini made the comments at a news conference in Brussels after hosting the EU’s first “joint council” with Cuba since the bloc dropped all sanctions on the island and agreed ona political framework within which to strengthen ties.\nThe EU has said it is now Cuba’s top trade and investment partner, and arguably plays a bigger role than traditional allies like Venezuela or Russia as the island implements market reforms to its centrally-planned economy.\nAnalysts say the EU has also taken advantage of U.S. indifference or a diplomatic vacuum, as the Trump administration backtracks on a fragile detente with Cuba.\nEuropean International Cooperation and Development Commissioner Neven Mimica, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez pose after a signing ceremony of a cooperation agreement at the EU Council in Brussels, Belgium May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “I personally believe that Cuba could play a positive role in trying to avoid further negative developments (in Venezuela) and trying to re-open and negotiate a political solution and dialogue,” Mogherini told joint news conference with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez.\nVenezuela will hold a presidential election on May 20 that the opposition coalition is boycotting, saying it is a farce intended to legitimize a “dictatorship” led by President Nicolas Maduro.\nSlideshow (3 Images) The Lima Group of largely Latin American nations on Monday urged the Venezuelan government to suspend the vote, calling the process “illegitimate and lacking in credibility.”\nCuba has played the role of broker in several disputes in recent years, notably hosting peace talks between the Colombian government and Marxist rebel groups it has been at war with for five decades.\nThe Cuban government has stood steadfast by Venezuela, denouncing foreign interference in its internal affairs, despite a sharp decline in subsidized Venezuelan oil shipments amid the OPEC nation’s economic crisis.\nThe EU has sent several high-level delegations to Cuba this year. First Mogherini visited, then a delegation from the European Investment Bank.\nThe bloc signed on Tuesday an agreement with Cuba to invest 18 million euros to help its achieve its ambitious goals in terms of developing renewable energy on the island.\nThe EU has said it will sign cooperation agreements worth 49 million euros in total.\nWriting by Sarah Marsh in Havana; Editing by Tom Brown\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
