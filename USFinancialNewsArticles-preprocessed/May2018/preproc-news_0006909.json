    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE: TPL) today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended March 31, 2018.\nResults for first quarter 2018:\nNet income of $43.8 million, or $5.60 per sub-share, for first quarter 2018, compared with $19.3 million, or $2.43 per sub-share, for first quarter 2017. Revenues of $60.0 million for first quarter 2018, compared with $30.4 million for first quarter 2017. Increases of 181.8% in water sales and royalty revenue, 150.7% in oil and gas royalty revenue, and 14.2% in easements and sundry income for first quarter 2018, compared with first quarter 2017.\nFurther Details for first quarter 2018:\nOil and gas royalty revenue was $26.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $10.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 150.7%. Crude oil and gas production subject to the Trust’s royalty interests increased 129.0% and 154.4%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. In addition, the prices received for crude oil production increased 13.5% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter of 2017 while prices received for gas production decreased 13.9% over the same time period.\nEasements and sundry income was $17.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 14.2% compared with the first quarter of 2017 when easements and sundry income was $14.9 million. This increase resulted primarily from increases in seismic permit income, sundry lease rental income, and temporary permit income. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in pipeline easement income of 15.8% to $8.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to timing differences resulting from a change in the form of our pipeline easement agreements.\nWater sales and royalty revenue was $13.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 181.8% compared with the first quarter of 2017 when water sales and royalty revenue was $4.8 million.\nLand sale revenue was $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2018. The Trust sold approximately 120 acres of land for an average price of approximately $22,917 per acre. There were no land sales in the first quarter of 2017.\nTexas Pacific Land Trust is not a REIT.\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
