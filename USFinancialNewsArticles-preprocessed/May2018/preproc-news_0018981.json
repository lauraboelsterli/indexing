    "text": "13 COMMENTS Hard-won experience has taught Washington to be skeptical of anything Pyongyang promises, especially about its nuclear program. It seems the lesson hasn’t been forgotten, given the skeptical bipartisan reaction to North Korea’s April 20 announcement that it is shutting down its nuclear testing program and halting its missile tests. And President Trump’s open and loud readiness to walk out of talks with Kim Jong Un is an encouraging sign that he won’t succumb to the wishful thinking that plagued his predecessors.\nThere will always be a temptation to proclaim that an unsatisfactory agreement is a great diplomatic triumph. The short-term political rewards of a bad “peace” deal are considerable. But Mr. Trump prides himself on his deal-making skills, and any agreement that lacks comprehensive verification mechanisms would be a failure.\nFortunately, John Bolton, the new national security adviser, is an expert in the tricky realm of arms-control verification. He understands that any flaws in an agreement will be exploited by America’s foes. Such problems will also find ready defenders in the international community.\nIn 1985 arms-control advocate Sidney Drell and his colleagues acknowledged: “The available evidence points to a Soviet reluctance to embrace the relationship of mutual deterrence with enthusiasm.” But, they continued, this does not “justify claims” that the Soviet Union broke the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, “or is preparing to do so in the near future.” Yet in 1989 the Soviet foreign minister admitted at the United Nations that his country was cheating on the agreement.\nThe credibility of any verification regime will depend not only on how intrusive and extensive it is but also on the will of the U.S. and its allies to enforce it. One way to do this would be to give the U.S., South Korea and Japan a binding right to cancel the agreement at any time. This would help ensure current sanctions would quickly “snap back” at the first sign of North Korean cheating.\nMr. Trump should not allow the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency to have a decisive role in judging whether an agreement to denuclearize North Korea has been violated. In April 2015 Mr. Bolton made the point that “U.N. inspectors have never found anything on their own other than what we’ve given them or others have given them in the form of intelligence.”\nTo succeed, the Trump administration must develop a plan to respond firmly and decisively to any North Korean cheating. This should include a prearranged agreement with as many allies as possible to cut off diplomatic as well as economic relations with Pyongyang. Another aspect of this response would be to have U.S.-based military units ready to reinforce South Korea in case a violation is detected.\nThe U.S. government must be ready to counter any claims—whether from North Korea, its apologists or even ostensible American allies—that any violations are insignificant. More than a few people and organizations in the arms-control community stand ready to help Mr. Kim if he cheats on an agreement.\nMr. Dinerman writes on space policy and national security.",
