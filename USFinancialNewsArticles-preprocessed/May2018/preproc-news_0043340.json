    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 18, After serving in the United States Marine Corp for 28 years, Rhett Jeppson retired from active and reserve service to join the Small Business Administration in 2012 and serve as Associate Administrator in the Office of Veteran Business Development, rising to acting Chief Operating Officer in 2014. In January of 2015, he was asked to reinvigorate the numismatic interest of Americans and given the title of Principal Deputy Director of the U.S. Mint. Early on, he was honored with a Presidential nomination, by President Barack Obama, to become the 39 th Director of the U.S. Mint and was subsequently approved by the Senate Banking Committee. However, as had become the norm since the last Senate-Approved Director left the Mint in 2011, partisan politics prevented the nomination from making it to the Senate floor for a vote.\nDuring his two years of leadership at the Mint, Jeppson managed to increase its profitability by more than $200 million annually, from the previous two years. In addition, he managed to reinvigorate collectors by:\novercoming lingering supply issues and returning the very popular Platinum American Eagle to production, celebrating the Mint's 225 th Anniversary with a $100 gold coin featuring the familiar allegorical figure of Liberty, presented for the first time as an African-American woman, selling out the entire 2016 American Liberty Silver Medal supply within six minutes of release, successfully cutting Mint production and operating costs, while maintaining a perfect delivery record, and successfully executing the Congressionally approved Silver American Eagle 30 th Anniversary celebratory modification of design, from the typical reeded edge, to a technically difficult lettered edge, noting the milestone.\nRhett Jeppson's life-long dedication to the service of America makes him a true American. Like everything else on his resume, his time at the U.S. Mint was intense, critical, and packed with accomplishments. Sharing his knowledge and experience with our clients and readers will no doubt be fascinating, but equally exciting is the fact that Rhett Jeppson has agreed to sign a limited number of gold and silver \"perfect\" PF70 American Eagle Proof coins and sets exclusively for American Bullion clients and readers. Like Rhett these coins and sets are a testament to American strength, determination, and resolve, making them a natural for any collectors interested in true Americana.\nContact: info@americanbullion.com\nView original content with multimedia: releases/rhett-jeppson-past-principal-deputy-director-of-the-united-states-mint-joins-the-american-bullion-business-team-300651376.html\nSOURCE American Bullion, Inc.",
