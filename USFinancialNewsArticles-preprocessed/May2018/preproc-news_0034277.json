Excluding the impact of such accounting changes, the revenue growth in Q1 under the previous accounting standards on revenue recognition would have been 30.3%. Excluding unrealized loss from fair value changes of equity securities of RMB136.7 million and share based compensation, adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) increased 47.5% year-over-year from RMB379.5 million to RMB559.7 million (US$89.2 million) for the first quarter of 2018.

To strengthen our partnership with AccorHotels, Huazhu had made a strategic investment of about 4.5% in AccorHotels and suggested a representation on the board of AccorHotels accordingly. This suggestion has been positively received by AccorHotels and shall be discussed further in the coming weeks. The Company provides guidance for Q2 2018 net revenues growth of 24 %-26% year over year, and revises upward the full year net revenues growth estimate ranges from 16%-19% to 18%-22% accordingly.\nSHANGHAI, China, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- China Lodging Group, Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) (“China Lodging Group”, “Huazhu” or the “Company”), a leading and fast-growing multi-brand hotel group in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter of 2018 Operational Highlights\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, China Lodging Group opened 127 hotels, including 7 leased (“leased-and-operated”) hotels and 120 manachised (“franchised-and-managed”) hotels and franchised hotels.\nThe Company closed a total of 56 hotels, including 5 leased hotels and 51 manachised and franchised hotels, during the first quarter of 2018. This was mainly due to:\na) The Company's strategic focus to upgrade the quality of the product and service. The Company closed 3 hotels for brand upgrade purposes and permanently removed 15 hotels from its network for their non-compliance with the brand and operating standards. These hotels were mainly under HanTing and Hi Inn brands. By removing hotels of lower quality, the Company is able to provide a more consistent customer experience, which will help enhance both the brands and future profitability.\nb) Property related issues, including rezoning and returning of military-owned properties, and expiry of leases, which resulted in the closure of 24 hotels.\nc) Operating losses from hotels located mainly in selected 3 rd or lower tier cities which resulted in the closure of 14 hotels.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had 673 leased hotels, 2,943 manachised hotels, and 201 franchised hotels in operation in 382 cities. The number of hotel rooms in operation totaled 384,959, an increase of 14.6% from a year ago.\nThe ADR, which is defined as the average daily rate for all hotels in operation, was RMB207 in the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB182 in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB211 in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase of 13.9% was due to both an increase in ADR of the mature hotels, as well as an increase in the proportion of midscale and upscale hotels with higher ADR in the Company’s brand mix. The sequential decrease resulted mainly from seasonality.\nThe occupancy rate for all hotels in operation was 83.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 83.9% in the first quarter of 2017 and 86.0% in the previous quarter. The occupancy rate almost remained flat year-over-year. The sequential decrease resulted mainly from seasonality.\nRevPAR, defined as revenue per available room for all hotels in operation, was RMB173 in the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB152 in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB181 in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase of 13.7% was attributable to higher ADR. The sequential decrease resulted mainly from seasonality.\nFor all hotels which had been in operation for at least 18 months, the same-hotel RevPAR was RMB165 for the first quarter of 2018, representing a 6.5% increase from RMB155 for the first quarter of 2017, with a 6.1% increase in ADR and a 0.3-percentage-point increase in occupancy rate. The economy hotels registered a 6.4% same-hotel RevPAR improvement, driven by a 6.1% increase in ADR and a 0.2-percentage-point increase in occupancy rate. The midscale and upscale hotels recorded a 6.5% same-hotel RevPAR improvement, driven by a 5.0% increase in ADR and a 1.0-percentage-point increase in occupancy rate. Crystal Orange Hotels will not be counted in the same-hotel RevPAR statistics until they are in the Huazhu system for 18 months.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s loyalty program had approximately 108 million members, who contributed approximately 76% of room nights sold during the first quarter of 2018 and approximately 87% of room nights were sold through the Company’s own direct channels.\n“We are excited to report a great start to the year. In the first quarter, same-hotel RevPAR grew by 6.5%, exceeding our expectation and reflecting the solid economic growth. Our fast expansion in mid- and upscale hotels are well on track. In the first quarter of 2018, our mid- and upscale room count increased by 92% year-over-year, and accounted for approximately 32% and 80% in total rooms in operation and in pipeline, respectively,” commented Ms. Jenny Zhang, Chief Executive Officer of China Lodging Group.\n“I’m also delighted to announce that we have made a strategic investment about 4.5% in AccorHotels to strengthen our partnership. Since our strategic alliance with AccorHotels in 2016, we have made efforts to expand the hotel network, enhance brand awareness and operational efficiencies. In the first quarter of 2018, Ibis and Mercure achieved same-hotel RevPAR growth of 14.5% and 12.6%, respectively,” added Ms. Zhang. “We have also engaged discussions with AccorHotels for a board representation. This has been positively received by AccorHotels and shall be discussed further in the coming weeks.”\nFirst Quarter of 2018 Financial Results\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted new revenue recognition standards and all prior year numbers are restated using the new standards. Please see the “Accounting Standards Update” section of this release for more information.\n(RMB in thousands) Q1 2017 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Revenues: Leased and owned hotels 1,226,644 1,716,259 1,575,977 Manachised and franchised hotels 379,150 495,851 508,792 Others 8,268 13,032 6,455 Net revenues 1,614,062 2,225,142 2,091,224 Net revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB2,091.2 million (US$333.4 million), representing a 29.6% year-over-year increase and a 6.0% sequential decrease. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to our hotel network expansion, improved blended RevPAR and the acquisition of Crystal Orange Hotels. The sequential decrease was due to seasonality.\nNet revenues from leased and owned hotels for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB1,576.0 million (US$251.2 million), representing a 28.5% year-over-year increase and a 8.2% sequential decrease.\nNet revenues from manachised and franchised hotels for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB508.8 million (US$81.1 million), representing a 34.2% year-over-year increase and a 2.6% sequential increase. Net revenues from manachised and franchised hotels accounted for 24.3% of the Company’s net revenues in the first quarter of 2018, up from 23.5% a year ago.\nOther revenues represent revenues generated from other than hotel businesses, which mainly include revenues from Huazhu mall and the provision of IT products and services to hotels, totaling RMB6.5 million (US$1.0 million) in the first quarter of 2018.\n(RMB in thousands) Q1 2017 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Operating costs and expenses: Hotel operating costs 1,199,226 1,623,449 1,506,035 Other operating costs 1,933 6,836 2,842 Selling and marketing expenses 48,902 98,464 65,826 General and administrative expenses 165,343 236,213 158,752 Pre-opening expenses 24,112 71,575 75,271 Total operating costs and expenses 1,439,516 2,036,537 1,808,726 Hotel operating costs for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB1,506.0 million (US$240.1 million), compared to RMB1,199.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing a 25.6% year-over-year increase. Total hotel operating costs excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB1,501.0 million (US$239.3 million), representing 71.8% of net revenues, compared to 74.0% for the first quarter in 2017 and 72.7% for the previous quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the percentage was mainly attributable to the improved blended RevPAR and the maturity of our leased and owned hotels.\nSelling and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB65.8 million (US$10.5 million), compared to RMB48.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB98.5 million in the previous quarter. Selling and marketing expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB64.7 million (US$10.3 million), or 3.0% of net revenues, compared to 3.0% for the first quarter of 2017 and 4.4% for the previous quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB158.8 million (US$25.3 million), compared to RMB165.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB236.2 million in the previous quarter. General and administrative expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB147.8 million (US$23.6 million), representing 7.1% of net revenues, compared with 9.5% of net revenues in the first quarter of 2017 and 10.0% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the one-off transaction costs related to Crystal Orange Hotels acquisition amounting to RMB46.2 million in first quarter of 2017.\nPre-opening expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB75.3 million (US$12.0 million), representing a 212.2% year-over-year increase and a 5.2% sequential increase. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to more midscale or upscale leased hotels being under construction in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 37 midscale and upscale leased hotels under construction, as compared to 15 as of March 31, 2017.\nIncome from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB306.6 million (US$48.9 million), compared to RMB173.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB231.2 million in the previous quarter. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, adjusted income from operations (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB323.7 million (US$51.6 million), compared to adjusted income from operation (non-GAAP) of RMB189.2 million for the first quarter of 2017 and RMB250.4 million for the previous quarter. The adjusted operating margin, defined as adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) as percentage of net revenues, for the first quarter of 2018 was 15.5%, compared with 11.7% in the first quarter of 2017 and 11.3% in the previous quarter. The improved year-over-year adjusted operating margin was mainly attributable to the improved blended RevPAR and increased proportion of manachised and franchised hotels.\nUnrealized loss from fair value changes of equity securities for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB136.7 million (US$21.8 million), mainly represents the unrealized loss from our investment in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, such as AccorHotels and Quanjude. According to ASU 2016-01 which was effective from January 1, 2018, we are required to reflect the unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes related to equity investment (except equity method investment) in net income. The unrealized losses from equity securities in the first quarter of 2018 were due to the lower share prices at end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to those at end of the fourth quarter of 2017. The unrealized gain (loss) will have a significant impact on our GAAP net income going forward. The closing share price of AccorHotels was EUR46.45 on May 11, 2018. Therefore, the unrealized gain on this AccorHotels investment in the second quarter up to May 11, 2018 would have been approximately RMB260 million.\nNet income attributable to China Lodging Group, Limited for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB128.5 million (US$20.5 million), compared to RMB152.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB225.7 million in the previous quarter. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and the unrealized loss from fair value changes of equity securities, adjusted net income attributable to China Lodging Group, Limited (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB282.3 million (US$45.0 million), representing a 67.6% year-over-year increase and a 27.9% sequential increase.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share/ADS. For the first quarter of 2018, basic earnings per share were RMB0.46 (US$0.07) and diluted earnings per share were RMB0.44 (US$0.07); basic earnings per ADS were RMB1.83 (US$0.29) and diluted earnings per ADS were RMB1.75 (US$0.28). For the first quarter of 2018, excluding share-based compensation expenses and unrealized loss from fair value changes of equity securities, adjusted basic earnings per share (non-GAAP) were RMB1.01 (US$0.16) and adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) were RMB0.96 (US$0.15); adjusted basic earnings per ADS (non-GAAP) were RMB4.02 (US$0.64) and adjusted diluted earnings per ADS (non-GAAP) were RMB3.85 (US$0.61).\nEBITDA (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB405.9 million (US$64.7 million), compared with RMB363.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB445.8 million in the previous quarter. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and unrealized loss from fair value changes of equity securities, adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB559.7 million (US$89.2 million), compared with RMB379.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 and RMB440.9 million for the previous quarter.\nCash flow. Operating cash inflow for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB420.2 million (US$67.0 million). Investing cash outflow for the first quarter was RMB4,023.3 million (US$641.4 million).\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company purchased 10.8 million shares of AccorHotels from public market at cash consideration of EUR489 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company held a total of 13.1 million AccorHotels shares representing 4.5% of the company. The purchase consideration of this investment amounted to EUR586.8 million, partly financed by a three-year share margin financing facility totaling EUR260 million.\nCash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had a total balance of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of RMB4,044.7 million (US$644.8 million).\nDebt financing. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had a total debt balance of RMB8,527.8 million (US$1,359.5 million) and the unutilized credit facility available to the Company was RMB830.0 million.\nAdoption of New Revenue Recognition Accounting Standards\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) on January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis in the condensed consolidated financial statements. As such, prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU 2014-09.\nThe most meaningful impacts of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 are as follows:\nUnder previous guidance, initial one-time franchise fee was recognized when the hotels opened for business and the Company had fulfilled its commitments and obligations. Upon adoption of new revenue standards the one-time franchise fee will be recognized over the term of the franchise contract.\nUnder previous guidance, the Company adopted the incremental cost model to account for customer loyalty program. The estimated incremental costs, net of the reimbursement received from the franchisees, are accrued and recorded as accruals for customer loyalty program as members accumulate points and are recognized as cost and expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Under new revenue standards, loyalty program is considered a separate performance obligation and the consideration allocated to the loyalty program will be recognized as revenue upon point redemption, net of any cost paid to the franchisees and other third parties.\nGuidance\nThanks to the better-than-expected growth in RevPAR outlook, the Company revised upwards the full year net revenues growth estimate from 16%-19% to 18%-22%. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects net revenues to grow 24%-26% year-over-year.\nThe above forecast reflects the Company’s current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nConference Call\nChina Lodging Group’s management will host a conference call at 9 p.m. ET, Monday, May 14, 2018 (or 9 a.m. on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 in the Shanghai/Hong Kong time zone) following the announcement.

Please dial in approximately 10 minutes before the scheduled time of the call.\nA recording of the conference call will be available after the conclusion of the conference call through May 22, 2018. Please dial +1 (855) 452 5696 (for callers in the US) or +61 2 9003 4211 (for callers outside the US) and entering pass code 6426629.\nThe conference call will also be webcast live over the Internet and can be accessed by all interested parties at the Company’s website, http://ir.huazhu.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited consolidated financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses the following non-GAAP measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: hotel operating costs excluding share-based compensation expenses; general and administrative expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses; selling and marketing expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses; adjusted income from operations excluding share-based compensation expenses; adjusted net income attributable to China Lodging Group, Limited excluding share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities; adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share and per ADS excluding share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities; EBITDA; and adjusted EBITDA excluding share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this release. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Company performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities that may not be indicative of Company operating performance. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Company performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used regularly by Company management in financial and operational decision-making. A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures excluding share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities is that share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities have been – and will continue to be – significant and recurring in the Company’s business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company believes that EBITDA is a useful financial metric to assess the operating and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes, given the significant investments that the Company has made in leasehold improvements, depreciation and amortization expense that comprise a significant portion of the Company’s cost structure. In addition, the Company believes that EBITDA is widely used by other companies in the lodging industry and may be used by investors as a measure of financial performance. The Company believes that EBITDA will provide investors with a useful tool for comparability between periods because it eliminates depreciation and amortization expense attributable to capital expenditures. The Company also uses adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA before share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities, to assess operating results of the hotels in operation. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities helps facilitate year-on-year comparison of the results of operations as the share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities may not be indicative of Company operating performance.\nThe company believes that unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of equity securities are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in periodic earnings.\nTherefore, the Company believes adjusted EBITDA more closely reflects the performance capability of hotels. The presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by other charges and gains considered to be outside the ordinary course of business.\nThe use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. Depreciation and amortization expense for various long-term assets (including land use rights), income tax, interest expense and interest income have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of EBITDA. Share-based compensation expenses and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted EBITDA. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of the results. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the depreciation and amortization, interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses, and unrealized gain (loss) from fair value changes of equity securities and other relevant items both in the reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and in the consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the performance of the Company.\nThe terms EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. GAAP, and neither EBITDA nor adjusted EBITDA is a measure of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When assessing the operating and financial performance, investors should not consider these data in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s net income, operating income or any other operating performance measure that is calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company’s EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA – or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies – since such other companies may not calculate EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as the Company does.\nReconciliations of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, to the consolidated statement of operations information are included at the end of this press release.\nAbout China Lodging Group, Limited\nChina Lodging Group, Limited is a leading hotel operator and franchisor in China.
