    "text": "(Reuters) - Ohio on Wednesday became the latest U.S. state to open its roads for testing self-driving vehicles, in a boost to a nascent industry that is facing heightened scrutiny over safety concerns.\nThe self-driving vehicles should meet safety requirements and comply with Ohioâ€™s traffic laws, Republican Governor John Kasich said in an executive order.\nAutonomous vehicle testing is also under way in Michigan, Pittsburgh, Arizona and California.\nCalls for more regulation for companies developing self-driving cars followed the death of a woman in March after being hit by an Uber SUV in Arizona.\nThe Ohio order mandates that the self-driving vehicles register with Drive Ohio, created by Kasich in January, and have designated operators to monitor the vehicles and report accidents.\nReporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
