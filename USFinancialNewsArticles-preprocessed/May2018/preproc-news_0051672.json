    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 2:44 AM / Updated 2 hours ago SoftBank to sell Flipkart stake to Walmart, first known Vision Fund divestment Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nTOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp ( 9984.T ) said on Wednesday it is selling its roughly 20 percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart [IPO-FLPK.N] to Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ), the first public divestment by its Vision Fund. The logo of Flipkart is seen on the company's office in Bengaluru, India, May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa\nWalmart said this month it will pay $16 billion for a stake of around 77 percent in Flipkart and there had been some uncertainty over whether the Japanese tech and investment giant would remain a shareholder.\nSoftBank did not disclose terms of the sale but this month CEO Masayoshi Son said its investment in the Indian firm was worth around $4 billion. The Vision Fund invested invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August last year.\nIt also did not comment on its reasons for cashing out. The Flipkart exit comes far more quickly than SoftBankâ€™s average investment duration of 13.5 years.\nThe Vision Fund has invested $30 billion in startups in the last year. Son, who, as of last May, has attracted $93 billion to his technology investment vehicle, said last week he is looking to start a new fund - potentially further upending the world of dealmaking.\nMajor investments by the fund include ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies, co-working space provider WeWork Cos and chip designer Arm Holdings.
