    "text": "MAYNARD, Mass., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQB) (“AquaBounty” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company focused on enhancing productivity in the aquaculture market and a majority-owned subsidiary of Intrexon Corporation (NYSE:XON), announces the Company’s financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial and Operational Summary:\nCompleted public offering of common shares and warrants, raising net funds of $10.6 million; received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to raise AquAdvantage ® Salmon at the Indiana facility; net loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, increased to $2.4 million from $2.1 million in the corresponding period of the previous year, reflecting pre-production costs at the Indiana farm site and commencement of R&D activities at the Rollo Bay hatchery; and cash and cash equivalents were $6.9 million (December 31, 2017: $0.5 million).\nAquaBounty previously announced that it had received FDA approval to raise AquAdvantage Salmon at its land-based contained facility near Albany, Indiana. However, the Company is currently prevented from importing its AquAdvantage Salmon eggs for the facility from Canada due to the existence of an “Import Alert” pending the FDA’s issuance of final labelling guidance for the product. The Company is fully prepared to comply with labelling requirements and hopes that this process will conclude in the near term.\nRonald Stotish, Chief Executive Officer of AquaBounty, stated: “In this quarter, we achieved our two main objectives of completing our public offering and receiving FDA approval for our Indiana farm site facility. We anticipate stocking the tanks in the coming months.”\nAbout AquAdvantage Salmon – AquAdvantage Salmon is an Atlantic salmon that has been bioengineered to grow to market size in about half the time of a traditional farmed Atlantic salmon. It improves the economics of producing salmon in land-based contained facilities. AquAdvantage Salmon is a healthy, environmentally sustainable alternative to imported farmed Atlantic salmon.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis press release contains within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
