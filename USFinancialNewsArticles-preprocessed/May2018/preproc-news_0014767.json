    "text": "In the midst of significant growth, CMG enhances the strength of its leadership team\nGLENDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Certified Management Group, LLC , the outsourced sales and marketing agency and brand management company that connects brands to consumers through independent segments of the food-away-from-home channel, today announced the appointment of Hal Kravitz as chairman of the CMG Board of Directors. Kravitz brings significant consumer packaged goods industry knowledge to CMG, with deep general management experience on the brand owner and distribution sides of the beverage business, and further enhances the caliber of CMG’s strong leadership team.\n“Hal is a respected leader with a wealth of expertise in marketing and brand management, finance and revenue management, sales and operations. His leadership background, network and business operations acumen will be invaluable to our clients and our company,” said CMG Founder Nick Karapetian. “He is the right individual to chair our board and to join us in steering CMG through its important next phase of growth.”\nKravitz joins CMG’s existing board members Nick Karapetian (founder of CMG), Diron M. Ohanian (director at Knapp, Petersen & Clarke, P.C.) and Armen Vartanian (founder of Oceanview Capital Partners, Inc.).\nKravitz is a member of the Celsius Holdings, Inc. Board of Directors and for the last three-and-a-half years served as CEO of AQUAhydrate. Before joining AQUAhydrate, Kravitz spent more than 30 years as an officer and leader at Coca-Cola, earning credentials in general management, strategy and planning, operations, sales, marketing, business development and revenue management. After serving as president of The Glaceau Division, he led the integration of the division into Coca-Cola North America (a division of The Coca-Cola Company). In August 2009, Kravitz was named senior vice president, franchise and commercial operations for the Glacéau Division, with oversight for brands including Powerade®, Fuze®, Vitaminwater® and Smartwater®. As SVP at Glacéau, Kravitz simultaneously served as director of customer governance in Coca-Cola North America’s Franchise Relations Group, where he worked with Coca-Cola Refreshments and the 69 independent Coca-Cola Bottlers on system alignment, customer management and go-to market strategy.\n“In the midst of a tremendous growth period for our company, Hal’s insight and experience will be essential as CMG continues to partner with brands seeking new growth in unconventional channels of trade,” said CEO Pete Slauer. “Hal is an influential leader within the beverage and consumer products industries. I’m thrilled to welcome him as our board chair.”\nIn recent years, CPG companies have reported lackluster growth in conventional grocery and mass retail. Many are recognizing that expanding beyond traditional channels is mission critical in the ongoing race to win the consumer. CMG leverages its national footprint and dedicated sales representatives to drive profitability for CPG brands in a broad array of market segments, with a focus on independent operators within the food-away-from-home channel.\n“I could not be more honored to join the CMG Board,” said Kravitz. “As a company, CMG is in the enviable position of being in the right place at the right time. Its talented leadership team has built a strong foundation and infrastructure for growth and is deeply committed to excellent customer service. I’m confident we’ll continue to develop innovative solutions that deliver revenue growth for consumer brands in independent channels of trade.”\nAbout Certified Management Group, LLC\nCertified Management Group LLC, founded in 2004 and based in Glendale, CA, is a rapidly growing outsourced sales and marketing company with a leading position across multiple segments of the food-away-from-home channel. As food-away-from-home consumption accelerates, and room to grow and innovate in conventional grocery and mass retail diminishes, CPG companies are investing capital and resources to pursue the significant growth opportunities that food-away-from-home-channeled customers collectively offer. CMG leverages its national footprint and unique solution to represent large-scale and emerging CPG brands in these highly fragmented, difficult-to-serve segments—connecting clients to tens of thousands of operators and distributors nationwide—and partnering with them to achieve relevant and sustainable growth for the future.
