Basic and diluted non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS 5 were RMB0.57 (US$0.09) and RMB0.54 (US$0.09), respectively, compared with basic and diluted non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS of RMB0.54 and RMB0.50 , respectively, for the same period of 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational Highlights\nTotal Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) 6 was RMB4,943.2 million, an increase of 66.2% year-over-year. Distribution GMV 7 was RMB535.9 million, a decrease of 7.6% year-over-year. Non-distribution GMV 8 was RMB4,407.3 million, an increase of 84.1% year-over-year.

This year’s theme was ‘Eyes on The Data’ and featured talks on big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. We are firmly focused on becoming the leading brand e-commerce business partner and technology development and solution services provider. We plan to continue investing in innovation to further strengthen our industry leading position and create greater value for our shareholders.”\nMr. Beck Chen, Chief Financial Officer of Baozun commented, “We delivered another strong quarter of growth with GMV increasing by 66.2% year-over-year. During this quarter, additional investments in innovation and productization were for RMB13.5 million. We believe the investments we are now making in innovation will enable us to expand our addressable market, further strengthen our long-term competitiveness, and provide more value to our brand partners over the long run.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal net revenues were RMB921.2 million (US$146.9 million), an increase of 14.5% from RMB804.9 million in the same quarter of last year.\nProduct sales revenue was RMB459.9 million (US$73.3 million), a decrease of 7.6% from RMB498.0 million in the same quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the transition of a leading electronics brand partner’s business from the distribution model to the consignment model in September 2017, which was partially offset by an increase in product sales revenue resulting from the increased popularity of brand partners’ products and Baozun’s increasingly effective marketing and promotional campaigns.\nServices revenue was RMB461.3 million (US$73.5 million), an increase of 50.3% from RMB306.9 million in the same quarter of last year. The increase was primarily attributable to the rapid growth of the Company’s consignment model and service fee model, and in particular, growth in sales from existing brand partners and the addition of new brand partners in the apparel category.\nTotal operating expenses were RMB892.8 million (US$142.3 million), compared with RMB789.5 million in the same quarter of last year.\nCost of products was RMB379.1 million (US$60.4 million), compared with RMB439.1 million in the same quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to the transition of a leading electronics brand partner’s business from the distribution model to the consignment model in September 2017 and improved margins from product sales, which were partially offset by higher costs associated with an increase in product sales revenue.\nFulfillment expenses were RMB210.6 million (US$33.6 million), compared with RMB132.4 million in the same quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in GMV contribution from the Company’s consignment model and warehouse rental expenses.\nSales and marketing expenses were RMB221.1 million (US$35.3 million), compared with RMB162.5 million in the same quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to the recruitment of additional online store operational staff and an increase in promotional and marketing expenses associated with Company-operated online stores.\nTechnology and content expenses were RMB50.3 million (US$8.0 million), compared with RMB28.8 million in the same quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to increased investments in innovation and productization, including recruitment of additional technology-focused staff.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were RMB32.3 million (US$5.2 million), compared with RMB27.2 million in the same quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in administrative, corporate strategy, and business planning staff.\nIncome from operations was RMB28.4 million (US$4.5 million), compared with RMB15.3 million in the same quarter of last year. Operating margin was 3.1%, compared with 1.9% in the same quarter of last year.\nNon-GAAP income from operations was RMB45.7 million (US$7.3 million), compared with RMB33.6 million in the same quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 5.0%, compared with 4.2% in the same quarter of last year.\nNet income attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. was RMB14.9 million (US$2.4 million), an increase of 40.8% from the same quarter of last year. Basic and diluted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS were RMB0.27 (US$0.04) and RMB0.25 (US$0.04), respectively, compared with basic and diluted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS of RMB0.20 and RMB0.18, respectively, in the same period of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. was RMB31.9 million (US$5.1 million), an increase of 10.7% from the same quarter of last year. Basic and diluted non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS were RMB0.57 (US$0.09) and RMB0.54 (US$0.09), respectively, compared with basic and diluted non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS of RMB0.54 and RMB0.50, respectively, in the same period of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had RMB709.3 million (US$113.1 million) in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment , an increase from RMB557.4 million as of December 31, 2017 primarily due to the collection of accounts receivable during the first quarter of 2018.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company expects total net revenues to be between RMB1,060 million and RMB1,100 million for the second quarter of 2018.\nWhile the Company is transitioning more of its business from the distribution model towards the non-distribution model, Baozun is providing quarterly guidance on services revenues. The Company expects services revenue to increase by over 50% on a year-over-year basis for the second quarter of 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss the earnings at 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, May 17, 2018 (7:30 p.m. Beijing time on the same day).\nDial-in numbers for the live conference call are as follows:\nInternational +852 3027 6500 U.S. Toll Free +1 855-824-5644 Mainland China Toll Free 8009-880563 Hong Kong 3027 6500 Passcode: 52759033# A telephone replay of the call will be available after the conclusion of the conference call through 11:59 p.m. Hong Kong Time, May 24, 2018.\nDial-in numbers for the replay are as follows:\nInternational Dial-in +852 3027-6520 U.S. Toll Free +1 646-982-0473 Passcode: 319290002# A live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Investor Relations section of Baozun’s website at http://ir.baozun.com/ .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating the Company’s business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess the Company’s operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations is income/(loss) from operations excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition. Non-GAAP operating margin is non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of total net revenues. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) is net income/(loss) excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition. Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income as a percentage of total net revenues. Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. is net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition. Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS is non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. divided by weighted average number of shares used in calculating net income per ordinary share multiplied by three.\nThe Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income/(loss) enable the Company’s management to assess the Company’s operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP measures facilitate investors’ assessment of the Company’s operating performance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc., and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company’s business and is not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income/(loss). Further, the non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. In light of the foregoing limitations, the non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS for the period should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to income/(loss) from operations, operating margin, net income/(loss), net margin, net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, “Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”\nSafe Harbor Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
