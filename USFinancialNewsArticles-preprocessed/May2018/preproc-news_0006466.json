Without a deal, Johnston Press said it would have to explore alternative refinancing and restructuring options.\nThe company’s shares were more than 9 percent higher by 1430 GMT but had halved in value since October.\nLiberum analysts said King would be regarded as a safe pair of hands who understands the company.\nKing, also a former BBC executive who joined the group in 2013 as CFO, takes the reins as the company looks to expand its online audience.\nDEFERRED BONUS Leading shareholder Custos Group, which had been trying to oust Chairman Camilla Rhodes and director Michael Butterworth, was critical of the outgoing chief executive.\n“I will initiate contact with the company again to sort out the mess that Ashley put the company into,” Custos Chief Executive Christen Ager-Hanssen told Reuters.\nCustos said in November it would push for the appointment of Scotland’s former nationalist first minister, Alex Salmond, as the publisher’s chairman\nJohnston Press declined to respond to Ager-Hanssen’s latest comments, while Highfield did not immediately respond.\nUnder Highfield, the company, which has more than 200 titles, acquired “i”, the cut-price sister paper of The Independent, two years ago to tap into its circulation revenue and advertising base.\nJohnston Press said Highfield previously decided to defer his 249,000 pound bonus, granted to him for achieving 2017 targets.\nA company spokesman said Highfield would not receive any payments from June 5 when he stands down, adding he would receive the deferred bonus payment only after the company’s restructuring.
