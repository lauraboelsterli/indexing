    "text": "SOLON, Ohio, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy Focus, Inc. (NASDAQ:EFOI), a leader in LED lighting technologies, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nNet sales for the first quarter of $4.7 million compared to $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit was $0.8 million, or 17.5 percent of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to gross profit of $0.6 million, or 13.7 percent in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 operating expenses of $3.2 million compared to $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter net loss of $2.4 million, or a loss of $0.20 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.5 million, or a loss of $0.39 per share, from the first quarter of 2017. Increased demand for our industry leading battery backup RedCap™ product, resulting in additional “pull through” of other TLED products. First quarter sales generated by our agents increased 29.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 Increased penetration in previously underserved Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Mid-South and Western regions, now supported through our sales agency model, resulting in a sequential quarter-over-quarter sales growth of 174%.\nDr. Ted Tewksbury, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, “Q1 was a transitional quarter. We continued to focus on the fundamental drivers which will power our turnaround – sales and new products. While revenue was disappointing, our sales agents penetrated new and underserved geographies, growing agency revenue by 29% sequentially. Customers are enthusiastically adopting our game-changing RedCap™ emergency backup battery, pulling through sales of our TLEDs. While revenue is a lagging indicator, we have stabilized the decline and believe we’re on the cusp of a recovery in 2018.”\nA further breakdown of net sales is shown below (in thousands):\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Commercial products $ 2,205 $ 3,079 Military maritime products 2,454 1,027 Total net sales $ 4,659 $ 4,106 Financial Results:\nNet sales of $4.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 increased 13.5 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017. Net sales of our commercial products decreased 28.4 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the timing of our customers’ projects and installation schedules. Sales of military products experienced a quarter-over-quarter increase of 138.9 percent, reflecting the timing and fulfillment of U.S. Navy awards during the first quarter of 2018 and our distributor’s ability to satisfy first quarter 2017 demand out of their existing inventory.\nGross profit was $0.8 million, or 17.5 percent of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to gross profit of $0.6 million or 13.7 percent for the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales is the result of improved manufacturing variances and efficiencies partially offset by changes in product mix, principally within our military product sales, continuing our efforts to liquidate inventory previously identified as excess.\nOperating loss, loss from continuing operations and net loss was $2.4 million for the quarter, or a loss of $0.20 per share, compared to operating loss, loss from continuing operations and net loss of $4.5 million, or a loss of $0.39 per share, in last year’s same period.\nAt March 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $10.2 million, compared to $10.8 million at December 31, 2017. Net cash used in operating activities of $0.7 million in 2018 compared to $1.6 million in 2017. Net cash used in operating activities results from the net losses incurred, adjusted for non-cash items, including: depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, the adjustment to the excess inventory reserve, and changes in working capital.\nDr. Tewksbury concluded, “We continue to receive strong interest in our military-tough, flicker-free, longest lifetime tubular LEDs by healthcare, educational and other demanding commercial, industrial and military customers. We’ll be introducing three new technologies and product families at LIGHTFAIR in May which will reinforce our industry leadership in LED retrofit solutions. While we are experiencing increasing pricing pressure and gross margin headwinds, we believe that the strength of our new products and nationwide sales force position us to grow revenue, profitability and shareholder value.”\nEarnings Conference Call:\nEnergy Focus, Inc. will host a conference call and webcast on May 2, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. ET to review the first quarter 2018 financial results, followed by a Q & A session.

These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, include adjustments for our restructuring expenses.\nWe believe that our use of non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies within the industry by isolating the effects of items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and Board of Directors evaluate our operating performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace U.S. GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n(In thousands) Three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Total operating expenses $ 3,226 $ 5,076 Less: Restructuring credits (expenses) 50 (674 ) Total operating expenses, excluding restructuring $ 3,276 $ 4,402 Three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net loss $ (2,390 ) $ (4,522 ) Add: Restructuring credits (expenses) (50 ) 674 Net loss, excluding restructuring $ (2,440 ) $ (3,848 )\nSource:Energy Focus, Inc.",
