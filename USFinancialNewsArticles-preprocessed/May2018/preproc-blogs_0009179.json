Oil prices extended gains on Tuesday, supported by comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he was sure U.S. President Donald Trump would do \"the right thing\" in reviewing Iran's nuclear deal with western powers.\n* Wall Street fell on Monday as healthcare stocks slid and investors worried about rising costs for companies as oil prices rose, although the major indexes eked out a gain in April to snap a two-month losing streak\nDATA/EVENT AHEAD (GMT)\n1400 U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI Apr 1400 U.S. Construction spending Mar U.S. Federal Reserve starts two-day monetary policy meeting\nGrains prices at 0226 GMT\nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 508.50 -2.00 -0.39% +2.01% 482.43 74 CBOT corn 400.50 -0.25 -0.06% +0.50% 392.49 69 CBOT soy 1046.50 -2.00 -0.19% -0.92% 1046.46 50 CBOT rice 13.05 -$0.02 -0.15% +0.35% $12.95 42 WTI crude 68.67 $0.10 +0.15% +0.84% $66.01 64\nCurrencies\nEuro/dlr $1.207 $0.000 -0.03% -0.45% USD/AUD 0.7536 0.001 +0.07% -0.59%\n(Reporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath)",
