    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 8:03 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago FireEye reports smaller loss as shift to subscription model pays off Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMay 2 (Reuters) - FireEye Inc reported a smaller quarterly loss on Wednesday as the cybersecurity firm gained from an ongoing transition to a subscription-based model.\nFireEye is pivoting to a subscription-based model from its traditional business that centered around the sale of hardware boxes to boost recurring revenue and shore up margins.\nThe subscription and services business rose 7.6 percent to $165.5 million in the first quarter ended March 31, above analysts’ expectation of $163.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n“Our newer products and cloud offering will continue to drive significant growth,” Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mandia said.\nThe Milpitas, California-based company has been involved in investigating some of the biggest cyber attacks, including the massive data breach at consumer credit agency Equifax Inc .\nFireEye reported adjusted billings of $175.1 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $170.3 million.\nBilling includes revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue, which are an important indicator of the health and visibility of a company’s business.\nThe company’s net loss narrowed to $71.8 million, or 39 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $77.2 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company lost 4 cents per share.\nTotal revenue rose about 8 percent to $199.1 million.
