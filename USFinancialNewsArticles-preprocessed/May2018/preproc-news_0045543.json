The downward revision comes in the wake of a string of disappointing economic indicators spanning everything from retail sales and industrial activity to consumer sentiment.\nEconomic Policy Secretary Fabio Kanczuk said the cut reflected weakness in services and nondurable goods consumption in the first quarter. Spending on durable goods and investments remained “extremely strong,” he added, a sign of a consistent upward trend.\nThe government raised its forecast for 2019 growth to 3.3 from 3 percent. $1 = 3.66 reais Reporting by Marcela Ayres; Writing by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Will Dunham",
