    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 2:46 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Jay-Z ordered to testify next week in U.S. SEC investigation Jonathan Stempel , Brendan Pierson 3 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York federal judge on Tuesday ordered Jay-Z to testify on May 15 in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission involving the sale of the rapper’s Rocawear clothing brand to Iconix Brand Group Inc. Shawn \"JAY-Z\" Carter speaks after being honored during the 2018 Pre-GRAMMY Gala & GRAMMY Salute to Industry Icons presented by Clive Davis and The Recording Academy honoring Shawn \"JAY-Z\" Carter in Manhattan, New York, U.S., January 27, 2018. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\nAt a hearing in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe said Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, had failed to respond to SEC subpoenas served on him November and February, despite the agency’s repeated efforts to schedule a time for him to testify.\n“The testimony has been delayed for five months, and I do not intend to tolerate any further delay,” he said.\nJay-Z was represented at the hearing by his lawyer, Alex Spiro, and did not appear himself. Spiro and lawyers for the SEC did not say where the testimony would take place.\nThe SEC filed a petition last week to enforce its subpoenas against Jay-Z.\nJay-Z sold Rocawear to Iconix in 2007 for about $204 million. The SEC has said it is looking into writedowns totaling this sum, $169 million in 2015 and $34.6 million in 2017, that Iconix took in connection with Rocawear.\nJay-Z said in a court filing on Monday that forcing him to testify at length would “impair the work of many individuals and entities” preparing for an upcoming world tour and hinder his own preparation.\nHe also said that his testimony would not be relevant to the investigation.\nGardephe disagreed, saying at Tuesday’s hearing that the agency had a “legitimate purpose” in seeking to interview Jay-Z.\nThe judge declined to impose a one-day time limit on the testimony, as Jay-Z requested in Monday’s court filing, saying that a time limit could be an incentive to “waste time” and “run out the clock.”\nSpiro said after the hearing that he was “pleased” with the outcome and declined to comment further.\nJay-Z is famous for songs including “Hard Knock Life,”“99 Problems” and “Big Pimpin’”.\nHe has won 21 Grammy Awards, most recently in 2015 for Best R&B song and Best R&B performance for “Drunk in Love” with his wife, pop star Beyonce.\nHis most recent album, “4:44,” was nominated for eight Grammys but did not win any.
