    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GNS Healthcare (GNS), a leading precision medicine company, announced the appointment of Dr. Ted Goldstein, Scientific Program Director of Computational Health of University of California, San Francisco, to its Strategic Advisory Board (SAB). Concurrently, Dr. Goldstein is an assistant professor of Hematology/Oncology at UCSF. In these roles he is responsible for developing a comprehensive cancer model using machine learning from genomic tests, electronic health records, and model data.\nDr. Goldstein is a technological innovator and has had a long career in Silicon Valley. Previously he was Vice President of Developer Tools at Apple, where he led the team that created the Mac OS X and iOS systems and the Xcode developer tools for Apple's Intel, iPhone, and iPad products. Prior to Apple, he led the electronic commerce and smart card efforts at Sun Microsystems, where he created Java Card, used for ecommerce, federal identification and medical information, and most SIM chips in mobile phones and bank cards.\n\"Throughout his career, Ted has been on the cutting edge of technology. We are excited to have his expertise and innovative mindset as we continue to build and expand our precision medicine products,\" said Colin Hill, Chairman, CEO and co-founder of GNS Healthcare. \"We are on the precipice of making precision medicine a reality, and I can't think of a better time for Ted to join our Strategic Advisory Board.\"\nDr. Goldstein earned his doctorate in bioinformatics and biomolecular engineers from University of California, Santa Cruz in 2013, where he earlier completed his bachelor's degree in computer and information sciences.\n\"The advancements in technology over the past decade have been remarkable both in terms of speed and complexity,\" said Goldstein. \"GNS is a machine learning pioneer and is tackling some of healthcare's most difficult questions.
