    "text": "Fairfax, VA, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bob Fortna, president, Fortinet Federal Inc., has been elected to serve as AFCEA International’s vice chairman of the board of directors. In this role, he will assist DeEtte Gray, chairwoman of the board of directors, in the performance of her duties, including general supervision over the affairs of AFCEA. When the chairwoman is unavailable, the vice chairman presides at the meetings of the council, the board of directors and the Executive Committee. Fortna also will serve as the vice chairman of the AFCEA Budget and Finance Committee.\nFortna has been an AFCEA member for more than 15 years. He has supported the association as a member of the board of directors and Executive Committee and served as chairman of the AFCEA Audit Committee.\n“Now more than ever, it’s crucial that public, private and academic sectors collaborate to advance global IT and cybersecurity issues and innovation,” Fortna says. “As a long-standing member of AFCEA, it’s an honor to join the leadership team and help foster communication among these groups on matters of national security.”\nCurrently, in addition to being the president of Fortinet Federal Inc., Fortna is a member of Fortinet Federal Inc. board of directors. Previously, he was the president of Government Industry Consulting LLC, a consulting business set up to drive success for businesses involved in the federal marketplace. With more than 25 years of federal industry leadership experience, he provided active engagement in strategic and go-to-market planning, execution and growth to his clients. Prior to his work with Government Industry Consulting, Fortna was the vice president for Juniper Network’s Defense Sector and the senior federal industry leader in organizations such as Enterasys Networks, Avaya and Nortel Networks. He began his career with IBM in the federal division in Bethesda, Maryland.\nFortna has an MBA from Southern Illinois University and a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from the University of Maryland College Park. He has spent his career leading, educating and motivating large teams in pursuing competitive public and federal sector business opportunities.\nLt. Gen. Bob Shea, USMC (Ret.), AFCEA’s president and CEO, is looking forward to continuing to work with Fortna. “I’ve had the pleasure of working with Bob during my tenure as president. As a member of our Audit Committee, he has been instrumental in improving our fiscal posture, and he has been a source of tremendous insight and guidance. I’m most confident he will continue to provide innovative leadership in his role as vice chairman,” Gen. Shea states.\n###\nAFCEA International , established in 1946, is a non-profit membership association serving the military, government, industry and academia.
