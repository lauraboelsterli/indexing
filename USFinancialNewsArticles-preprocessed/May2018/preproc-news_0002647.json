    "text": "TORONTO, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- North American Palladium Ltd. (\"NAP\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:PDL) (OTC PINK:PALDF) today announced the financial and operational results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 2018 Results Summary\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the first quarter of 2018 was $28.4 million compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2017. Net income was $5.6 million this quarter compared to a net loss of $3.8 million for the same period in 2017. Underground production was 569,468 tonnes (6,327 tonnes per day) at an average grade of 3.3 grams per tonne compared to 363,136 tonnes (4,035 tonnes per day) at an average grade of 4.4 grams per tonne in the first quarter of 2017. Initial production commenced from the Sheriff Pit this quarter and totaled 127,940 tonnes at a grade of 1.27 grams per tonne. Underground mining cost per tonne in the first quarter decreased to $39 compared to $56 in the same period in 2017. Total tonnes milled increased to 1,021,147 in the quarter compared to 458,382 tonnes in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the return to full-time milling, supplemented by increased underground production, Sheriff Pit ore and additional surface stockpile tonnage. The Company produced 57,053 ounces of payable palladium at an All-Inclusive Sustaining Cost 1 (\"AISC\") of US$709 per ounce compared to 40,252 ounces of palladium in 2017 at an AISC of US$765.\n\"Our operational and financial key performance indicators improved significantly this quarter compared to this time last year. Underground production has become consistent, reliable and predictable, and should continue to gradually increase this year as we bring more of the lower grade reserves in the upper part of the mine back into production. This quarter we began initial production from the Sheriff Pit, which is expected to produce higher grade material in the second half of the year. Total mill throughput also continued to increase this quarter. All of this indicates further performance improvements throughout 2018,” said Jim Gallagher, President and CEO of North American Palladium.\n“The recently announced drill results from our Lac des Iles and regional exploration programs highlight the quality and quantity of targets generated from our extensive property holdings. In addition, we recently commenced resource delineation drilling of the Offset South zone, which is our most immediate opportunity to add to the Lac des Iles mineral inventory. We are also seeing positive results from our Greenfields exploration efforts that remain focused on the discovery of another Lac des Iles-type palladium deposit.”\n“Palladium prices have shown good resilience to recent financial market volatility driven by trade and sanction concerns. The continuing strength in palladium prices reflects the fundamental supply deficit that still exists, with growing automotive demand and flat global supply,” continued Mr. Gallagher.\nOperating Highlights Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Ore mined (tonnes) Underground 569,468 363,136 Surface (stockpile and open pit) 480,916 77,600 Total 1,050,384 440,736 Mined ore grade (Pd g/t) Underground 3.3 4.4 Surface 1.0 1.0 Milling Tonnes milled (dry metric tonnes) 1,021,147 458,382 Palladium recoveries (%) 79.9 82.6 Palladium concentrate grade (g/t) 263 295 Tonnes of concentrate produced 7,162 4,496 Production cost per tonne milled 1 $ 47 $ 70 Payable production Palladium – ounces 57,053 40,252 Other results 1 Underground cost per tonne mined $ 39 $ 56 AISC per ounce of palladium produced (US$) 1 $ 709 $ 765 Cash cost per ounce of palladium sold, net of by-product revenues (US$) 1 $ 567 $ 627 Financial Highlights Three months ended March 31, (expressed in millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 Revenue $ 86.6 $ 44.3 Smelting, Refining, Freight and Royalty 3.9 2.1 Royalty Expense 3.6 2.2 Net Revenue 79.1 40.0 Operating Expenses Production Cost Mining 30.1 23.9 Milling 12.3 6.8 General and Administration 6.1 5.9 Inventory and Other Cost (0.1 ) (4.7 ) Total Production Costs 48.4 31.9 Depreciation and Amortization 12.0 8.1 Inventory price adjustment - (0.2 ) Loss on disposal of equipment 0.10 0.1 Total Mining Operating Expenses 60.5 39.9 Income (loss) from Mining Operations $ 18.6 $ 0.1 Net Income (loss) $ 5.6 $ (3.8 ) Net Income (loss) per share $ 0.1 $ (0.07 ) Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 28.4 $ 6.8 Capital Investment, Excluding Non-Cash Leases $ 12.5 $ 16.3 Adjusted EBITDA 1 for the quarter was $28.4 million compared to $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the quarter was $5.6 million compared to a loss of $3.8 million in 2017. Revenue for the quarter was $86.6 million compared to $44.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The higher revenue in the quarter was primarily due to an increase in palladium prices and payable palladium sold.\nTotal production cost for the quarter before inventory and other cost adjustments was $48.5 million ($47 per tonne milled) compared to $36.6 million ($80 per tonne milled) in the first quarter of 2017. Cash provided by operations prior to changes in non-cash working capital for the quarter was $23.8 million compared to $6.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nThe AISC per ounce of palladium produced decreased to US$709 per ounce for the quarter, compared to US$765 per ounce in the first quarter of 2017. Sustaining capital expenditures in the first quarter were $8.6 compared to $7.0 in 2017. Cash costs for the quarter were US$567 per ounce sold, compared to US$627 per ounce sold in Q1 2017.\nFinancial Liquidity\nAs at March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $20.7 million compared to $18.1 million for the same period in 2017. During the quarter, the Company extended the term of its US$60 million credit facility to December 31, 2018. At quarter end, the Company had total debt of $102.9 million compared to $123.3 million for the same period of 2017. As at April 15, 2018, the Company had credit available of US$14 million under the Company’s credit facility.\nExploration\nExploration expenditures were $3.8 million for the quarter, compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2017. The increased costs are attributable to an increase in greenfields exploration and drilling activity at the recently acquired Sunday Lake project.\nA total of 14,067 metres of drilling was completed in the quarter. This includes 6,264 metres of underground and surface drilling at Lac des Iles mine (“LDI”), 5,582 metres of drilling at the Sunday Lake project and 2,221 metres of drilling at the Legris Lake project. Results from these programs were announced in the Company’s March 27, 2018 , April 3, 2018 and April 5, 2018 news releases.\nIn the second quarter, the Company plans to complete resource definition and conversion drilling on the Offset South zone. Additional drilling programs at LDI will test underground targets near the Offset zone and near surface targets in the eastern part of the mine property. NAP expects to provide an update to its LDI mineral resource estimate later this year. Preparations are ongoing for a several month field program of trenching, mapping, geophysical surveying and surface prospecting on selected greenfields properties.\nFurther updates on exploration activities will be provided as significant, new results become available.\nOutlook\nThe Company's previously stated 2018 guidance of palladium production between 230,000 and 240,000 ounces of palladium at an average AISC cost of US$640-660 per ounce remains unchanged.\nShareholder Information\nThe complete condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the related management’s discussion and analysis can be found on NAP’s website at www.nap.com , and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nThe Company invites you to join its webcast and conference call on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.
