FILE PHOTO - Commander of the U.S. European Command Curtis M. Scaparrotti speaks during his presentation for Finnish National Defence Course Association in Helsinki, Finland August 9, 2017. Lehtikuva/Mikko Stig via REUTERS\nGeneral Curtis Scaparrotti, head of U.S. European Command and NATO’s supreme allied commander, said deterrence of Russia was one of his central tasks.\nResources currently focused on counter-terrorism may need to be redirected, Scaparrotti told reporters after a meeting with chiefs of defense from across Europe.\n“In terms of the force structure...in each of our domains, there are additions that I need,” he said.\nBoosting U.S. forces in specific air, land and sea areas “would help me do a better job of deterring Russian and set us in a better place to understand how Russia operates,” he said.\nScaparrotti said the U.S. military had enough airborne early warning and control aircraft in Europe, but he had requested other additional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance planes given the terrain and other specific needs.\nThe general said he spoke with other military leaders about the need to better coordinate their counter-terrorism efforts to free up resources that could be used to respond to growing challenges posed by Russia and China.\n“We’ve got a lot of resources focused on counter-terrorism and some of these resources are going to have to shift,” he said.\nThe military meeting capped three days of political and military discussions at the U.S. Army’s headquarters in Wiesbaden, near Frankfurt, to focus on changing threats, progress on information-sharing, and efforts to better coordinate among their respective government agencies.\nScaparrotti said improved information-sharing within the U.S. government and among allies in Europe over the past year had helped authorities thwart many potential attacks.
