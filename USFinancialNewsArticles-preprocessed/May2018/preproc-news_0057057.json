    "text": "ROME, May 28 (Reuters) - Italy’s president will meet former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli at 1130 local (930 GMT) on Monday, a presidential spokesperson said, amid speculation that Cottarelli would be asked to head a stopgap government.\nPresident Sergio Mattarella is summoning Cottarelli to his office after the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League abandoned plans to form a ruling coalition in protest at Mattarella’s veto of their proposed economy minister.
