    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- North American Risk Services, Inc. ( NARS ) has hired Randy Wallace as its Director of Catastrophe and Service Partnership Management. In this role, Randy will oversee NARS’ organizational response in the event of a catastrophic event (CAT), test capabilities, and enhance procedures. Based in the Irving, TX office, he will lead a CAT Command Center which will house dedicated CAT adjusters.\n“As our team reflected on the 2017 CAT season, we felt that we should dedicate more resources to CAT handling and to separate it completely from our daily claims operations. We are pleased to have someone with Randy’s level of expertise to refine our procedures and to facilitate the best possible response to any catastrophe,” said Robert Ruryk, NARS President and CEO.\nOver Randy’s 26-year career, he has served as a property adjuster and supervisor for large insurance carriers. As Catastrophe Line Manager for Travelers, Randy was involved in redesigning their National Catastrophe Response Team, growing it from 30 CAT adjusters to over 200. More recently, Randy served as the Director of Property Claims at AmTrust Financial.\nRandy shared, “I chose the property line of business as my career over 25 years ago and, for the last 15 years, CAT has been my passion. My goal is to enhance the deployment and CAT management strategies already in place at NARS, while keeping the customer experience at the forefront.”\nRandy has additional experience in Training, Quality Assurance, and Branch Management. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration from the University of North Texas.\nAbout NARS\nNorth American Risk Services, Inc.
