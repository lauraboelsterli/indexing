(NASDAQ:UMRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of cellular immunotherapies based on its novel, universal Antibody-Coupled T-cell Receptor (ACTR) technology platform, today reported financial results and provided a corporate update for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and recent activities.\n“Following our successful initial public offering in April 2018 and concurrent private placement, we are in a strong financial position to continue developing our proprietary, universal ACTR technology platform and rapidly advancing our pipeline of cellular immunotherapies through clinical development,” said Chuck Wilson, CEO of Unum. “We are currently evaluating the potential of ACTR in combination with different tumor-targeting antibodies, in three ongoing multi-center Phase I trials, ATTCK-20-2 and ATTCK-20-03 evaluating ACTR087 and ACTR707, respectively, in combination with rituximab in patients with CD20+ r/r Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), and ATTCK-17-01 evaluating ACTR087 in combination with SEA-BCMA in patients with r/r multiple myeloma. We expect to report preliminary data from these three trials late this year. In the second half of 2018 we also look forward to filing an IND and initiating clinical development of ACTR707 in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with HER2+ advanced cancers, our first solid tumor product candidate.”\nRecent Business Highlights and Outlook\nSuccessfully Completed IPO and Concurrent Private Placement: In April, 2018, Unum successfully completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 5,985,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share, including the exercise by the underwriters of 215,000 shares of their overallotment option, raising $66.8 million in net proceeds. In addition, with a private placement concurrent with the IPO, Seattle Genetics, Inc. purchased $5.0 million shares of common stock at the initial public offering price. The proceeds from the IPO and the concurrent private placement will be used primarily to advance Unum’s four lead ACTR development candidates.\nInitiated Cohort Expansion Phase of ATTCK-20-2 Phase I trial; Plans to Expand Clinical Development: In May 2018, Unum initiated the cohort expansion phase of the ATTCK-20-2 trial evaluating safety and anti-lymphoma activity of ACTR087 at the preliminary recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) level used in combination with rituximab in patients with CD20+ r/r NHL. Unum expects to report updated data, including preliminary data from this phase of the ATTCK-20-2 trial, in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThese data will also inform the strategy for a planned multi-center Phase II clinical trial exploring ACTR T cells used in combination with rituximab in patients with CD20+ r/r NHL who received prior CD19 CAR T cell therapy.\nIn addition, Unum intends to file a protocol amendment to the ATTCK-20-2 trial in the second half of 2018 to explore ACTR087 in combination with an alternative rituximab dosing regimen from that currently being studied. Preclinical experiments have shown that the level of ACTR T cell activity depends upon the amount of the co-administered antibody. As such, ACTR087 safety and anti-tumor activity in combination with rituximab in CD20+ r/r NHL may be even further optimized by an alternative rituximab regimen. Testing the alternative regimen will complement the clinical data being generated to support additional clinical trials with the combination.\nInitiated Patient Enrollment and Dosing in ATTCK-17-01 Phase I trial: In the first quarter, Unum initiated patient enrollment in ATTCK-17-01, a Phase I, multi-center, open-label clinical trial designed to test the safety, tolerability, and anti-myeloma activity of ACTR087 used in combination with SEA-BCMA in patients with r/r multiple myeloma. Unum is currently enrolling and dosing patients in this trial and expects to report preliminary data in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nContinued Enrollment in ATTCK-20-03 Phase I trial: In the fourth quarter of 2017, Unum initiated patient enrollment in a Phase I, multi-center, open-label clinical trial called ATTCK-20-03, evaluating the safety, tolerability, and anti-lymphoma activity of ACTR707 used in combination with rituximab in patients with CD20+ r/r NHL. Unum has completed enrollment in the first dose level of this ongoing dose escalation study and expects to report preliminary data from the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nOn Track to File IND for First Solid Tumor ACTR Product Candidate in the Second Half of 2018: Unum is on track to file an IND in the second half of 2018 for ACTR707 in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with HER2+ advanced cancers.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCollaboration Revenue: Collaboration revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, of $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively, reflects the recognition of a portion of the $25.0 million upfront payment received from Seattle Genetics under Unum’s collaboration agreement as well as reimbursements of research and development costs by Seattle Genetics. Effective January 1, 2018, Unum adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, which changed the manner in which the Company recognizes revenue from this collaboration agreement.\nR&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $8.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $7.0 million for the same period last year. The increase reflects higher clinical trial costs for the three active Phase I clinical trials, as well as increased personnel-related costs, materials and facility-related costs related to scaling manufacturing processes, and increased consultant costs. This was partially offset primarily by a decrease in consulting and manufacturing costs incurred for the Phase I clinical trial of ACTR087 in combination with rituximab as there was no production activity in the first quarter of 2018.\nG&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $1.1 million, compared to $0.9 million for the prior year period.\nNet Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $6.8 million, or $0.66 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and $6.0 million, or $0.58 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: As of March 31, 2018, Unum had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $32.4 million. This amount does not include the approximately $66.8 million in net proceeds from its IPO in April 2018, $5.0 million from the concurrent private placement, and available borrowings under its loan and security agreement of $15.0 million. The Company believes that the net proceeds from the IPO and concurrent private placement, together with its existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, will fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least December 2019, without considering available borrowings under its loan and security agreement.\nAbout Unum Therapeutics\nUnum Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel immunotherapy products designed to harness the power of a patient’s immune system to cure cancer.
