    "text": "OAKDALE, Minn., GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc. (OTCQX: GLAE) (\"GlassBridge\", the \"Company\" or \"we\") today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nOverview\nIn the last earnings release, we discussed the issues related to our partially owned Nexsan business and our strategy to turn the business around. We are pleased to announce that our strategy was successfully implemented and that Nexsan has returned to profitability in the first quarter of 2018. \"I am extremely proud of our Nexsan team. Despite all the challenges, this resilient team has executed on every aspect of our plan. Not only did we significantly reduce operating cost, we also grew revenue and improved gross margin from Q4 2017. Just as importantly, we have begun to execute on our innovative approach to managing and protecting cloud storage, a tremendous growth opportunity. Utilizing Nexsan's proven proprietary technology is an integral component of this plan,\" said Danny Zheng, GlassBridge Interim CEO and Nexsan CEO. \"While a return to profitability is the first milestone in our journey, we are fully aware of the competitive landscape and the many challenges still ahead. We will continue to leverage Nexsan's competitive advantages across all of our product lines to generate cash, invest in the business and grow. This will allow GlassBridge to preserve cash and focus on its core asset management business.\"\nOver the past year, we have repositioned the resources of the Company to develop and grow our asset management business. In addition to our technology-focused alternative asset management business driven by quantitative trading strategies, we have also focused on venture capital and investment opportunities, including through our strategic partnership called \"ARRIVE\" with Primary Venture Partners and Roc Nation, a global sports and entertainment management organization. In our asset management business, we seeded the first investment vehicle managed by our investment adviser subsidiary GlassBridge Asset Management, LLC (\"GBAM\"). We believe that ongoing improvements within the quantitative trading space - and the growing sophistication related to processing large quantities of market data - allow us to remain well-positioned to capture assets looking to benefit from our investment strategy. GlassBridge continues to engage in discussions with a number of strategic investors regarding our product offerings, and we have had some success curating our multiple sub-strategies into a product designed to match an investor's needs. We continue to endeavor to work towards examining other distribution platforms, including liquid alternatives in the U.S. and abroad. We will continue to grow the asset management business in a measured way moving forward. In addition, \"ARRIVE\" has led to a number of proprietary business opportunities and transactions that have already added value to GlassBridge, and we will continue to evaluate and pursue opportunities arising out of this partnership.\nOverview of Financial Results\nGlassBridge's revenue for Q1 2018 was $9.4 million, down 2.1 percent from Q1 2017. Revenue generated by our Nexsan business was $9.3 million and revenue generated by our asset management business was $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. Our gross margins improved from 45.8 percent in Q1 2017 to 52.1 percent in Q1 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined by $3.7 million, or 41.6 percent year-over-year. Operating loss from continuing operations decreased from $7.5 million in Q1 2017 to a loss of $1.6 million in Q1 2018. The current quarter loss was due to the asset management business and corporate expenses, offset by the profit from our Nexsan business. Loss from discontinued operations decreased from $2.0 million in Q1 2017 to a loss of $0.4 million in Q1 2018. Our cash balance and short term investments totaled $8.4 million as of March 31, 2018.\nDetailed Q1 2018 Results\nThe following financial results are for the current and prior period unless otherwise indicated. Included within the following financial results are our continuing operations, including the corporate holding company, our asset management business and our partially-owned data storage business accounted for using the variable interest entity method as further described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018.\nNet revenue for Q1 2018 was $9.4 million, down 2.1 percent from Q1 2017. The revenue was mostly related to our Nexsan business. The revenue decline was primarily a result of our effort to optimize investment in sales and marketing, which was scaled back by approximately 33% year-over-year.\nGross margin for Q1 2018 was 52.1 percent, a 6.3 percent increase from Q1 2017. The increase was primarily driven by production differentiation and product mix change.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in Q1 2018 were $5.2 million, down 41.6 percent from Q1 2017. The decrease was primarily due to corporate cost reductions and cost reductions for our partially-owned data storage business.\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses in Q1 2018 were $1.2 million, compared to $2.5 million in Q1 2017. The decrease was primarily due to eliminating investment in Transporter technology, which did not generate sufficient return, and headcount reductions.\nGBAM Fund expenses were $0.1 million in Q1 2018 compared to none in Q1 2017. GBAM Fund expenses include general and administrative expenses for our investment vehicle launched at the end of the second quarter in 2017.\nOperating loss from continuing operations was $1.6 million in Q1 2018 compared to a loss of $7.5 million in Q1 2017, mostly driven by improvements in our Nexsan business and lower corporate general and administrative expenses.\nNet loss from GBAM Fund activities were $0.1 million in Q1 2018 compared to none in Q1 2017. Net gain (loss) from GBAM Fund activities include income or loss associated with our proprietary investment in GBAM fund, which was launched at the end of the second quarter in 2017.\nIncome tax provision was $0.1 million in Q1 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.1 million in Q1 2017. The change in the income tax provision was primarily related to foreign subsidiary income tax accruals.\nDiscontinued operations had a loss (after tax) in Q1 2018 of $0.4 million compared with a loss (after tax) of $2.0 million in Q1 2017. The decrease was primarily due to reduction in legal and consulting costs. Discontinued operations include the results of the IronKey business, which was divested in February 2016, and the legacy businesses that we substantially wound down by the first quarter of 2016.\nNet loss excluding noncontrolling interest was $1.7 million for Q1 2018 compared to a net loss of $7.8 million in Q1 2017.\nLoss per share from continuing operations attributable to GlassBridge common stockholders was $0.25 in Q1 2018 compared with a loss per share of $1.41 in Q1 2017 based on weighted average shares outstanding of 5.1 million and 4.1 million, respectively (adjusted to give effect to the February 2017 1:10 reverse stock split).\nCash and short-term investments were $8.4 million (including $1.1 million cash of our variable interest entity as further described in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018) as of March 31, 2018, down by $1.1 million during Q1 2018, primarily driven by operating loss and litigation settlement payment.\nWebcast and Replay Information\nA teleconference is scheduled for 10:00 AM Eastern Time today, May 15, 2018, and will be available on the Internet on a listen-only basis at:\nhttps://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1401/25872\nA digital recording of this teleconference will be available for replay at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 15, 2018 and will be accessible via the replay number listed below until May 22, 2018.\nFor your convenience, you will also be able to access the recording online at:\nhttps://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1401/25872\nDigital Recording Replay Numbers:\nU.S. Toll Free:\n877-344-7529\nInternational Toll:\n412-317-0088\nCanada Toll Free:\n855-669-9658\nReplay Access Code:\n10120415\nAll remarks made during the teleconference will be current at the time of the call and the replays will not be updated to reflect any subsequent developments.\nDescription of Tables\nTable One -- Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nTable Two -- Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nTable Three -- Supplemental Segment and Product Information\nTable Four -- Additional Information\nAbout GlassBridge Enterprises\nGlassBridge Enterprises, Inc.
