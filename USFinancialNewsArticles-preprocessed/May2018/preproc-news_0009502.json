(NYSE:ARE) announced financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKey highlights\nIncreased common stock dividend\nCommon stock dividend for 1Q18 of $0.90 per common share, up 7 cents, or 8%, over 1Q17; continuation of our strategy to share growth in cash flows from operating activities with our stockholders while also retaining a significant portion for reinvestment.\nImprovement in credit rating outlook\nIn February 2018, S&P Global Ratings raised its credit outlook for our corporate credit rating to BBB/Positive from BBB/Stable. The positive outlook reflects S&P's belief that \"there is further ratings upside over the next couple of years stemming from the company's high quality operating portfolio and projects under development, combined with a prudent financial policy.\"\nStrong internal growth\nTotal revenues of $320.1 million, up 18.2%, for 1Q18, compared to $270.9 million for 1Q17; Same property net operating income growth: 4.0% and 14.6% (cash basis) for 1Q18, compared to 1Q17; Continued solid leasing activity and strong rental rate growth, in light of modest contractual lease expirations at the beginning of 2018 and a highly leased value-creation pipeline:\n1Q18\nTotal leasing activity – RSF\n1,481,164\nLease renewals and re-leasing of space:\nRental rate increases\n16.3%\nRental rate increases (cash basis)\n19.0%\nRSF (included in total leasing activity above)\n234,548\nKey leases executed during 1Q18 (included in total leasing activity above): Property\nSubmarket\nRSF\nTenant\n1655 and 1725 Third Street\nMission Bay/SoMa\n593,765\nUber Technologies, Inc.\nSummers Ridge Science Park\nSorrento Mesa\n192,070\nQuidel Corporation\n399 Binney Street\nCambridge\n123,403\nThree life science entities\n279 East Grand Avenue\nSouth San Francisco\n104,013\nVerily Life Sciences, LLC\n681 Gateway Boulevard\nSouth San Francisco\n60,963\nTwist Bioscience Corp.\nStrong external growth; disciplined allocation of capital to visible, multiyear, highly leased value-creation pipeline\nDevelopment and redevelopment projects placed into service in 1Q18: 91,155 RSF at our development project at 100 Binney Street in our Cambridge submarket, 100% leased to four high-quality biotechnology entities; and 27,315 RSF at our redevelopment project at 266 and 275 Second Avenue in our Route 128 submarket, leased to Visterra, Inc. Significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $76 million, of which $60 million will commence through 4Q18 ($35 million in 2Q18, $13 million in 3Q18, and $12 million in 4Q18). This is related to initial free rent granted on development and redevelopment projects recently placed into service (and no longer included in our value-creation pipeline) that are currently generating rental revenue. 1Q18 commencements of development and redevelopment projects aggregating 651,951 RSF, including: 593,765 RSF at 1655 and 1725 Third Street in our Mission Bay/SoMa submarket; and 58,186 RSF at 704 Quince Orchard Road in our Gaithersburg submarket. 81% leased on 2.3 million RSF of development and redevelopment projects undergoing construction (excludes RSF in service).\nCompleted strategic acquisitions\nAcquisitions completed or under contract:\nIn 1Q18, we acquired 11 properties in four transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $320.5 million with current and future value-creation development and redevelopment opportunities.\nOperating results\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard which requires us, on a prospective basis, to generally present our equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.

In March 2018, we settled 843,600 shares from our forward equity sales agreements and received proceeds of $100.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and adjustments provided in the forward equity sales agreements. We expect to receive proceeds of $713.7 million upon settlement of the remaining outstanding forward equity sales agreements, to be further adjusted as provided in the sales agreements, which will fund current and near-term value-creation projects and acquisitions in 2018.\nCorporate responsibility and industry leadership\n50% of annual rental revenue expected from LEED ® certified projects upon completion of nine in-process projects. Two of our properties recently received LEED certifications, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability: In March 2018, 505 Brannan Street in our Mission Bay/SoMa submarket received LEED Platinum certification; and In April 2018, 100 Binney Street in our Cambridge submarket received LEED Gold certification. In January 2018, we were awarded a 2017 Governor's Environmental and Economic Leadership Award, California's highest environmental honor recognizing entities that have demonstrated exceptional leadership and made notable contributions to conserving precious natural resources while promoting economic growth. In January 2018, Alexandria Venture Investments launched the Alexandria Seed Capital Platform, an innovative seed-stage life science funding model and extension of Alexandria LaunchLabs ® , which provides seed-stage financing to transformative life science companies. Alexandria Seed Capital Platform drives the growth of seed- and early-stage companies in New York City and across the country. In February 2018, Joel S. Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder, was appointed to the Navy SEAL Foundation board of directors. In February 2018, Menlo Gateway in our Greater Stanford submarket was awarded \"Development of the Year\" by NAIOP San Francisco at its \"Best of the Bay\" awards event. In March 2018, we announced elevations of key executive officers, effective in April 2018.\nSubsequent events\nDuring April 2018, we sold 782,967 shares of common stock under our at-the-market common stock offering program (\"ATM program\") for $122.20 per share and received net proceeds of $94.2 million. In April 2018, our real estate joint venture at Menlo Gateway in our Greater Stanford submarket closed a secured construction loan with commitments available for borrowing of $157.3 million, for the development of Phase II of the project.
