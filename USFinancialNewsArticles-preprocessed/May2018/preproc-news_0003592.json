    "text": "May 4, 2018 / 8:23 AM / Updated 35 minutes ago India's Flipkart approves $15 billion stake sale to Walmart-led group: Bloomberg Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart’s board has approved a deal to sell an equity stake of about 75 percent in the company to a group led by Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ) for about $15 billion, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.

Chinnappa/File Photo\nSoftBank ( 9984.T ) will sell its 20-plus percent stake as part of the deal, Bloomberg said, adding Google’s parent Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL.O ) was likely to participate in the investment with Walmart.\nA final close of the deal is expected within 10 days, although deal terms could still change and a deal isn’t certain, Bloomberg reported.\nFlipkart and Alphabet did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment.\nEarlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported that Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) has made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart. Amazon, which is Flipkart’s biggest rival in India, declined to comment on that report. Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman",
