    "text": "BARCELONA, Spain, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nGlobal venture capital firm Eight Roads Ventures has led a $12m Series B extension\nRed Points , the Barcelona headquartered IP Protection SaaS company, today announces an additional investment extension round of $12m. Eight Roads Ventures joins existing investors Mangrove and Northzone. This follows the announcement of a Series B round in January 2018, which was led by Northzone.\n(Photo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/688298/Red_Points_Online_Brand_Protection.jpg )\nRed Points has continued to experience rapid growth since its Series B round of investment and will add global scaling expertise by partnering with Eight Roads Ventures, a global venture capital firm which recently announced a $375m European fund for scale-ups. Eight Roads Ventures has offices in the UK, U.S., China, Japan and India, and its near 50-year history of investing includes partnerships with companies such as Alibaba, Appsflyer, Made.com , Wallapop and Xoom.\nFor Laura Urquizu, the Red Points' CEO, the addition of Eight Roads Ventures reinforces Red Points' strong prospects in a sector that is being disrupted by technology. \"Together with Mangrove and Northzone, Eight Roads Ventures is an essential ally in our fight for a world where brands can rely on technology to solve their problems with counterfeits, piracy and other forms of brand abuse. The fact that we've managed to attract VCs with strong experience in ecommerce and content platforms is because they too understand the importance of a technology solution in a space that has traditionally been dealt with by law firms.\"\nDavor Hebel, Managing Partner and Head of Eight Roads Ventures Europe, said: \"Red Points tackles important issues of counterfeiting and copyright infringement for SMEs and enterprises through its best-in-class SaaS platform. The company is exactly the kind we like to invest in, scaling fast and with the ambition and product to become a global industry leader. We look forward to working closely with this talented team and leveraging our global platform and experienced operators to support their development.\"\nThe announcement of the new round was made together with the nomination of David Waroquier as Red Points' new Chairman. David Waroquier assumes the position previously occupied by Josep Coll, who originally founded Red Points.\nThe decision was taken in consideration of the significant growth of Red Points and its next stage of business and technology development. \"Red Points wouldn't be the success story we know today if it wasn't for Josep Coll's contribution,\" comments Urquizu. \"We've taken the joint decision that David Waroquier's international experience and its firm, Mangrove's, expertise in growing world leading SaaS companies such as Wix and WalkMe will help Red Points consolidate and develop its unique positioning in the intellectual property protection market.\"\nAbout Red Points\nRed Points is a technology company that provides the smart solution for brands and content owners to counterfeiting online and digital piracy.
