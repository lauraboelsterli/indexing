    "text": "BERLIN, May 3 (Reuters) - Volkswagen is pondering spin-offs of non-core assets such as motorcycle maker Ducati and transmissions maker Renk, its new chief executive said, as the group seeks to boost its efficiency and become more nimble.\n“For non-core businesses such as Ducati, Renk and (large engines unit) MAN Diesel & Turbo, we will draw up sustainable future perspectives,” Herbert Diess said on Thursday at the carmaker’s annual shareholder meeting in Berlin.\nThe deliberations could lead to steps to expand those businesses and to develop growth strategies, but spin-offs “are also conceivable”, Diess said, without being more specific.\n$1 = 0.8333 euros Reporting by Andreas Cremer Editing by Maria Sheahan\nOur ",
