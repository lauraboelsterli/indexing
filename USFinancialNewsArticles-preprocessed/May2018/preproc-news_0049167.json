Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 31.4% year-over-year to RMB383.8 million (US$61.2 million). Non-GAAP net loss was RMB23.8 million (US$3.8 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a Non-GAAP net loss of RMB226.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. As of April 30, 2018, Tuniu added 51 new offline retail stores during the year. As of April 30, 2018, Tuniu had 21 local tour operators in total, including 7 newly launched local tour operators in China [4] during April.\nMr. Donald Dunde Yu, Tuniu's co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"As the leading online leisure travel company in China, we have developed a comprehensive sales network that allows us to efficiently acquire customers through various channels at different departure cities. With a solid foundation established through our sales network, our next step is to replicate the expansion model to our service network at destinations. As China's consumption power continues its upward trend, Chinese travelers are demanding better services and experiences. We believe that many of these demands are still unmet and there continues to be an opportunity for Tuniu to provide products and services consistent with current demands through its service network.\"\nMs. Maria Yi Xin, Tuniu's Chief Financial Officer, said, \"During the first quarter, we were able to continue reducing our net loss. The development of our sales network served a vital role in the reduction of our sales and marketing expenses. Tuniu's new retail model continues to gain traction as customers acquired through our offline retail stores contributed more than 10% of our packaged tour GMV for the first time during this quarter. With our blended user acquisition cost declining from the expansion of our sales network, and bargaining power increasing from the development of our service network, Tuniu's operational efficiency will continue to scale in the future.\"\n1.

Other revenues were RMB77.9 million (US$12.4 million) in the first quarter of 2018, representing a year-over-year decrease of 22.2% from the corresponding period in 2017.

Research and product development expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 17.5% in the first quarter of 2018, decreasing from 35.0% in the corresponding period in 2017.
