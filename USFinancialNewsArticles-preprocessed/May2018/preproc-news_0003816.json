    "text": "Conference Call Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Qumu Corporation (NASDAQ: QUMU) today reported financial results ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter revenue was $4.8 million, compared to $6.7 million in the first quarter 2017, and net loss was $(4.5) million, or $(0.48) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(3.6) million, or $(0.39) per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017. First quarter adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was negative $(2.9) million, compared to $(1.9) million 2017. The first quarter year over year revenue comparison was negatively impacted by approximately $184,000 due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASC Topic 606) as well as the loss of a large customer, representing revenue of approximately $800,000 in the current quarter, which was previously announced as lost in Q4 2017. In January, the Company replaced its existing debt with a $10.0 million credit agreement to strengthen its balance sheet, provide additional cash for operations and provide increased financial and operating flexibility through a covenant package more suitable to its business.\n\"These numbers do not yet reflect the positive momentum that is building at Qumu,\" said Vern Hanzlik, Qumu’s President and CEO. \"As we execute on our strategic plan, we are beginning to see a resurgence of opportunities with prospects, customers and channel partners. Our sales leadership and marketing efforts have increased both the quality and quantity of our inbound opportunities. As a result, our pipeline is strong and we are aggressively pursuing these opportunities. We also added three new partners, extending our global footprint and vertical industry reach. Meanwhile, our existing partners, including AT&T, British Telecom, Pexip, Pinnaca and iStudy are working directly with us to enhance lead generation and closing deals.\"\nOther Financial Highlights\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company closed a $10.0 million credit agreement with ESW Capital, LLC. After repayment of the outstanding principal, interest, fees and expenses associated with the refinancing, the Company increased net cash by $805,000. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.6 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $7.7 million as of December 31, 2017, reflecting the first quarter operating loss offset by cash proceeds from refinanced debt and changes in working capital. Total headcount was 106 as of March 31, 2018 compared to 121 as of December 31, 2017 and 145 as of March 31, 2017. Additionally, in the first quarter, the Company took action to reduce annualized non-headcount related costs by approximately $1.5 million. Subscription, maintenance and support revenue 2018 of $4.0 million, compared to $4.8 million 2017, was negatively impacted in the quarter by approximately $184,000 from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASC Topic 606) as well as the loss of a large customer representing approximately $800,000 in revenue in the first quarter which was previously announced as lost in Q4 2017. Gross margin 2018 of 56.3%, compared to 61.5% 2017, was unfavorably impacted by fixed amortized prepaid royalties for embedded OEM licenses and lower perpetual license revenue in the quarter. BriefCam, Ltd., in which the Company has a $3.1 million investment reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements at cost basis, recently announced 100% revenue growth in 2017, the release of its next generation video content analytics platform and receipt of Security Today's 2018 Platinum Govie Award for video analytics. During Q2 2018, the Company secured a $2.2 million total booking with a major healthcare provider in the U.S.\nThe Company is reiterating its previously issued financial guidance for the full year 2018. Core bookings growth is expected to be 25% in 2018, emphasizing growth in sales of the Qx platform. Revenue for 2018 is expected to be approximately $25 million, which includes an approximately $1.1 million unfavorable revenue impact due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASC Topic 606) in 2018, as well as the loss of a large customer in the fourth quarter 2017, representing revenue of approximately $3.2 million annually. Gross margin is expected to be in the mid to high 60s. Adjusted EBITDA loss for 2018 is expected to be approximately $(3.5) million. The Company expects to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 excludes stock-based compensation of approximately $1.0 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $2.1 million, depreciation expense of approximately $0.5 million, income tax benefit of approximately $0.2 million, and interest expense of approximately $2.0 million. Net loss for 2018 is expected to be approximately $(9.0) million.\nConference Call\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call and webcast to review its first quarter 2018 results tomorrow, May 2, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The dial-in number for the conference call is 877-456-6914 for domestic participants and 929-387-3794 for international participants. Investors can also access a webcast of the live conference call by linking through the investor relations section of the Qumu website, www.qumu.com . Webcasts will be archived on Qumu’s website.\nNon-GAAP Information\nTo supplement the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, the Company uses adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure), which excludes certain items from net income (loss) (a GAAP measure). Adjusted EBITDA excludes items related to interest income and expense, the impact of income-based taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liability, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-operating income and expenses.\nThe Company uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating the Company’s performance. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides supplemental information that allows investors to review the Company's results of operations from the same perspective as management and the Company's board of directors. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only for understanding our operating results. The non-GAAP results should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nSee the attached Supplemental Financial Information for a reconciliation of net loss, a GAAP measure, to adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
