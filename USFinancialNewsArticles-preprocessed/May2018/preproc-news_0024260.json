    "text": "Lizzy Gurdus: CNBC Digital Producer Published 11:42 AM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 Updated 3:09 PM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 CNBC.com\n\"My name is Lizzy Gurdus and I'm a digital producer at CNBC.\nMy time here goes back to the 2016 Business News Associate Workshop in Washington, D.C. The workshop was key to helping me understand the culture, the environment here at CNBC. \"From participating in a hands-on breaking news workshop with some of CNBC's top brass, to hearing about their experiences first-hand, I realized just how much knowledge and responsibility working here could give me.\"\nAfter some time in the newsroom, writing breaking news and covering top business and political figures, I became a digital producer on one of CNBC's flagship shows Mad Money with Jim Kramer.\nI've learned, grown, and flourished with CNBC, and I have the workshop to thank for that.\" Business News Associate Workshop at #AAJA18 | Houston | Aug 10 ",
