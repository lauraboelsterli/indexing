    "text": "Achieved gross margin from continuing operations of 15% Generated $7.1 million of cash from operating activities in continuing operations\nIRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Power Equipment Group Inc. (OTC:GLPW) (“Global Power” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. First quarter 2017 results include Hetsco Inc., which was divested on January 13, 2017.\nAs previously reported, the Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments have been classified as discontinued operations and, accordingly, the results for those segments are presented as such. Results of continuing operations are presented as a single segment comprised of the former Services segment (or “Williams”) and corporate operations, unless otherwise noted.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue from continuing operations was $43.1 million compared with $45.6 million in the prior-year period. Excluding revenue from the Hetsco divestiture and a reserve reversal from first quarter 2017, revenue increased 8% in the first quarter 2018. Loss from continuing operations for the 2018 first quarter improved to $2.2 million, or $(0.12) per share, compared with $11.6 million, or $(0.67) per share, for the corresponding 2017 period. Total net loss was reduced to $4.0 million, or $(0.22) per share, compared with $16.8 million, or $(0.97) per share, for the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the first quarter 2018 was $0.4 million compared with $(8.8) million for the first quarter 2017. See NOTE 1—Non-GAAP Financial Measures in the attached tables for important disclosures regarding Global Power's use of Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nTracy Pagliara, President and CEO of Global Power, noted, “The momentum in our business that began late last year has continued into 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, our backlog and pipeline of opportunities continued to grow and, as previously reported, we resolved several important contingencies. In addition, our operating performance is improving. We achieved 15% gross margin in the quarter, which underscores our earnings power potential. We also continue to aggressively implement our plan to achieve an annualized general and administrative expenses run rate of approximately $14 million to $18 million by the end of 2018. We expect to achieve this plan by incurring restructuring costs of approximately $8 million to $12 million in 2018.\n“Importantly, we are also making progress on the sale of the Koontz-Wagner business and have received multiple bids. In addition, our Houston facility operations have been stabilized. Our goal remains to have the Koontz-Wagner divestiture completed by the end of June. Of note, the potential sale of Global Power and/or Williams has been eliminated from consideration as a strategic alternative at this time. In the meantime, we are diligently moving forward on our initiatives to recapitalize our balance sheet with new asset-based and restructured term loans. We believe that a strengthened balance sheet, coupled with the improving operational performance of our business and substantially reduced general and administrative costs, will position our Company for future growth and profitability.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results Review (Discussion is regarding continuing operations and compared with the corresponding period in 2017 unless noted otherwise)\nFirst Quarter 2018 Revenue Bridge\n(in millions) $ Change % Change First quarter 2017 revenue $ 45.6 Project revenue 3.1 6.8 % Divestiture of Hetsco (1.2 ) (2.6 )% Reserve release for liquidated damages in Q1 2017 (4.4 ) (9.6 )% Total change (2.5 ) (5.5 )% First quarter 2018 revenue $ 43.1 Revenue for the quarter was down $2.5 million. However, when first quarter 2017 revenue is adjusted for the $1.2 million reduction in revenue from the divestiture of Hetsco in January 2017 and the benefit of the reversal of a $4.4 million liquidated damage contingent liability reserve, revenue improved 8%. The $8.4 million increase from construction activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4 more than offset declines from fewer non-recurring projects and the timing of a nuclear outage.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Gross Profit Bridge\n(in millions) $ Change First quarter 2017 gross profit $ (1.5 ) Project revenue and incremental margin (0.1 ) Divestiture of Hetsco (0.6 ) Estimated contract losses 13.1 Reserve release for liquidated damages in Q1 2017 (4.4 ) Total change 8.0 First quarter 2018 gross profit $ 6.5 Gross profit increased $8.0 million to $6.5 million and was 15% of revenue. Last year’s first quarter was negatively impacted by $13.1 million of new or revised estimated losses on three projects, which was partially offset by $4.4 million related to the release of the contingent liability reserve discussed previously, which had no associated costs.\nOperating expenses for the 2018 first quarter were down $3.2 million including a $1.6 million reduction of restatement expenses related to the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2018, labor-related expenses decreased $0.7 million and stock-based compensation expense decreased $0.5 million. Furthermore, other expenses decreased $0.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in professional fees related to strategic alternative activities.\nInterest expense decreased $0.3 million on lower average debt balances.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s operating activities, including discontinued operations, provided $2.2 million of cash. The Company’s liquidity remains constrained as a result of continued losses, inconsistent cash flows from operations and constraints on borrowing additional amounts for short-term working capital needs or issuing additional standby letters of credit.\nOutlook\nAt March 31, 2018, backlog was $150.1 million up from $137.7 million at the end of 2017. The increase in construction activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4 and new contract awards contributed to the larger backlog.\nMr. Pagliara concluded, “While our liquidity position remains a challenge, we are confident in our ability to resolve that issue as we press forward with the sale of the Koontz-Wagner business, our restructuring plans and the ultimate recapitalization of our balance sheet. We have a strong and diverse pipeline of opportunities, including the potential for nuclear decommissioning projects, gaining more scope at Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4 and adding new customers. We are also expanding our operations into Canada and the oil and gas industry while pursuing opportunities with analog to digital controls conversions.”\nWebcast and Teleconference\nThe Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 22, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (9:00 a.m. Central).

A reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided below.\nCONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Net loss-continuing operations $ (2,238 ) $ (11,625 ) Add back: Depreciation and amortization expense 221 335 Gain on sale of business and net assets held for sale — (239 ) Interest expense, net 1,378 1,701 Restatement expenses 130 1,720 Stock-based compensation 194 721 Income tax expense (benefit) 285 (1,838 ) Bank restructuring costs — 200 Severance costs 14 151 Asset disposition costs 326 36 Franchise taxes 65 76 Adjusted EBITDA-continuing operations 375 (8,762 ) Adjusted EBITDA-discontinued operations (1,706 ) (2,635 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,331 ) $ (11,397 ) NOTE 1—Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of our net loss before interest expense, net and income tax (benefit) expense and unusual gains or charges. It also excludes non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization. The Company’s management believes adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes and unusual gains or charges (stock-based compensation, restatement expenses, asset disposition costs, gain on sale of business and net assets held for sale, bank restructuring costs, loss on sale-leaseback and severance costs), which are not always commensurate with the reporting period in which such items are included. Global Power’s credit facility also contains ratios based on EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or as a better measure of liquidity than net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, and, therefore, should not be used in isolation from, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180521005944/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nKei Advisors LLC\nDeborah K.
