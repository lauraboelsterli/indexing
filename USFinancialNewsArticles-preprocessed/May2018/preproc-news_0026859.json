REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo “They asked us for time until Sunday and on Sunday we expect an answer,” the source said.\nThe two groups, which are hostile to European Union budget restrictions, entered into negotiations on Wednesday just as a swift return to the polls looked inevitable after 9 weeks of stalemate following an inconclusive election.\nReporting by Massimiliano Di Giorgio, writing by Gavin Jones; editing by Crispian Balmer\n ",
