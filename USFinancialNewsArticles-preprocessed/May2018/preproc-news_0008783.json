The number of aircraft with its Global Xpress service installed rose to 245 at the end of the first quarter, from 194 at the end of last year.\n“The in-flight connectivity business Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) is now close to break even and operating free cash is improving significantly - that is something investors have been concerned about,” Pearce said.\nInmarsat said in March it would not slow investment in in-flight connectivity, despite some risks to cash flow from a separate contract with a U.S. company that uses its airwaves.\nThe company kept its outlook, targeting mid-single digit revenue growth on average over the next five years, unchanged from March.\n$1 = 0.7352 pounds Editing by Susan Fenton and Adrian Croft\n ",
