Here’s essential reading on today’s developments.\nMUST READS FROM WSJ CITY\nPhoto: European Pressphoto Agency\nThe US and China have agreed on the broad outline of a deal that would save imperilled Chinese telecom giant ZTE, according to people with knowledge of the matter in both countries. The deal comes as the two sides move closer to resolving their trade dispute, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest close since early March.\nThere are two great times to make money in stock markets: the postcrash rebound and the end-of-cycle excess, James Mackintosh writes in his Streetwise column. Oil and technology have fitted this pattern perfectly over the past two years, the former rebounding along with energy prices, the latter driven to new heights by giddy enthusiasm.\nItaly’s anti-establishment parties chose a political novice to become the next prime minister, potentially allowing their leaders to act as the powers behind the throne. Giuseppe Conte, an academic and lawyer with virtually no political experience, must still be approved by President Sergio Mattarella.\nStacey Cunningham is set to become the first female leader of the New York Stock Exchange in its 226-year history.\nA resurgent dollar is exposing weaknesses in the developing world, pushing investors to unwind long-held bets on emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies. Among those feeling the pinch are two of Europe’s star currencies from 2017: Poland’s zloty and Hungary’s forint.\nEuropean leaders are playing a dangerous game, writes chief European commentator Simon Nixon. They are ramping up the rhetoric against the US even though relations with Washington are at their lowest ebb in 70 years.\nThe children born into Ronald Reagan’s ‘Morning in America’ era could become the last recession’s ‘lost generation,’ research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis suggests.\nTesla has given the first signals that it is giving up on its ambition to become a mass-market car maker. Prospective customers should be angry, and investors ought to be wary, writes Charley Grant for Heard on the Street.\nIN THE PAPERS\nThe Trump administration put Iran on notice that any new deal would require it to stop enriching all uranium and halt its support for militant groups in the region, sweeping demands that Tehran swiftly rejected. WSJ\nMark Zuckerberg is expected to tell European leaders he is sorry Facebook failed to stop the misuse of people’s data on the network, and will apologise for the spread of fake news. Politico\nThe Bank of England has been urged to introduce strict rules on how banks deal with the risks of climate change by activist investor Christopher Hohn, who warned that failing to act could endanger the long-term stability of Britain’s banking system. FT (£)\nTurkey is paying more on its debt than Senegal, even though it has a higher credit rating and its economy is 60 times bigger. Analysts say it’s because of Erdoganomics. Bloomberg (£)\nA second select committee of MPs is expected to examine how Russian companies use the City of London after the foreign affairs committee singled out the corporate law firm Linklaters for its role in advising on last year’s flotation of Oleg Deripaska’s En+. The Guardian\nMARKETS TODAY\nEuropean stocks edged higher, following strong gains in the US as trade tensions between the US and China eased. Still, sentiment was subdued in Europe, with banks and consumer stocks leading markets to notch slight gains, following a mixed session in holiday-thinned Asian trade.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average surged nearly 300 points on Monday to reach its highest level in more than two months.\nInvestors were also monitoring the latest political developments in Italy, where stocks rose just over 0.5% in early trading, while the 10-year Italian BTP traded at a yield of 2.36%. Italy continues to take centre stage in eurozone government bond markets “as market focus shifts to the implementation of the coalition’s ambitious agenda and its potential ministers,” said Commerzbank rates strategists.\nThe basic resource sector lagged in Europe, despite Brent crude rising back towards $80 a barrel. The dollar was largely flat, as were US Treasurys.\nCOMING UP\nBOE Governor Mark Carney takes questions from MPs; Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond speaks at the CBI’s annual dinner; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addresses the European Parliament.\nShare this: WSJ City Previous Will Small Caps Lead Large Caps Higher?
