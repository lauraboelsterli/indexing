    "text": "Los Angeles, CA. , May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- US Nuclear Corp. (OTCBB: UCLE) and Electronic Sensor Technology Inc. have signed a worldwide sales representative and resale agreement giving US Nuclear non-exclusive rights to sell the revolutionary, high-speed zNose® chemical sniffers.\nThe zNose\nThe zNose® chemical sniffers, recently featured in CBS Television’s CSI Miami, use advanced Surface Acoustic Wave sensors and ultra-fast gas chromatography to separate and analyze vapor samples in near real-time. The patented technology detects all compounds within an odor to provide a complete chemical profile, and the software includes an expandable library of over 700 chemicals and odor signatures, allowing the zNose to recognize virtually any target odor.\nThe zNose® can be used to measure:\nSalmonella and E-Coli contamination in food\nChemical warfare agents such as Sarin and Agent Orange\nBomb detection\nPurity and safety of milk and foods. Also applicable to cannabis: on-site, point of sale testing and certification assures the customer that the products are free from mold spores, insecticides, and other hazardous materials.\nVarious known carcinogens, harmful petroleum, and oil vapors\nResearch on breath analysis for early screening of cancers and pulmonary diseases; clinical studies have shown that these types of analyzers can identify women with early stage breast cancer\nPerforming analytical measurements of blood, urine, and stool\nRecently, Electronic Sensor Technology staff trained a sheriff’s office on the operation of the zNose® for detecting conventional explosives, plastic explosives, and drugs of abuse. The zNose® was demonstrated to detect and quantify the explosives and drugs, and the officers were very pleased that the product could complement trained dogs in detecting the substances.\nzNose® products are an excellent fit with US Nuclear’s current markets, including homeland security, first responder and rescue teams, worker safety, environmental monitoring, and military/government agencies.\nSafe Harbor Act\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
