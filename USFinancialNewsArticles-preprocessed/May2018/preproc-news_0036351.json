We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment loss on goodwill and other intangibles, stock-based compensation, and provision for bad debts. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe this supplemental measure of operating performance is helpful in comparing our operating results across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding non-cash items that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our results of operations in any particular period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as a factor in evaluating the performance of certain management personnel when determining incentive compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, while providing useful information, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or cash flows as determined under GAAP. Consistent with Regulation G under the U.S. federal securities laws, Adjusted EBITDA has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure, and this reconciliation is located under the heading “Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation” following the Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this press release.\nAbout TSS, Inc.\nTSS provides a comprehensive suite of services for the planning, design, system integration, deployment, maintenance, refresh and take-back of end-user and enterprise systems, including the mission-critical facilities they are housed in.

In this context, forward-looking statements may address matters such as our expected future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as “guidance,” “prospects,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “should,” or “will.” Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Particular uncertainties that could adversely or positively affect the Company's future results include: our independent registered public accounting firm’s reports on our 2016 and 2017 financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; we may not have sufficient resources to fund our business and may need to issue debt or equity to obtain additional funding; our reliance on a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers; risks relating to operating in a highly competitive industry; risks relating to the failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; risks relating to rapid technological, structural, and competitive changes affecting the industries we serve; risks involved in properly managing complex projects; risks relating to the possible cancellation of customer contracts on short notice; risks relating our ability to continue to implement our strategy, including having sufficient financial resources to carry out that strategy; risks relating to our ability to meet all of the terms and conditions of our debt obligations; uncertainty related to current economic conditions and the related impact on demand for our services; and other disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. These uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.\nCompany Contact:\nTSS, Inc.\nJohn Penver, CFO\nPhone: (512) 310-1000\nTSS, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands except par values) March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (unaudited) Assets Current Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,837 $ 2,268 Contract and other receivables, net 1,975 990 Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 193 223 Inventories, net 94 134 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 115 114 Total current assets 4,214 3,729 Property and equipment, net 385 418 Goodwill 1,907 1,907 Intangible assets, net 525 561 Other assets 112 112 Total assets $ 7,143 $ 6,727 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Current Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 2,647 $ 2,841 Deferred revenues 2,801 2,494 Total current liabilities 5,448 5,335 Convertible notes, less current portion, net 1,702 1,656 Deferred revenues – noncurrent portion 122 - Other liabilities 46 41 Total liabilities 7,318 7,032 Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) Preferred stock- $.0001 par value; 1,000 shares authorized at\nMarch 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017; none issued - - Common stock- $.0001 par value, 49,000 shares authorized at\nMarch 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017: 16,286 and 16,316 shares\nissued at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively\n2 2 Additional paid-in capital 68,935 68,886 Treasury stock 769 shares at cost at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively (1,536 ) (1,536 ) Accumulated deficit (67,576 ) (67,657 ) Total stockholders' equity (deficit) (175 ) (305 ) Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity (deficit) $ 7,143 $ 6,727\nTSS, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands except per-share values, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Results of Operations: Revenue $ 4,849 $ 4,389 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization 2,983 2,530 Gross profit 1,866 1,859 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 1,575 1,741 Depreciation and amortization 106 139 Gain on sale of assets - (321 ) Total operating costs 1,681 1,559 Operating income 185 300 Interest income (expense), net (93 ) (77 ) Other income (expense), net - - Income before income taxes 92 223 Income tax expense (benefit) 11 (31) Net income $ 81 $ 254 Basic and diluted income per share: Basic net income per share $ 0.01 $ 0.02 Diluted net income per share $ 0.00 $ 0.02\nTSS, Inc.\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n(In thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ 81 $ 254 Interest income (expense), net 93 77 Depreciation and amortization 106 138 Income tax expense (benefit) 11 (31) EBITDA $ 291 $ 438 Stock based compensation 49 10 Provision for bad debts - 2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 340 $ 450\nSource:TSS, Inc.",
