He continued, “We produced another quarter of excellent financial results while also announcing an organizational consolidation plan to better focus our capital deployment and strategic resources on our core asset, LogistiCare. During the quarter, NET Services was focused on multiple new contract implementations and continued to progress its critical value enhancement initiatives aimed at decreasing transportation and call center costs while also improving the quality of its service offerings. Within WD Services, we successfully launched each of our Work and Health Program contracts and our underlying profitability was solid despite seeing a negative impact from adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Lastly our Matrix Investment experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth while also beginning the process of integrating HealthFair. This great start to the year across all of our businesses gives us greater confidence in achieving our full year goals.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported revenue from continuing operations of $406.0 million, an increase of 1.6% from $399.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. As previously disclosed, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in a negative impact to revenue of $9.3 million versus the prior standard. In addition, WD Services benefited from favorable exchange rates, which provided a positive revenue impact of $6.4 million.\nIncome from continuing operations, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2018 was $5.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, compared to $1.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2017. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 includes restructuring and related charges of $2.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Adjusted Net Income in the first quarter of 2018 was $10.7 million, or $0.63 per diluted common share, compared to $6.6 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nSegment-level Adjusted EBITDA was $26.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $22.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $15.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn the first quarter 2018 the new revenue recognition standard resulted in a negative impact to operating income and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 million versus the prior standard. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, earnings per share, and Adjusted EPS were also negatively impacted by the adoption.\nShare Repurchases\nFrom January 1 2018, through May 7, 2018, the Company repurchased 589,000 shares of common stock for $37.4 million, or for an average price of $63.46 per share.\nAs previously announced, on April 3, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors amended the Company's ongoing stock repurchase program to add an additional $78 million of capacity and extend the expiration date of the program from December 31, 2018 to June 30, 2019. As of May 7, 2018, the Company has approximately $99.5 million of share repurchase availability under its share repurchase program.\nSince beginning to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 through May 7, 2018, the Company has repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock, or approximately 22% of the Company’s common stock outstanding at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015, for $170.2 million, or for an average price of $47.18 per share.\nOrganizational Consolidation\nAs previously announced on April 11, 2018, we are currently in the process of an organizational consolidation to integrate substantially all activities and functions performed at the corporate holding company level into LogistiCare. We anticipate the organizational consolidation will result in a more streamlined company structure with greater operational and strategic alignment and better able to pursue both organic and inorganic growth initiatives. This strategic process is expected to take approximately 12 months to complete, over which time implementation costs will negatively impact earnings but once complete is expected to generate annual savings of at least $10 million. In furtherance of our efforts to create this more streamlined organizational structure and allow us to more effectively deploy capital and focus strategic resources towards the significant growth opportunities available to LogistiCare, we are also exploring strategic alternatives in regards to our WD Services segment, which may involve a sale transaction of the segment.\nSegment Results\nFor analysis purposes, the Company provides revenue, expenses, operating income (loss), income (loss) from continuing operations, net of taxes, and Adjusted EBITDA on a segment basis. Segment results include revenue and expenses incurred by each segment, as well as an allocation of certain direct expenses incurred by Corporate and Other on behalf of the segment. No direct cash expenses were incurred by Corporate on behalf of the Matrix Investment segment. The activities reflected in Corporate and Other include executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal, public reporting, certain strategic and corporate development functions and the results of the Company’s captive insurance company.\nNET Services\nNET Services revenue was $336.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 3.9% from $324.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income was $19.6 million, or 5.8% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $11.8 million, or 3.6% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. Included in NET Services operating income in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were $0.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of restructuring and related charges. NET Services Adjusted EBITDA was $23.9 million, or 7.1% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $16.3 million, or 5.0% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 revenue includes a negative impact of $3.9 million from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, as the accounting for one contract changed from a gross basis to net basis. This change had no impact to NET Services operating income or Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe year-over-year increase in NET Services revenue was primarily due to the impact of numerous new contracts, including new managed care organization (\"MCO\") contracts in Indiana and New York and new state contracts in Texas. Increased membership and rates across various existing contracts also positively impacted revenue in the first quarter of 2018. These increases to revenue were partially offset by the ending of state contracts in New York and Connecticut and certain of our MCO contracts in Florida as well as reduced membership under our renewed state contract in Virginia. NET Services Adjusted EBITDA margins in the first quarter of 2018 benefited from the favorable resolution of contractual adjustments and retrospective rate adjustments as well as lower transportation costs on a per trip basis due to our value enhancement activities, partially offset by higher utilization across certain contracts and the ending of our state contract in New York.\nWD Services\nWD Services revenue was $69.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 8.1% from $75.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating loss was $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to income of $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Included within WD Services operating income (loss) in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were restructuring and related costs of $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively. WD Services Adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 million, or 4.1% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 million, or 8.3% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 revenue reflects a $5.4 million negative impact on revenue and a $3.5 million negative impact on operating income and Adjusted EBITDA as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. WD Services benefited from favorable exchange rates in the first quarter of 2018, which provided a positive revenue impact of $6.4 million, although only a small impact on Adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, revenue declined 16.7% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the first quarter of 2017.\nThe year-over-year decrease in WD Services revenue in the first quarter of 2018, on a constant currency basis and excluding the negative impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, was primarily due to the anticipated decline in Work Program revenues, partially offset by the launch of the Work and Health Program and growth in health services revenue in the UK. Excluding the negative impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, WD Services first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was in line with the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 included a favorable Adjusted EBITDA impact of $5.2 million related to the finalization of a contractual adjustment, whereas the first quarter of 2018 included a favorable impact of only $1.1 million related to contractual adjustments. This net reduction in income was offset by payroll savings generated by our Ingeus Futures restructuring programs.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other incurred a $7.9 million operating loss in the first quarter of 2018 compared to an operating loss of $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Included within Corporate and Other operating loss in the first quarter of 2018 were restructuring and related costs of $0.4 million related to the consolidation of the holding company structure into LogistiCare. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA was negative $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to negative $7.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nThis increase in Corporate and Other's Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily due to an increase in cash settled stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million, as a result of a more significant increase in the Company’s stock price in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nMatrix Investment (Equity Investment)\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Providence recorded a loss in equity earnings of $2.3 million related to its Matrix Investment compared to a loss of $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAs Providence’s interest in Matrix is accounted for as an equity method investment, the following numbers are not included within the Company’s consolidated results of operations. For the first quarter of 2018, Matrix’s revenue was $67.4 million, an increase of 20.7% from $55.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Matrix’s operating loss was $0.8 million, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to income of $1.0 million, for the first quarter of 2017. Included within Matrix’s operating loss in the first quarter of 2018 were $3.1 million of management fees paid to Matrix shareholders and transaction costs of $2.2 million related to the acquisition of HealthFair. Included within Matrix's operating income in the first quarter of 2017 was $2.2 million of expense related to transaction bonuses paid to the Matrix management team, $0.8 million of other transaction related expenses, and $0.5 million of management fees paid to Matrix shareholders.\nMatrix net loss was $8.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Matrix's net loss in the first quarter of 2018 includes $6.0 million of interest expense related to the acceleration of deferred financing fees triggered by the refinancing of Matrix's debt in relation to the HealthFair acquisition. Matrix’s Adjusted EBITDA was $13.5 million, or 20.0% of revenue, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $12.5 million, or 22.4% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe positive year-over-year revenue growth for the first quarter of 2018 was related to the acquisition of HealthFair, which contributed approximately 50% of the increase in revenue as well as increased in-home visit volumes within Matrix’s legacy operations, partially offset by lower pricing. The year-over-year decline in Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the timing of new contract startup costs at HealthFair and lower pricing.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Matrix had cash of $19.6 million and $330.0 million of term loan debt outstanding under its credit facility, which was entered into in February 2018 in conjunction with the HealthFair acquisition. At the end of the quarter, Providence's ownership interest in Matrix was 43.6%.\nInvestor Presentation and Conference Call\nProvidence will hold a conference call to discuss its financial results on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET.

For more information, please visit prscholdings.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjustments\nIn addition to the financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release includes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment-level Adjusted EBITDA for the Company and its operating segments, and Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the Company, which are performance measures that are not recognized under GAAP. EBITDA is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations, net of taxes, before: (1) interest expense, net, (2) provision (benefit) for income taxes and (3) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA before certain items, including (as applicable): (1) restructuring and related charges, including costs related to our corporate reorganization, (2) foreign currency transactions, (3) equity in net earnings or losses of investees, (4) certain litigation related expenses or settlement income, (5) gain or loss on sale of equity investments, (6) management fees and (7) certain transaction and related costs. Segment-level Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the company excluding the Adjusted EBITDA associated with corporate and holding company costs reported as our Corporate and Other Segment. Adjusted Net Income is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, before certain items, including (1) restructuring and related charges, (2) foreign currency transactions, (3) equity in net earnings or losses of investees, (4) certain litigation related expenses or settlement income, (5) intangible amortization expense, (6) gain or loss on sale of equity investments, (7) the non-recurring impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (8) excess tax charges associated with long term incentive plans, (9) the impact of adjustments on noncontrolling interests, (10) transaction and related costs and (11) the income tax impact of such adjustments. Adjusted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income less (as applicable): (1) dividends on convertible preferred stock, (2) accretion of convertible preferred stock discount, and (3) income allocated to participating stockholders, divided by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. We utilize these non-GAAP performance measures, which exclude certain expenses and amounts, because we believe the timing of such expenses is unpredictable and not driven by our core operating results, and therefore render comparisons with prior periods as well as with other companies in our industry less meaningful. We believe such measures allow investors to gain a better understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing operations of our business. We consider our core operations to be the ongoing activities to provide services from which we earn revenue, including direct operating costs and indirect costs to support these activities. In addition, our net earnings in equity investees are excluded from these measures, as we do not have the ability to manage these ventures, allocate resources within the ventures, or directly control their operations or performance.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
