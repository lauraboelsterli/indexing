Our business segments, flame and gas detection and our IIoT Cloud/Gateway business, continued to perform well. As Q1 can often be a challenging quarter at the start of new year, we are very pleased with the progress we have made at improving our financial performance,” said Jeff Brown President and CEO of Sierra Monitor. “Further, we are making good progress in our focused efforts across the business on our main solutions themes, edge computing, cloud based IIoT enablement and our expanding large data repository. Our customers are seeing the value of our solutions and are working with us as we provide additional features and functionality across all our product lines”.\nDuring Q1 2018, Sierra Monitor continued its progress to develop and deliver solutions allowing our customers to employ flexible architectures to solve their business problems. Some examples include:\nSMC worked with its distribution team to deliver a state of the art solution allowing a major oil refinery in Oman to monitor for Hydrogen Sulfide accumulations in their oil fields to keep their personnel safe. SMC was chosen after an in-depth technical review for our capabilities in this market segment.\nA large Fortune 100 conglomerate selected SMC’s ProtoAir Wi-Fi solution to enable their portfolio of state of the art flow meters, including mass flowmeter, electromagnetic and ultrasonic versions to convert from proprietary protocols to industry standard versions. The flexibility of the wireless solution allowing ease of deployment and negating the need for expensive cabling allows the customer to include these flowmeters in network based management solutions.\nLexington Fayette Urban is a Kentucky based municipality that needed to ensure safety for its personnel in the wastewater treatment plant. SMC provided a comprehensive gas detection solution for the customer enabling them to enhance their safety solution, a key concern for the municipality. SMC was chosen for both its superior monitoring capabilities as well as its price performance including our reduced down time and labor costs for calibration.\nA large integrator who provides solutions to one of the biggest property management companies in the world chose SMC’s dual port Bacnet router as a standard solution. Faced with a need to connect multiple networks and provide redundancy, the two port router solved the problem providing the right technology and price point to meet the needs of this complex customer.\nOne of the largest European suppliers of air conditioning chose SMC’s ProtoNode to provide support for integration to diverse building management systems including BacNet, KNX and Lonworks. In addition, with the need to remotely manage and monitor their systems, the SMCCloud solution provided the platform to implement this requirement.\nAbout Sierra Monitor Corporation\nSierra Monitor Corporation addresses the industrial and commercial facilities management market with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions that target facility automation and facility safety requirements, also referred to as “Connect” and “Protect”.\nThe Connect business is our FieldServer family of protocol gateways, routers, and network explorers which targets industrial and facilities automation.

The following tables reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include EBITDA (Table D), non-GAAP operating results (Table C), and basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per share.\nSierra Monitor continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP and does not suggest or believe non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Sierra Monitor believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its operating results primarily because they exclude amounts the Company does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the overall Company performance.\nWe believe that our non-GAAP financial measures facilitate the comparison of results for current periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from non-GAAP financial measures:\nDepreciation and Amortization of Tangible and Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with GAAP, depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets includes depreciation of purchased capital assets and amortization of intangible assets including third party approval fees. We exclude these amounts from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes.\nProvision for Bad Debt Expense\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to ensure that it is adequate to the best of management’s knowledge. We exclude these amounts from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes.\nProvision for Inventory Losses\nWe evaluate our inventories for excess or obsolescence on a quarterly basis. Inventories identified as slow moving or obsolete are determined based on historical experience and current product demand. The quarterly analysis is used to adjust the provision for inventory losses. We exclude the provision for inventory losses from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes.\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nOur non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expenses, which consist of expenses for stock options. While stock-based compensation is an expense affecting our results of operations, management excludes stock-based compensation from our budget and planning process. For these reasons we exclude stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures. We compute weighted average dilutive stocks using the methods required by GAAP for both GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA represents net earnings attributable to Sierra Monitor excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliation on Table D of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that EBITDA is one of the appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because it reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet, and make strategic acquisitions.\nSierra Monitor refers to these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating and measuring the performance of our ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to historical operating results. We are reporting non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nSierra Monitor believes that non-GAAP measures have significant limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Sierra Monitor’s financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Sierra Monitor’s financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Because of these limitations, Sierra Monitor qualifies the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented. In addition, the exclusion of the charges and expenses indicated above from the non-GAAP financial measures presented does not indicate an expectation by Sierra Monitor management that similar charges and expenses will not be incurred in subsequent periods.\nTable C\nSIERRA MONITOR CORPORATION\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Operating Results\n(Unaudited)\nFor the three months ended March 31 2018 2017 GAAP Net Income (Loss) $ 51,261 $ (133,842 ) Depreciation and amortization 58,537 74,733 Provision for bad debt expense (7,804 ) - Provision for inventory losses 30,000 - Stock based compensation expense 46,660 81,204 Total adjustments to GAAP net income 127,393 155,937 Non-GAAP Net Income $ 178,654 $ 22,095 Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share: Basic $ 0.02 $ 0.00 Diluted $ 0.02 $ 0.00 Weighted-average number of shares used in per share computations: Basic 10,203,995 10,181,553 Diluted 10,328,108 10,181,553 Table D\nSIERRA MONITOR CORPORATION\nReconciliation of GAAP to EBITDA Operating Results\n(Unaudited)\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 GAAP Net Income (Loss) $ 51,261 $ (133,842 ) Interest income (308 ) - Income tax provision (benefit) 39,997 (35,093 ) Depreciation and amortization 58,537 74,733 Non-GAAP EBITDA $ 149,487 $ (94,202 )\nSierra Monitor Investor Relations Contact Tamara Allen CFO, Sierra Monitor Corporation TAllen@sierramonitor.com\nSource:Sierra Monitor Corporation",
