Sales amounted to USD 82.2 million, up 41.3% compared to the same period last year due to higher volume and prices of blueberries and higher volumes of shrimps. As of March 31 st , 2018, the Company maintained a cash balance of USD 42.5 million, Net Debt was USD 147.3 million, resulting in a Net leverage ratio [2] of 1.1x.\nThe Company expects to continue its diversification strategy by: increasing production of the F&V Division (blueberries, avocados and tangerines), converting open ponds into intensive ponds in Marinasol, and strengthening relationship with clients adding value through commercial strategies, marketing and service initiatives.\nPerspectives of long-term growth of fresh and healthy products are excellent. Avocado and blueberry consumption is growing, with headroom for increased per capita consumption in key markets. The Company expects good demand for its products in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\"During the first quarter of the year we maintained the growth trend as a result of our strategic decision to focus on fresh and healthy products and to develop a direct road to market.
