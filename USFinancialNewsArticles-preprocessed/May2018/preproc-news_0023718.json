A live webcast and replay of the call will be available at the Investor Relations section of the Company’s web site at ir.r1rcm.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by R1’s management team in financial and operational decision making, the Company supplements its GAAP consolidated financial statements with certain non-GAAP financial performance measures, including adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income before net interest income, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, reorganization-related expenses, transaction-related expenses and certain other items.\nOur board of directors and management team use adjusted EBITDA as (i) one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and (ii) a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive compensation programs, as well as for incentive compensation programs for employees.\nTable 4 presents a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. Table 7 presents a reconciliation of GAAP operating income guidance to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA guidance. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release includes information that may constitute “forward-looking statements,” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
