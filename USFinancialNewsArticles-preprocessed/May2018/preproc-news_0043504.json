    "text": "NEW YORK, May 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DelphX Capital Markets Inc. (DELX.V) (\" DelphX \") announced today that it has engaged international investor relations (IR) specialists, MKR Group, Inc. (\"MKR\") to lead its shareholder communication program. This marks the beginning of a comprehensive outreach initiative to broadly inform institutional buyside and sellside participants in the U.S. and Canada.\nMKR is a boutique, Los Angeles-based, IR firm specializing in micro- and small-cap technology growth companies, with particular expertise in cross-border development. MKR will manage all phases of the global DelphX shareholder communication program, including press releases, earnings calls, road show support and strategic advisory. Information on MKR's history and other current clients can be found at www.mkr-group.com .\n\"We are very excited to team with MKR, as we seek to inform and expand our North American institutional investor base,\" explained DelphX CEO, Larry Fondren. \"With nearly two decades of experience working with leading technology growth companies, we believe MKR is the ideal firm to spearhead our global initiative to inform and serve the institutional investment community.\"\nAbout DelphX:\nDelphX is a technology company focused on optimizing fixed income markets around the world by transforming the way credit capital is secured. It is developing a blockchain-powered solution employing proprietary distributed ledger technology and actuarial science to facilitate broad diffusion of credit default risks. The new DelphX alternative trading system (\"ATS\") market will be regulated by the SEC and operated by DelphX Services Corporation, a FINRA member firm, to facilitate the negotiation, purchase and trading of two new forms of Smart Contract securities:\nCovered Put Option (CPO) securities that provide secured default protection for U.S. dollar-denominated corporate, municipal and sovereign securities, with each CPO strike-price equaling the par value of its underlying security; and Covered Reference Note (CRN) securities that allow investors to take on exposure to the default risk of a single underlying security or to participate in a pool of diverse risks that broadly diffuses the impact of credit events among all participants.\nAll CPO and CRN securities will be issued by Quantem Capital Corporation Ltd.(\"Quantem\"), a Bermuda-domiciled subsidiary of DelphX, and transparently administered within Quantem's immutable Distributed Ledger. A traditional book-entry record of each security will also be maintained in parallel by Quantem's issuing and paying agent to provide additional transparency and efficiency.\nDelphX is headquartered in the U.S., with locations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and its development operations are located in the Kitchener-Waterloo (\"Silicon Valley North\") region of Canada.\nDelphX is not owned or controlled by any entity with a vested interest in the success of particular issuers, securities or market participants. As a result, DelphX will not directly or indirectly compete with any of its market participants.\nFor more information about DelphX, please visit www.delphx.com .\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration, qualification or availability of an exemption under the securities laws of that jurisdiction.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" including, without limitation, statements regarding the launch of the DelphX market.
