Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. There’s no easy way to make IT infrastructure fully secure from cyberattacks. But there’s an easy way to avoid a good many of the biggest threats that companies face. They can make sure that they keep software up to date, WSJ Pro Cybersecurity’s Adam Janofsky explains in a story for Journal Reports. “Several companies have suffered more than $100 million in lost revenue over the past year due to a common and frequently overlooked cybersecurity issue: outdated software,” he writes.\nBehold, the unpatched . Last May, WannaCry ransomware hit health-care organizations across England. Hospitals had to find manual workarounds for a variety of tasks. The attack spread by exploiting a known vulnerability for which Microsoft Corp . had issued a patch months earlier. Weeks later, consumer-goods company Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC , pharmaceutical firm Merck & Co . and shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk reported losses totaling about $130 million, $135 million and $300 million, respectively, after the NotPetya ransomware made servers and computers unusable. That attack spread using the same vulnerability.\nPatching is difficult, but not impossible . Defense contractor Raytheon Co . has five people who manage rollouts of patches and monitor whether customers are updating systems, says CISO Jeff Brown. When the team learns of a new patch, they assign a priority level to it—low, medium, high or critical. Some systems may be patched within hours. The goal is for about 95% of the devices to be patched within a few days. The remaining 5% usually consists of people on vacation, and servers that can’t run the patch because they have a unique configuration or have applications that won’t work if the patch is installed. “You’re never going to get to 100% patched—it’s a worthy goal, but it’s never going to happen,” Mr. Brown says.\nAUTOMOTIVE TECH\nA Tesla Model 3 car is displayed at an auto show in Beijing in April.

Tesla Inc . was able to improve the braking distance of Model 3 cars by as much as 20 feet by wirelessly transmitting a software update into the vehicles, the Journal’s Tim Higgins reports . The improvement led Consumer Reports to recommend the vehicle, and shows how the automaker can boost performance without costly dealership repairs.\nUber, Waymo consider self-driving partnership . Uber Technologies Inc is talking with Alphabet .’s autonomous driving unit about using its technology on Uber’s ride-hailing app, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday. According to Reuters , the discussions indicate a possible thaw in relations between the two companies after Uber said would pay Waymo $245 million in shares to settle a legal dispute.\nMapbox deepens push into self-driving cars . The startup on Wednesday said it will partner with Microsoft Corp ., Intel Corp . and SoftBank Group Corp .’s ARM Holdings PLC chip unit to provide maps for self-driving cars, Reuters reports . Mapbox provides the underlying maps inside apps like Snap ., and has been pushing to provide tools for developers who make software for self-driving vehicles.\nMORE TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nGoogle’s U.K. headquarters in London. The European Union’s strict privacy law is drawing ad money to the tech giant and away from competitors struggling to show they’re are complying with the sweeping regulation. Photo: CHRIS RATCLIFFE/BLOOMBERG NEWS\nGDPR’s early winner: Google . The European Union’s new privacy law is drawing advertising money toward Google’s online-ad services and away from competitors that are straining to show they’re complying with the sweeping regulation, the Journal’s Nick Kostov and Sam Schechner write . The reason: the Alphabet Inc. ad giant is gathering individuals’ consent for targeted advertising at far higher rates than many competing online-ad services. That indicates GDPR is reinforcing, at least initially, the strength of the biggest online-ad players.\nIn other regulatory news : New Zealand’s top privacy enforcer is seeking greater powers to regulate Facebook . as the social network continues to face scrutiny over its handling of personal data.

Facial recognition software developer SenseTime Group Ltd. raised $620 million in its latest funding round, bringing its valuation to more than $4.5 billion, Bloomberg writes . Fidelity International, Silver Lake and Tiger Global were among investors. The funding round comes months after winning a similar amount from investors including Alibaba Holding Group Ltd .\nFederal cybersecurity: still not great . A report from the Office of Management and Budget confirms the federal government’s shortcomings and reinforces a dire need for change, Wired writes . Of the 96 federal agencies OMB assessed, it deemed 74 percent either “At Risk” or “High Risk,” meaning that they need crucial and immediate improvements. Over half lack the ability to determine what software runs on their systems.\nJudge drops Kaspersky lawsuit challenging software ban . A U.S. judge dismissed a pair of lawsuits filed by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab demanding the U.S. government rescind a ban on the use of its software in U.S. government computers, saying the action was justified to reduce cybersecurity risk, the Journal reports . “These defensive actions may very well have adverse consequences for some third-parties,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her Wednesday ruling. “But that does not make them unconstitutional.”\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo opened two days of talks with a senior North Korean official, as the Trump administration tries to establish whether there is enough common ground to proceed with a summit.
