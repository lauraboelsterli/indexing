    "text": "1 COMMENTS Russia and Saudi Arabia are hammering out the terms of a deal to jointly increase oil production—a move that could cool crude markets and extend, at least for now, a crucial role for Moscow in setting global prices.\nThe coordination represents the first time Moscow has moved beyond a temporary deal it struck two years ago with Riyadh and OPEC, the cartel of some of the world’s biggest producers, to tighten supplies.\nThat 2016 agreement worked. It whittled away the world’s excess supply of stored crude , helping to boost international prices as high as $80 a barrel last week, up sharply from a long trough in which crude traded as low as around $25 a barrel. Now, officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Saudi Arabia and Russia have all agreed that it is time to loosen the taps again.\nUntil now, Russia’s role in the pact was to serve, temporarily, as a big addition to OPEC’s already prodigious leverage over global markets. OPEC pumps about one in every three barrels the world consumes. But even that weight wasn’t enough to help lift prices after they cratered in 2014, thanks in part to new U.S. shale production that swamped markets.\nSaudi Arabia, Russia and the U.S. are the worlds top oil producers. Including Russia and a handful of other big, non-OPEC producers in cutbacks allowed the cartel to hold back a bigger share of output than it could on its own.\nBy discussing potential production increases, not just cuts, this time around, Moscow is graduating to a more integrated decision-making role, alongside OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia, in determining how the cartel meters oil to sway prices.\nOPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said Friday the group planned to “institutionalize” its deal with Russia. While it’s unclear how concrete or detailed any new deal would be, the current discussions over output increases will deepen Russia’s commitment to acting alongside OPEC, in times of crisis, when prices are too low, and times, like today, when they appear too high.\nThat could be a new irritant to Washington. For decades, the U.S. has relied on Riyadh, as OPEC’s biggest producer by far, to steer the group, which also includes Iran, toward keeping oil markets stable and acting to rein in prices during supply crises. That trust doesn’t extend to Moscow, and the new oil-policy cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia will add a fresh layer of complexity to the relationship between all three countries.\nOil prices fell sharply Friday after Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak and Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih both said during an economic conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, that they are working to boost production soon.\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 2.2% to $77.08 a barrel on London’s ICE Futures exchange. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading down 1.9% at $69.40 a barrel.\nRelated\nOil Tumbles as Major Producers Discuss Lifting Output Venezuela’s Creditors Are Cutting Its Crude-Oil Lifeline (May 16, 2018) What Happened to the Oil Glut? (April 12, 2018) The new level of cooperation has its limits. While Saudi Arabia and Russia agree prices are too high, they are split about how widely they should reopen the spigots in an effort to cool markets, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe original deal called for cutting total global production 2% from 2016 levels. In recent months outages in Venezuela , another OPEC member, and over compliance by other members of the pact, have led to the group producing about 700,000 fewer barrels a day than the deal calls for.\nSaudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf producers favors the idea of increasing output by 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day, said a senior Saudi official familiar with the matter. That reflects Riyadh’s view that supply and demand aren’t out of alignment and modest increases are only necessary.\nIn a phone call with Nuer Bekri, the administrator of the National Energy Administration of China, a big buyer of Saudi crises, Mr. Falih said “current oil market fundamentals are sound,” according to a Saudi energy ministry press release Friday.\nBut Russia supports a more radical approach. It wants to quickly remove the group’s current over compliance to the deal, according to people familiar with the matter. By bringing compliance to 100%, from the current 152% the group reported in April, that would bring back about 700,000 barrels a day. Russia has also floated the idea of going as high as 800,000 barrels a day, according to the Saudi official.\nOne pressure Moscow faces that Saudi Arabia doesn’t is that Russia’s many private oil companies have spent billions investing in new field development, and the 2016 agreement put a lid on the output—and profit—they could squeeze from that spending.\nMr. Novak said Friday, Russian producers and the government are on the same page on prices.\n“Russian companies understand the market is heading towards rebalancing,” he told the St. Petersburg conference Friday. “They don’t want to overheat the market. We don’t have disagreements with our companies.”\nThe new level of cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia has caused grumbling among other OPEC members.\n“This conversation is mostly between Saudi Arabia and Russia,“ one OPEC official said. Not including the rest of the coalition—which is made of 14 members of the cartel and 10 non-OPEC producers--“could create some tension for sure,” another OPEC official said.\n— Anatoly Kurmanaev in St. Petersburg contributed to this article.\nWrite to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com",
