    "text": "TULSA, Okla., May 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Educational Development Corporation (“EDC”) (NASDAQ:EDUC) ( http://www.edcpub.com ) today reports record net sales and earnings per share results for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018.\nRandall White, CEO of Educational Development Corporation, announced that for the fiscal year 2018, the Company reports record net revenues of $111,966,100, an increase of $5,338,000, or 5%, when compared to $106,628,100 for the previous year. Fiscal 2018 net earnings totaled $5,214,700, compared to $2,860,900 in fiscal 2017, an increase of 82%. Fiscal year 2018 earnings per share were $1.27 compared to $0.70 the previous year, up 81% on a fully diluted basis.\nThe direct sales division, Usborne Books & More (“UBAM”) continued to have strong growth this year driven by the success and growth of our active sales consultants. Net revenues in this division increased by 6% from $97,620,600 in fiscal year 2017 to $103,698,600 in fiscal year 2018. The number of active direct sales consultants also increased to 35,500 at the end of fiscal 2018, an increase of 38% over the active consultant count from the end of fiscal year 2017.\nThe Publishing division’s net revenues declined $740,000, or 8%, from $9,007,500 in fiscal 2017 to $8,267,500 in fiscal 2018. Publishing experienced a decline in net revenues due primarily to a decline in sales to two of our large national retail book chain customers that had reduced purchasing volumes.\nPer Mr. White, “I am very pleased to report that our Company had record net revenues for our fourth consecutive fiscal year, growing from $32.5 million in fiscal 2015 to $112.0 million in fiscal 2018. This growth was made possible by the continued success of our sales consultants within our UBAM Division.”\nMr. White continued, “During the last several years of revenue growth, we invested heavily in new facilities, processes and systems with the expectations that these investments would result in increased bottom line profitability. During fiscal 2018, we saw these expectations become reality in increased profit margins. Our pretax profits this year exceeded $7.8 million, or 7.0% of net revenues, which represents a significant increase in our recent profitability ratios.”\nPer Mr. White “With the improvements in our profitability, our increase in cash on hand and our ability to access additional cash through our $15 million line of credit with our bank, we expect we have the necessary cash flows to operate our business and fund future growth. As such, our Board has approved the reinstatement of our past practice of issuing quarterly dividends and authorized a $0.10 per share cash dividend which will be paid on June 21, 2018 to shareholders of record June 4, 2018.”\nEDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CONDENSED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS Twelve Months Ended February 28, 2018 2017 NET REVENUES 111,966,100 106,628,100 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 7,832,700 4,612,100 INCOME TAXES 2,618,000 1,751,200 NET EARNINGS $ 5,214,700 2,860,900 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE: Basic $ 1.28 $ 0.70 Diluted $ 1.27 $ 0.70 WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING: Basic 4,087,998 4,077,695 Diluted 4,090,661 4,082,854\nEDC will host its annual results Investor Call including a live Q&A webcast on Wednesday, May 30, 2018, at 2 PM CT (3 PM ET).
