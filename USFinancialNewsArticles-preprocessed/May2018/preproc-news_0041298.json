    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 9:23 AM / Updated 9 minutes ago Prince William's children get starring roles at brother's wedding Reuters Staff 1 Britain’s Prince Harry and his U.S. fiancée Meghan Markle have chosen George and Charlotte, the children of the royal’s elder brother Prince William, to be among the bridesmaids and page boys for their wedding, his office said on Wednesday.

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\nAlso selected for the much-anticipated event at Windsor Castle on Saturday are the couple’s goddaughters and godson, and the children of one of her best friends.\nHarry’s office said last week that all the bridesmaids would be children and that Markle had decided not to have a maid of honour because she could not choose between her friends.
