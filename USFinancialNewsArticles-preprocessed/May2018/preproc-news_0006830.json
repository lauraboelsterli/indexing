    "text": "(Reuters) - Two black men arrested while waiting at a Philadelphia Starbucks store reached a settlement with the coffee chain and dropped legal claims against the city.\nFILE PHOTO: Protesters marching down Market Street are seen reflected in a Starbucks storefront in Philadelphia, a week after two black men were arrested at a Starbucks coffee shop, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Dominick Reuter The city agreed to pay each man $1 and committed $200,000 to fund an entrepreneurship program for public school students.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) on Wednesday announced its financial settlement with Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, whose arrests on April 12 sparked protests and calls for a boycott of the chain.\nThe company did not disclose the value of the settlement but said it would give details in a joint statement.\nRobinson and Nelson were arrested after a manager called police to complain that they had not made a purchase and refused to leave. They were released hours later without being charged.\nStarbucks plans to close 8,000 stores for a half day of anti-bias training on May 29.\n“Starbucks will continue to take actions that stem from this incident to repair and reaffirm our values and vision for the kind of company we want to be,” Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said in a statement.\nReporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ",
