    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 4:34 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago U.N. and Myanmar agree outline of Rohingya return deal, no details Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nGENEVA/YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it had struck a deal with Myanmar aimed at eventually allowing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims sheltering in Bangladesh to return safely and by choice.\nSince August 2017, about 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled a military crackdown in mainly Buddhist Myanmar, many reporting killings, rape and arson on a large scale, U.N. and other aid organizations have said.\n“Since the conditions are not conducive for voluntary return yet, the MoU (memorandum of understanding) is the first and necessary step to support the government’s efforts to change that situation,” the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement.\nMyanmar’s government said in a brief statement late on Thursday the MoU would be signed “soon” and U.N. agencies would “support access to livelihoods through the design and implementation of community-based interventions”.\nMyanmar civilian government spokesman Zaw Htay said he had nothing to add to the statement.\nMyanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete the voluntary repatriation of the refugees within two years but differences between the two sides remain and implementation of the plan has been slow.\nIn a separate statement on Thursday, Myanmar’s government said it would set up an independent commission to investigate “the violation of human rights and related issues” in Rakhine State following the army operation there in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security posts.\nThe commission will be assisted by international experts, the statement said without elaborating.\nThe United Nations and aid agencies have described the crackdown on the Rohingya as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”, an accusation Myanmar rejects.\nThe Security Council asked Myanmar in November to ensure no “further excessive use of military force” and to allow “freedom of movement, equal access to basic services, and equal access to full citizenship for all”.\nMyanmar has for years denied Rohingya citizenship, freedom of movement and access to basic services such as healthcare. Many in Myanmar regard the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from mostly Muslim Bangladesh. Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay, Shoon Naing and Yimou Lee; Editing by Tom Miles/Mark Heinrich",
