The majority of fixed rate loans are associated with NEF and are short in duration with average hold periods of 2.5 years. Additionally, NEF seeks to match-fund its fixed rate assets with fixed rate liabilities.\n(6) Excludes the impact of success fees and/or warrants.\nThe Comprehensive Investment Portfolio is diversified across over 237 unique issuers across approximately 80 industries and with an average exposure of $7.6 million or 0.4% per issuer.\nAt March 31, 2018, 98.2% of the Company’s Comprehensive Investment Portfolio was invested in senior secured loans, comprised of 78.9% first lien senior secured loans and approximately 19.3% second lien senior secured loans. Year over year, second lien loan exposure of the Comprehensive Investment Portfolio declined by approximately 40%, as the Company has focused its origination efforts on underwriting first lien and stretch first lien loans to upper middle market sponsor-owned companies as well as commercial finance investments.\nSolar Capital Ltd. Portfolio\nWeighted Average Yield\nAt March 31, 2018, the weighted average yield on our income-producing investments, inclusive of our equity interests in Crystal Financial, NEF, SSLP and SSLP II, was 10.2% measured at fair value, and 10.6%, measured at amortized cost, consistent with the weighted average yield at December 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nAs of March 31, 2018, 100% of the Company’s portfolio was performing.\nThe Company puts its largest emphasis on risk control and credit performance. On a quarterly basis, or more frequently if deemed necessary, the Company formally rates each portfolio investment on a scale of one to four, with one representing the least amount of risk.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the composition of our portfolio, on a risk ratings basis, was as follows:\nInternal Investment Rating Investments at Fair Value % of Total Portfolio 1 $224.7 15.3%\n2 $1,217.1 82.7%\n3 $29.2 2.0%\n4 $0.9 <0.1% Investment Income\nFor the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, gross investment income totaled $39.0 million and $34.4 million, respectively.

The increase in expenses from Q1 2017 to Q1 2018 is primarily due to higher incentive fees resulting from higher income, higher interest expense resulting from an increase in borrowings to support a larger income producing investment portfolio, partially offset by the reduction in the base management fee.\nNet Investment Income\nThe Company’s net investment income totaled $18.9 million and $16.3 million, or $0.45 and $0.39 per average share, respectively, for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gain\nNet realized and unrealized gains for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled approximately $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\nNet Increase in Net Assets Resulting From Operations\nFor the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $20.0 million and $17.2 million, respectively.
