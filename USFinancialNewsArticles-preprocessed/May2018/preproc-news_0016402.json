    "text": "Net Sales and Diluted EPS Increase by 20.1% and 18.6%, Respectively\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Inter Parfums, Inc. (NASDAQ GS: IPAR) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017:\nNet sales were $171.8 million, up 20.1% from $143.1 million; at comparable foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 13.1%; Sales by European based operations rose 24.9% to $149.5 million from $119.7 million; Sales by U.S. based operations declined 4.6% to $22.3 million from $23.4 million; Gross margin was 61.5% of net sales compared to 63.0%; S,G&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 43.8% compared to 44.7%; Operating income increased 16.2% to $30.4 million as compared to $26.2 million; Operating margin was 17.7% compared to 18.3%; The effective income tax rate was 30.5% compared to 32.8 %; Net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. increased to $15.9 million, up 19.0% from $13.4 million; and, Net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. per diluted share rose 18.6% to $0.51 from $0.43.\nJean Madar, Chairman & CEO of Inter Parfums, Inc. noted, “All regions in which we operate achieved sales growth, with our three largest markets, North America, Western Europe and Asia producing comparable quarter gains of 19%, 10% and 34%, respectively. The performance of smaller markets was also quite good, with sales growth of 33%, 15% and 18%, in the Middle East, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe, respectively.”\nCommenting on the performance of the larger brands within European based operations, Mr. Madar continued, “Montblanc and Coach brand fragrances drove top line growth with sales gains of 33% and 242%, respectively. With last year’s first quarter sales up 57% attributable in great part to new product launches, Jimmy Choo fragrances declined 28% in the current first quarter. We expect better comparisons in future quarters with the introduction of Jimmy Choo Man Blue and Jimmy Choo Fever later in the year. The strength of the euro magnified the sales performances of Lanvin and Rochas, whose sales were down slightly in local currency, but in dollars, were up 10% and 14%, respectively.”\nOn the subject of launches, Mr. Madar continued, “We would characterize 2018 as a year focused on complementary initiatives, including the two noted above for the Jimmy Choo brand. Thus far this year, we have already debuted Lanvin’s Modern Princess Eau Sensuelle and Coach Floral. In addition, we have another brand extension for the Lanvin Éclat fragrance family, and debuting later this year, Coach Platinum, a flanker for the very successful signature men’s scent. With regard to Rochas, our goal is to expand the brand’s market by opening distribution in Asia and South America.”\nMoving on to U.S. based operations, Mr. Madar noted, “While comparable quarter sales gains by Anna Sui and Oscar de la Renta fragrance were achieved in the first quarter, we expect much better sales comparisons by U.S. based operations in later quarters as we unveil new products for many of our other brands and commence sales of GUESS brand fragrances in the second quarter.”\nRussell Greenberg, Executive Vice President and CFO of Inter Parfums, Inc., pointed out, “In the current first quarter, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had the expected impact on our top and bottom lines, as the average U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate was 1.23, as compared to 1.065 in the first quarter of 2017. The weakness of the dollar had a favorable impact on our net sales while gross margins were negatively affected, because over 45% of net sales of our European operations are denominated in dollars, while almost all costs of our European operations are incurred in euro. Gross profit margin for European operations was 63.0% of sales for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 65.5% for the corresponding period of the prior year. With the exception of the lower tax rate noted earlier, there were no other unusual operating or non-operating fluctuations for the quarter.”\nMr. Greenberg also pointed out, “We closed the first quarter with working capital of $401 million, including approximately $251 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a working capital ratio of almost 3.4 to 1 and $56.0 million of long-term debt, including current maturities, incurred in connection with the 2015 Rochas brand acquisition.”\nAffirms 2018 Guidance\nMr. Greenberg concluded, “As we reported last month, we expect 2018 net sales to approximate $665 million and net income per diluted share attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. to come in at $1.59. Guidance assumes the dollar remains at current levels.”\nDividend\nThe Company’s regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share is payable on July 13, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 29, 2018.\nConference Call\nManagement will conduct a conference call to discuss financial results and business developments at 11:00 am ET on Wednesday, May 9, 2018.
