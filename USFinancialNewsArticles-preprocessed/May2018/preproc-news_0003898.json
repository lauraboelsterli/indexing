(NASDAQ: SBT), the holding company of Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B., today reported unaudited financial results for its first quarter\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, net income totaled $15.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, based on 53.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. This compares to fourth quarter 2017 net income of $6.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, based on 49.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For the first quarter of 2017, net income totaled $10.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, based on 45.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\n“We are very pleased with our strong start to 2018, as we delivered excellent growth in our revenue streams combined with well controlled expenses,” said Gary Judd, Chairman and CEO of Sterling Bancorp. “As a result, we generated a 30% year-over-year increase in earnings per share and continued to deliver the superior level of returns that made us the top performing community bank in the United States in 2017, as recognized by SNL/S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n“We continue to see strong demand for residential mortgage loans in our target markets, and we increased the volume of loans sold into the secondary market as part of our balance sheet management strategy. Given our healthy loan pipeline, we expect to continue to strategically utilize loan sales to mitigate pressure on our net interest margin going forward, which we believe will enable us to continue to generate profitable growth for our shareholders,” said Mr. Judd.\nFinancial Highlights (Unaudited)\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) At or for the Three Months Ended 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Net income $ 15,749 $ 6,531 $ 10,416 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.30 $ 0.13 $ 0.23 Net interest income before provision for loan losses $ 28,195 $ 26,915 $ 21,871 Net interest margin 3.89 % 3.97 % 4.07 % Noninterest income $ 6,037 $ 2,826 $ 5,586 Noninterest expense $ 11,503 $ 11,943 $ 9,092 Loans held for investment, net $ 2,580,560 $ 2,594,357 $ 2,003,019 Deposits $ 2,291,165 $ 2,245,110 $ 1,722,148 Nonperforming loans $ 5,115 $ 783 $ 640 Allowance for loan losses to total loans 0.74 % 0.71 % 0.77 % Allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans 374 % 2,357 % 2,432 % Provision for loan losses $ 641 $ 600 $ 600 Net charge offs (recoveries) $ (34 ) $ (668 ) $ (145 ) ROA 2.13 % 0.94 % 1.89 % ROE 22.17 % 11.46 % 24.80 % Efficiency ratio 33.6 % 40.2 % 33.1 % Operating Results for the First Quarter 2018\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $28.2 million, an increase of 4.8% from $26.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income from the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to a $185 million increase in average interest earning assets, partially offset by the effects of an 8 basis point decrease in the net interest margin.\nRelative to the first quarter of 2017, net interest income increased 28.9% from $21.9 million. The increase in net interest income from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to a $748 million increase in average interest earning assets, partially offset by the effects of an 18 basis point decrease in the net interest margin.\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.89%, compared to 3.97% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily attributable to a 5 basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets and a 10 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits.\nRelative to the first quarter of 2017, the net interest margin decreased from 4.07%, primarily due to a 32 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 2 basis point increase in the average yield on interest earning assets.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.0 million, an increase from $2.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily the result of a $3.1 million increase in the gain on sale of loans due to an increase in the amount of residential mortgages sold in the secondary market compared to the prior period.\nNoninterest income increased from $5.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of a $0.2 million increase in service charges and fees and a $0.2 million increase in other income.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.5 million, compared with $11.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower salary expense, as well as $0.2 million of expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the Company’s initial public offering.\nRelative to the first quarter of 2017, noninterest expense increased from $9.1 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses and occupancy and equipment costs required to support the growth in the Company’s operations.\nThe Company’s operating efficiency ratio was 33.6% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 40.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 33.1% in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 29%, compared with 62% and 41% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to first quarter of 2017 was attributable to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate that was effective January 1, 2018. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes the effect of the re-measurement of the Company’s net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company continues to expect that its effective tax rate for 2018 will be in the range of 28% to 30%. The actual annual effective tax rate will vary depending upon the mix of the Company’s taxable income by state.\nLoan Portfolio\nTotal loans, which includes those held for investment and held for sale, were $2.80 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $2.73 billion at December 31, 2017. Contributing to the increase were an $88 million increase in residential real estate loans and a $6 million increase in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a $20 million decrease in the commercial real estate and construction loan portfolio, which decrease was driven by loan payoffs.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company originated $408 million in loans, which included $349 million in residential mortgage loans, $5 million in commercial real estate loans, $44 million in construction loans and $10 million in commercial and industrial loans.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits were $2.29 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $2.25 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a $123 million increase in retail deposits, partially offset by a $77 million decrease in brokered deposits.\nCredit Quality\nNonperforming assets totaled $8.1 million, or 0.27% of total assets, at March 31, 2018, compared with $3.8 million, or 0.13% of total assets, at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a large residential real estate loan being placed on non-accrual. The Company believes that no impairment exists, as there is more than sufficient collateral value supporting the loan.\nNet recoveries for the first quarter of 2018 were $34,000 and there were no charge offs during the quarter.\nWith the lack of charge offs and no specific reserves required for the large loan placed on non-accrual, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $641,000 for the first quarter of 2018, comparable with the provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company’s allowance for loan losses was 0.74% of total loans and 374% of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018, compared with 0.71% and 2,357%, respectively, at December 31, 2017.\nCapital\nAt March 31, 2018, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III and was considered to be a “well-capitalized” financial institution, as summarized in the following tables:\nWell\nCapitalized\nCompany Actual at\nMarch 31, 2018 Total adjusted capital to risk-weighted assets N/A 20.38 % Tier 1 (core) capital to risk-weighted assets N/A 15.77 % Tier 1 (core) capital to adjusted tangible assets N/A 9.73 % Common Tier 1 (CET 1) N/A 15.77 % Well\nCapitalized Sterling Bank Actual at\nMarch 31, 2018 Total adjusted capital to risk-weighted assets 10.00 % 15.07 % Tier 1 (core) capital to risk-weighted assets 8.00 % 14.02 % Tier 1 (core) capital to adjusted tangible assets 5.00 % 8.65 % Common Tier 1 (CET 1) 6.50 % 14.02 % Conference Call and Webcast\nManagement will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's financial results.
