    "text": "May 5, 2018 / 4:55 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Astros' Cole fans 16 in one-hitter against Diamondbacks Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nHouston right-hander Gerrit Cole struck out a career-high 16 and gave up only one hit in his first career shutout and the Astros broke a three-game losing streak with an 8-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field on Friday.\nThe top four in the Houston lineup — George Springer, Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and Yuli Gurriel — combined for 11 hits, eight runs and seven RBIs for the Astros, who entered the series with a 28-inning scoreless drought and three losses in their past four games.\nCole has 77 strikeouts in his first seven starts with the Astros, the most for a pitcher in his first seven starts with a new team in big league history, according to Elias. Chris Sale had 73 with Boston last year. Cole struck out the side in the second, third and fourth innings and threw 114 pitches.\nCorrea had two doubles and drove in three runs, Gurriel had fur hits and drove in three, and Springer had three hits and scored three runs.\nCole has four double-digit strikeout games this season, and he set his previous career high with 14 in a 3-2 victory over Texas on April 13. He struck out the side in the second, third and fourth innings.\nCole retired the first nine and 12 of the first 13, giving up only a walk to David Peralta in the fourth inning until Chris Owings doubled with one out in the fifth.\nArizona right-hander Kris Medlen (0-1) gave up nine hits and seven runs in four innings in his first major league start since May 10, 2016, while with Kansas City. He was recalled from Triple-A Reno after Robbie Ray suffered an oblique strain. Medlen stuck out four and walked four.\nHouston took a 2-0 lead in the first inning. Springer singled on the first pitch of the game and advanced on a wild pitch on the second. Altuve doubled to drive in Springer, and Gurriel singled to drove in Altuve.\nSpringer beat out an infield single and Altuve walked with two outs in the second before Correa doubled into the right field corner for a 4-0 lead.\nSpringer beat out another infield single in the fourth inning and scored on Correa’s two-out double. Gurriel singled in Correa, took second on a wild pitch and scored on Josh Reddick’s single. It was 7-0.\nArizona right fielder Jarrod Dyson extended his glove over the right field fence to take a home run away from Jake Marisnick in the fifth inning.\n—Field Level Media",
