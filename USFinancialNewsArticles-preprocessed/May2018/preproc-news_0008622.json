    "text": "CLEVELAND, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG), a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components, today reported results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the second quarter include:\nNet sales of $933.1 million, up 7.4% from $868.7 million; Net income from continuing operations of $201.8 million, up 29.6% from $155.7 million; Earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.63, up 30.6% from $2.78; EBITDA As Defined of $463.1 million, up 9.8% from $421.7 million; Adjusted earnings per share of $3.79, up 25.1% from $3.03; and Upward revision to fiscal 2018 sales, EBITDA As Defined and adjusted earnings per share guidance.\nNet sales for the quarter rose 7.4%, or $64.4 million, to $933.1 million from $868.7 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. Organic sales growth was 6.6%.\nNet income from continuing operations for the quarter rose 29.6% to $201.8 million, or $3.63 per share, compared to $155.7 million, or $2.78 per share, in the comparable quarter a year ago. The current quarter was positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (tax reform) of 18.3% compared to 27.7% in the second quarter of 2017. The balance of the increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales described above and improvements to our operating margin resulting from the strength of our proprietary products and continued productivity efforts. This growth in net income was partially offset by higher interest expense.\nNet loss from discontinued operations in the quarter was $5.6 million, or $0.10 loss per share attributable to the sale of Schroth.\nAdjusted net income for the quarter rose 24.5% to $210.8 million, or $3.79 per share, from $169.3 million, or $3.03 per share, in the comparable quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share in the current fiscal year includes $0.41 of favorable impact from the enactment of tax reform. Excluding this favorable tax impact, current earnings per share of $3.38 increased 11.6% over the prior year.\nEBITDA for the quarter increased 10.5% to $439.4 million from $397.7 million for the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the period increased 9.8% to $463.1 million compared with $421.7 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 49.6%.\n\" We are pleased with our second quarter and fiscal first half results,\" stated W. Nicholas Howley, TransDigm Group's Executive Chairman. \"Our focused value driven operating strategy continues to generate real intrinsic shareholder value. The commercial aftermarket revenues were again quite encouraging. During the quarter we announced and have now closed the acquisition of two proprietary aerospace businesses for a purchase price of approximately $575 million.\"\nOn January 26, 2018, TransDigm completed the sale of Schroth in a management buyout to a private equity fund and certain members of Schroth management for approximately $61 million.\nOn March 15, 2018, TransDigm completed the acquisition of the Kirkhill business from Esterline for approximately $50 million. Kirkhill is a leading supplier of highly engineered elastomers used in a variety of most commercial transport and military platforms.\nSubsequent to the quarter, on April 24, 2018, TransDigm completed the acquisition of Extant Components Group Holdings, Inc. a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus LLC, for approximately $525 million. Extant exclusively licenses or acquires proprietary aftermarket focused products from leading aerospace and defense OEM's. Extant then supports these products over the significant remaining useful lives of the aircraft on which the equipment is installed.\nYear-to-Date Results\nNet sales for the twenty-six week period ended March 31, 2018 rose 5.8% to $1,781.0 million from $1,682.7 million in the comparable period last year. Organic net sales growth was 4.8%.\nNet income from continuing operations for the twenty-six week period ended March 31, 2018 increased 87.2% to $513.9 million, or $8.23 per share, compared with $274.6 million, or $3.17 per share, in the comparable period last year. The current twenty-six week period was positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate due to tax reform. The current effective tax rate was a benefit of 17.3% compared to a provision of 22.5% for the first half of fiscal 2017. The balance of the increase in net income primarily reflects growth in net sales described above, lower refinancing costs and lower acquisition-related costs, as well as improvements to our operating margin resulting from the strength of our proprietary products and continued productivity efforts. This growth in net income was partially offset by higher interest expense due to an increase in the level of outstanding borrowings to $11.8 billion from $11.2 billion outstanding in the comparable period last year.\nEarnings per share were reduced in both 2018 and 2017 by $1.01 per share and $1.71 per share, respectively, representing dividend equivalent payments made during each year.\nNet loss from discontinued operations in the twenty-six week period ended March 31, 2018 was $2.8 million, or $0.05 loss per share.\nAdjusted net income for the twenty-six week period ended March 31, 2018 rose 66.9% to $520.9 million, or $9.37 per share, from $312.0 million, or $5.55 per share, in the comparable period a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share in the current fiscal year includes $3.37 of favorable impact from the enactment of tax reform. Excluding this favorable tax impact, current earnings per share of $6.00 increased 8.1% over the prior year.\nEBITDA for the twenty-six week period ended March 31, 2018 increased 14.1% to $822.0 million from $720.7 million for the comparable period a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the period increased 7.7% to $864.7 million compared with $802.9 million in the comparable period a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the period was 48.5%.\nPlease see the attached tables for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, and adjusted net income; a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, and a reconciliation of earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for the periods discussed in this press release.\nF i scal 2018 Outlook\nMr. Howley continued, \"We are updating our full year guidance to include the two recent acquisitions and our strong operating performance to date. At the mid-point, we are increasing our revenue guidance by $95 million, EBITDA as Defined guidance by $25 million, and our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.40 per share.\"\nAssuming no additional acquisitions, TransDigm now expects fiscal 2018 financial guidance to be as follows:\nNet sales are anticipated to be in the range of $3,740 million to $3,820 million compared with $3,504 million in fiscal 2017; Net income from continuing operations is anticipated to be in the range of $902 million to $938 million compared with $629 million in fiscal 2017; Earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be in the range of $15.22 to $15.86 per share based upon weighted average shares outstanding of 55.6 compared with $8.45 per share in fiscal 2017; EBITDA As Defined is anticipated to be in the range of $1,830 million to $1,880 million compared with $1,711 million in fiscal 2017; and Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $17.35 to $17.99 per share compared with $12.38 per share in fiscal 2017.\nPlease see the attached table 6 for a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined to net income and reported earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share guidance mid-point estimated for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. Additionally, please see the attached table 7 for comparison of the current fiscal year 2018 guidance versus the previously issued fiscal year 2018 guidance.\nEarnings Conference Call\nTransDigm Group will host a conference call for investors and security analysts on May 1, 2018, beginning at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time.

In addition to the $700 million of new term loans, TransDigm Group or one if its subsidiaries may also seek to raise approximately $500 million of new subordinated debt.\nTransDigm Group intends to use the net proceeds from the incremental term loan and any new subordinated debt to replenish the cash used to fund the purchase price for its acquisitions of the Kirkhill elastomers business and Extant Components Group Holding, Inc. This cash and the remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including potential future acquisitions, dividends or repurchases under its stock repurchase program.\nIn connection with the incremental term loan, TransDigm Group will make a presentation to its lenders on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 beginning at 1:30 p.m., Eastern Time. Additional information will be available via Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC.\nAbout TransDigm Group\nTransDigm Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today. Major product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, NiCad batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, rods and locking devices, engineered connectors and elastomers, databus and power controls, cockpit security components and systems, specialized cockpit displays, aircraft audio systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered interior surfaces and related components, lighting and control technology, military personnel parachutes, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Information\nEBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release as supplemental disclosures to net income and reported results. TransDigm Group defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and defines EBITDA As Defined as EBITDA plus certain non-operating items, refinancing costs, acquisition-related costs, transaction-related costs and non-cash charges incurred in connection with certain employee benefit plans. TransDigm Group defines adjusted net income as net income plus purchase accounting backlog amortization expense, effects from the sale on businesses, refinancing costs, acquisition-related costs, transaction-related costs and non-cash charges incurred in connection with certain employee benefit plans. EBITDA As Defined Margin represents EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales. TransDigm Group defines adjusted diluted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the total shares for basic and diluted earnings per share. For more information regarding the computation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined and adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, please see the attached financial tables.\nTransDigm Group presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they are useful indicators of its operating performance. TransDigm Group believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes, capitalized asset values and employee compensation structures, all of which can vary substantially from company to company. In addition, analysts, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company's ability to incur and service debt. EBITDA As Defined is used to measure TransDigm Inc.'s compliance with the financial covenant contained in its credit facility. TransDigm Group's management also uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess its operating performance, to prepare its annual budget and financial projections and to review and evaluate its management team in connection with employee incentive programs. Moreover, TransDigm Group's management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions and as a liquidity measure. In addition, TransDigm Group's management uses adjusted net income as a measure of comparable operating performance between time periods and among companies as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance.\nNone of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share is a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and such financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, TransDigm Group's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAlthough we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nneither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, on our indebtedness; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements; the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined; neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and EBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release that are not historical facts, including statements under the heading \"Fiscal 2018 Outlook,\" are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Words such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" or \"continue\" and other words and terms of similar meaning may identify forward-looking statements.\nAll forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could affect TransDigm Group's actual results and could cause its actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, TransDigm Group. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: the sensitivity of our business to the number of flight hours that our customers' planes spend aloft and our customers' profitability, both of which are affected by general economic conditions; future geopolitical or worldwide events; cyber-security threats and natural disasters; our reliance on certain customers; the U.S. defense budget and risks associated with being a government supplier; failure to maintain government or industry approvals; failure to complete or successfully integrate acquisitions; our substantial indebtedness; potential environmental liabilities; increases in raw material costs, taxes and labor costs that cannot be recovered in product pricing; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; and other risk factors. Further information regarding the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results can be found in TransDigm Group's Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports that TransDigm Group or its subsidiaries have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Therefore, Schroth was classified as held-for-sale and as discontinued operations beginning September 30, 2017 for all periods presented. The Company acquired Schroth in February 2017.
