    "text": "BETHLEHEM, Pa., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OraSure Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:OSUR), a leader in point-of-care diagnostic tests and specimen collection devices, today announced its consolidated financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nConsolidated net revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $42.0 million, a 29% increase from the first quarter of 2017. Consolidated net product revenues were $38.3 million, representing a 22% increase over the first quarter of 2017.\nNet molecular collection systems revenues were $18.4 million during the first quarter of 2018, which represents a 72% increase over the first quarter of 2017.\nInternational sales of the Company’s OraQuick ® HIV products of $5.7 million increased 117% compared to the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily the result of higher sales of the Company’s HIV self-test.\nInternational sales of the Company’s OraQuick ® HCV product of $665,000 for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 85% compared to the first quarter of 2017 as a result of the non-renewal of a foreign government supply contract in support of a countrywide HCV eradication program at the end of 2017. This program contributed $2.8 million of sales during the first quarter of 2017.\nConsolidated net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.1 million, or $0.03 per share, which compares to consolidated net income of $12.4 million, or $0.21 per share on a fully diluted basis, for the first quarter of 2017. Consolidated net loss for the current quarter included $6.4 million of transition costs associated the retirement of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and the hiring of their successors. These transition costs approximated $0.10 per share and primarily consist of non-cash stock compensation charges. Consolidated net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included a $12.5 million gain related to the settlement of litigation against Ancestry.com DNA and its contract manufacturer. This gain was accounted for as a reduction of operating expenses and approximated $0.16 per share on an after-tax and fully diluted basis in that period.\nCash and investments totaled $178.4 million and working capital amounted to $175.6 million at March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased to see that our growth strategy is delivering the expected results and 2018 is off to a strong start,” said Stephen S. Tang, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of OraSure Technologies. “Our first quarter benefitted from robust growth in sales of our molecular collections and international HIV products. Importantly, we expect to see continued growth from those businesses for the remainder of the year. Our years of planning and investment are paying off and OraSure has never been financially stronger than it is now. We see significant opportunity in our existing markets and we will look to expand our addressable markets where possible.”\nFinancial Results\nConsolidated net product revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 22% over the comparable period of 2017, primarily as a result of higher sales of the Company’s molecular collections products and higher international sales of the OraQuick ® HIV self-test, partially offset by lower international sales of the OraQuick ® HCV test. First quarter 2018 sales of the OraQuick ® HIV self-test included $985,000 of support payments under the Company’s charitable support agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (“Gates Foundation”).\nConsolidated other revenues were $3.7 million and $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other revenues in the first quarter of 2018 included royalty income of $1.6 million associated with a litigation settlement agreement, Ebola and Zika-related funding received from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (“BARDA”) of $1.5 million and cost reimbursement under the Company’s charitable support agreement with the Gates Foundation of $529,000, which is separate from the support payments mentioned above. Other revenues in the first quarter of 2017 consisted only of BARDA funding.\nConsolidated gross margin was 58% and 62% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Gross margin was lower for the current quarter primarily due to an increase in lower margin product sales and a decrease in the absorption of fixed costs as a result of lower production levels in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by an increase in other revenues and lower scrap and spoilage costs as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nConsolidated operating expenses increased to $25.0 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was largely due to the inclusion in the current quarter of $6.4 million of transition costs as discussed above and the absence of the $12.5 million litigation gain associated with the settlement of litigation against Ancestry.com DNA that was included in the first quarter of 2017. There was no similar gain recorded during the first quarter of 2018. The first quarter of 2018 also included higher spending on the Company’s Ebola and Zika products and higher staffing and consulting costs, partially offset by a reduction in legal expenses.\nThe Company reported an operating loss of $498,000 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to operating income of $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome tax expense was $2.0 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.9 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Income tax expense in the first quarter of 2017 included the additional taxes due as a result of the $12.5 million litigation settlement gain. Income tax expense in the first quarter of 2018 reflects the higher pre-tax income generated by the Company’s Canadian subsidiary.\nThe Company’s cash and investment balance totaled $178.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $176.6 million at December 31, 2017. Working capital was $175.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $189.7 million at December 31, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated $7.6 million in cash from operations.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook\nThe Company expects consolidated net revenues to range from $42.0 million to $42.5 million and is projecting consolidated net income of approximately $0.03 per share for the second quarter of 2018. These results include approximately $1.7 million in final management transition costs projected for the quarter.\nFinancial Data\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Data\n(In thousands, except per-share data)\nUnaudited\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Results of Operations Net revenues $ 41,987 $ 32,546 Cost of products sold 17,520 12,236 Gross profit 24,467 20,310 Operating expenses: Research and development 4,075 2,970 Sales and marketing 7,499 6,877 General and administrative 13,391 7,092 Gain on litigation settlement — (12,500 ) Total operating expenses 24,965 4,439 Operating income (loss) (498 ) 15,871 Other income 412 467 Income (loss) before income taxes (86 ) 16,338 Income tax expense 2,033 3,897 Net income (loss) $ (2,119 ) $ 12,441 Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ (0.03 ) $ 0.22 Diluted $ (0.03 ) $ 0.21 Weighted average shares: Basic 60,865 56,929 Diluted 60,865 58,772 Summary of Net Revenues by Market and Product (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, Dollars Percentage\nof Total Net\nRevenues 2018 2017 %\nChange 2018 2017 Market Infectious disease testing $ 14,170 $ 14,583 (3 )% 34 % 45 % Risk assessment testing 3,002 3,130 (4 ) 7 10 Cryosurgical systems 2,785 3,063 (9 ) 6 9 Molecular collection systems 18,361 10,706 72 44 33 Net product revenues 38,318 31,482 22 91 97 Other 3,669 1,064 245 9 3 Net revenues $ 41,987 $ 32,546 29 % 100 % 100 %\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 %\nChange OraQuick ® Revenues Domestic HIV $ 3,344 $ 3,812 (12 )% International HIV 5,737 2,644 117 Domestic OTC HIV 1,632 1,542 6 Net HIV revenues 10,713 7,998 34 Domestic HCV 1,627 1,709 (5 ) International HCV 665 4,402 (85 ) Net HCV revenues 2,292 6,111 (62 ) Net product revenues $ 13,005 $ 14,109 (8 )%\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 %\nChange Cryosurgical Systems Revenues Domestic professional $ 875 $ 1,496 (42 )% International professional 150 130 15 Domestic OTC 289 285 1 International OTC 1,471 1,152 28 Net product revenues $ 2,785 $ 3,063 (9 )%\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 %\nChange Molecular Collection Systems Revenues Commercial Genomics $ 14,256 $ 7,254 97 % Academic Genomics 2,832 2,685 5 Microbiome 1,273 767 66 Net product revenues $ 18,361 $ 10,706 72 %\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 %\nChange Other Revenues Royalty income $ 1,602 $ - N/A BARDA funding 1,538 1,064 45 % Charitable support reimbursement 529 - N/A Other revenues $ 3,669 $ 1,064 245 % Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 64,065 $ 72,869 Short-term investments 79,446 83,028 Accounts receivable, net 28,197 42,521 Inventories 20,907 19,343 Other current assets 4,139 4,144 Property and equipment, net 22,975 21,372 Intangible assets, net 7,390 8,223 Goodwill 19,584 20,083 Long-term investments 34,880 20,690 Other non-current assets 4,340 3,928 Total assets $ 285,923 $ 296,201 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Accounts payable $ 9,622 $ 10,228 Deferred revenue 1,799 1,314 Other current liabilities 9,765 20,695 Other non-current liabilities 4,258 3,932 Deferred income taxes 1,761 1,951 Stockholders’ equity 258,718 258,081 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 285,923 $ 296,201\nThree Months Ended March 31, Additional Financial Data (Unaudited) 2018 2017 Capital expenditures $ 1,897 $ 878 Depreciation and amortization $ 1,868 $ 1,419 Stock-based compensation $ 7,483 $ 1,518 Cash provided by operating activities $ 7,636 $ 12,619 Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast for analysts and investors to discuss the Company’s 2018 first quarter financial results, certain business developments and financial guidance for the second quarter of 2018, beginning today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time).
