    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Accuray Incorporated (NASDAQ: ARAY) today reported financial results for the third fiscal quarter .\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\nRevenue increased 3 percent year over year to $99.8 million driven by service revenue growth of 15 percent Gross orders were $74.9 million; net orders were $40.9 million. Ending backlog increased 4 percent year over year to $468.1 million Strong demand for Radixactâ„¢ System results in largest number of orders for any single quarter since launch Retired $40 million principal amount of 2018 convertible notes, reducing potential shareholder dilution\n\"Market acceptance of our Radixact System, as well as strong sales of our latest software upgrades, have been key factors in our continuing market momentum,\" said Joshua H. Levine, president and chief executive officer. \"Radixact's positioning as a highly efficient and versatile treatment platform capable of treating both ends of the case mix spectrum from routine to highly complex cases, continues to resonate with customers and is driving an expanded market opportunity for Accuray.\"\nFiscal Third Quarter Results\nTotal revenue was $99.8 million compared to $97.3 million in the prior fiscal year third quarter. Product revenue totaled $43.2 million compared to $48.0 million in the prior fiscal year third quarter, while service revenue totaled $56.6 million compared to $49.3 million in the prior fiscal year third quarter. The increase in service revenue was primarily driven by upgrade related sales.\nTotal gross profit for the 2018 fiscal third quarter was $36.2 million, or 36.3 percent of sales, comprised of product gross margin of 41.4 percent and service gross margin of 32.4 percent. This compares to total gross profit of $35.4 million, or 36.4 percent of sales, comprised of product gross margin of 38.4 percent and service gross margin of 34.4 percent for the prior fiscal year third quarter.\nOperating expenses were $40.1 million, an increase of 9 percent compared with $36.7 million in the prior fiscal third quarter. The increase is primarily due to investments in both research and development and commercial infrastructure mainly in the US sales organization.\nNet loss was $8.9 million, or $0.10 per share, for the 2018 fiscal third quarter, compared to a net loss of $5.0 million, or $0.06 per share, for the 2017 fiscal third quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the 2018 fiscal third quarter was $1.4 million, compared to $7.1 million in the prior fiscal year third quarter.\nCash, cash equivalents, investments and short-term restricted cash were $73.2 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $106.1 million as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to $40 million cash used for the settlement of convertible notes in February 2018.\nFiscal Nine Month Results\nFor the nine months , gross product orders totaled $208.5 million compared to $212.6 million for the same prior fiscal year period.\nTotal revenue for the nine months was $291.1 million compared to $271.3 million in the prior fiscal year period. Product revenue totaled $129.3 million compared to $119.0 million, while service revenue totaled $161.8 million compared to $152.3 million in the prior fiscal year period. The increase in service revenue is primarily driven by upgrade related sales. Product revenue increased primarily due to backlog conversion of orders to revenue from the EIMEA region.\nTotal gross profit for the nine months was $113.7 million, or 39.1 percent of sales, comprised of product gross margin of 42.5 percent and service gross margin of 36.3 percent. This compares to total gross profit of $98.2 million, or 36.2 percent of sales, comprised of product gross margin of 36.2 percent and service gross margin of 36.1 percent for the same prior fiscal year period. The increase in product gross margin stemmed from lower intangible amortization as well as product and channel mix.\nOperating expenses were $120.6 million, an increase of 9 percent compared with $110.8 million in the prior fiscal year period. The increase is primarily due to investments in research and development and our commercial organization.\nNet loss was $23.0 million, or $0.27 per share, for the nine months , compared to a net loss of $24.3 million, or $0.30 per share, for the prior fiscal year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the nine months was $9.3 million, compared to $10.1 million in the prior fiscal year period.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe company updated its fiscal year 2018 guidance. Details are summarized as follows:\nRevenue: $395.0 million to $400.0 million. This is adjusted from the previous revenue range of $390.0 million to $400.0 million; Gross Orders: The company is reaffirming gross orders growth of approximately 5 percent year over year; and Adjusted EBITDA: Approximately $18.0 to $20.0 million. This is adjusted from the previous range of $25 million to $30 million due to strategic investments and lower than anticipated gross margins\nGuidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes amortization of intangibles, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, interest expense, net and provision for income taxes.
