    "text": "Continued Global Galafold ® (Migalastat) Adoption and Expansion – Reaffirms FY18 Revenue Guidance of $75M-$85M at Top End of Range\nSignificant Momentum with Pompe Clinical, Regulatory and Manufacturing Activities - GMP Manufacturing Campaigns of ATB200 Drug Substance and Drug Product Completed at 1000L Scale\n$605.2M Cash Balance to Support Current Operating Plan and Invest in Rare Metabolic Disease Pipeline\nConference Call and Webcast Today at 8:30am ET\nCRANBURY, N.J., Amicus Therapeutics (Nasdaq:FOLD), a global biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing and delivering novel medicines for rare metabolic diseases, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company also summarized recent program updates and reiterated full-year 2018 revenue and net cash spend guidance.\nJohn F. Crowley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. stated, “Since the beginning of 2018, we have successfully executed across our five key strategic priorities for the year. We are on track to more than double our Galafold ® revenue from last year, we secured approval of Galafold in Japan, and we have advanced our Pompe clinical, manufacturing and regulatory activities. Along with our key value drivers in Fabry and Pompe, we continue to evaluate other potential first- or best-in-class technologies that we believe may deliver significant benefits for many more people living with rare metabolic diseases. Today, more than ever, we are well positioned to achieve our vision to impact as many people as possible who are living with rare metabolic diseases as we continue to build a leading global rare disease biotech company.”\n2018 Key Strategic Priorities\nDouble global revenue for Galafold ($75 million - $85 million) Secure approvals for migalastat in Japan and the U.S. Achieve clinical, manufacturing and regulatory milestones to advance AT-GAA (also known as ATB200/AT2221) toward global regulatory submissions and approvals as soon as possible Develop and expand preclinical pipeline to ensure at least one new clinical program in 2019 Maintain a strong balance sheet\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results and Full-Year 2018 Financial Guidance\nTotal revenue in the first quarter 2018 was $16.7 million, a year-over-year increase of 300% from total revenue of $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $605.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $358.6 million at December 31, 2017. Total operating expenses increased to $70.3 million for the first quarter 2018 compared to $55.4 million in the first quarter 2017 reflecting increased investment in Pompe clinical and manufacturing activities as well as Galafold commercial launch and launch preparations. Net cash spend was $48.0 million for the first quarter 2018. Net loss was $49.9 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to a net loss of $55.0 million, or $0.39 per share, for the first quarter 2017.\n“The first quarter of 2018 marked another period of continued growth for Galafold and our strongest balance sheet in our Company’s history,” said Bradley L. Campbell, President and COO of Amicus Therapeutics. “We are confident in our ability to achieve the high end of our full-year 2018 Galafold revenue guidance given the current and anticipated increase in patient and physician adoption; expansion into new countries; and what we are seeing as a very high rate of compliance and adherence for this oral precision medicine.”\n2018 Financial Guidance\nFor the full-year 2018 the Company anticipates total Galafold revenue at the high end of the $75 million to $85 million guidance range. The Galafold revenue guidance includes anticipated revenue from countries with final pricing and reimbursement, and does not currently include potential partial year contributions from Japan or the U.S.\nThe Company continues to expect full-year 2018 net cash spend between $230 million and $260 million. The current cash position, including proceeds from the February 2018 equity offering and expected Galafold revenues, is sufficient to fund ongoing Fabry and Pompe program operations into at least 2021. Potential future business development collaborations, pipeline expansion, and investment in biologics manufacturing capabilities could impact the Company’s future capital requirements.\nProgram Highlights\nMigalastat for Fabry Disease\nAmicus is committed to advancing the highest quality therapies for all people living with Fabry disease. Migalastat is an oral precision medicine intended to treat Fabry disease in patients 16 years or older who have amenable genetic mutations. Regulatory authorities in the European Union, Japan, Switzerland, Israel, Canada, Australia, and South Korea have granted full approval for migalastat under the trade name Galafold. In the U.S., the FDA accepted the Company’s new drug application (NDA) for migalastat under priority review with a six-month PDUFA goal date of August 13, 2018.\nFor people with non-amenable mutations who are not eligible for migalastat as an oral precision medicine, the strategy is to advance next-generation therapies such as a novel Fabry ERT (ATB101) co-formulated with migalastat or other innovative technologies that continue to be evaluated.\nGlobal Fabry Updates:\nPricing and reimbursement secured in 18 countries with first commercial patients treated in multiple new countries in 2018 Approvals secured in EU, Australia, Canada, Japan, Israel, South Korea and Switzerland Launch team hired and trained in Japan to execute upcoming launch U.S. leadership, including Mike Keavany, to serve as Senior Vice President of the U.S. Business, and majority of field team now in place to support planned U.S. launch\nAnticipated Milestones:\nJapanese launch (2Q18) U.S. FDA regulatory decision (3Q18)\nAdvanced and Targeted GAA (AT-GAA, also known as ATB200/AT2221) for Pompe Disease\nAT-GAA is a novel treatment paradigm that consists of ATB200, a unique recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) enzyme with optimized carbohydrate structures, particularly mannose-6 phosphate (M6P), to enhance uptake, co-administered with AT2221, a pharmacological chaperone. During WORLD Symposium™ in February 2018, Amicus presented updated positive data from an ongoing global Phase 1/2 clinical study ( ATB200-02 ) to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and functional outcomes of AT-GAA across ambulatory ERT-switch patients (Cohort 1), non-ambulatory ERT-switch patients (Cohort 2), and ERT-naïve patients (Cohort 3).\nThe Company is engaged in ongoing collaborative discussions with U.S. and EU regulators regarding a registration-directed study for full approval, manufacturing activities, and the best and fastest pathway forward for this novel treatment regimen. Amicus is pursuing formal scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A scientific advice meeting with the EMA is scheduled in 2Q18. The Company expects to provide an update on the results from that meeting by the end of 2Q. In the U.S., ongoing interactions on this program include a Type C meeting to occur in early 3Q18. Amicus expects to provide an FDA update in 3Q after receipt of written minutes from this meeting. The Company continues to believe that the evolving regulatory path will include a series of further iterative discussions with regulators as the program advances and as additional data are collected, including data from ongoing studies, data from new patients being enrolled and the results of a formal natural history study of Pompe patients receiving current ERT standard of care.\nAmicus also continues to make progress with clinical and manufacturing activities to support the needs of the Pompe community.\nPompe Clinical Activities\nAll 19 patients for whom extension study data have been previously reported continue treatment with AT-GAA in the ongoing Phase 1/2 ATB200-02 clinical study Currently enrolling Cohort 4 (up to 10 additional ambulatory ERT-switch patients) in ATB200-02 study Supportive studies underway including a retrospective study (POM-002) on the natural history of Pompe disease in up to 100 ERT-treated Pompe patients to help provide context for the ATB200-02 clinical study results; and a prospective observational study (POM-003) to assess safety and functional outcomes in patients currently treated with standard of care ERT, and to serve as a potential run-in for a registration study\nPompe Manufacturing Activities:\nAs previously announced, FDA agreed on comparability between 250L scale and 1000L engineering batches, as well as the testing strategy for demonstrating comparability between 250L scale and 1000L GMP batches GMP production runs of ATB200 drug substance and drug product completed at 1,000L commercial scale\nAnticipated Upcoming Pompe Program Milestones:\nFull enrollment of additional patients in ATB200-02 clinical study Final demonstration of comparability between 1,000L GMP material and 250L material Pompe regulatory updates (2Q18 and 3Q18) Release of 1,000L GMP material for initiation of registration-directed study (2H18) 18-month data from ATB200-02 clinical study (4Q18)\nConference Call and Webcast\nAmicus Therapeutics will host a conference call and audio webcast today, May 8, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results and corporate updates.
