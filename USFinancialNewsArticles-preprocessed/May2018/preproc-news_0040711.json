    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., May 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skybox™ Security, a global leader in cybersecurity management, announced today a new partnership with Exclusive Networks for distribution of Skybox solutions in the Middle East, including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region and Egypt. Exclusive Networks will deploy and service the Skybox™ Security Suite, a broad security management platform that provides comprehensive attack surface visibility and enables unified vulnerability management and firewall/security policy management across an organization’s entire network, including in physical, multi-cloud and OT environments.\n“Driven by government outlays (with oil, gas and defence industries leading the charge), Middle East organisations are looking for trusted security advisors who can navigate digital transformations and reduce risks — especially as they deal with migration to the cloud, IT/OT convergence and a skills shortage. Skybox gives our business partners the tools needed to address these challenges — things like visibility, automation and advanced analytics,” said Oliver Downs, alliances manager for Exclusive Networks. “With Skybox, our partners have the power to more effectively manage security holistically within large, complex networks, including in physical, virtual, multi–cloud, and even OT environments.”\nExclusive Networks has been certified by Skybox for its expertise and ability to deliver the Skybox Security Suite, including any customization that is needed for specific security and business processes.
