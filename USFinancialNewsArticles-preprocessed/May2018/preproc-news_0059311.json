The primary focus of this study is to understand the investment and acquisition trends across these business models globally and what can be expected as an outcome going forward.\nThe study analyzes the investment activities by key market participants, which include shared mobility operators, OEMs, technology companies, and venture capitalists that are playing a significant role in being a part of the shared mobility industry today.\nKey Issues Addressed\n• What are the key criteria that venture capitalists and potential investors look into while investing in start-ups? Why do they attract more investments compared to established organizations?\n• What are the key markets for start-ups to venture into and what are the key trends in those markets?\n• What are the OEM investment patterns in the mobility space?\n• What are the different mobility value chains and what are the business models of key participants?\n• What are the future trends in the shared mobility market?\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/5402907\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: sarah@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +1 (718) 213 4904\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ma-investment-trends-and-opportunities-in-the-global-mobility-space-2017-300655437.html\nSOURCE ReportBuyer",
