    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Social Reality, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRAX), a digital marketing and consumer data management and distribution technology platform company, reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSRAX's CEO and Chairman Christopher Miglino, stated, \"2018 has been and will be a year of tremendous strategic change as we grow and monetize our verticals as well as launch our consumer data management and distribution system BIGtoken.com . Even as our first quarter experienced its typical seasonality, we achieved a gross margin above historical averages at 61%. Also, during the quarter, we continued to invest in sales, engineering and product development, which yielded several new launches. Regarding SRAXmd, our healthcare vertical, we have entered into a MOU, and our team is working diligently to close the transaction.\n\" BIGtoken.com development is proceeding quite well. In March, we released our Alpha version to test functionality, reward mechanisms and blockchain mechanics. We are receiving excellent, actionable feedback. As we move into Beta testing, we intend to include additional features with team-oriented components for gaming and social-oriented elements for data gathering. BIGtoken.com will provide a solution to many of today's privacy concerns by creating an ecosystem where advertisers and marketing companies obtain quality, verified data through secure blockchain technology designed to provide consumers with choice, awareness and rewards. We believe this addition will diversify our product portfolio and drive shareholder value.\"\nFinancial Results: First Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017\nGross revenue was $2.1 million, compared to $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, which included high volume, low-margin revenue as well as a larger contribution from SRAX Reach customers. Gross margin was 61% on gross profit of $1.3 million, compared to gross margin of 38% on gross profit of $2.0 million in the year ago quarter, reflecting the company's focus on high-margin revenue. Operating expenses were $4.1 million, compared to $5.2 million, which included $847,000 in one-time charges in the first quarter of 2017. Loss from operations improved to $2.8 million, compared to $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was $3.6 million, or $0.36 cents per share, compared to $3.9 million, or $0.50 cents per share in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $2.5 million, compared to $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents were $190,000 at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.0 million at December 31, 2017. The company renewed its $4 million credit facility with FastPay in April.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain additional one-time expenses. It is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). A detailed description and reconciliation of EBITDA and management's reasons for using this measure is set forth at the end of this press release.\nOther Recent Corporate Highlights:\nEntered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding in May 2018. The closing of the transaction is subject to the completion of due diligence and definitive agreements. As of the date hereof, none of these conditions have been met. Gathered useful feedback from the BIGtoken.com platform Alpha release to begin Beta testing. Launched SRAX Social's Intelligent Budget to facilitate allocation and payment amongst specific campaigns or client profiles. Unveiled SRAX Social's Auto-Boost to automatically enhance social advertising campaigns based on user-set rules and parameters. Bolstered SRAXshopper target verified shoppers visiting advertisers' key retailers with a single intended message across multiple devices and inventory sources.\nConference Call\nManagement will review the results on a conference call with a live question and answer session today, May 15, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET.

In addition to the company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from operations before depreciation and amortization expenses, stock-based compensation and one-time financing and transaction expense. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about Social Reality's operating results. The tables below provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP measure should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the\nThree Month Period Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet Loss\n$\n(3,609,620)\n$\n(3,920,922)\nplus\nEquity Based compensation\n166,130\n512,442\nAccretion of put liability\n—\n—\nAdjusted net loss\n$\n(3,443,490)\n$\n(3,408,480)\nRestructuring Costs\n—\n377,961\nWrite-off of non-compete agreement\n—\n468,751\nExchange Gain or Loss\n4,664\n—\nInterest Expense\n767,443\n711,446\nDepreciation and amortization\n175,625\n110,954\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(2,495,758)\n$\n(1,739,368)\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/srax-reports-first-quarter-of-2018-300648946.html\nSOURCE Social Reality, Inc.",
