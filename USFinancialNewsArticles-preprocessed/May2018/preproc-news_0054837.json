    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla., May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grom Social Enterprises (OTCQB:GRMM) (\"Grom\" or the \"Company\"), an innovative leader and pioneer in providing original social media content to children between the ages of five and 16, www.gromsocial.com ﻿; today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter March 31, 2018 Results\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported operating revenues of $2,032,672 compared to $1,708,681 for the same period in 2017, an increase of approximately 19%. Operating expenses decreased from $3,802,008 for the period ended March 31, 2017 to $2,083,307 compared to the same period ended in 2018, a decrease of approximately 62.7% Net loss for the first quarter in 2018 was $1,091,122 or $(0.01) per share, compared to $2,922,234 or $(0.03) per share in the comparable 2017 period.\nThe increase in revenues was attributable to increased animation revenues at the Company’s Top Draw animation division offset by a decline in revenues at Netspective webfiltering. Subscription and advertising revenue generated by our gromsocial.com website and from our “MamaBear” mobile software safety application for the period ended March 31, 2018 was nominal. The Company expects to start generating increasing levels of revenue from these sources in the second half of 2018. Additionally, the Company expects to generate revenues from its new nutritional product supplement for children that the Company expects to launch in the second half of 2018.\nThe decrease in operating expenses during the first quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to a reduction of approximately $1,478,000 in stock-based compensation, and due to a reduction of approximately $352,000 in professional fees, offset by an increase in general and administrative expense of approximately $180,000.\nDarren Marks, Grom Chairman and CEO stated, \"We remain strongly focused on our strategy which is growing our user base both organically and through synergistic acquisitions which also generate positive cash flow; and in developing original content, technology, branding and marketing the “Grom” name”. Mr. Marks further stated, “We recently launched an upgrade version of our acclaimed MamaBear app. The early results are very promising. Although we have yet to generate meaningful revenue from our base, we are getting much closer to achieving our goals. We appreciate the efforts of the Grom team and the support of our shareholder base who have enabled us to get to this stage without having to enter into expensive financings that could have negatively impacted our cap structure.\nAbout Grom Social Enterprises, Inc.\nGrom Social Enterprises, Inc. owns five separate subsidiaries, including Grom Social, a safe social media platform for kids between the ages of five and 16.
