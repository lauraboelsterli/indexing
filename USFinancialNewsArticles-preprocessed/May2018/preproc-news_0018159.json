We present these measures because we believe they and similar measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and financing structure. We also believe these measures facilitate the comparison of our operating performance and financing structure with other companies in our industry. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nGREEN BRICK PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\n2017\nSale of residential units $ 120,366 $ 93,397 Sale of land and lots 7,899 5,940 Total revenues 128,265 99,337 Cost of residential units 94,509 73,761 Cost of land and lots 6,626 4,290 Total cost of sales 101,135 78,051 Total gross profit 27,130 21,286 Salary expense 6,938 5,435 Selling, general and administrative expense 5,825 4,278 Operating profit 14,367 11,573 Equity in income of unconsolidated entity 1,536 — Other income, net 708 542 Income before taxes 16,611 12,115 Income tax provision 3,372 3,889 Net income 13,239 8,226 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,036 2,029 Net income attributable to Green Brick Partners, Inc. $ 11,203 $ 6,197 Net income attributable to Green Brick Partners, Inc. per common share: Basic $ 0.22 $ 0.13 Diluted $ 0.22 $ 0.13 Weighted average common shares used in the calculation of net income\nattributable to Green Brick Partners, Inc. per common share: Basic 50,577 48,958 Diluted 50,718 49,017 GREEN BRICK PARTNERS, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Increase (Decrease) New Homes Delivered and Home Sales Revenue 2018 2017 Change % New homes delivered 267 226 41 18.1 % Home sales revenue ($ in thousands) $ 120,366 $ 93,397 $ 26,969 28.9 % Average sales price of homes delivered $ 450,809 $ 413,261 $ 37,548 9.1 %\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Increase (Decrease) Land and Lots Sales Revenue 2018 2017 Change % Lots sold 48 47 1 2.1 % Lots sales revenue ($ in thousands) $ 6,749 $ 5,940 $ 809 13.6 % Average sales price of lots sold $ 140,604 $ 126,383 $ 14,221 11.3 % Land sales revenue ($ in thousands) $ 1,150 $ — $ 1,150 — %\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Increase (Decrease) New Home Orders and Backlog 2018 2017 Change % Net new home orders 434 287 147 51.2 % Average selling communities 55 51 4 7.8 % Selling communities at end of period 54 52 2 3.8 % Backlog ($ in thousands) $ 226,516 $ 145,164 $ 81,352 56.0 % Backlog (units) 477 298 179 60.1 % Average sales price of backlog $ 474,876 $ 487,128 $ (12,252 ) (2.5 )% The following table presents the non-GAAP measure of adjusted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 and reconciles these amounts to net income attributable to Green Brick as reported and prepared in accordance with GAAP.
