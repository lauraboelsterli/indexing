    "text": "CNBC.com Photo by fizkes via Getty Images\nThere's a website out there touting a hot initial coin offering, and it happens to be bogus.\nSo who created it? The Securities and Exchange Commission.\nHoweyCoins.com , set up to mimic other too-good-to-be-true coin offerings that have surged during the rise of bitcoin and other digital currencies, is a bogus site intended to help investors recognize investment scams.\nThe site details how investors can get in on the offer, which purportedly combines blockchain technology and travel. It even says HoweyCoins are registered with the U.S. government and will trade on an SEC-compliant exchange.\nThe site also includes aspects that regulators view as common enticements to fraudulent offerings, such as a complex white paper, promises of guaranteed returns and a countdown clock showing how long you have left to get in on the deal. show chapters 12:56 PM ET Mon, 30 April 2018 | 01:37\nWhen investors click on \"Buy coins now\" they are taken to an SEC site explaining they were about to be duped.\n\"We embrace new technologies, but we also want investors to see what fraud looks like, so we built this educational site with many of the classic warning signs of fraud,\" said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in a public statement.\nMore from Personal Finance:",
