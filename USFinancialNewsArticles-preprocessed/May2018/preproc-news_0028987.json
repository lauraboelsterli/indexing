    "text": "36 COMMENTS A federal jury on Friday convicted Sheldon Silver, the former powerful speaker of the New York State Assembly, on all counts in his second trial for public corruption. This is an important result with national implications for the prosecution of corrupt public officials.\nLast July an appellate court tossed out Silver’s first conviction on grounds that the prosecution’s jury instructions had violated the Supreme Court’s 2016 ruling on corruption in the case of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell.\nPotomac Watch Podcast\nPotomac Watch podcast: The fight over the FBI’s “top-secret” intelligence source, and Michael Cohen’s corporate clients. Critics of McDonnell have said the Court’s narrower definition of a corrupt “official act” made prosecutions of public officials too difficult. Friday’s successful conviction of Silver suggests these fears are overblown.\nThe worst of the corruption charges against Silver said he had used his high office to enrich himself by steering mesothelioma cases to a New York law firm, which gave him some $3 million in referral fees. At issue in the controversy over the McDonnell ruling was whether the High Court had been too restrictive in defining a quid-pro-quo exchange. Two juries have concluded that the deals Silver concocted to enrich himself were within the Court’s definition.\nThe McDonnell decision was a necessary corrective to abusive prosecutions. The Silver conviction reaffirms that public corruption does not have a free pass.",
