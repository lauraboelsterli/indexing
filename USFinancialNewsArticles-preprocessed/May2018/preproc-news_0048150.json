    "text": "(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp said on Wednesday it would invest more than $15 billion for research and development and capacity expansion in the United States over the next five years, spurred by the recent tax cuts.\nFILE PHOTO: United Technologies logo is displayed on a screen at the post where it's stock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 5, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The company also plans to hire 35,000 people in this period and spend about $75 billion with U.S. suppliers to strengthen local economies.\nThe maker of Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines said about $9 billion of the investment is expected to go towards research and development, including on artificial intelligence and autonomy.\nThe remaining $6 billion will be used to increase capacity in existing manufacturing facilities and improve efficiency.\nThe announcement comes at a time when the company is facing pressures from activist shareholders who believe that a breakup into three businesses could unlock $20 billion in value.\nReporting by Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Arun Koyyur\n ",
