    "text": "20 COMMENTS The investment chief of the nation’s largest public pension expects to leave his post by the end of the year, the latest in a series of executive exits from the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.\nTed Eliopoulos, 54 years old, made the surprise announcement at a public Calpers meeting Monday. The chief investment officer attributed the decision to “significant health considerations” for his younger daughter, who has been accepted to a school in New York. He and his wife plan to move to be close to that daughter.\n“I want to make sure that we give her every bit of support as we can as she makes the transition back east,” said Mr. Eliopoulos, who attended Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia.\nOver the past four years, Mr. Eliopoulos led a retreat from more expensive investments as the giant retirement system reduced return expectations, cut costs and tried to better protect the pension fund from the next economic downturn. His approach offered a contrast to forerunners who embraced a Wall Street-centered investment approach as a way of boosting returns.\nAssets have swelled to more than $355 billion from roughly $300 billion during his tenure. Returns reported by Calpers have trailed U.S. public pension medians in each fiscal year between 2015 and 2017 as measured by the Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service database. Calpers is up 7.9% through the first three quarters of fiscal 2018.\nMr. Eliopoulos’s announcement Monday follows a string of high-profile staff changes for Calpers, which is responsible for benefits to more than 1.9 million active or retired police officers, firefighters and other public employees.\nOther top Calpers investment officials that have recently left or announced plans to depart include longtime fixed-income chief Curtis Ishii, private-equity managing investment director Real Desrochers and chief operating investment officer Wylie Tollette. Mr. Eliopoulos will stay until his successor is named.\nThe former deputy treasurer for California joined Calpers in 2007 when he was hired to oversee Calpers’s real- estate portfolio amid a U.S. housing collapse. He produced a turnaround by favoring less complex assets with stable revenue and by reducing the number of partnerships.\nMr. Eliopoulos became acting investment chief in early 2014 as his predecessor, Joseph Dear, stepped away from his role due to an illness. Mr. Dear died in February of that year. Mr. Eliopoulos became the permanent investment chief in September 2014.\nHe didn’t waste any time shaking things up. He called for a re-evaluation of a hedge fund portfolio championed by Mr. Dear and eventually recommended all hedge-fund holdings be sold.\nThat move marked a significant shift for the retirement system. For decades Calpers had plowed into alternatives to stocks and bonds other systems once avoided because of their risk: hedge funds, private equity, timber and other commodities. Many other pensions around the country followed as Calpers emerged as a bellwether for investment trends.\nMr. Eliopoulos’s strategy was to make Calpers less complex as a way of avoiding certain problems it faced during the last financial crisis when some alternative holdings didn’t perform as expected.\nThat meant undoing the work of several predecessors. The retirement system decided to sever ties with many private equity, real estate and other outside firms handling its money and explore other ways to invest in private equity without traditional pooled funds.\nDirectors also agreed to a recommendation championed by Mr. Eliopoulos that long-term investment target drop to 7% from 7.5% because of changing market conditions and a cash crunch, a move that will likely trigger an increase in yearly pension bills for the towns, counties and school districts that participate in the California plan.\nSome moves made by Mr. Eliopoulos produced turmoil inside the typically staid halls of Calpers. A number of senior portfolio managers, hired when Mr. Dear aggressively expanded Calpers’s internal staff, exited or quit because they viewed the changes as a movement away from the fund’s trailblazing past, according to people familiar with the matter.\nHis overhaul had skeptics who worried that the turn toward austerity would mean years of low returns and that mistakes could be made as the system pruned external managers. One bad year can have serious consequences for cities and towns across California that may have to cough up more money if investments decline in value.\n“Instead of trying to be the low-cost operator of the industry, Calpers should focus on getting the most returns possible and being innovative,” said Don Steinbrugge, a managing partner with Richmond, Va.-based Agecroft Partners LLC, a hedge fund consulting firm that works with public pension funds. “Most people don’t view them as innovative anymore.”\nMr. Eliopoulos, who never worked on Wall Street, cut a different image from the investing veterans who held his job in past decades. He grew up around plumbers, mechanics and pilots in a middle-class neighborhood in San Mateo, just south of San Francisco.\nHis parents—a public school gym teacher and a community-college office assistant—held traditional pensions that were guaranteed no matter what happened to the stock or bond markets. He said his father told him it wouldn’t have been possible for the family to plan for a secure retirement without such certainty.\n“I saw it around the kitchen table,” he said in a previous interview with The Wall Street Journal. “Planning for your retirement; having secure health care when issues come up. They were all meaningful and real things to me.”\nWrite to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com and Dawn Lim at dawn.lim@wsj.com",
