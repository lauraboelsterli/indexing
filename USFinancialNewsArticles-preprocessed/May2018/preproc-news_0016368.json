REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nBy 0756 GMT, the FTSE advanced 0.2 percent at three-month highs, while the mid-cap FTMC index added 0.5 percent. London markets were closed on Monday for a bank holiday.\n“The (FTSE) index is...supported by a still depressed GBP while USD remains strong, both currencies at opposite ends of the spectrum of rate hike expectations ahead of their next policy meetings, the BoE this week and the Fed in June,” Accendo Markets analysts said in a note.\nShire rose 3.7 percent at 4000 pence, leading gainers on the FTSE. Takeda agreed to buy the rare disease specialist for 45.3 billion pounds on Tuesday after the Japanese company raised the amount of cash in its offer to secure a recommendation.\nShire traded below the agreed price of 4817 pence, reflecting that the deal would only be completed next year, traders said.\n“We expect Shire shares to...trade at a relatively wide 10-15 percent spread to the offer given close is not anticipated until the first half of 2019,” Jefferies analysts said in a note, adding the offer price was reasonable.\nElsewhere, declines in the pound helped big international companies such as Unilever, Imperial Brands , Compass and Experian advance.\nRoyal Mail was the biggest loser among British blue chips, falling 1.7 percent, following a disappointing update from German peer Deutsche Post DHL.\nSky fell 1.2 percent after U.S. cable operator Comcast formally notified the European Commission of its intention to bid for Britain’s pay-TV group, a source told Reuters.\nStill in M&A, Virgin Money said that it received an 1.6 billion pounds all-stock takeover offer from rival CYBG, sending its shares up 8.5 percent. CYBG, which owns Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank, also rose, up 1.5 percent.\nShares in other mid-sized lenders Metro Bank and OnesavingsBank also rose in response to the takeover offer, a sign that long-awaited consolidation of Britain’s so-called challenger banks could be starting.\nFirstgroup however fell 9.6 percent after U.S. private equity firm Apollo Global Management withdrew interest to buy the Bus and rail operator.
