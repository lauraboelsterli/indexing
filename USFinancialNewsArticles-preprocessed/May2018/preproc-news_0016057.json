    "text": "ELYRIA, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Invacare Corporation (NYSE: IVC) (\"Invacare\" or the \"company\") today reported results for the quarter\nHighlights\nReported net sales increased 2.3% to $237.1 million while constant currency net sales (a) decreased 4.4% compared to 1Q17 * . Constant currency sequential net sales (b) decreased 6.6% compared to 4Q17. Constant currency sequential net sales increased in the North America/Home Medical Equipment (\"NA/HME\") and Institutional Products (\"IPG\") segments but offset by declines in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments. The Europe segment has historically been impacted by seasonality with stronger sales in the second half versus the first half of the year. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was unchanged at 28.1% compared to 1Q17 primarily as a result of favorable manufacturing costs, including favorable impact from foreign currency, and reduced R&D expenses offset by increased freight costs, principally to support fulfillment of the order backlog carried over from 4Q17. Operating loss was $5.1 million, an improvement of $5.5 million compared to 1Q17, as operating profit increased for most of the business segments and restructuring costs decreased. GAAP loss per share was $0.43, compared to loss per share of $0.52 in 1Q17, and adjusted net loss per share (c) was $0.35 versus loss per share of $0.47 in 1Q17. Free cash flow (d) usage was $26.7 million compared to usage of $33.4 million in 1Q17. EBITDA (e) was negative $1.0 million, an improvement of $6.0 million compared to 1Q17. EBITDA in 1Q18 included an increase of $0.9 million related to equity compensation expense. Results in 1Q18 were not materially affected by the 4Q17 U.S. tax law change principally due to the company's domestic losses and valuation reserves.\nKey Financial Results\n(in millions USD) 1Q18 1Q17 $ Change\n% Change Net Sales $237.1 $231.7 $5.3 2.3% Constant Currency Net Sales $221.4 $231.7 $(10.3) (4.4)% Gross Margin % of Net Sales 28.1% 28.1% 0 bps Gross Profit $66.5 $65.1 $1.4 2.2% Constant Currency SG&A (f) $67.7 $72.5 $(4.8) (6.6)% Free Cash Flow $(26.7) $(33.4) $6.6 19.9% EBITDA $(1.0) $(7.1) $6.0 85.3% * Date format is quarter and year in each instance. CEO Summary\n\"In the first quarter, consolidated constant currency sequential net sales declined 6.6% compared to the fourth quarter 2017, which was largely expected as the company's sales are historically stronger in the second half of the year, especially in the Europe segment. Importantly, both the NA/HME and IPG segments achieved constant currency sequential net sales growth, an indicator of the progress of our transformation. Operating loss and EBITDA improved as compared to the first quarter last year with benefit from favorable foreign currency and cost reduction activities implemented in 2017. During the quarter, the company's continued focus on cash resulted in a $6.6 million improvement in free cash flow and $6.0 million improvement in EBITDA compared to the first quarter 2017 principally driven by a lower net loss. The company continued to prioritize its emphasis on a culture of quality excellence and achieving improved earnings,\" said Matthew E. Monaghan, chairman, president and chief executive officer.\n1Q18 Segment Results\n(in millions USD) Net Sales Operating Income (Loss) Constant Reported Currency 1Q18 1Q17 % Change % Change 1Q18 1Q17 % Change Europe $ 131.3 $ 119.5 9.9 % (2.6 )% $ 6.6 $ 5.1 29.3 % NA/HME 79.8 84.3 (5.3 ) (5.7 ) (8.1 ) (9.4 ) 13.7 IPG 14.9 16.4 (9.1 ) (9.3 ) 1.6 1.9 (15.8 ) Asia/Pacific 11.1 11.6 (4.3 ) (7.5 ) 1.0 (0.4 ) 326.0 Europe - Compared to 1Q17, the decline in constant currency net sales was driven by lifestyle and respiratory products and, to a lesser extent, mobility and seating products as the company gradually applies its transformation strategy to this segment. Operating income increased compared to 1Q17 principally due to favorable impact from foreign currency and sales mix partially offset by increased freight costs and sales declines.\nNorth America/Home Medical Equipment (NA/HME) - Constant currency net sales decreased driven largely by respiratory and lifestyle products partially offset by increases in mobility and seating products compared to 1Q17. The decline in sales was also impacted by reduced sales in China as result of the closure of one of the company's Suzhou, China facilities in 3Q17. Compared to 4Q17, constant currency sequential net sales improved 0.5% driven by respiratory products. Operating loss decreased compared to 1Q17 primarily related to reduced SG&A expense and R&D expense, primarily employment costs, partially offset by sales decline, unfavorable sales mix and increased freight costs.\nInstitutional Products Group (IPG) - Constant currency net sales decreased compared to 1Q17, principally due to case goods, bed products and interior design projects. Compared to 4Q17, constant currency sequential net sales improved 7.6% driven by interior design projects and DME products. Operating income declined compared to 1Q17 principally due to a decline in sales, partially offset by reduced SG&A expense.\nAsia/Pacific - Constant currency net sales decreased compared to 1Q17 in institutional beds and respiratory products. Operating income increased significantly compared to 1Q17 as a result of favorable sales mix and reduced R&D expense and manufacturing costs.\nAdditional highlights\nIn January, the company’s independent auditor completed its first semi-annual inspection of the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities in accordance with the company’s FDA consent decree. The auditor concluded the company continues to operate these facilities in substantial compliance with FDA requirements. In April, FDA conducted a follow-up inspection of the company’s Alber facility in Germany following the corrections of issues raised in the previously disclosed 2017 warning letter. There were no observations from this inspection and Invacare anticipates closure of the warning letter in due course. Sales restrictions from the warning letter were lifted in January 2018.\nOutlook\nAs part of the company's transformation, the company will continue to make significant investments, strategically reduce sales in certain areas, refocus resources away from less accretive activities and evaluate its global infrastructure for opportunities to drive efficiency. Phase One investments are providing returns. The company expects to see improved results in 2018 with Phase Two actions continuing as the company continues to streamline operations, resize and reshape the organization, especially in North America, around its new business mix and size. By executing this strategy and making these operational improvements, the company expects long-term benefits for the company’s stakeholders.\nAs a result of anticipated commercial effectiveness, the company expects increased working capital, which, if realized, would support investments for growth, especially growth of NA/HME mobility and seating products. This would include investments in demonstration units, increased SG&A to support increased sales growth and the working capital needed to support an extended Quote: -to-cash process for power wheelchairs. Also, the company expects to make additional restructuring and capital investments as it continues to reshape the business over the transformation period. Accordingly, the company anticipates its cash flow usage for 2018 will be similar to the cash used in 2017, including consideration of seasonality of cash flow usage during the year.\nAs noted previously, the company is gradually applying the transformation to the Europe segment, which may continue to reduce the segment's sales as it begins to shift its product mix toward more clinically valued, higher-margin products. Regarding the IPG segment, the company does not anticipate sequential sales growth in the subsequent quarters of 2018 to be as strong as realized in 1Q18 as the company expects its new strategic selling approach to continue to take time to yield growth.\nIn its pursuit of increased shareholder value, the company continues to prioritize its emphasis on a culture of quality excellence and achieving its long-term earnings potential.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAs previously announced, the company will provide a conference call and webcast for investors and other interested parties to review its first quarter 2018 financial results on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 8:30 AM ET.
