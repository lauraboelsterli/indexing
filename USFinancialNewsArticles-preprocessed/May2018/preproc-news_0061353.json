    "text": "MORRISVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Worldwide Clinical Trials, Inc. (Worldwide), an award-winning, full-service CRO, announced the addition of Sara Davis as Senior Vice President of Business Development, for the U.S. region, which will further build its business development team to address growth.\nMarket insight shows that emerging to midsize pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical organizations are seeking to avoid the trap of large CRO consolidation and commoditization. Davis will focus on accelerating momentum in this important market sector, as these organizations are opting to partner with a midsize CRO, like Worldwide, that is differentiating services by delivering outstanding customer service and flexibility.\n“Worldwide is growing exponentially by focusing our investments and resources on reaching emerging to midsize pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical organizations,\" said Peter Benton, president and COO, Worldwide Clinical Trials. \"With Sara and other key leaders in place, we're even better equipped to deliver what those markets demand: a comprehensive services offering across the entire drug development lifecycle and the agility to offer speed, quality, flexibility and uncommon customer service.\"\nDavis is a CRO industry veteran and has a strong background in leading multinational sales teams. She joins Worldwide from Chiltern, where she was an executive vice president in charge of global sales teams for the oncology, biopharmaceutical, clinical analytics, medical device and diagnostics business units throughout the U.S., Western Europe and Asia Pacific. She has also held senior executive roles with PRA Health Sciences and i3 Research.\n“I'm thrilled to be joining the Worldwide team at a true industry inflection point, when pharma and biotech sponsors are telling us they have trouble gaining needed expertise, personnel and resources from large, consolidating CROs,” said Davis. \"Worldwide is building its brand promise by delivering the scientific and operational expertise, flexibility, innovation, personal service and executive support, and engagement this market demands of its CRO partner.\"\nAbout Worldwide Clinical Trials\nWorldwide Clinical Trials employs more than 1,600 professionals around the world, with offices in North and South America, Eastern and Western Europe, Russia, and Asia. Founded by physicians committed to advancing medical science, Worldwide is out to change how the world experiences CROs – in the best possible way.
