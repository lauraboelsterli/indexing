FILE PHOTO: U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern is surrounded by reporters after the final draft of the climate pact was presented during the COP 21 United Nations conference on climate change on December 12, 2015 at Le Bourget, on the outskirts of Paris. REUTERS/Mandel Ngan/Pool\n“I don’t want to see the Paris Agreement roll off the tracks,” Todd Stern, who was Obama’s Special Envoy for Climate Change, told Reuters during two-week talks ending on Thursday in Germany on a detailed “rule book” for the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n“That’s not in the interests of the United States,” he told Reuters. Stern is with the World Resources Institute think-tank at the Bonn meeting of almost 200 nations and also works at the Brookings Institution.\nHe, and many other delegates, said the United States has been concerned for decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations to ensure that rules governing environmental pacts were strong and oblige China, for instance, to abide by the same standards as rich nations.\nIn Bonn, the U.S. delegation is also insisting on strong rules for reporting and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions in a rare overlap between Obama’s and Trump’s interests. A rule book is due to be in place by the end of 2018 at a meeting in Poland.\nA strong rule book “is not only in the interests of the U.S. … It would mean everyone can say: ‘that’s a pretty good deal’,” Stern said. Stern said he was listening to delegates and giving advice.

Formally, a pullout will only take effect in 2020. [nL1N1IZ1BA]\n“It’s not surprising to me,” Patricia Espinosa, head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, said of Stern’s presence.\nShe told Reuters there is always a need “for people with skills, who can advise people, who can give a perspective on different things.”\nAsked about Stern, a U.S. State Department official said: “the United States has always supported access for non-party stakeholders in the (U.N. climate) process, including business groups, NGOs, and other civil society representatives.”\nAlden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said a strong rule book could make it easier for a future U.S. administration to re-enter the deal.\n“U.S. policy since the 1990s has been to hold countries to the same standards,” he said.
