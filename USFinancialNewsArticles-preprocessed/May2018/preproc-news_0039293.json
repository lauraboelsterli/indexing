    "text": "(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein is expected to step down by December, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the bankâ€™s plan.\nFILE PHOTO: Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, speaks at the Boston College Chief Executives Club luncheon in Boston, MA, U.S., March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Blankfein, 63, one of the longest-serving CEOs on Wall Street, has led what is viewed as the most powerful U.S. investment bank for nearly 12 years. He has outlasted calls for his departure in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and stayed in the job even as he battled cancer.\nBlankfein is likely to be replaced by Goldman President David Solomon, the newspaper reported.\nThe Wall Street Journal had reported in March that Blankfein plans to depart by the end of the year.\nGoldman was not immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Nikhil Subba and Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ",
