They include Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd and state investor Temasek Holdings (Private) Ltd, as well as U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, the people said.\nThe people spoke to Reuters on condition they not be identified as the deal details are not yet public. The amount and investor line-up are finalised and the transfer of funds is underway, the people also said.\nAnt, controlled by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd founder Jack Ma, declined to comment. Temasek and Warburg declined to comment. GIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
