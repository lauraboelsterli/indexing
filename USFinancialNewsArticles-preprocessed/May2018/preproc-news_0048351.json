Olsen denies any wrongdoing in the matter, which is being investigated by the authorities in France.\nThe company’s results have also been disappointing so far, triggering a revamp of its strategy under new Chief Executive Jan Jenisch, focusing more on growth and concentrating on fewer markets.\nThe group in March announced a 400 million Swiss franc ($404 million) cost-cutting programme, saying it would be closing its Singapore and Miami offices by the middle of this year.\n$1 = 0.9909 Swiss francs Reporting by John Revill and Oliver Hirt; Editing by Michael Shields\n ",
