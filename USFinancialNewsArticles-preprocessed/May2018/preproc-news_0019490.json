    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vectrus, Inc. (NYSE:VEC) announced first quarter 2018 financial results. For the first quarter, revenue was $320.5 million, operating income was $8.7 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.54. Net cash used in operating activities was $11.6 million in the first quarter 2018. Additionally, the company increased full-year 2018 guidance for revenue, net income, and diluted EPS.\nDuring the quarter, the company adopted the required new revenue recognition accounting standard, Accounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which impacted operating results. The former ASC 605 guidance would have resulted in revenue 1 of $320.6 million, operating income 1 of $11.8 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.76. There is no change for the quarter to net cash used in operating activities as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.\n\"We reported solid first quarter results, which were driven by strong program performance, execution of our strategic imperatives, and disciplined cost management,\" said Chuck Prow, president and chief executive officer of Vectrus. \"During the quarter, revenue improved 10.5% year-over-year, while our growth related activities continue to experience positive momentum, winning over $120 million of new business as well as receiving several contract modifications and extensions. These awards further enhance our 2018 revenue visibility.\"\n\"The slight delay of an invoice weighed on our cash performance in the first quarter,\" said Prow. \"We still expect to meet our guidance for 2018 net cash provided by operating activities.\"\n\"With total backlog growing to $3.3 billion, we have a significant opportunity to continue applying innovation and enterprise wide improvement initiatives to drive performance improvement through 2018 and beyond,\" explained Prow. \"Our long-term strategy, facilitated by the SENTEL acquisition, is yielding top-and-bottom line improvements and we look forward to delivering further value as we work to achieve our five-year goal by 2023.\"\n\"It is important to reinforce that the recently adopted ASC 606 standard impacted the timing of operating income recognition in the quarter and is solely reflective of the required accounting change and does not represent a change in the fundamentals of our business or guidance,\" said Matt Klein, chief financial officer of Vectrus. \"We expect the entire first quarter operating income impact will be positively offset by future profitability recognition over the remaining quarters of 2018.\"\nFirst quarter 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $11.6 million, a decrease of $21.5 million compared to 2017. Days sales outstanding (DSO) was 68 days in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 54 days in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company ended the first quarter 2018 with a total debt balance of $78.0 million, which was down from $79.0 million at the end of 2017. As of March 30, 2018, the Company had total consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (total leverage ratio) of 1.48x to 1.00x.\n\"Our financial position remains strong, and as such, we were able to pay off the debt associated with the SENTEL acquisition in the first quarter,\" explained Klein.\nThe Company ended the first quarter 2018 with total backlog of $3.3 billion and funded backlog of $723.3 million.\n2018 Guidance\n\"We are increasing our full-year 2018 revenue, net income and diluted EPS guidance. We expect annual revenue to be in the range of $1,215 million to $1,285 million with a mid-point of $1,250 million. Full-year operating margin is unchanged at 3.6 percent to 4.0 percent and net income is expected to be in the range of $30.9 million to $36.9 million. We expect to see diluted EPS in the range of $2.71 to $3.23 per share and net cash provided by operating activities is unchanged at $35.0 million to $39.0 million,\" said Klein. \"Our 2018 guidance assumes interest expense of approximately $4.3 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $4.2 million, non-recurring transaction related expenses of $3.0 million, mandatory debt payments of $4.0 million, a tax rate of 22 percent and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 11.4 million at December 31, 2018.\"\n2018 guidance details include:\n$ millions, except for operating margin and per share amounts\n(Prior)\n2018 Guidance\n(Updated)\n2018 Guidance\nRevenue\n$1,205\nto\n$1,275\n$1,215\nto\n$1,285\nOperating Margin (unchanged)\n3.6%\nto\n4.0%\n3.6%\nto\n4.0%\nNet Income\n$30.5\nto\n$36.4\n$30.9\nto\n$36.9\nDiluted EPS 2\n$2.70\nto\n$3.22\n$2.71\nto\n$3.23\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities (unchanged)\n$35.0\nto\n$39.0\n$35.0\nto\n$39.0\nThe Company notes that forward-looking statements of future performance made in this release, including 2018 guidance and five-year goals, are based upon current expectations and are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested here, including those factors set forth in the Safe Harbor Statement below.\nInvestor Call\nManagement representatives will conduct an investor briefing and conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.\nU.S.-based participants may dial into the conference call at 877-407-0792, while international participants may dial 201-689-8263.

This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives.\nASC 605 results, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA %, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA %, net income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, however, are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for net income and diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these items are provided below.\n\"ASC 605\" is defined as the current results adjusted for prior revenue recognition standard.\n\"Adjusted operating income\" is defined as operating income, adjusted to exclude items that may include, but are not limited to, transaction and non-recurring integration costs that impact current results but are not related to our ongoing operations.\n\"Adjusted operating margin\" is defined as adjusted operating income divided by revenue.\n\"EBITDA\" is defined as operating income, adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\"EBITDA %\" is defined as EBITDA divided by revenue.\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude items that may include, but are not limited to, transaction and non-recurring integration costs that impact current results but are not related to our ongoing operations.\n\"Adjusted EBITDA %\" is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.\n\"Adjusted net income\" is defined as net income, adjusted to exclude items that may include, but are not limited to, other income; significant charges or credits that impact current results but are not related to our ongoing operations and unusual and infrequent non-operating items and non-operating tax settlements or adjustments, such as revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and net settlement of uncertain tax positions.\n\"Adjusted diluted earnings per share\" is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.\nImpact of ASC606 vs. ASC605\nIn thousands, except for % and diluted EPS\nThree Months Ended March 30, 2018\nASC 606 vs. ASC 605 (Non-GAAP Measure)\nASC 606\nASC 605\nChange\nRevenue\n$\n320,516\n$\n320,614\n$\n(98)\nCost of revenue\n294,050\n291,019\n3,031\nSG&A\n17,795\n17,795\n—\nOperating income\n8,671\n11,800\n(3,129)\nOperating margin\n2.7\n%\n3.7\n%\nInterest (expense) income\n(1,164)\n(1,164)\n—\nIncome before income taxes\n7,507\n10,636\n(3,129)\nIncome tax expense\n1,396\n1,978\n(582)\nNet income\n$\n6,111\n$\n8,658\n$\n(2,547)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n11,338\n11,338\n—\nEarnings per share - diluted\n$\n0.54\n$\n0.76\n$\n(0.22)\nImpact of ASC606 vs ASC606 and non-recurring acquisition and transition costs\nIn thousands, except for %\nThree Months Ended March 30, 2018\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin (Non-GAAP Measure)\nASC 606\nASC 605\nChange\nRevenue\n$\n320,516\n$\n320,614\n$\n(98)\nCost of revenue\n294,050\n291,019\n3,031\nSG&A\n17,795\n17,795\n—\nOperating income\n$\n8,671\n$\n11,800\n$\n(3,129)\nOperating margin\n2.7\n%\n3.7\n%\nTransaction and non-recurring integration cost\n1,177\n1,177\n—\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n9,848\n$\n12,977\n$\n(3,129)\nAdjusted operating margin\n3.1\n%\n4.0\n%\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP Measure)\nASC 606\nASC 605\nChange\nIn thousands, except for diluted EPS\nThree Months Ended March 30, 2018\nNet income\n$\n6,111\n$\n8,658\n$\n(2,547)\nTransaction and non-recurring integration costs\n1,177\n1,177\n—\nTax impact of adjustments\n(219)\n(219)\n—\nAdjusted net income\n$\n7,069\n$\n9,616\n$\n(2,547)\nGAAP EPS - diluted\n$\n0.54\n$\n0.76\n$\n(0.22)\nAdjusted EPS - diluted\n$\n0.62\n$\n0.85\n$\n(0.23)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n11,338\n11,338\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Measure)\nASC 606\nASC 605\nChange\nIn thousands, except for %\nThree Months Ended March 30, 2018\nOperating income\n$\n8,671\n$\n11,800\n$\n(3,129)\nDepreciation and amortization\n809\n809\n—\nEBITDA\n$\n9,480\n$\n12,609\n$\n(3,129)\nEBITDA %\n2.96\n%\n3.93\n%\nTransaction and non-recurring integration costs\n1,177\n1,177\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n10,657\n$\n13,786\n$\n(3,129)\nAdjusted EBITDA %\n3.3\n%\n4.3\n%\nSupplemental Information\nRevenue by client branch, contract type, contract relationship, and geographic region for the periods presented below was as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 30,\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\nClient branch\nRevenue\n% of Total\nRevenue\n% of Total\nArmy\n$\n237,847\n74\n%\n$\n252,161\n87\n%\nNavy\n8,357\n3\n%\n4,933\n2\n%\nAir Force\n65,255\n20\n%\n32,969\n11\n%\nOther\n9,057\n3\n%\n—\n—\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n320,516\n$\n290,063\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 30,\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nContract type\nRevenue\n% of Total\nRevenue\n% of Total\nFirm-Fixed-Price\n$\n90,308\n28\n%\n$\n71,806\n25\n%\nCost-Plus and Cost Reimbursable ¹\n230,208\n72\n%\n218,257\n75\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n320,516\n$\n290,063\n¹ Includes time and material contracts\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 30,\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\nContract relationship\nRevenue\n% of Total\nRevenue\n% of Total\nPrime Contractor\n$\n301,028\n94\n%\n$\n285,033\n98\n%\nSub Contractor\n19,488\n6\n%\n5,030\n2\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n320,516\n$\n290,063\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 30,\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\nGeographic region\nRevenue\n% of Total\nRevenue\n% of Total\nMiddle East\n$\n219,880\n69\n%\n$\n233,907\n81\n%\nUnited States\n73,788\n23\n%\n40,010\n14\n%\nEurope\n26,848\n8\n%\n16,146\n5\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n320,516\n$\n290,063\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vectrus-announces-solid-first-quarter-2018-results-300644827.html\nSOURCE Vectrus, Inc.",
