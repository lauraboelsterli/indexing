    "text": "TORONTO, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dr. Francis Dubé (“Dubé”) together with a group of concerned shareholders (the \"Concerned Shareholders\"), in their capacities as shareholders of Zenyatta Ventures Ltd. (\"Zenyatta\" or the \"Corporation\") announced today their continued disappointment with the Board’s use of the Corporation’s scarce financial resources by sending a letter to the Board of Directors of Zenyatta warning it against taking further actions that may destroy value and further entrench the Board.\nFull text of the letter the Concerned Shareholders delivered to the Board:\nMay 3, 2018\nBoard of Directors\nZENYATTA VENTURES LTD.\n1224 Amber Drive\nThunder Bay ON P7B 6M5\nAttention: Keith Morrison, Executive Chairman\nDear Mr. Morrison:\nOn March 21, 2018 the Corporation called a special meeting of shareholders for May 11, 2018 (the “Special Meeting”) following a request from a group of concerned shareholders (the \"Concerned Shareholders\") of Zenyatta Ventures. The sole purpose of the Special Meeting is to replace certain incumbent directors with independent shareholder representatives.\nThe Corporation issued today a press release announcing the appointment of Mr. Paul Gardner as Chief Executive Officer and sole employee of Zenyatta’s wholly owned subsidiary, ZEN-tech Materials Limited (“ZEN-tech”). Mr. Gardner has no prior experience or relevant expertise in the resources or nanomaterial industries.\nThe Corporation previously issued a press release on April 17, 2018, announcing changes in executives roles with your appointment as Executive Chairman and the transition of Mr. Aubrey Eveleigh from President and CEO to President with a $900,000 severance payment over time and a new employment agreement for the same base salary of $225,000 that he was receiving as Chief Executive Officer.\nBetween now and the Special Meeting we strongly urge the Board and management not to engage in any activities, or take any action, that have the potential to further devalue our Corporation or be oppressive to its shareholders.\nWe insist the Board does not:\nDelay the Special Meeting\nAdd new members to the Board or management prior to the Special Meeting\nBurden either Zenyatta or ZEN-tech with additional financial leverage\nIssue additional equity or engage in any other capital market transaction\nApprove any non-maintenance capital expenditures\nThe Concerned Shareholders are committed to improving value for all Zenyatta shareholders. We believe there is significant value in the business if capital allocation, expense management and execution issues are corrected. We believe an immediate reconstitution of the Board is required to ensure all future decisions place the interests of all shareholders and other stakeholders of Zenyatta first and foremost.\nSincerely,\nConcerned Shareholders of Zenyatta\nThe ZEN forward Plan\nThe concerned shareholders encourage shareholders to vote using only the YELLOW proxy.\nThe Concerned Shareholders would like to thank all of the investors across Canada who support our vision to bring change to the Board and management of Zenyatta. For this change to happen, we need your votes. If you have not received the YELLOW proxy , we ask you to call your broker and ask for your “Opposed Control Number”. You should be getting a different number for each of your accounts. You then need to go to Proxyvote.com and follow the prompts. Every vote is important so please exercise your right to vote for change!\nThe Concerned Shareholders previously announced that they are proposing to elect Mr. Brian Bosse, Dubé, and Mr. Eric Wallman (the \" Nominees \") as directors of the Corporation, and are proposing to remove Mr. Aubrey Eveleigh, Mr. Barry Allan, Mr. Sean Whiteford, and Mr. Keith Morrison as directors of the Corporation. Each of the Nominees would serve as directors until the next annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, or until his successor is duly elected or appointed.\nTO VOTE FOR CHANGE: DELIVER YOUR YELLOW PROXY TO SHORECREST GROUP PRIOR TO 5:00 P.M. (EDT) ON TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2018. Shareholders are urged to follow the instructions found on the YELLOW proxy or voting instruction form to ensure votes are received in a timely manner.\nShareholders are encouraged to read the letter to Shareholders and the Circular filed on SEDAR (at www.sedar.com ) under Zenyatta’s profile, or visit the Concerned Shareholders' website at www.zenforward.ca .\nShareholder Questions\nShareholders who have questions or require assistance with voting may contact Shorecrest Group at:\nShorecrest Group Ltd.\nToll free in North America: 1-888-637-5789\nBanks and Brokers and collect calls: 1-647-931-7454\nFax: 1-647-931-7349\nEmail: contact@shorecrestgroup.com\nDisclaimers\nThe Concerned Shareholders have not sought or obtained consent from any third party to the use herein of previously published information.
