    "text": "The U.S. Marines have a rule: \"Officers eat last.\" It's a fundamental philosophy of Marine Corps leadership that officers wait to eat until all Marines beneath them in rank have gotten their food. The rule creates a sense of unity and instills loyalty, and it's an attitude that business leaders should use too, says war reporter and author Sebastian Junger.\nJunger is an award-winning journalist, author and documentary filmmaker known for works such as the novels \"The Perfect Storm\" and \"Tribe,\" and the feature-length documentary \"Restrepo.\" He is a contributor to a PBS film premiering Memorial Day called \"Going to War,\" which is about the human experience of preparing for war, fighting and coming home.",
