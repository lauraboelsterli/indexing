    "text": "ISELIN, N.J., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlesex Water Company (“Middlesex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:MSEX) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results\nConsolidated Net income for first quarter 2018 increased $0.1 million as compared with the first quarter 2017. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $0.27, unchanged from the same period reported in 2017.\nOperating revenues increased in 2018 by $1.0 million to $31.2 million. The increase is attributable to growth in our regulated customer base and non-regulated contract operations in Delaware as well as the November 2017 implementation of a Purchased Water Adjustment Clause and higher commercial and industrial customer water usage in New Jersey.\nOperations and maintenance expenses increased in 2018 by $1.9 million from the same period in 2017. Severe weather during the 2018 winter season caused an increase in water main break repair costs of $1.0 million in our Middlesex System, and increased water production costs of $0.5 million, also in our Middlesex system.\nIncome Tax expense in 2018 decreased by $1.3 million when compared to 2017 due to the lower corporate income tax rate implemented under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 legislation as well as regulatory accounting treatment of tangible property regulations related tax deductions, which were approved in Middlesex’s most recent base rate case.\nMiddlesex President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis W. Doll said, “Severe weather earlier this year created a busy and challenging time for our field personnel working night and day to mitigate the effects of the sustained frigid weather. We sincerely appreciate their efforts to minimize service disruptions to our customers. We are pleased that our Middlesex rate case, filed in October 2017, received a timely decision from our New Jersey regulators, which resulted in a $5.5 million increase in customer’s base rates. The new rates went into effect April 1, 2018. We’re also preparing to break ground on our Western Transmission Main, a $52 million project, part of our Water for Tomorrow capital program in which Middlesex will be investing up to $305 million in various significant infrastructure projects over the next five years,” said Doll.\nQuarterly Dividend Declared\nAs previously announced in April 2018, the Board of Directors of Middlesex Water Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22375 per common share to be paid on June 1, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2018. The Company has paid cash dividends continually since 1912 and increased its dividend for the forty-fifth consecutive year in 2017. Information about Middlesex’s Direct Share Purchase and Sale and Dividend Reinvestment Plan can be found on our website.\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders\nThe Company will host its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Tuesday, May 22, 2018, beginning at 11:00 a.m. at its corporate headquarters at 1500 Ronson Road in Iselin, New Jersey.
