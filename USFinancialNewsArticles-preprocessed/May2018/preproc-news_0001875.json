    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intersect ENT, Inc. (NASDAQ:XENT), a company dedicated to improving the quality of life for patients with ear, nose and throat conditions, today reported financial results for\nRecent Business Highlights\nIn April 2018, the company announced U.S. commercial availability of SINUVA™ Sinus Implant, a new in-office treatment option for recurrent nasal polyps. Placed during a routine doctor’s office visit under local or topical anesthesia, SINUVA is designed to deliver an anti-inflammatory steroid directly to the site of disease for an extended period of time (up to 90 days) following placement into the sinus cavity. SINUVA is clinically proven to reduce polyps and symptoms of nasal congestion.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenue grew to $24.7 million for the first quarter 2018 compared to $20.5 million for the same period of 2017, an increase of 21%. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to growth in adoption of the company’s PROPEL ® family of steroid releasing implants.\nReflecting a one-time charge associated with the initial production of SINUVA, gross profit for the first quarter 2018 was $19.2 million and gross margin was 78%. This one-time charge reduced gross margin by 4%, from 82% to 78%, and was related to the transition of SINUVA production from development to commercial scale. These results compare with gross profit of $17.6 million and gross margin of 86% in the first quarter 2017. The decrease in gross margin was also attributable to increased overhead and inefficiencies associated with the addition of SINUVA and PROPEL ® Contour manufacturing and to a benefit in the first quarter 2017 from the sale of PROPEL Contour product that was produced prior to FDA approval and therefore expensed in the fourth quarter 2016.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter 2018 were $25.8 million compared to $24.5 million in the same period of 2017, an increase of 5%. R&D expenses increased to $4.3 million from $4.2 million. SG&A expenses increased to $21.5 million from $20.3 million, primarily driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses.\nOutlook\nThe company continues to forecast full year 2018 revenue of $111 to $116 million, including an estimated 8% contribution from SINUVA product sales, and forecasts second quarter 2018 revenue of $27.7 to $28.2 million.\nThe company expects gross margin for the second quarter of approximately 80% and updated guidance for the full year 2018 in the range of 80% to 81%, compared to prior guidance in the range of 81% to 82%. The company’s forecast for full year 2018 operating expenses remains in the range of $113 to $115 million.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nIntersect ENT will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the company’s first quarter 2018 results and business outlook.
