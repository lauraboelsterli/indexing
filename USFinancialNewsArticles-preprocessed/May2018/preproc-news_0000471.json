Former Volkswagen chief executive Martin Winterkorn leaves after testifying to a German parliamentary committee on the carmaker's emissions scandal in Berlin, Germany, January 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\nVolkswagen did not immediately comment.\nAn indictment filed in secret in March, was unsealed on Thursday in U.S. District Court, and names numerous former executives. Winterkorn resigned soon after the scandal over polluting vehicles in the United States became public in September 2015. Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Grant McCool",
