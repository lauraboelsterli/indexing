    "text": "OSLO, May 9 (Reuters) - Aker, an investment vehicle of Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, will explore options for its stake in oil startup Aker Energy after submitting a development plan for an offshore field in Ghana, Aker’s CEO said on Wednesday.\nAlternatives include listing Aker Energy separately, making a transaction with oil companies present in the area or seeking to enter it, or a combination of both, Aker’s CEO Oeyvind Eriksen told Reuters.\nThe decision could be made within six to twelve months from now, he added.
