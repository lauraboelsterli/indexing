Formula One - F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku City Circuit, Baku, Azerbaijan - April 29, 2018 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton crosses the finish line to win the race Srdjan Suki/Pool via Reuters\nSpeaking at the Spanish Grand Prix, the International Automobile Federation’s head of technical matters for single seater racing, Nikolas Tombazis, said race performance would definitely be affected.\n“We expect this rule change to be approximately half way or one third ... less performance,” the former Ferrari chief designer told reporters. “So we expect to lose about one-and-a-half seconds maybe.”\n“But it’s a bit difficult to predict exactly the amount of development the teams will put on.”\nThe FIA this month announced modifications to front and rear wings and front brake ducts for next season to make it easier for cars to follow each other and increase overtaking.\nThe measures followed research carried out by most teams and backed by commercial rights holders Liberty Media.
