Dial-in and webcast information is listed below.\nFirst Quarter Earnings Conference Call Date: Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Time: 11:00 a.m. EDT Dial#: 877-407-0789 or 201-689-8562 Webcast: investors.regencycenters.com\nReplay\nWebcast Archive: Investor Relations page under Events & Webcasts\nNon-GAAP Disclosure\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to the required GAAP presentations, as it believes these measures improve the understanding of the Company's operational results. Regency manages its entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure, although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval. Therefore, the Company believes presenting its pro-rata share of operating results regardless of ownership structure, along with other non-GAAP measures, makes comparisons of other REITs' operating results to the Company's more meaningful. Management continually evaluates the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of the Company’s reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.\nNAREIT FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from dispositions of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Regency computes NAREIT FFO for all periods presented in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. Since NAREIT FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it can provide a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of the Company’s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, NAREIT FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. Operating FFO is an additional performance measure that excludes from NAREIT FFO: (a) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market of debt adjustments. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income to NAREIT FFO and Operating FFO for actual results.\nReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders to NAREIT FFO and Operating FFO - Actual (in thousands)\nFor the Periods Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 Three Months Ended\nYear to Date\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to NAREIT FFO: Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders $ 52,660 (33,223)\n$ 52,660 (33,223 ) Adjustments to reconcile to NAREIT Funds From Operations (1) : Depreciation and amortization (excluding FF&E) 96,197 67,444 96,197 67,444 Provision for impairment to operating properties 16,054 - 16,054 - Gain on sale of operating properties (102 ) (12 ) (102 ) (12 ) Gain on remeasurement of investment in real estate partnership - - - - Exchangeable operating partnership units 111 (19 ) 111 (19 ) NAREIT Funds From Operations $ 164,920 34,190 $ 164,920 34,190 Reconciliation of NAREIT FFO to Operating FFO: NAREIT Funds From Operations $ 164,920 34,190 $ 164,920 34,190 Adjustments to reconcile to Operating Funds From Operations (1) : Acquisition pursuit and closing costs - 27 - 27 Income tax benefit - - - - Gain on sale of land (107 ) (404 ) (107 ) (404 ) Provision for impairment to land - - - - Loss on derivative instruments and hedge ineffectiveness - (8 ) - (8 ) Early extinguishment of debt 162 - 162 - Interest on bonds for period from notice to redemption 600 - 600 - Merger related costs - 69,732 - 69,732 Merger related debt offering interest - 975 - 975 Preferred redemption costs - 9,368 - 9,368 Hurricane losses - - - - Straight line rent, net (4,081 ) (3,365 ) (4,081 ) (3,365 ) Above/below market rent amortization, net (8,422 ) (3,719 ) (8,422 ) (3,719 ) Debt premium/discount amortization (899 ) (641 ) (899 ) (641 ) Operating Funds From Operations $ 152,173 106,155 $ 152,173 106,155 Weighted Average Shares For Diluted Earnings per Share 170,959 126,649\n170,959 126,649 Weighted Average Shares For Diluted FFO and Operating FFO per Share 171,309 127,051\n171,309 127,051 (1) Includes pro-rata share of unconsolidated co-investment partnerships, net of pro-rata share attributable to noncontrolling interests.
