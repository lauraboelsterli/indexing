    "text": "VICTORIA, British Columbia, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carmanah Technologies Corporation (TSX:CMH) (“the Company” or “Carmanah”) today reported its first quarter financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018. Currency amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted and are for Carmanah’s continuing operations which exclude the operating results from the Company’s Power Division segment which was divested by way of two separate transactions in 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Carmanah generated revenues of USD $14.9 million, up USD $3.8 million or 34.3% over the first quarter of 2017 revenues of USD $11.1 million. The increase in revenues was attributed to stronger performance by the Company’s Signals segment, which generated revenues of USD $13.5 million, up USD $4.0 million or 41.2% over the first quarter of 2017 revenues of USD $9.6 million. The Illumination segment generated revenues of USD $1.4 million, down USD $0.1 million or 8.9% over the first quarter of 2017 revenues of USD $1.5 million, as the transition to our next generation EverGen product continued.\nGross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018 was 42.4%, down 2.5% compared to the same period in 2017. The reduction in gross margins resulted from sales mix in the quarter.\nCore operating expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 were USD $5.3 million, up from USD $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the amortization of acquired intangible assets from Vega and EKTA and the overall increase in G&A expenses associated with the acquisition of Vega.\nNet income in the first quarter of 2018 was USD $0.6 million which was unchanged from the same period in 2017.\nCarmanah management relies on Adjusted EBITDA 1 (a non-IFRS measure) to gauge financial performance. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company generated Adjusted EBITDA of USD $1.8 million, up 11.0% from USD $1.6 million in the same period in 2017. A table reconciling net income and Adjusted EBITDA is included in this release.\n“Important operational progress was made by our Company in the first quarter”, said John Simmons, CEO. “During the quarter, capping more than a year of development, our Telematics vertical received orders and began shipping its first products. Also in the quarter the Company acquired a patent portfolio which now allow Carmanah’s Traffic vertical to resume the pursuit of sales from its very popular Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon without concerns of intellectual property infringement. Finally, continued progress was made during the quarter for our consolidating integration of Vega Industries by Sabik Marine and we are targeting the third quarter 2018 to fully integrate and cease operating in New Zealand.\nHighlights for the quarter are provided below:\nThree months ended March 31, (US$ thousands) 2018 2017 Revenue 14,942 11,127 Gross margin % 42.4% 44.9% Core operating expenditures (5,286) (4,069) Net income after tax 594 609 Adjusted EBITDA 1 1,826 1,645 Financial Condition at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017\nCash and cash equivalents of USD $8.2 million, down USD $3.6 million from USD $11.8 million, primarily due to repayment of our term loan. Working capital of USD $20.0 million, down USD $1.2 million from USD $21.2 million\nComplete set of Financial Statements and Management Discussion & Analysis\nA complete set of the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion & Analysis are available on Carmanah's corporate website. To view these documents, visit: https://carmanah.com/company/financial-reports . Both documents are also filed on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ). The financial information included in this release is qualified in its entirety and should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, including the notes thereto.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 1\nEBITDA reconciliations Three months ended March 31, (US$ in thousands) 2018 2017 Net income 594 609 Add/(deduct): Interest 66 47 Income taxes 297 271 Amortization 772 387 Non-cash stock based compensation 122 177 EBITDA 1 1,851 1,491 Merger and acquisition costs - 53 Extraordinary legal costs 43 11 Restructuring costs/(recovery) (53) - Other non-recurring (60) 91 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) 45 (1) Adjusted EBITDA 1 1,826 1,645 1 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. This news release presents information about EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both of which are non-IFRS financial measures, to provide supplementary information about 2017 operating performance. Carmanah defines EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, income taxes, amortization, and non-cash stock based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA removes unusual or non-operating items from EBITDA, such merger and acquisition costs, restructuring charges, asset write offs, and foreign exchange gains and losses. Carmanah uses these non-IFRS measures internally to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate its performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended as a substitute for IFRS measures. A limitation of utilizing these non-IFRS measures is that the IFRS accounting effects of the non-recurring items do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of Carmanah’s business and these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing Carmanah’s financial results. Therefore, management believes that Carmanah’s IFRS measures of net loss and the same respective non-IFRS measure should be considered together. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Readers should refer to the “Definitions and Reconciliations” section of the Company’s most recently filed MD&A for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 for a more detailed discussion of these measures and their calculation.\nAbout Carmanah Technologies Corporation\nCarmanah designs, develops and distributes a portfolio of products focused on energy optimized LED solutions for infrastructure.
