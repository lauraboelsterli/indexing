REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\nThe European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT), which brings together around 50 European companies from Germany’s energy giant E.ON ( EONGn.DE ) to the Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer ( WLSNc.AS ), also issued a warning during their meeting with May.\n“The uninterrupted flow of goods is essential to both the EU and UK economies. This must be frictionless as with a customs union. We need clarity and certainty, because time is running out. Uncertainty causes less investment,” the lobby said in a statement.
