    "text": "DALLAS, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Senior Living Corporation (the “Company”) (NYSE:CSU), one of the nation’s largest operators of senior housing communities, today announced operating and financial results for the first quarter 2018.\n“Focused execution on our key initiatives resulted in year-over-year growth in same-community revenue and net operating income in the first quarter,” said Lawrence A. Cohen, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Despite the effect of seasonal attrition on occupancy, which was in line with our projections, we stayed focused on our residents, maintained a disciplined approach to our cost structure and delivered solid financial results. By building on our 2017 cost control initiatives with further improvements in the first quarter, we had lower than anticipated expenses and our CFFO exceeded our internal projections. We are pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2018.”\nMr. Cohen continued, “We are executing our comprehensive strategy to deliver higher revenues, enhance cash flow and maximize the value of our owned real estate. With a disciplined focus on our growth strategy and driving operational improvements, we are well positioned to capitalize on our competitive advantages as a leading pure-play private-pay senior housing owner/operator and enhance shareholder value.”\nOperating and Financial Summary (all amounts in this operating and financial summary exclude two communities that are undergoing lease-up or significant renovation and conversion, unless otherwise noted; also, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below and reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure on the final page of this release.)\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2018, including all communities, was $114.6 million, a $1.3 million, or 1.2%, decrease from the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 includes no revenue from the Company’s two communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017. Revenue for these two communities was $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n-- Revenue for consolidated and same communities, which exclude two communities undergoing lease-up or significant renovation and conversion and the Company’s two communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey, was $113.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 1.0% as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\n-- Occupancy for consolidated and same communities was 86.1% in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 100 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 130 basis points from the first quarter of 2017.\n-- Average monthly rent for consolidated and same communities was $3,592, an increase of $60 per occupied unit, or 1.7%, as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome from operations, including all communities, was $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a loss of $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, which included a non-cash lease termination charge of $12.9 million associated with the Company’s purchase in January 2017 of four communities it previously leased.\nThe Company’s Net Loss for the first quarter of 2018, including all communities, was $7.2 million.\n-- Excluding items noted and reconciled on the final page of this release, the Company’s adjusted net loss was $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2018.\n-- Adjusted EBITDAR was $37.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $37.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDAR is a financial valuation measure, rather than a financial performance measure, used by management and others to evaluate the value of companies in the senior living industry.\n-- Adjusted Cash From Facility Operations (“CFFO”) was $10.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $11.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Results - First Quarter\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported revenue of $114.6 million, compared to revenue of $116.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue for consolidated communities excluding the two communities undergoing significant renovation and conversion, and the two Houston communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey, increased 1.0% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $71.7 million, a decrease of $1.1 million from the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses include a $1.6 million business interruption insurance credit related to the Company’s two Houston communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey to offset the lost revenues and continuing expenses, and to restore the communities’ net income for the first quarter of 2018 based on an approximate average of the communities’ net income in the seven months of 2017 prior to the hurricane.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $6.0 million. This compares to general and administrative expenses of $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding transaction and conversion costs in both periods, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenues under management, general and administrative expenses, excluding transaction and conversion costs, were 5.1% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.9% in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.4 million. The Company recorded a net loss on a GAAP basis of $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding items noted and reconciled on the final page of this release, the Company’s adjusted net loss was $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures exclude two communities that are undergoing significant renovation and conversion (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below), including a community in Indiana that recently completed a significant renovation and conversion and is now in lease-up that was excluded beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Three communities that were previously excluded from the Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures were added back to such measures beginning in the first quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDAR for the first quarter of 2018 was $37.9 million as compared to $37.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted CFFO was $10.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $11.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating Activities\nSame-community results exclude two communities previously noted that are undergoing lease-up or significant renovation and conversion, and the two Houston communities impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Same-community results also exclude certain conversion costs.\nSame-community revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 1.0% versus the first quarter of 2017.\nSame-community operating expenses increased 1.0% from the first quarter of the prior year, excluding conversion costs in both periods. On the same basis, labor costs, including benefits, increased 1.3% and utilities increased 8.3%, while food costs decreased 4.4%, all as compared to the first quarter of 2017. At communities that have not converted units to higher levels of care, labor costs increased 0.5% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Same-community net operating income increased 0.9% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nCapital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.6 million, representing approximately $4.2 million of investment spending and approximately $1.2 million of recurring capital expenditures.\nBalance Sheet\nThe Company ended the quarter with $23.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash. As of March 31, 2018, the Company financed its owned communities with mortgages totaling $958.8 million at interest rates averaging 4.7%. All of the Company’s debt is at fixed interest rates, except for two bridge loans totaling approximately $76.4 million at March 31, 2018, one of which matures in the second quarter of 2019 and the other in the first quarter of 2020. The earliest maturity date for the Company’s fixed-rate debt is in 2021.\nThe Company’s cash on hand and cash flow from operations are expected to be sufficient for working capital, prudent reserves and the equity needed to fund the Company’s acquisition, conversion and renovation programs.\nQ1 2018 Conference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call with senior management to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results. The call will be held on Tuesday, May 1, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The call-in number is 323-701-0225, confirmation code 2087338. A link to a simultaneous webcast of the teleconference will be available at www.capitalsenior.com through Windows Media Player or RealPlayer.\nFor the convenience of the Company’s shareholders and the public, the conference call will be recorded and available for replay starting May 1, 2018 at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, until May 9, 2018 at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time. To access the conference call replay, call 719-457-0820, confirmation code 2087338. The conference call will also be made available for playback via the Company’s corporate website, www.capitalsenior.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures of Operating Performance\nAdjusted EBITDAR is a financial valuation measure and Adjusted Net Income/(Loss) and Adjusted CFFO are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP financial measures may have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDAR is a valuation measure commonly used by our management, research analysts and investors to value companies in the senior living industry. Because Adjusted EBITDAR excludes interest expense and rent expense, it allows our management, research analysts and investors to compare the enterprise values of different companies without regard to differences in capital structures and leasing arrangements.\nThe Company believes that Adjusted Net Income/(Loss) and Adjusted CFFO are useful as performance measures in identifying trends in day-to-day operations because they exclude the costs associated with acquisitions and conversions and other items that do not ordinarily reflect the ongoing operating results of our primary business. Adjusted Net Income/(Loss) and Adjusted CFFO provide indicators to management of progress in achieving both consolidated and individual business unit operating performance and are used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance of companies in the senior living industry.\nThe Company strongly urges you to review on the last page of this release the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDAR and the reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted Net Income/(Loss) and Adjusted CFFO, along with the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, and statements of cash flows.\nAbout the Company\nCapital Senior Living Corporation is one of the nation’s largest operators of residential communities for senior adults. The Company’s operating strategy is to provide value to residents by providing quality senior housing services at reasonable prices. The Company’s communities emphasize a continuum of care, which integrates independent living, assisted living, and memory care services, to provide residents the opportunity to age in place. The Company operates 129 senior housing communities in geographically concentrated regions with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,500 residents.\nSafe Harbor\nThe in this release are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially, including, but not without limitation to, the Company’s ability to find suitable acquisition properties at favorable terms, financing, refinancing, community sales, licensing, business conditions, risks of downturns in economic conditions generally, satisfaction of closing conditions such as those pertaining to licensure, availability of insurance at commercially reasonable rates, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations among others, and other risks and factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFor information about Capital Senior Living, visit www.capitalsenior.com .\nContact Carey P.
