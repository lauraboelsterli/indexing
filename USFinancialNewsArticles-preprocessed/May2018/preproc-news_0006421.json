    "text": "- Net income of $8.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.72 -\n- 12 th consecutive quarter of double-digit total finance receivables growth -\n- 7 th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth -\nGREENVILLE, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regional Management Corp. (NYSE:RM), a diversified consumer finance company, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.6 million, an increase of 13.2% from the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.72, based on a diluted share count of 12.0 million. Total finance receivables as of March 31, 2018 were $805.0 million, an increase of 15.8%, or $110.0 million, from the prior year. Twelfth consecutive quarter that total finance receivables have grown at least 10% over the prior-year period. Total core small and large loan finance receivables increased $146.5 million, or 25.3%, compared to the prior-year period. Large loan finance receivables of $363.9 million increased $121.6 million, or 50.1%, from the prior-year period and now represent 45.2% of the total loan portfolio. Small loan finance receivables as of March 31, 2018 were $360.5 million, an increase of 7.4% over the prior-year period. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $72.6 million, a $6.8 million, or 10.3%, increase from the prior-year period. Seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. Interest and fee income increased 11.6%, driven by a 15.8% increase in finance receivables compared to the prior-year period. Overall yield declined 140 basis points on a year-over-year basis primarily due to a shifting product mix, a net 20 basis point reduction related to the temporary shift of insurance claims, and a 10 basis point impact due to the 2017 hurricanes. Provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2018 was $19.5 million, an increase of 2.0% from the prior-year period, while total finance receivables increased 15.8%. Annualized net credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables were 10.2%, a 70 basis point improvement from 10.9% in the prior-year period. 30+ day contractual delinquencies were 6.5% (0.2% of which was due to the 2017 hurricanes), comparable to March 31, 2017 and sequentially down from 7.5% (0.2% of which was also due to the 2017 hurricanes).\n“We had another successful quarter to start off 2018,” said Peter R. Knitzer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Regional Management. “We saw continued strong performance on our top line driven by our core loan portfolio, with a double-digit increase in our finance receivables for the 12 th consecutive quarter. Credit remained stable, our costs were under control, and we achieved another quarter of double-digit bottom line growth.”\n“Furthermore, we have begun to reap the benefits of the systems and modernized infrastructure that we installed over the past couple of years,” continued Mr. Knitzer. “Our employees can better serve our customers with automated underwriting and servicing, our digital capabilities are being integrated into a more seamless experience for our customers, and, over time, we expect an enhanced credit function with the implementation of custom scorecards. All of this allows us to further improve our margins over the longer term. At the same time, we continue to employ our hybrid growth plan of increasing our receivables per branch while reaccelerating our de novo branch expansion, including entering two new states, Missouri and Wisconsin, in the back half of 2018.”\n“It is truly an exciting time for all of us at Regional. Our efforts over the past few years have positioned Regional as strongly as we’ve ever been as we continue to focus on delivering long-term shareholder value,” concluded Mr. Knitzer.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFinance receivables outstanding at March 31, 2018 were $805.0 million, a 15.8% increase from $695.0 million in the prior year. Finance receivables increased from continued strong growth in both the core small and large loan portfolios.\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported total revenue of $72.6 million, a 10.3% increase from $65.8 million in the prior-year period. Interest and fee income for the first quarter of 2018 was $66.2 million, an 11.6% increase from $59.3 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to increases in the small and large loan portfolios compared to the prior-year period. Insurance income, net for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.4 million, a $0.4 million, or 10.9%, reduction from the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to the transition in insurance carriers in the prior-year period, causing some of the Company’s insurance claims to impact net credit losses in the first quarter of 2017 instead of insurance income. Other income for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.1 million, an 11.8% increase from the prior-year period.\nThe provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2018 was $19.5 million, a 2.0% increase compared to $19.1 million in the prior-year period, while total finance receivables increased 15.8%. Net credit losses were $20.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $1.3 million over the prior-year period. The increase over the prior-year period was primarily due to portfolio growth, though it also included $0.7 million of hurricane-related losses and was partially offset by a net $0.4 million reduction in the temporary shift of insurance claims from the insurance line. Annualized net credit losses as a percentage of average finance receivables in the first quarter of 2018 were 10.2%, a 70 basis point improvement from 10.9% in the prior-year period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $34.6 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 10.0%, from the prior-year period. Annualized general and administrative expenses as a percentage of average finance receivables improved 70 basis points from the prior-year period. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 included higher personnel costs related to staffing increases in information technology, centralized collections, and branches to support ongoing loan portfolio growth, as well as higher incentive expense. Sequentially, general and administrative expenses increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInterest expense was $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $5.2 million in the prior-year period. The increase in interest expense was due to larger long-term debt amounts outstanding from growth in finance receivables, federal funds rate increases, larger unused lines of credit, and incremental debt issuance costs associated with upsizing the senior revolving credit facility and entering into the warehouse credit facility. The Company’s diversified sources of funding continue to position it for long-term growth.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.6 million, an increase from $7.6 million in the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.72, an increase from $0.65 in the prior-year period. Net income in the first quarter of 2017 was boosted by a $1.5 million tax benefit from share-based compensation, while net income for the first quarter of 2018 was positively impacted by approximately the same amount due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n2018 De Novo Outlook\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s branch network consisted of 341 locations. The Company consolidated one location during the first quarter of 2018 and maintains its plan to open between 25 and 30 de novo branches during 2018, all of which should occur during the second half of the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had finance receivables of $805.0 million and outstanding long-term debt of $550.4 million (consisting of $416.1 million of long-term debt on its $638.0 million senior revolving credit facility, $91.6 million of long-term debt on its $125.0 million revolving warehouse credit facility, and $42.6 million of long-term debt on its amortizing loan).\nConference Call Information\nRegional Management Corp. will host a conference call and webcast today at 5:00 PM ET to discuss these results.\nThe dial-in number for the conference call is (855) 327-6837 (toll-free) or (631) 891-4304 (direct).
