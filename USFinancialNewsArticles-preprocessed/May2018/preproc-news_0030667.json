    "text": "TORONTO, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marathon Gold Corporation (TSX:MOZ) (“Marathon”) announced today its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights:\nAt March 31, 2018 Marathon had $4.1 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $7.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nMarathon completed the following activities in the period ended March 31, 2018, and subsequently to the date of this press release:\nPreliminary Economic Assessment:\nMarathon is nearing completion on the Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) on the Valentine Lake project, the first economic study on the project, and expects to release the results of the PEA in the third week of May 2018.\nMineral Resource Estimate:\nIn November 2017, Marathon released an updated mineral resource estimate and the supporting National Instrument 43-101 technical report for the Valentine Lake property. This resource estimate incorporated the results of drilling on the property through the third quarter of 2017 and the re-modelling of the Leprechaun Deposit, which was undertaken to better reflect the revised geological model for this deposit. This resource estimate served initially as the foundation for the PEA.\nIn finalizing the PEA, the resource estimate for the Marathon Deposit was updated in March 2018 to incorporate the results of fire assay and metallic screen assays received from November 27, 2017, the cutoff for the November 2017 resource, to March 2, 2018, and the resources for the Leprechaun and Victory Deposits were updated to apply the design of open pits for these deposits to the underlying resource estimates.\nWith completion of the March 2018 resource estimate, the Valentine Lake property hosts a total Measured and Indicated resource of 2.1 million ounces of gold at a grade of 1.99 g/t and an additional Inferred resource of 1.1 million ounces at a grade of 1.99 g/t.\nDrilling:\nDrill programs, which ran from January to March and May to November 2017, and January to March 2018, focused on: expanding and upgrading the Leprechaun Deposit resource; expanding and upgrading the Marathon resource; and completing a program of widely spaced exploration holes in the 3.5-kilometer bog zone between the Sprite and Marathon Deposits to determine the potential of this area of the property, which has seen little in the way of exploration activity, to host mineral resources.\nSince May 22, 2017, Marathon has completed a total of 143 new holes and extended 16 drill holes covering 59,550 meters out of a planned program of 60,000 meters of infill, extension and exploration drilling at Leprechaun and Marathon, of which a total of 134 holes covering 56,404 meters have been assayed and reported.\nOperating Results:\nThe results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized below.\n2018 2017 $ $ Expenses: Exploration expenses - 81,479 General and administrative expenses 483,630 354,257 Interest income - (12,380 ) Foreign exchange (gain) loss (5,225 ) 1,938 Loss before tax 478,405 425,294 Income tax recovery (311,151 ) (1,174,289 ) Loss (Income) for the period 167,254 (748,995 ) This press release should be read in conjunction with Marathon's condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis, both of which are available on www.sedar.com .\nAbout Marathon\nMarathon is a Toronto based gold exploration company rapidly advancing its 100% owned Valentine Lake Gold Camp located in Newfoundland, one of the top mining jurisdictions in the world. The Valentine Lake Gold Camp currently hosts four near-surface, mainly pit-shell constrained, deposits with measured and indicated resources totaling 2,137,400 oz. of gold at 1.99 g/t and inferred resources totaling 1,104,700 oz. of gold at 1.99 g/t. The majority of the resources occur in the Marathon and Leprechaun deposits, which also have resources below the pit shell. Both deposits are open to depth and on strike. Gold mineralization has been traced down over 350 meters vertically at Leprechaun and almost a kilometer at Marathon. The four deposits outlined to date occur over a 20-kilometer system of gold bearing veins, with much of the 24,000-hectare property having had little detailed exploration activity to date. Drilling is continuing to focus on expanding the Marathon Deposit at surface and to depth as well as exploration drilling along the boggy covered area between the Marathon and Sprite Deposits.\nThe Valentine Lake Gold Camp is accessible by year-round road and is located in close proximity to Newfoundland’s electrical grid. Marathon maintains a 50-person all-season camp at the property. Recent metallurgical tests have demonstrated 93% to 98% recoveries via conventional milling and 50% to 70% recoveries via low cost heap leaching at both the Leprechaun and Marathon Deposits.\nTo find out more information on the Valentine Lake Gold Camp please visit www.marathon-gold.com .\nFor more information, please contact:\nJim Kirke\nChief Financial Officer\n(416) 987-0710 Phillip Walford\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n(416) 987-0711 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nExcept for statements of historical fact relating to Marathon Gold Corporation, certain information contained herein constitutes \"forward-looking statements\".
