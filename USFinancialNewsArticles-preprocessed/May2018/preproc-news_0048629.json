    "text": "Company is focusing on improving fundamentals, increasing sales, reducing operational expenses and increasing income\nCHICAGO, May 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Epazz, Inc . (OTC: EPAZ), a leading provider of cloud-based business software solutions, has reported its unaudited first quarter results for 2018. The company reported revenue of $474,145 compared with $473,974 for the first quarter of 2017. The company reported a net income of $15,050. This is a substantial turnaround in the company’s financial position. Additionally, the company’s interest expense has substantially decreased, dropping from $73,462 for the first quarter of 2017 to just $34,771 for the first quarter of 2018.\nEpazz, Inc.’s CEO, Shaun Passley, Ph.D., said, “Our valuation in the marketplace is not reflecting our true value. We expected our new versions of our cloud business software to assist in growing our revenues and increasing our profits.”\n“As we go on in 2018,” continued Passley, “we expect our Zenapay and other blockchain apps to begin to generate revenues. Zenapay is our blockchain payment solution for companies to accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.”\nIn October 2017 and prior to Zenapay’s release, the company announced that it saw an opportunity for Zenapay in fantasy sports. The Supreme Court recently decided to allow states to legalize sports betting, so there is now a major opportunity to push forward with plans to add fantasy sport features and functionality to Zenapay and other blockchain apps such as Tap Bitcoin.\nFuture Features Releases\nFantasy Sport Module\nThe Zenapay development team is working on adding fantasy sport features into its wallet. The Tap Bitcoin game will include the software in development for Zenapay.\nVendor and Payroll Payment Solution\nZenaPay’s development team is also working on a vendor payment solution that will allow merchant businesses to pay vendors and employees using cryptocurrencies.\nFuture features will include the following:\nAn e-commerce store Seed-to-sale tracking Sales reporting and compliance\nAbout ZenaPay ( www.ZenaPay.com )\nZenaPay is being developed to solve a major problem in high-risk industries: getting paid. Traditional banking systems do not allow high-risk industries to access their payment systems. ZenaPay offers a cutting-edge payment solution that gives consumers a way to buy items online or in stores using Bitcoin. The new Bitcoin payment software will allow consumers to use digital currency to make online or in-store purchases with ease. The process will also be anonymous because all transaction details are encrypted through Bitcoin, which will enable stores to accept digital currency instead of only cash. ZenaPay is available on the App Store and Play Store.\nAbout Epazz, Inc.
