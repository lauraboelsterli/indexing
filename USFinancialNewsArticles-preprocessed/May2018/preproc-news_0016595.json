    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. (NYSE: LBRT; “Liberty”) announced today first quarter 2018 financial and operational results.\nSummary Results and Highlights\nRevenue of $495 million and net income of $54 million 1 for the first quarter of 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million 2 and annualized adjusted EBITDA per average active fleet of $20.4 million for the first quarter of 2018\nMessage from Chris Wright, CEO\n“We are proud of our first quarter results. The Liberty team came together to deliver record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA despite significant operational challenges arising from unusual winter weather and sand logistics issues during the first quarter.\n“We are excited for the remainder of 2018. The frac market remains strong and in partnership with our customers we continue to drive increases in throughput across our entire fleet. The second quarter is off to a great start and we expect results for this period will surpass our Adjusted EBITDA per average active fleet from last year’s third quarter.\n“In the Permian, we are pleased with our deepening customer relationships and the results we are seeing. During the first quarter, we deployed our sixth Permian fleet under a dedicated arrangement. The Permian market remains tight for top tier, high-efficiency frac fleets, and pricing is strong. More importantly, we are seeing meaningful throughput and efficiency gains across our fleets in the basin.”\nFleet Deployment Update\nDuring Liberty deployed fleets 20 and 21 under dedicated arrangements with existing customers. Liberty has staffed fleet 22 and is on schedule to deploy that fleet on a dedicated basis at the end of the second quarter of 2018. As previously announced, Liberty anticipates fleets 23 and 24 will be delivered at the end of the third and fourth quarters of 2018 under dedicated arrangements.\n1 Net income attributable to Predecessor, controlling and noncontrolling interests 2 “Adjusted EBITDA” is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Please see the supplemental financial information in the table under “Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” at the end of this earnings release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. First Quarter 2018 Results\nFor revenue grew 10% to $495 million from $449 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet income totaled $54 million 1 in the first quarter compared to net income of $58 million in the fourth quarter. First quarter results included a $3 million one-time, non-recurring expense related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with our initial public offering. First quarter income tax expense totaled $8 million. Liberty was not subject to income tax prior to its initial public offering.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $100 million from $92 million in the fourth quarter. Annualized adjusted EBITDA per average active fleet increased to $20.4 million in the first quarter compared to $20.2 million in the fourth quarter. Please refer to the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) to net income (a GAAP measure) in this release.\nFor the trailing twelve-months ended March 31, 2018, the Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) was 39%. Please refer to the calculation of ROCE in this release.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, Liberty had cash on hand of $98 million and total debt of $107 million, net of discount. There were no borrowings drawn on the ABL credit facility, and total liquidity including availability under the credit facility was $311 million. On January 17, 2018, Liberty completed its initial public offering of approximately 14.6 million shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $17.00 per share.\nConference Call\nLiberty will host a conference call to discuss the results at 8:00 a.m. Mountain Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.

We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow the evaluation of our operating performance and compares the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We believe that the presentation of Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed allows the evaluation of our investment returns on capital and our effectiveness in deploying our assets. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. See the tables entitled “Reconciliation and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial and Operational Measures” for a reconciliation or calculation of the non-GAAP financial or operational measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nThe information above includes “ ” within the meaning of the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
