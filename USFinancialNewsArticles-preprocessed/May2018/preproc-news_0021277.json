    "text": "FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (NASDAQ: ICHR), a leader in the design, engineering, and manufacturing of critical fluid and gas delivery subsystems for semiconductor capital equipment, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nHighlights for the first quarter of 2018:\nRecord Revenues and Strong Growth. Revenues set a new quarterly record of $258 million, up 41% quarter-over-quarter and up 74% from the first quarter of 2017; Increasing Margins. With GAAP gross margin of 16.5%, non-GAAP gross margin increased 1.2 percentage points from the prior quarter to a record 18.3%. Operating margin was 8.0% on a GAAP basis, and reached a new record of 13.3% on a non-GAAP basis, up 2.1 percentage points from the prior quarter; Record Earnings. Net earnings were $0.63 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and set a new quarterly record of $1.03 per diluted share on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, up 47% quarter-over-quarter and up 81% from the first quarter of 2017.\n“We are very pleased to report stronger-than-expected financial results for the first quarter, in which we achieved new records in revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share,” commented Tom Rohrs, Chairman and CEO of Ichor. “We continue to outperform industry spending, with revenue growth well outpacing investments in wafer fab equipment, while continuing to deliver on our objective to grow earnings faster than revenues. Our strategic acquisitions are contributing to our strong revenue growth and expanding margins, and our first-quarter profitability is showing solid progress toward our financial model targets.\n“We recently announced the acquisition of IAN Engineering, providing us with a key strategic foothold in the rapidly-growing semiconductor equipment market in South Korea,” continued Mr. Rohrs. “We expect IAN will be yet another driver of revenue outperformance beginning in the second half of 2018, and certainly as we look ahead to 2019. Together with our previous acquisitions of Cal-Weld and Talon, as well as our proprietary liquid delivery platform, all of these businesses significantly expand our served markets and provide meaningful opportunities to expand our market share, enabling continued revenue growth and outperformance relative to industry spending.\n“Our outlook for 2018 has strengthened since last quarter, both in terms of revenue growth and profitability,” concluded Mr. Rohrs. Our greater market share, higher revenue volume, and increased gross margin are enabling us to make increased investments in manufacturing capacity to support our customers’ increasing demand for our solutions. While the second quarter is expected to moderate slightly from the record first quarter results, our first half revenues at the midpoint will be up 46% over the second half of 2017, and up 64% over the same period last year, and we fully expect full-year revenues to again outpace industry spending, with even higher growth expected in earnings.”\nQ1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages) U.S. GAAP Financial Results: Net sales $ 258,029 $ 182,936 $ 148,704 Gross profit percent 16.5 % 15.9 % 16.1 % Operating income percent 8.0 % 6.7 % 9.2 % Net income from continuing operations $ 16,721 $ 19,195 $ 12,952 Diluted EPS $ 0.63 $ 0.72 $ 0.51 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages) Non-GAAP Financial Results: Net sales $ 258,029 $ 182,936 $ 148,704 Gross profit percent 18.3 % 17.1 % 16.2 % Operating income percent 13.3 % 11.2 % 10.5 % Adjusted net income from continuing operations $ 27,450 $ 18,640 $ 14,567 Diluted EPS $ 1.03 $ 0.70 $ 0.57 U.S. GAAP Financial Results Overview\nFor the first quarter of 2018, revenue was $258.0 million, net income from continuing operations was $16.7 million, and net income from continuing operations per diluted share (“diluted EPS”) was $0.63. This compares to revenue of $182.9 million and $148.7 million, net income from continuing operations of $19.2 million and $13.0 million, and diluted EPS of $0.72 and $0.51, for the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Results Overview\nFor the first quarter of 2018, non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations was $27.5 million and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS was $1.03. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations of $18.6 million and $14.6 million, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS of $0.70 and $0.57, for the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Financial Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $244 to $254 million. We expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.86 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of and $0.91 to $1.00.\nThis outlook for non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS excludes known charges related to amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, tax adjustments related to these non-GAAP adjustments, and non-recurring charges known at the time of providing this outlook. This outlook for non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS excludes any items that are unknown at this time, such as non-recurring tax-related items or other unusual items which we are not able to predict without unreasonable efforts due to their inherent uncertainty.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Results\nAt March 30, 2018, we had cash of $63.8 million. The net decrease in cash of $5.5 million during the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to capital expenditures of $3.7 million, net cash used in financing activities of $1.1 million, and net cash used in operating activities of $0.8 million.\nWe used $0.8 million of cash in operating activities during the first quarter of 2018 due to a net increase of $27.3 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by net income of $16.7 million and net non-cash charges of $9.7 million. Non-cash charges primarily consist of $5.8 million in depreciation and amortization and $3.8 million in share-based compensation expense. The increase in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $26.4 million, due to increased sales volume and timing of shipments and customer payments during the quarter, and an increase in inventories of $10.5 million, due to increased materials purchases to support demand, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $8.7 million. Cash used in investing activities during the first quarter of 2018 of $3.7 million was from capital expenditures to support current and future growth. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 million due to share repurchases of $5.0 million and debt issuance costs of $2.1 million in connection with the refinancing of our credit facilities in February 2018, partially offset by $3.4 million in proceeds related to issuances of ordinary shares under our share-based compensation plans and $2.6 million in net borrowing of long-term debt in connection with the refinancing.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Results\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS. These non-GAAP metrics excluded amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, tax adjustments related to those non-GAAP adjustments, tax benefits from acquisitions, and non-recurring charges, to the extent they are present in gross profit, operating margin, and net income from continuing operations. A table showing these metrics on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, with reconciliation footnotes thereto, is included at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS is defined as non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations divided by weighted average diluted ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nManagement uses non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS to evaluate our operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors’ ability to view our results from management’s perspective. A table presenting the reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations to U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations is also included at the end of this press release.\nConference Call\nWe will conduct a conference call to discuss our first quarter 2018 results and business outlook on May 8, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time.\nTo listen to the conference call via the Internet, please visit the investor relations section of our web site at ir.ichorsystems.com .
