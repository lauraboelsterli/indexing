(Nasdaq: ARDX), today announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of up to $50,000,000 of shares of its common stock. All of the shares to be sold in the offering will be offered by Ardelyx. In addition, Ardelyx intends to grant the underwriters of the offering the right for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional $7,500,000 of shares of common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed.\nArdelyx currently expects to use its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the net proceeds of the offering to support its clinical development and pre-commercialization efforts for tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease who are on dialysis, including the ongoing second Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating tenapanor for such indication, its manufacturing efforts for tenapanor, research and development efforts for its RDX013 program, the preparation and submission of a New Drug Application for tenapanor for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and for general corporate purposes and working capital.\nJefferies and Leerink Partners are acting as joint book-running managers for the proposed offering.\nA registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and became effective on July 20, 2015. The offering is being made only by means of a written prospectus and prospectus supplement that will form a part of the registration statement. A preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the offering will be filed with the SEC and will be available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .
