    "text": "May 29, 2018 / 7:52 PM / a few seconds ago Royal wedding guest Serena blushes at timing of 'Queen is back' ad Richard Lough 2 Min Read\nPARIS (Reuters) - Few people can upstage American tennis great Serena Williams but even the 23-time Grand Slam champion knows one should never steal the show at a friend’s wedding, not least a royal wedding. Dressed in a skintight, all-in-one black bodysuit, broken up by a vivid scarlet belt, Serena captivated the French crowd from the start of the contest to its 7-6(4) 6-4 conclusion. \"Two years has been a really long time,\" she told the crowd in French, referring to her last match on clay. \"I am just so happy to have won a match here... thank you all.\" REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\nSo the timing of Nike’s advert “the Queen is back”, launched to coincide with the first-time mother’s return to the French Open, was, she said, a touch embarrassing.\n“Nike came up with this idea right when I decided I was going to come back. And so it’s kind of interesting how it all tied into the wedding and, you know, then I felt a little awkward!” Serena told a news conference after stunning the Roland Garros crowds with her all-in-black catsuit.\n“Now, you know, Meghan is royalty and I have known her for so many years, and I’m like, I’m not — now she’s a princess. A duchess, I should say, excuse me.” Williams has spoken about health concerns over blood clots in the days after giving birth, and on Tuesday said: \"Yeah, the catsuit, I had a lot of problems with my blood clots, and, God, I don't know how many I have had in the past 12 months ... So it is definitely a little functionality to it. I have been wearing pants in general a lot when I play so I can keep, you know, the blood circulation going. It's a fun suit, but it's also functional so I can be able to play without any problems.\" REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\n“But anyway, it’s all really cool.”\nSerena joined Queen Elizabeth, senior royals and celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney and David Beckham at the marriage of Prince Harry and his actress bride Meghan Markle earlier this month. Slideshow (3 Images)\nThe ceremony in a mediaeval chapel at Windsor Castle blended ancient English ritual with African American culture, breaking with tradition, in particular the passionate sermon of U.S. Episcopalian bishop Michael Bruce Curry that was far removed from the sombre tones of the Church of England.\n“You know, it was really exciting to see so much African-American culture impacted in the wedding, and I was really happy that Meghan wanted to incorporate that into it,” Serena said.\n“I think it was just a whole cultural shift and change. It was seeing how far African-Americans have come, I thought it was an incredibly inspiring and beautiful and really motivating thing.”\nBut she poured cold water over British media stories that she ran a beer pong table at which she used her tennis skills to come out on top.\n“Oh, there was no beer pong. I don’t know where this story (came from) — I don’t even drink beer.” Reporting by Richard Lough; editing by Ken Ferris",
