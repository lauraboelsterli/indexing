REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri\nExpectations of a bumper sugarcane crop this year have led to falling prices and caused financial losses for sugar mills, which are seeking federal and state government support to cover what they owe farmers.\nIndia is the second largest sugar producer after Brazil, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to placate the country’s 50 million cane growers, who have an influential political lobby.\nKarnataka, among the largest cane growers, holds state elections next week, while a national election is due by early next year.Earlier this week, the Modi government decided to offer a subsidy of 55 rupees per tonne to sugarcane farmers and it is now considering ways to raise funds through an additional levy on retail sugar prices.\nIndia had abolished a surcharge on sugar, or cess, after the introduction of the nationwide GST last year, but the central government has proposed reintroducing it in response to requests by some states.\nSpeaking to reporters after meeting state and central finance ministry officials attending a GST council, Jaitley said five ministers were expected to deliver other recommendations in the next two weeks, including “the imposition of a cess or temporarily increasing the tax.”\nWholesale sugar prices fell by more than 10 percent in March from a year ago.\nIndustry officials last month said the amount owed by sugar mills to farmers could leap to a record 250 billion rupees ($3.8 billion) in the 2017/18 season.\nAnalysts said a proposed additional levy of 2-5 percent would undermine the goal of the GST, which had been hailed as a landmark reform that would create for the first time a single market for India’s 29 states.\nAtul Gupta, a senior director at Deloitte India, said that reintroducing a surcharge would send a wrong signal, and urged the council to focus on steps to reduce evasion of GST in order to raise funds.
