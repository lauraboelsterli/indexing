    "text": "3 COMMENTS New York City is expected to announce Wednesday plans for a campaign and website that aim to help women navigate—in one place—the myriad services available to them that are currently hard to find or access.\nThe initiative, called Women.NYC, is being led by Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor of economic development and housing. It will cover a variety of topics and services, ranging from applying for a job with the city and signing up for the Pre-K program to reporting sexual harassment or wage discrimination.\nThe city already offers hundreds of different services backed by millions of taxpayer dollars to support women and their businesses. But those resources often are poorly marketed across the city’s dozens of websites or are a headache to access.\nIn the future, the effort will include training programs for women and partnerships with outside groups and nonprofits that also primarily support women.\nWomen’s Work Women make less than men Full-time, year round workers’ earnings in New York state\nFemale\nMale\n$50,000\n40,000\n30,000\n20,000\n10,000\n0\n2006\n2016\n2011\nMedian earnings by borough*\nMale\nFemale\n$50,000\n$75,000\n$100,000\n$25,000\n$0\nBronx\nBrooklyn\nManhattan\nQueens\nTotal median\nearnings\nStaten\nIsland\n*In the past 12 months for full-time, year-round civilian employed, 16 years and over, in 2016 inflation-adjusted dollars\nSource: New York State Department of Labor\nMs. McCray said women have much to juggle and need simplicity in accessing city programs.\n“We have many excellent services, but we don’t make it easy for women to connect to them,” said Ms. McCray. “It’s like a maze you have to navigate.”\nThe initiative comes at a time when women’s pay, workplace discrimination and harassment have taken center stage. Meanwhile, Mr. de Blasio has been criticized in recent weeks for saying there is a “hyper-complaint dynamic” that has led to hundreds of sexual-harassment complaints at the city’s Department of Education.\nMs. McCray dismissed the recent criticism, saying the mayor’s “passion and intent are in the right place” in terms of making sure policies and programs for women are accessible.\n“He’s walking the walk,” she said.\nWomen in the state have the narrowest wage gap in the nation, earning the equivalent of 89 cents to each dollar by male counterparts, according to a report released last month by the New York State Department of Labor. In New York City, the ratio is 88.6 cents.\nWomen are more likely to live in poverty than men. A report last month from the city found that in 2016, the poverty rate for females was 20.7% compared with 18.1% for males.\nDeputy Mayor Alicia Glen says the city will be calling for private-sector employers to close the wage gap by 2028. Photo: Benjamin Kanter/Mayoral Photo Office As part of the Women.NYC initiative, the city will be calling for private-sector employers to close the gender wage gap by 2028. Ms. Glen said the city is exploring legislative options to force employers to make public gender pay gap figures, which are seen by some as an important tool for achieving equal pay.\nMs. Glen pointed to a law enacted last year that prohibits employers in New York City from inquiring about salary history during the hiring process as a way to help reduce the wage gap.\nThe city, she said, is committed to opening investigations into employers who try to seek a salary history from a job applicant.\n“We will come and get you,” she said.\nWrite to Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.com",
