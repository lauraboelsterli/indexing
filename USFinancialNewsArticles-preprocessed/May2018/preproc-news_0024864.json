    "text": "May 9 (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc Chief Operating Officer Simon Kirby will leave the company in June as the British manufacturer looks to streamline its business, it said in a memo to staff seen by Reuters.\nKirby joined the group in 2016 from British high-speed rail project HS2 to take up a newly created post and was tasked with a “group-wide transformation agenda”.\n“As we update our organisation and move to more empowered business units with a much leaner centre, it has become clear that we no longer need the Group Chief Operating Officer role for which Simon Kirby was recruited in autumn 2016”, Chief Executive Warren East said in the memo.\nEast has been trying to reshape Rolls during his three years in charge after declines in some of its older aero-engine programmes and plunging demand for oil equipment.\n“I want to thank Simon for his huge contribution to reducing central costs as part of the transformation programme, despite in doing so, working himself out of his own role”, East said.\n$1 = 0.8434 euros Reporting by Kate Holton in London; Writing by Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Editing by Mark Potter\n ",
