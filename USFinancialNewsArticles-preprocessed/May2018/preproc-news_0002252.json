    "text": "By Chris Morris 10:31 AM EDT\nThe parent company of Budweiser has placed an order for 800 hydrogen-electric semi-trucks from Nikola Motor, throwing its weight behind the Tesla competitor as the brewer moves to reduce its carbon footprint.\nAnheuser-Busch says this is the first step in a plan to convert its entire dedicated fleet to renewable power by 2025. The company expects to begin integrating the Nikola trucks into its fleet in 2020.\n“At Anheuser-Busch we’re continuously searching for ways to improve sustainability across our entire value chain and drive our industry forward,” said Michel Doukeris, CEO of Anheuser-Busch. “The transport industry is one that is ripe for innovative solutions and Nikola is leading the way with hydrogen-electric, zero-emission capabilities. We are very excited by the possibilities our partnership with them can offer.”\nNikola says the trucks will be able to travel between 500 and 1,200 miles per charge— and can be refilled within 20 minutes, reducing idle time.\nThursday’s announcement is significantly larger than Anheuser-Busch’s order of 40 Tesla self-driving semis , which the brewer made last December.\nAnheuser-Busch says it hopes to reduce its CO2 emissions by 25% by 2025. The brewer says when these trucks are operational, it will be the equivalent of taking over 13,000 passenger cars off the road. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
