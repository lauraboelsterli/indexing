    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., May 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- (NASDAQ: VIAV) Viavi Solutions Inc. (\"VIAVI\") today announced that on May 22, 2018 it has entered into privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its outstanding 0.625% Senior Convertible Notes due 2033 (the \"2033 Notes\") pursuant to which VIAVI will exchange $151.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2033 Notes for $155.5 million aggregate principal amount of newly issued 1.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 (the \"New Notes\") (the \"Exchange Transactions\"). Following the closing of the Exchange Transactions, $277.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2033 Notes will remain outstanding with terms unchanged. VIAVI also announced that on May 22, 2018, it has entered into subscription agreements pursuant to which VIAVI has agreed to sell in a private placement to institutional accredited investors $69.5 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes (the \"Private Placement\"). The Exchange Transactions and the Private Placement are expected to close concurrently on or about May 29, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nWhen issued:\nThe New Notes will represent senior unsecured obligations of VIAVI and pay interest semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2018, at a rate of 1.75% per annum; The New Notes will mature on June 1, 2023, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased; The New Notes will be convertible at the option of holders in certain circumstances and during certain periods into cash up to their principal amount, and into cash, shares of VIAVI's common stock or a combination of cash and VIAVI's common stock at VIAVI's election for the conversion value above the principal amount, if any. The initial conversion rate is 71.7231 shares of VIAVI's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of New Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.94 per share and will be subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. This represents an approximately 37.5% conversion premium over the closing price of $10.14 of VIAVI's common stock on May 22, 2018; and VIAVI may redeem for cash all or any portion of the New Notes, at its option, on or after June 1, 2021, under certain circumstances at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nVIAVI will not receive any cash proceeds from the Exchange Transactions. In exchange for issuing the New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Transactions, VIAVI will receive and cancel the exchanged 2033 Notes. VIAVI estimates that net cash proceeds from the Private Placement will be approximately $67.3 million after deducting estimated offering expenses for both the Exchange Transactions and the Private Placement. VIAVI intends to use net cash proceeds from the Private Placement for general corporate purposes.\nThe New Notes and any of VIAVI's common stock issuable upon conversion of the New Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold without registration under, or an applicable exemption from, the registration requirements. This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell, nor is it a solicitation of an offer to buy, these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any state or any jurisdiction.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
