    "text": "7 COMMENTS Teenagers have always worried about how they measure up: Am I popular? Attractive? Do I fit in?\nSocial media now answers those questions in a very public and quantifiable way. It’s not just about the number of “likes” and online friends a young person has. The data on popularity can be even more granular: how many photos you’re “tagged” in, the level of activity and comments on your posts, how long it takes to accumulate those status markers, and even the “follow ratio,” that is, how many people you follow versus follow you.\nSites like Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook offer much more than a virtual place to hang out. New research shows that they play a key role in how teens measure and manage social success; it also finds that the overuse of social media may bring added risks to an adolescent’s mental health.\nFor many teens, social media offers positive benefits, such as a deeper connection with friends and a low-stakes way to communicate with peers. For those on the social margins, online communities also can offer a sense of belonging and support.\nBut for others, it can be stressful to keep up with hundreds of online friends, maintain a perfectly curated digital profile and manage the onslaught of posts showing peers living seemingly better lives. “The hyper-vigilance that some adolescents feel forced to maintain online is anxiety-provoking and hijacks time away from more important things like homework and sleep,” says Catherine Steiner-Adair, a clinical psychologist in Chestnut Hill, Mass., and the author of “The Big Disconnect.” Before social media, she adds, home was a place where you could be a more relaxed, authentic version of yourself. Now some teens never get that break.\nA study led by Jacqueline Nesi of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published in March in the Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology, calls the quest for online popularity “digital status seeking.” The researchers followed 716 adolescents, ages 15 to 18, for one year. They found that adolescents who were more engaged in digital status seeking—frequent social-media users who employed status-seeking strategies and reported caring more about their online popularity—were more likely, a year later, to be engaged in risky behavior such as substance abuse and having an increased number of sexual partners. Ms. Nesi theorizes that this is perhaps because they “are more willing to engage in behaviors that will make them appear popular.”\nAdolescent girls can be especially susceptible. In a longitudinal study in the U.K. published in March in the journal BMC Public Health, researchers followed nearly 10,000 adolescents between the ages of 10 and 15 for five years. The study found that at age 10, 10% of girls and 7% of boys reported spending one to three hours a day on social media. By age 15, the figures increased to 43% of girls and 31% of boys. Girls who used social media for more than an hour a day at age 10 were found to have the highest risk for developing social and emotional problems at age 15.\nSome adolescents even resort to paying for online validation.

The strong association between well-being and use of social media didn’t hold for boys, perhaps because they spend more time playing online games and less making social comparisons, says lead researcher Cara Booker of the University of Essex.\nAnother recent study, published in the Journal of Research on Adolescence, looked at the effort that goes into cultivating online identities. In a series of focus groups, many of the study’s participants (27 females and 24 males, ages 12 to 18) talked about the need to appear “interesting and likable” online, but girls added the need to be “attractive.” They were also found to be more strategic in building their social capital, by posting content at peak hours for traffic, for example, and enlisting friends to comment on and “like” posts to boost their popularity. Several of the girls described the process as a lot of “work,” but none of the boys described it that way, nor did they expect close friends to “like” or comment on their posts.\nSome adolescents even resort to paying for online validation. A pilot study of 110 Canadian teens, ages 13 to 17, presented this week at a conference in St. Catharines, Ontario, found that more than 70% engaged in one or more “deceptive like-seeking behaviors,” such as purchasing 500 “likes” for $6.99 through a website or using computer programs to give themselves a “digital nose job” before posting.\nMore Essays\nGive Processed Food a Break May 4, 2018 We’ve Got to Stop Meeting Like This: Tips for Better Workplace Gatherings May 4, 2018 The Danger of Constant Impeachment Talk May 4, 2018 The Teenage Social-Media Trap May 4, 2018 A #MeToo Divorce Debate in the Philippines April 27, 2018 Lead researcher Tara Dumas of Huron University College in London, Ontario, calls the findings “concerning.” She adds, “We know from previous research that social validation and belonging is so important for adolescents, but when you are getting ‘likes’ by buying them or based on an image of you that’s not real, what is that doing to your self-esteem?”\n“Too many young people, typically girls, conflate the attention they get on social media with their self-worth,” says Rachel Simmons, a leadership development specialist at Smith College and the author of “Enough As She Is.”\nWhat can parents do? Pulling back the curtain on social media—exposing the tactics that are used to get us hooked—can help teens think more critically about how they’re participating in a system that profits from their obsession with “likes,” says Ms. Simmons.\nDr. Steiner-Adair advises parents to check in daily about what’s going on in their teen’s online world and to stay approachable. “Parents need to start taking as much interest in their teen’s online life as they do their real one,” she says.\n—Ms. Wallace is a freelance writer in New York.\nRelated reading\nScreen Time for Kids Is Awful—And I Can’t Live Without It Parents’ Dilemma: When to Give Children Smartphones How Tech Experts Monitor Their Teens on Social Media How to Raise More Grateful Children",
