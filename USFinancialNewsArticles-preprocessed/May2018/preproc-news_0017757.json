MW Installed of approximately 40 MWs for the quarter. Total cumulative MWs installed were approximately 905 MWs. Installations were 5,813 for the quarter. Cumulative installations were 132,643. Estimated Retained Value increased by approximately $77 million during the quarter to approximately $1.7 billion. Estimated Retained Value per Watt at quarter end was $2.02. Cost per Watt was $3.15, an increase from $2.95 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase from $2.98 in the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancing Activity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had $200 million in undrawn capacity in the aggregation facility and approximately 29 MWs of available installation capacity remaining in its tax equity funds. Subsequent to quarter end, the company closed a new tax equity partnership with a $101 million commitment that will fund the installation of approximately 64 MWs with a new tax equity investor.\nSummary First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\n$ amounts in millions, except per share data\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nYoY\nRevenue:\nOperating leases and incentives\n$\n31.1\n$\n30.4\nup 2%\nSolar energy system and product sales\n37.1\n22.7\nup 63%\nTotal Revenue\n68.3\n53.1\nup 28%\nCost of revenue:\nOperating leases and incentives\n38.7\n35.1\nup 10%\nSolar energy system and product sales\n26.0\n18.7\nup 40%\nTotal cost of revenue\n64.7\n53.7\nup 20%\nGross profit (loss)\n3.5\n(0.6)\nup 667%\nLoss from Operations\n(28.1)\n(31.1)\nup 10%\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(13.0)\n$\n13.3\ndown 198%\nNet (loss) income per diluted share\n$\n(0.11)\n$\n0.11\ndown 200%\nNon-GAAP net loss per share\n$\n(0.53)\n$\n(0.50)\ndown 6%\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nGuidance for the Second Quarter 2018\nThe following statements are based on current expectations.

sensitivity analysis of our estimate of retained value of solar energy systems under contracts as of March 31, 2018, including both the contracted and estimated renewal portion, at a range of discount rates (retained value amounts in millions):\n4%\n6%\n8%\nEstimated retained value under energy contracts\n$\n1,541.0\n$\n1,295.7\n$\n1,102.6\nEstimated retained value of renewal\n617.0\n396.6\n257.8\nTotal estimated retained value\n$\n2,158.0\n$\n1,692.3\n$\n1,360.4\nNon-GAAP Earnings per Share (EPS) Before Non-controlling Interests\nWe report GAAP EPS, which is based upon net (loss attributable) income available to common stockholders. We also report non-GAAP EPS. The difference between GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS is that non-GAAP EPS is based on net loss, which excludes net loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests. As we are in a net loss position for all periods reported, potentially issuable shares are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation since the effect would be antidilutive. Therefore, basic and diluted non-GAAP EPS are the same in each period presented.\nUnder GAAP accounting, we report net loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests to reflect our joint venture fund investors' allocable share in the results of these joint venture investment funds. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests is calculated based primarily on the hypothetical liquidation at book value, or HLBV, method, which assumes that the joint venture funds are liquidated at the reporting date, even though liquidation may or may not ever occur. Additionally, the returns that will be allocated to the investors over the expected terms of the investment funds may differ significantly from the amounts calculated under the HLBV method. Accordingly, we also report non-GAAP EPS based on our losses before net loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests per share, which we view as a better measure of our operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAccording to this definition, the non-GAAP loss before the allocation of loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests per share was ($0.53) for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nVivint Solar, Inc.\nReconciliation from GAAP EPS to Non-GAAP EPS\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet Loss\nEPS\nNet Loss\nEPS\nNet (loss attributable) income available to common stockholders\n$\n(12,976)\n$\n(0.11)\n$\n13,292\n$\n0.12\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests\n(48,408)\n(0.42)\n(68,744)\n(0.62)\nNon-GAAP net loss\n$\n(61,384)\n$\n(0.53)\n$\n(55,452)\n$\n(0.50)\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share\n115,155\n110,765\nGlossary of Definitions\n\" Installations \" represents the number of solar energy systems installed on customers' premises.\n\" MWs or megawatts \" represents the DC nameplate megawatt production capacity.\n\" MW Booked \" represents the aggregate megawatt nameplate capacity of solar energy systems that were permitted during the period net of cancellations in the period.\n\" MW Installed \" represents the aggregate megawatt nameplate capacity of solar energy systems for which panels, inverters, and mounting and racking hardware have been installed on customer premises in the period.\n\" Nominal Contracted Payments Remaining \" equals the sum of the remaining cash payments that Vivint Solar's customers are expected to pay over the term of their agreements for systems installed as of the measurement date. For a power purchase agreement, Vivint Solar multiplies the contract price per kilowatt-hour by the estimated annual energy output of the associated solar energy system to determine the estimated nominal contracted payments. For a customer lease, Vivint Solar includes the monthly fees and upfront fee, if any, as set forth in the lease.\n\" Retained Value \" represents the net cash flows, discounted at 6%, that Vivint Solar expects to receive from customers pursuant to long-term customer contracts net of estimated cash distributions to fund investors and estimated operating expenses for systems installed as of the measurement date. For purposes of the calculation, Vivint Solar aggregates the estimated retained value from the solar energy systems during the typical 20-year term of Vivint Solar's contracts, which Vivint Solar refers to as estimated retained value under energy contracts, and the estimated retained value associated with an assumed 10-year renewal term following the expiration of the initial contract term, which Vivint Solar refers to as estimated retained value of renewal. To calculate estimated retained value of renewal, Vivint Solar assumes all contracts are renewed at 90% of the contractual price in effect at the expiration of the initial term.\n\" Retained Value per Watt \" is calculated by dividing the estimated retained value as of the measurement date by the aggregate nameplate capacity of solar energy systems under long-term customer contracts that have been installed as of such date, and is subject to the same assumptions and uncertainties as estimated retained value.\n\" Undeployed Tax Equity Financing Capacity \" represents a forecast of the amount of megawatts that can be deployed based on committed available tax equity financing for energy contracts.\nInvestor Contact:\nRob Kain\n855-842-1844\nir@vivintsolar.com\nPress Contact:\nHelen Langan\n385-202-6577\npr@vivintsolar.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivint-solar-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300644660.html\nSOURCE Vivint Solar",
