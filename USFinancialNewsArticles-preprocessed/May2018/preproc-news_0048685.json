FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Champions League - Paris St Germain Press Conference - Parc des Princes, Paris, France - March 5, 2018 Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery during the press conference REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\nThe 46-year-old has been hired to fill the sizeable void left by the departure of Frenchman Arsene Wenger who had been at the Arsenal helm since 1996.\n\"I am thrilled to be joining one of the great clubs in the game,\" Emery, who spent the past two seasons at Paris St Germain, taking them to a domestic treble this season, told the Arsenal website www.arsenal.com .\n“Arsenal is known and loved throughout the world for its style of play, its commitment to young players, the fantastic stadium, the way the club is run.\n“I’m very excited to be given the responsibility to start this important new chapter in Arsenal’s history.”\nArsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis said Emery had emerged as the strongest candidate after a “wide-ranging and rigorous search” for Wenger’s replacement.\n“Unai has an outstanding track record of success throughout his career, has developed some of the best young talent in Europe and plays an exciting, progressive style of football that fits Arsenal perfectly,” he said.\n“His hard-working, passionate approach and his sense of values on and off the pitch make him the ideal person to take us forward.”\nEmery won the Ligue 1 title, the French Cup and the League Cup this past season in Paris. Before his time in France he spent three years at Sevilla, winning three consecutive Europa League trophies. He has also had spells in Spain with Valencia and Almeria after beginning his coaching career with Lorca Deportiva.\nThe only blot on his managerial copybook was a short spell at Spartak Moscow where he was sacked in 2012.

We’re confident he is the right person for the job and that he will work to deliver the triumphs our fans, staff and everyone who cares about Arsenal want,” he said.\n“He shares our vision to move forward, to build on the platform created by Arsene Wenger and help this club enjoy greater success.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by John O'Brien and Christian Radnedge",
