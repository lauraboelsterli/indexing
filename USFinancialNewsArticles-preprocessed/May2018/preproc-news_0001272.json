REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\nShares of the company rose 2.4 percent to $5.08 in extended trading as the company’s quarterly revenue also beat Wall Street expectations.\nTotal operating expenses fell to $119.7 million from $156.8 million.\nThe company - which exited its Karma drone business to stem losses- has been trying to attract users with its $199.99 entry-level HERO camera that was announced in March.\nThe company in April also announced huge discounts and trade-up programs for its premium products.\nDemand for GoPro’s cameras have been waning as users move to cheaper options and smartphones with powerful cameras.\nThe company’s net loss narrowed to $76.3 million, or 55 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $111.2 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company lost 34 cents per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of a loss of 37 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nGoPro — whose cameras are used by surfers, skydivers and other action junkies — said revenue fell to $202.35 million from $218.61 million. Analysts had expected revenue of $184.2 million. Reporting by Pushkala Aripaka and Anirban Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur",
