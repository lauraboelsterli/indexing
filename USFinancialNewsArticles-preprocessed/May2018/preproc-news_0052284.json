Chinese premier Li Keqiang, in a joint media appearance with Merkel at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, said China and Germany both upheld global free trade, and stressed the huge potential for cooperation between them.\n** Most sectors lost ground for the day, led by consumer and industry firms. ** Bucking the broad trend, dairy producers gained as Beijing plans more measures to boost dairy industry, with Lanzhou Zhuangyuan Pasture up 10 percent in Shenzhen. firmer by 0.16 percent, while closed down 1.11 percent . ** At 0704 GMT, the yuan was Quote: d at 6.3885 per U.S. dollar, percent weaker 6.3883. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Hainan Haiqi Transportation Group Co Ltd up 10.02 percent, followed by Zhejiang Tieliu Clutch Co Ltd gaining 10.02 percent and Shanghai Tianyong Engineering Co Ltd up by 10.01 percent. ** The largest percentage losses in the Shanghai index were Shanghai Baosight Software Co Ltd down 6.91 percent, followed by TVZone Media Co Ltd losing 6.17 percent and Wuxi Hongsheng Heat Exchanger Manufacturing Co Ltd down by 5.92 percent. ** So far this year, the Shanghai stock index is down 4.6 percent, the CSI300 has fallen 5 percent while China’s H-share index listed in Hong Kong is up 3.5 percent. Shanghai stocks have risen 2.36 percent this month. ** As of 0705 GMT, China’s 20.41 (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)\n ",
