(\"Enertec\"), a 22 year-old private company, Israel’s largest private developer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the aerospace and defense markets. Enertec generated over $8 million in annual revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nCoolisys Technologies Inc.\nEnertec is recognized for providing multi-purpose turnkey systems designed to serve in harsh environments and battlefield conditions.

Enertec was a subsidiary of Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc., an entity until recently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\"MICT\").\nCommenting on the transaction, Coolisys’ President and CEO Amos Kohn stated, \"The purchase of Enertec marks a major step in continuing to execute our acquisition growth strategy in 2018. We are very pleased that, through this strategic acquisition, we will realize an increase in our sales revenues, an expansion of our customer base, and Coolisys will benefit from Enertec's innovative technology. Additionally, Coolisys will increase its technological and manufacturing capabilities, thereby positioning itself as an advanced aerospace and defense technology supplier for major strategic defense programs. Further, Enertec may provide synergistic opportunities that Coolisys may leverage through its worldwide divisions and affiliated entities. We strongly believe that the acquisition of Enertec will also invigorate Coolisys’ endeavors in the growing medical and commercial electronics sectors in both international and domestic markets.\" Mr. Kohn added, \"Coolisys, with Enertec’s assistance, will target the U.S. Department of Defense's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Military Financing (FMF) programs as well as expand its sales by offering its new product and services portfolios to other global defense markets such as India, members of NATO, other countries and agencies.\"\nCoolisys paid to the seller $4,772,520 in cash and assumed $4,288,439 revolving debt of Enertec to certain banks.
