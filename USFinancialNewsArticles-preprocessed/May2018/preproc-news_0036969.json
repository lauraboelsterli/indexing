Any moment the sanctions will be put in place and nobody wants to take a risk,” Maciej Wozniak of the state-run PGNiG told Reuters.\n“We can take risks when we are drilling and looking for hydrocarbons, but we will not take risks playing politics,” he said, adding the project consisted of providing technical expertise in gas extraction in Iran.
