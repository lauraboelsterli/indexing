    "text": "(Reuters) - British vaping liquids manufacturer Supreme Plc said on Friday it would postpone its London listing citing market conditions.\nThe decision was taken despite encouraging institutional support, Supreme, which is also a distributor of battery and lighting products, said in a brief statement.\nAccording to the company, Supreme was looking to raise 10 million pounds ($13.52 million) in fresh capital from the listing and aiming for a market valuation of between 100-150 million pounds ($203 million-$135 million).\nChief Executive Sandy Chadha, who currently holds 100 percent of the company, also planned to sell shares in the supplier of liquids for e-cigarettes.\nIt would have become the first vaping business to float in London.\nIn 2017, a string of companies, including Britainâ€™s biggest debt collector Cabot Credit Management, ditched attempts to list in London.\nGreensphere Capital ( IPO-GRN.L ) announced a decision to postpone initial public offering in December.\nThe IPO market has been muted since the country voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, making firms skittish about market launches.\n($1 = 0.7398 pounds)\nReporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru and Ben Martin in LONDON\n ",
