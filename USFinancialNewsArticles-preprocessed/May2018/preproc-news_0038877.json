U.S. President Donald Trump looks up during his meeting with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev at the White House in Washington. U.S., May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n“We’ll have to see,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if the summit was still on.\n“No decision, we haven’t been notified at all ... We haven’t seen anything, we haven’t heard anything,” he said. Reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama",
