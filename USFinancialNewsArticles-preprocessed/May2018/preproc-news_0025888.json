In each one-hour episode, self-made real-estate mogul and serial entrepreneur, Sidney Torres , brings his multi-million dollar fortune and expertise to the aid of struggling property investors.\nIn exchange for a piece of the property and a percentage of the profits, Sidney helps these inexperienced developers restore their rundown homes to their former glory. Torres lives for the thrill of deal-making and using his vast resources, design savvy and years of experience to transform both the people and properties in need of his help.\nThis season takes viewers through every stage of the renovation process, as Torres works with everyone from aspiring and ambitious novices to seasoned, down-on-their-luck real-estate developers. Some of the partners featured this season include an ambitious law student looking to make his mark in real estate, a couple seeking to turn their flipping dream into a reality after a 10-year wait, a pair of recovering addicts looking for a fresh start, and one of Sidney's oldest friends who's in desperate need of help with his million dollar money pit.\n\"The Deed\" is produced for CNBC by Cineflix (Deed 2) Inc. with Dave Hamilton and Karin Jarlstedt among the executive producers for Cineflix. Jim Ackerman and Adam Barry are the executive producers for CNBC.\nFor more information regarding The Deed, visit: https://www.cnbc.com/the-deed/\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheDeedCNBC/\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedeedcnbc/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedeedcnbc\nAbout CNBC:\nWith CNBC in the U.S., CNBC in Asia Pacific, CNBC in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and CNBC World, CNBC is the recognized world leader in business news and provides real-time financial market coverage and business information to more than 409 million homes worldwide, including more than 91 million households in the United States and Canada.
