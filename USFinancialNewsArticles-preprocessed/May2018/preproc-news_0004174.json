    "text": "~ Strong 1Q18 Growth in Sales, Profit, and Cash Flow ~\n~ Announces Planned Divestiture of Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics Product Lines for $600 million ~\n~ Increases 2018 Outlook for Sales, Profit, and Cash Flow ~\nFRISCO, Texas, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Integer Holdings Corporation (NYSE:ITGR), a leading medical device outsource manufacturer, today announced results for the three months ended March 30, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nSales of $382 million, an increase of 10.5% reported, 8.8% organic versus prior year. GAAP Net Income increased $12 million to $8 million, Non-GAAP increased $7 million to $20 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $69 million. GAAP Diluted EPS increased $0.39 to $0.25 per share, Non-GAAP increased $0.20 to $0.61 per share. Unfavorable $0.03 from foreign currency losses in GAAP & Non-GAAP EPS. Paid down $50 million of debt as Cash Flow from Operating Activities grew 19% to $46 million. Increasing 2018 Sales outlook by $20 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $5 million and Adjusted EPS by $0.05 per share.\nAnnounces Planned Divestiture of Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics Product Lines for $600 million\nSigned Agreement on May 3, 2018 to sell AS&O Product Lines to MedPlast, LLC for $600 million. MedPlast, LLC to receive ~$400 million in sales (2017 basis); Integer sales reduced by ~$350 million (2017 basis) after entering into long-term supply agreement with MedPlast, LLC. Expect to close in 3Q18. Combination of MedPlast, LLC and Integer’s AS&O product lines creates a market leader in Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics that will be one of the largest MDO’s serving this market. Divestiture creates a higher margin and more profitable Integer after use of proceeds for debt repayment. The significant deleveraging creates financial flexibility to invest more aggressively to drive growth in Integer’s market leadership positions in Cardio & Vascular and Cardiac & Neuromodulation.\nExecuting Operational Strategy for Accelerated Growth\nDeveloping and implementing multi-year roadmap for Six Strategic Imperatives. Defining “Excellence” for each imperative and aligning resources and compensation to achievement.\n“Integer delivered another quarter of high single digit sales growth with even stronger net income and cash flow growth, which enabled significant debt repayment during the quarter,” said Joseph Dziedzic, Integer’s president and chief executive officer. “Our current growth trajectory supports our increased sales, profit and cash flow outlook for 2018.”\n“We also announced today the planned sale of our Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics product lines to MedPlast, LLC for $600 million,” continued Mr. Dziedzic. “During our strategic review last year, we identified the opportunity to unlock significant value for Integer shareholders through the divestiture of our AS&O product line to a market leader like MedPlast, LLC. The synergies from this combination include increased innovation, manufacturing capability, and scale, which is reflected in the sale price.”\n“After completing the sale and paying down debt with the proceeds, we expect Integer to be a higher margin business with increased net earnings, higher returns on invested capital, debt leverage below four times, and cash flows similar to those prior to the divestiture,” concluded Mr. Dziedzic. “Looking forward, Integer has clear market leadership positions in our remaining product lines, with differentiated technology and increased financial flexibility to invest more aggressively to grow. We are now better positioned to deliver on our objectives of sales growth above the market, profit growth two times sales growth, and to earn a valuation premium.”\n2018 Outlook (a)\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nGAAP Non-GAAP (b)(c) As Reported Growth Adjusted Growth Sales $1,510 to $1,550 3% to 6% $1,510 to $1,550 3% to 6% Net Income $50 to $60 (25%) to (10%) $103 to $113 14% to 25% EBITDA N/A N/A $310 to $320 9% to 12% Earnings per Diluted Share $1.55 to $1.85 (26%) to (11%) $3.20 to $3.50 14% to 25%\n(a) Integer’s 2018 Outlook does not reflect the potential impact of the planned divestiture of the Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics product lines that was announced on May 3, 2018. (b) Except as described below, further reconciliations by line item to the closest corresponding GAAP financial measure for Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share and Adjusted EBITDA, included in our “2018 Outlook” above, are not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and visibility of the charges excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure. (c) Adjusted Net Income and EPS for 2018 is expected to consist of GAAP Net Income and EPS, excluding items such as intangible amortization, IP-related litigation costs, consolidation and realignment costs, asset disposition and write-down charges, and loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $63 million. The after-tax impact of these items is estimated to be approximately $50 million, or approximately $1.54 per diluted share. Additionally, Adjusted Net Income and EPS is expected to exclude the estimated impact relating to our disallowed deduction of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax, as mandated by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”). This disallowed deduction of the GILTI tax (approximately 50% of the total GILTI tax) is due to the Company making use of its U.S. net operating losses (“NOLs”), and will be eliminated once the Company’s U.S. NOLs are fully utilized, which is expected to be in approximately three to five years. This adjustment makes our Adjusted Diluted EPS more comparable with other global companies that are not subject to this disallowed GILTI tax deduction and more comparable to the Company’s results following the full utilization of its U.S. NOLs. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to consist of Adjusted Net Income, excluding items such as depreciation, interest, stock-based compensation and taxes totaling approximately $207 million.

Refer to Table D at the end of this release for a reconciliation of these amounts. Discussion of First Quarter Financial Results\nMedical segment sales grew on a reported and organic basis driven by strong demand for Integer-owned and contract manufactured products in the Cardio & Vascular product line and strength in the Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics and Portable Medical product line, primarily driven by continued organic growth in spinal implants, ramping of new products and support of a customer inventory build program. Strong Neuromodulation demand and the resolution of a prior year supply constraint drove solid growth in the Cardiac & Neuromodulation product line. Non-Medical segment sales grew on a reported and organic basis as a result of new business wins. GAAP profitability metrics improved year-over-year primarily due to higher sales, the completion of spending on integration activities, lower interest expense and a net gain on investments, partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs. GAAP and Non-GAAP profitability metrics reflect solid sales growth across all product lines, partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs. Net cash from operating activities improved year-over-year primarily due to improved operating performance, reduced spend on other operating expenses, and improved use of cash, which enabled $50 million of debt pay down during the quarter, versus $29 million in 2017.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss these results.

Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share consist of GAAP amounts adjusted for the following to the extent occurring during the period: (i) acquisition and integration related charges and expenses, (ii) amortization of intangible assets including inventory step-up amortization, (iii) facility consolidation, optimization, manufacturing transfer and system integration charges, (iv) asset write-down and disposition charges, (v) charges in connection with corporate realignments or a reduction in force, (vi) certain litigation expenses, charges and gains, (vii) unusual or infrequently occurring items, (viii) gain (loss) on cost and equity method investments, (ix) extinguishment of debt charges, (x) the income tax (benefit) related to these adjustments and (xi) certain tax items that are outside the normal provision for the period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are calculated by dividing adjusted net income by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income (loss) plus (i) the same adjustments as listed above except for items (x) and (xi), (ii) GAAP stock-based compensation, interest expense, and depreciation, (iii) GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes and (iv) cash gains received from cost and equity method investments during the period. To calculate organic sales growth rates, we convert current period sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using the previous period’s foreign currency exchange rates and exclude the amount of sales acquired/divested during the period from the current/previous period amounts, respectively. Organic growth rates for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses included in other (income) loss, net. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and organic growth rates provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the statements contained in this press release and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us and our representatives are not statements of historical or current fact.

Net income amounts are computed using a 21% U.S. tax rate (35% U.S. tax rate for 2017 periods), and the statutory tax rates in Mexico, Germany, France, Netherlands, Uruguay, Ireland and Switzerland, as adjusted for the existence of NOLs. Amortization of intangibles and OOE expense have also been adjusted to reflect the estimated impact relating to our disallowed deduction of the GILTI tax, as described in note (i) below. Expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes (i.e. permanent tax differences) are added back at 100%. (b) In 2013, we filed suit against AVX Corporation alleging they were infringing our intellectual property. Given the complexity and significant costs incurred pursuing this litigation, we are excluding these litigation expenses from adjusted amounts. This matter proceeded to trial during 2016 and again in the third quarter of 2017 that resulted in a jury awarding damages in the amount of $37.5 million. In March 2018, the court vacated that damage award and ordered a new trial on damages, which is scheduled for January 2019. To date, no gains have been recognized in connection with this litigation. (c) As a result of the strategic review of our customers, competitors and markets we undertook during the fourth quarter of 2017, we began to take steps to better align our resources in order to invest to grow, protect, preserve and to enhance the profitability of our portfolio of products. This will include focusing our investment in RD&E and manufacturing, improving our business processes and redirecting investments away from projects where the market does not justify the investment. As a result, during 2018 we incurred charges related to this strategy, which primarily consisted of severance and fees for professional services. (d) In 2017, we initiated several initiatives designed to reduce costs, improve operating efficiencies and increase manufacturing capacity to accommodate growth. The plan involves the relocation of certain manufacturing operations and expansion of certain of our facilities. (e) During 2018 and 2017, we incurred costs primarily related to the closure of our Clarence, NY facility and the transfer of our Beaverton, OR portable medical and Plymouth, MN vascular manufacturing operations to Tijuana, Mexico. (f) Reflects acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Lake Region Medical, which occurred in October 2015. (g) Amounts for 2017 primarily include expenses related to our CEO and CFO transitions. (h) Represents debt extinguishment charges in connection with pre-payments made on our Term B Loan Facility which are included in interest expense. (i) Tax adjustments primarily includes the estimated impact relating to our disallowed deduction of the GILTI tax, as mandated by the Tax Reform Act. This disallowed deduction of the GILTI tax (approximately 50% of the total GILTI tax) is due to the Company making use of its U.S. NOLs, and will be eliminated once the Company’s U.S. NOLs are fully utilized, which is expected to be in approximately three to five years. This adjustment makes our Adjusted Diluted EPS more comparable with other global companies that are not subject to this disallowed GILTI tax deduction and more comparable to the Company’s results following the full utilization of its U.S. NOLs. (j) The diluted weighted average shares for adjusted EPS for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 includes 669,000 of potentially dilutive shares not included in the computation of diluted weighted average common shares for GAAP diluted EPS purposes because their effect would have been anti-dilutive in that period.
