    "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on Google's at its annual developers conference (all times local):\n12:05 p.m.\nSome of the features Google is announcing at its annual developers conference won't be coming to Samsung phones.\nGoogle and Samsung have increasingly become competitors as Samsung launches services that duplicate what Google already offers on Android.\nGoogle is making a test version of the upcoming Android P operating system available on some phones, but none are from Samsung, the leading maker of Android phones. Samsung owners will have to wait several months for a later version.\nThe new system promises better battery life and brightness adjustments with the help of artificial intelligence.\nLikewise, Samsung's camera app won't get a built-in Lens feature that lets Google offer information after taking a photo of a building or sign. Samsung has been developing its own, Bixby Vision.\nIt's not immediately known which company made the call to withhold the features announced Tuesday.\n11:45 a.m.\nGoogle is introducing a navigation system feature with its Google Maps app that uses augmented reality to help guide people to their destination.\nWhen Google Maps users pull up directions, they can look through their camera in Maps and get turn-by-turn directions while viewing the actual street. They can also get information about buildings and shops that can be seen through the camera.\nGoogle says the technology is called VPS, or visual positioning system. It was unveiled Tuesday at the company's annual developers conference in Mountain View, California.\n11:25 a.m.\nGoogle outlined its latest improvements to its Android operating system, including more adaptive brightness settings and battery function. Called Android P it's the ninth major version of the Android operating system.\nThe battery will now use machine learning to adapt to how you use apps in order to conserve energy and have what Dave Burke, Android vice president of engineering, calls a more \"consistent\" battery experience.\nIt will also have something called \"adaptive brightness\" that learns how bright a user likes their screen based on manual adjustments, instead of automatically adjusting based on the how bright it is in the environment.\nAnother feature called \"shush\" mode automatically turns on the \"Do Not Disturb\" function if someone turns their phone face down on a table. And \"Wind Down Mode\" will fade the screen to greyscale at a designated bed time to help users disconnect before bed.\nThe features were discussed Tuesday at Google's annual developers conference.\n11:05 a.m.\nGoogle is working on technology it's calling Google Duplex that will use artificial intelligence to call businesses to make appointments and other tedious calls.\nIn two demonstrations, one setting up a hair appointment and another a restaurant reservation, a realistic-sounding automated voice used pauses and \"ums\" and \"mmm-hmms\" to sound more human during interactions with people.\n\"Hi, I'm calling to book hair appointment for a client,\" the AI voice said in the demo and then negotiated a time and date for the appointment.\nAt its annual developers conference Tuesday, Google emphasized the technology is still in development and rolling out as \"an experiment\" in coming weeks.\n\"We really want to work hard to get this right,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n10:30 a.m.\nGoogle is introducing an autocomplete feature in its Gmail email service.\nThe feature called \"smart compose\" uses machine learning to offer suggested ways to finish sentences users start typing.\nFor example, \"I haven't seen you\" might be autocompleted to \"I haven't seen you in a while and I hope you're doing well.\" Users can accept the completion by hitting tab.\nThe \"smart compose\" feature that was introduced Tuesday at Google's annual developers conference should be available to all users this month.\nFor its photos service, Google is starting a new service called \"Suggested Actions.\" If it recognizes a photo of someone who is a Google contact, it can suggested sending it to the person. It can also convert photos to PDFs and automatically add color to black-and-white photos or make part of a color photo black and white. The changes are coming in the next two months.\n9:45 a.m.\nGoogle is showing off what it's like to experiment with artificially intelligent music.\nTwo performers are using synthesizers infused with what the company says is machine learning to warm up the crowd ahead of a keynote by CEO Sundar Pichai at Google's annual developers conference.\nThe music is a mix of electronic dance music and bells. Graphics suggest the sounds are meant to mimic a sitar, guitar, a piano and something called a \"resopad.\"\nOther than starting a wave, the attendees at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, don't seem that into it. Some people are waving when their images appear on giant screens around the stage.\n12:01 a.m.\nGoogle is likely to again put artificial intelligence in the spotlight at its annual developers conference.\nThe company's digital concierge, known only as the Google Assistant, could gain new abilities to handle tasks such as making reservations without human hand-holding.\nGoogle may also unveil updates to its Android mobile operating system, enable better AI-powered suggestions from Google Maps, and push further into augmented reality technology, which overlays a view of the real world with digital images.\nGoogle aims to make its assistant so useful that people can't live without it — or the search results that drive its advertising business. But it's also showcasing how its AI is being used by developers to improve health care, preserve the environment and make new scientific discoveries.",
