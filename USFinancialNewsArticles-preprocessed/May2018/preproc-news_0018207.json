    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Black Stone Minerals, L.P. (NYSE: BSM) (\"Black Stone Minerals,\" \"Black Stone,\" or \"the Partnership\") today announces its financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2018 and recent developments after quarter-end.\nHighlights\nPartnership reports quarterly production of 42.4 Mboe/d, an increase of 11% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Reported oil and gas revenues of $126.2 million and lease bonus and other income of $4.6 million for the quarter. Generated net income of $42.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $95.0 million. Reported distributable cash flow of $83.4 million, resulting in distribution coverage for all units of 1.6x. Acquired $32.2 million in mineral and royalty assets for cash during the quarter, led by a sizeable acquisition in the Midland Basin. After quarter-end, borrowing base increased to $600 million from $550 million.\nManagement Commentary\nThomas L. Carter, Jr., Black Stone Minerals’ President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman, commented, \"Black Stone had a strong quarter to begin 2018. We set new quarterly records for production, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow. Our assets continue to perform well across the board. We had strong production from the Bakken and Permian, and we are seeing a ramp-up in Haynesville completions that should drive continued production growth in the second quarter. The mineral and royalty assets that we acquired from Noble Energy in late 2017 are performing above our expectations. We also continued to bolster our core positions in the Midland Basin and the East Texas Haynesville/Bossier play through targeted acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018. As such, Black Stone is well positioned to deliver on our commitment to increase distributions to common and subordinated unitholders to an annualized rate of $1.35 per unit next quarter.\"\nQuarterly Financial and Operating Results\nProduction\nBlack Stone reported average production of 42.4 MBoe/d (67% mineral and royalty, 69% natural gas) for the first quarter of 2018. This represents an increase of 19% over average production of 35.6 MBoe/d for the corresponding period in 2017 and is 11% higher than average daily production in the fourth quarter of 2017. Production for the period benefited from a particularly strong contribution from the Bakken/Three Forks program, where the Partnership is seeing increased industry activity over the last year.\nRealized Prices, Revenues, and Net Income\nThe Partnership’s average realized price per Boe, excluding the effect of derivative settlements, was $33.10 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This represents a 17% increase from the preceding quarter and is 20% higher than the $27.52 per Boe reported for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nBlack Stone reported oil and gas revenues of $126.2 million (58% oil and condensate) for an increase of 43% from $88.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. This increase in oil and gas revenue was driven by the aforementioned increases in reported production volumes and realized pricing. Oil and gas revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $98.9 million.\nThe Partnership recognized a loss on commodity derivative instruments of $16.3 million in composed of a $4.3 million loss from realized settlements and a $12.0 million unrealized loss due to the change in value of the Partnership’s derivative positions during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, the Partnership reported a gain on commodity derivative instruments of $22.7 million.\nBlack Stone recognized $4.6 million in lease bonus and other income in the majority of which related to the Canyon Lime and other plays in the Mid-Continent. The Partnership reported $13.7 million in lease bonus and other income in the same period in 2017.\nThe Partnership reported net income of $42.0 million, which includes the non-cash derivative loss described above, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $61.6 million in the corresponding period in 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nBlack Stone reported Adjusted EBITDA of $95.0 million for compared to $77.9 million for the corresponding quarter in 2017 and $79.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow for the first quarter of 2018 was $83.4 million, an increase of 22% from the $68.5 million reported in the first quarter of 2017 and a 20% increase from the $69.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. These results for the first quarter of 2018 are both quarterly records for the Partnership as a publicly traded partnership.\nFinancial Position\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Partnership had $6.3 million in cash and $436.0 million outstanding under its credit facility. Subsequent to quarter-end, the borrowing base was increased to $600.0 million as part of a regularly scheduled semi-annual redetermination process. As of May 4, 2018, the Partnership had $394.0 million outstanding under the credit facility and $12.5 million in cash, providing $218.5 million in available liquidity. Black Stone Minerals is in compliance with all financial covenants associated with its credit facility.\nHedge Position\nBlack Stone has commodity derivative contracts in place covering significant portions of its anticipated production for the remainder of 2018 and 2019. For the balance of 2018, approximately 83% of expected oil volumes are hedged at prices averaging $55.24 per barrel and approximately 74% of expected gas volumes are hedged at prices averaging $3.01 per Mcf. For 2019, approximately 48% of anticipated oil volumes are hedged at prices averaging $56.57 per barrel and approximately 39% of expected gas volumes are hedged at an average price of $2.86 per Mcf. More detailed information about the Partnership's existing hedge position can be found in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which is expected to be filed on or around May 8, 2018.\nAcquisitions\nBlack Stone acquired $32.2 million of properties for cash in the first quarter of 2018. Included in that amount was a $22.6 million mineral package in the Midland Basin. Additionally, the Partnership continued to consolidate its acreage position in the Shelby Trough area in East Texas.\nWorking Interest Capital Expenditures\nThe Partnership invested a net total of $28.2 million in working interest capital during inclusive of $18.0 million in reimbursements from farmout partners. The majority of this capital is related to its participation in the completion of wells drilled on its Haynesville/Bossier properties in the Shelby Trough of East Texas prior to the previously announced farmouts with Canaan Resource Partners and Pivotal Petroleum Partners. As a result of those farmouts, the Partnership expects the first quarter of 2018 to be the last quarter of meaningful working interest participation capital expenditures related to the Haynesville/Bossier development.\nThe Partnership expects net working interest capital expenditures to total $32 to $40 million during 2018. Spending related to Black Stone's participation in Haynesville/Bossier development for 2018 is expected to be $20 to $25 million net of farmout reimbursements, the vast majority of which was incurred in the first quarter. Black Stone also intends to invest $12 to $15 million delineating its PepperJack prospect in Hardin and Liberty counties, Texas during 2018. The PepperJack A#1 well, targeting the Lower Wilcox formation in Southeast Texas, was drilled and logged during the first quarter of 2018 at a cost of $6.3 million with encouraging results. The PepperJack B#1 well will be drilled during the second quarter of this year. Black Stone plans to ultimately market the development project to an operator to complete these wells and develop the field. The Partnership expects to receive substantial reimbursement of prior capital expenditures, lease bonus consideration, and a healthy continuous drilling commitment from the operator, while retaining a meaningful royalty interest in the project going forward.\nDistributions\nThe Board of Directors of the general partner (the \"Board\") has approved cash distributions attributable to the first quarter of 2018 of $0.3125 per common unit and $0.20875 per subordinated unit. Distributions will be payable on May 24, 2018 to unitholders of record on May 17, 2018. The quarterly distribution coverage ratio attributable to the first quarter of 2018 was approximately 1.6x for all units (2.5x for common units).\n2018 Outlook\nBlack Stone generally reviews its guidance on a semi-annual basis unless circumstances suggest there has been a material change that warrants updating information for the investment community. The following items have changed since the original budget was announced and should be noted for financial modeling purposes:\nDD&A - Black Stone is reducing its 2018 DD&A per BOE guidance to $7.50 - $8.50 per Boe, down from $8.00 - $9.00 per Boe. The change is primarily a result of higher proved reserves at year-end 2017 compared to what had been assumed for budgeting purposes. Maintenance Capital - On April 27, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a replacement capital expenditure estimate of $11.0 million for the period from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019. The decrease from the prior twelve-month estimate of $13.0 million reflects the decline of working interest as a driver of reserve replacement for the Partnership going forward.\nConference Call\nBlack Stone Minerals will host a conference call and webcast for investors and analysts to discuss its results for the first quarter of 2018 on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. To join the call, participants should dial (877) 447-4732 and use conference code 8485889. A live broadcast of the call will also be available at http://investor.blackstoneminerals.com . A recording of the conference call will be available at that site through June 7, 2018.\nAbout Black Stone Minerals, L.P.\nBlack Stone Minerals is one of the largest owners of oil and natural gas mineral interests in the United States.

As a result, the Partnership is unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on its acreage. Accordingly, no NGL volumes are included in our reported production; however, revenue attributable to NGLs is included in natural gas revenue and the calculation of realized prices for natural gas. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by our management and external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts, and others, to assess the financial performance of our assets and our ability to sustain distributions over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization adjusted for impairment of oil and natural gas properties, accretion of asset retirement obligations, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, and non-cash equity-based compensation. We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA plus or minus amounts for certain non-cash operating activities, estimated replacement capital expenditures, cash interest expense, and distributions to noncontrolling interests and preferred unitholders.\nAdjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States as measures of our financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.\n 2018 2017 (Unaudited) (In thousands) Net income $ 41,957 $ 61,583 Adjustments to reconcile to Adjusted EBITDA: Depreciation, depletion and amortization 28,570 26,379 Interest expense 4,521 3,507 Income tax expense 1,507 — Accretion of asset retirement obligations 269 247 Equity–based compensation 6,226 4,661 Unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments 11,958 (18,447 ) Adjusted EBITDA 95,008 77,930 Adjustments to reconcile to distributable cash flow: Deferred revenue 1,303 (325 ) Cash interest expense (4,316 ) (3,292 ) (Gain) loss on sale of assets, net (2 ) (924 ) Estimated replacement capital expenditures 1 (3,250 ) (3,750 ) Cash paid to noncontrolling interests (52 ) (25 ) Preferred unit distributions (5,275 ) (1,114 ) Distributable cash flow $ 83,416 $ 68,500 1 On August 3, 2016, the Board of Directors of our general partner (the “Board”) approved a replacement capital expenditure estimate of $15.0 million for the period of April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.
