    "text": "How to record the screen on your Mac CNBC will show you how to take a \"screengrab\" or \"screen capture\" on your Mac. We'll also show you how to record a video of the screen on your Mac. 7 Hours Ago | 01:46\nYou might want to capture part of the screen on your Mac -- maybe a menu from a restaurant you want to visit or a part of a website -- to share with someone else. Or, maybe you want to record video of your Mac's screen. Both tasks are really easy, so we'll show you how.\nTo capture a screenshot of the entire display: Tap Shift + Command + 3. Find the picture on your Mac's desktop.\nTo capture just a part of the screen on your Mac: Tap Shift + Command + 4. Find the picture on your Mac's desktop\nTo record a video on your Mac: Open QuickTime Tap \"File\" at the top of the display. Choose \"New Screen recording\" Hit record. You can record the whole screen, or click and drag your mouse cursor to record just a specific part. Todd Haselton Technology Product Editor Playing",
