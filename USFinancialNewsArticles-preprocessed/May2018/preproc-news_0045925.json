Upon closing of the transaction, Hanmi will have approximately $5.7 billion in assets, $4.7 billion in loans and $4.7 billion in deposits. Important strategic benefits of the acquisition to Hanmi include:\nIncreased operational scale and market share in key high-growth Texas markets with appealing demographic profiles; SWNB also brings a complementary branch network located in highly populated Asian-American communities.\nFinancially attractive transaction; Accretive to Hanmi’s 2019 earnings per share.\nExcess liquidity from SWNB (75% loan-to-deposit ratio) will be deployed through Hanmi’s robust loan origination channels.\nAnticipated ease of integration with little to no business disruption to SWNB’s customer base.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, SWNB shareholders will elect to receive 0.1961 shares of HAFC common stock or $5.74 in cash, subject to the overall requirement that 80% of SWNB shares of common stock receive the stock consideration and the remainder receive cash. The aggregate consideration of the transaction is approximately $76.7 million, which is based on HAFC’s closing stock price of $28.65 per share as of May 18, 2018. The transaction is expected to close late in the third quarter of 2018. Hanmi anticipates the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in 2019 and will generate a modest dilution to tangible book value of 1.5% with an earn-back period of approximately three years. The internal rate of return on this transaction will be in excess of 20%.\n“I am pleased to announce the acquisition of Southwestern National Bank and look forward to welcoming their customers and employees to Hanmi,” said C. G. Kum, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hanmi Financial Corporation. “This transaction will bolster our footprint in attractive Texas banking markets and is expected to be accretive to earnings per share in 2019 and beyond. SWNB has a strong portfolio of assets with an excellent credit profile along with an attractive deposit base. In addition, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 75%, SWNB brings over $100 million in excess liquidity that we plan to deploy into new loans as we grow and scale the Hanmi franchise. This transaction is an important milestone for Hanmi and a great opportunity to build on our track record of successful M&A transactions which have enhanced shareholder value.”\nCommenting on the agreement, C.K. Lee, Chairman of the Board of Directors of SWNB Bancorp, Inc., said, “This transaction is extremely positive for current SWNB employees, along with our loyal customers. In addition, it provides a great opportunity for current SWNB shareholders to continue to build on the long-term success we have achieved at SWNB through their ownership of Hanmi common stock.
