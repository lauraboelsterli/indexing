    "text": "LAS VEGAS, May 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire – Medical Cannabis Payment Solutions (OTC:REFG), a Nevada corporation specializing in state-of-the-art financial services structured to serve the medical cannabis and banking industries, today announces it has acquired two marijuana strains, GrapeApe and Birthday Cake, from the strains’ creator. GrapeApe is an indica strain that has tested at approximately 33 percent THC by volume. Birthday Cake, a sativa strain, is approximately 15 percent THC and 15 percent CBD by volume.\nThe company also said it will seek to acquire additional licenses for marijuana cultivation and will work to develop licensing agreements with other state-sanctioned cannabis establishments. The cultivation licenses will be sought via the company’s newly acquired subsidiary, SpeedyGrow.\n“We are very excited about GrapeApe and Birthday Cake,” said Jeremy Roberts, CEO of Medical Cannabis Payment Solutions. “We are strong advocates for state-sanctioned marijuana. We have teamed with excellent partners in SpeedyGrow. This acquisition positions us to have two very highly successful strains to grow, market and license.”\n“This is just the beginning,” David Schenk, president of SpeedyGrow, said. “We are making great progress and expanding our reach into the state-sanctioned marijuana space.”\nThe company also announced that due to its forthcoming Regulation A offering and the company’s announced and future acquisitions, it has passed a resolution to increase the authorized shares from 490 million to 690 million. Those shares include 275 million held by Roberts and 25 million shares held by Sean Hullinger, the company’s general counsel.\nAbout Medical Cannabis Payment Solutions: Our mission is to provide end-to-end management, across multiple management systems, for medicinal marijuana operations.
