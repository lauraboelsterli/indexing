    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Randy Record, chairman of the board of directors of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, issues the following statement regarding the formation of the Delta Conveyance Design and Construction Joint Powers Authority for California WaterFix:\n“With today’s formation of the Delta Conveyance Design and Construction Joint Powers Authority, we are taking another important step forward to build California WaterFix and provide much of our state with the water supply reliability it needs in a climate change world.\n“Using a Design and Construction Authority, Metropolitan and the other public water agencies that are investing in California WaterFix will be able to safely manage, design and construct the project with transparency and accountability, while the state Department of Water Resources maintains a strong and important oversight role. We are confident this partnership is the best structure to manage risk and ensure WaterFix is built on time, on budget and to the highest engineering standards.”\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is a cooperative of 26 cities and water agencies serving nearly 19 million people in six counties. The district imports water from the Colorado River and Northern California to supplement local supplies, and helps its members to develop increased water conservation, recycling, storage and other resource-management programs.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514006445/en/\nMetropolitan Water District of Southern California\nRebecca Kimitch\n(213) 217-6450\n(202) 821-5253, mobile\nor\nBob Muir\n(213) 217-6930\n(213) 324-5213, mobile\nSource: Metropolitan Water District of Southern California",
