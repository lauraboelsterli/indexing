    "text": "Marco Bello | Reuters A woman walks past a mural with the corporate logo of the state oil company PDVSA in Caracas, Venezuela November 3, 2017. A Curacao court has authorized ConocoPhillips to seize about $636 million in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA due to the 2007 nationalization of the U.S. oil major's projects in Venezuela .\nThe legal action was the latest in the Caribbean to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) over the nationalization.\nThe court decision, first reported by Caribbean media outlet Antilliaans Dagblad on Saturday, says Curacao can attach \"oil or oil products on ships and on bank deposits.\"\nConoco and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nReuters reported on Friday that PDVSA was preparing to shut down the 335,000 barrel-per-day Isla refinery it operates in Curacao amid threats by Conoco to seize cargoes sent to resupply\nthe facility.",
