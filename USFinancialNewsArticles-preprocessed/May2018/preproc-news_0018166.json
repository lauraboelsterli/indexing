Blake L. Sartini, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Golden Entertainment, commented, “Our record first quarter results were driven by year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA growth from our Nevada casinos acquired with American Casino and Entertainment in October 2017 as well as Adjusted EBITDA growth at Maryland’s Rocky Gap Casino Resort despite the challenging northeast weather.\n“Throughout the first quarter we made progress against all of our 2018 strategic priorities. We continued the expansion of our Las Vegas branded tavern platform with the opening of two of the six planned new locations for 2018 and both new properties are on track to generate the attractive returns we have experienced from other recent tavern openings. In addition, we completed the renovation of 110 of Rocky Gap’s approximately 200 rooms to build on its success in the upcoming higher demand summer months.\n“We also began work on Phase I of our capital investment plan at the Stratosphere which includes room renovations, refreshing the casino exterior, and adding exciting new venues to attract and engage patrons. By the end of 2018, we expect to have completed the renovation of 317 rooms at the Stratosphere as well as the installation of state-of-the-art exterior digital signage and lighting. Further, we intend to add a unique gastro-brewery to the property that leverages our market-leading tavern experience while featuring Golden Entertainment’s signature branded craft beers. This brewery will be connected to a new sports and race book creating a one-of-a-kind experience for our guests. Our continued investment will establish Stratosphere as a preferred destination for Las Vegas visitors and locals alike, and we remain confident that our renovations will generate an attractive return on capital.\n“We also made progress with our plan to introduce a single loyalty program across all our operations through an agreement with Konami to deploy their casino management system in our acquired properties. This will allow us to leverage our newly-launched logo and branding with a single player card, which we believe will build on the positive cross play opportunities we have seen since completing the American transaction. In addition, having operated our new properties for six months, we have identified additional opportunities to improve margins beyond our initial synergy target.”\nMr. Sartini concluded, “We are excited by the growth opportunities presented to Golden Entertainment as a result of our expanded platform and the value to be created from our capital investments. With a leading and growing presence in Southern Nevada, we are optimistic about our anticipated financial performance as most of our revenue and cash flow is derived from what we believe is the most attractive gaming market in the country. Las Vegas continues to experience robust levels of economic activity, and we are excited about our Company’s prospects to further enhance shareholder value.”\nResults for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s new revenue recognition standard. Certain prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of the standard, with no material impact on operating income, net income or Adjusted EBITDA.\nRevenues for the 2018 first quarter were $214.8 million, compared to $105.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Revenues benefited from continued growth of the Company’s Nevada casinos, including the casinos acquired in the American acquisition in October 2017, as well as our branded taverns in Nevada. Casino revenues in the 2018 first quarter were $130.5 million compared to $24.3 million in the prior-year period, reflecting the contributions from the acquired American properties. Revenues for the casino operations were up 1% year over year in the first quarter when compared to Combined Revenues for the prior-year period including the American properties. Revenues for the distributed gaming operations rose 3.2% over the prior-year period to $84.2 million.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded net income of $3.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the 2018 first quarter was $45.9 million compared to $13.6 million for the prior-year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the contribution from the American casino properties acquired in October 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the casino operations grew 6.1% when compared to Combined Adjusted EBITDA for the prior-year period including the American properties, while Adjusted EBITDA for the distributed gaming operations declined 0.8% for the first quarter. Total Adjusted EBITDA was up 9.2% when compared to Combined Adjusted EBITDA for the prior-year period including the American properties.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $134 million and total outstanding debt of approximately $1 billion. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Company’s $100 million revolving credit facility. Our cash balance includes approximately $25 million raised from our follow on equity offering in January 2018, which we intend to use for potential future strategic opportunities.\nCharles H. Protell, Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “During the first quarter, we generated cash from operations of approximately $25 million after maintenance capital expenditures of $5 million. In addition, we funded approximately $5 million of growth capital initiatives including opening two taverns and renovating 110 rooms at Rocky Gap. We anticipate continuing to fund our remaining 2018 capital expenditures from operating cash flow and expect to end the year with a net leverage ratio (debt less cash to 2018 Adjusted EBITDA) between 4.5x to 4.75x. The Company is actively evaluating additional opportunities to expand our casino and distributed gaming businesses in an accretive manner. We will continue to manage our capital structure to provide the right balance of leverage and liquidity to maintain flexibility to act on opportunities that can create value for shareholders.”\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call today, May 9, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, to discuss the first quarter 2018 results.

Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” “potential,” “seek,” “should,” “think,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions, or they may use future dates. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, without limitation, statements regarding: the benefits of and realization of cost synergies from the American transaction; estimated future financial and operating results and future net leverage ratio; proposed future capital expenditures, investments and property improvements, including the Stratosphere redevelopment plan, and their associated timing, source of funding and cost; and the Company’s plans, strategic priorities, objectives, expectations, intentions, including with respect to its growth prospects and growth opportunities and potential acquisitions. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding the Company’s business, the economy and other future conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and readers are therefore cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: the Company’s ability to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits of the American transaction and its other acquisitions, and integration risks relating to such transactions; changes in national, regional and local economic, political and market conditions; legislative and regulatory matters (including the cost of compliance or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations); increases in gaming taxes and fees in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates; litigation; increased competition; the Company’s ability to renew its distributed gaming contracts; reliance on key personnel (including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Strategy and Financial Officer); the level of the Company’s indebtedness and the Company’s ability to comply with covenants in its debt instruments; terrorist incidents; natural disasters; severe weather conditions; the effects of environmental and structural building conditions; the effects of disruptions to the Company’s information technology and other systems and infrastructure; factors affecting the gaming, entertainment and hospitality industries generally; and other risks and uncertainties discussed in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including the “Risk Factors” sections of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and most recent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. All forward-looking statements in this press release are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, Combined Revenues and Combined Adjusted EBITDA, which measures the Company believes are appropriate to provide meaningful comparison with, and to enhance an overall understanding of, the Company’s past financial performance and prospects for the future. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding specific expenses and gains that the Company believes are not indicative of core operating results. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of operating performance used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance and is widely used in the gaming industry. Other companies in the gaming industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does.\nCombined Revenues and Combined Adjusted EBITDA represent historical revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of American (for periods prior to the American acquisition) and Golden on a combined basis, as if the American acquisition had occurred on the first day of the period presented. Such presentation does not conform to GAAP or the Securities and Exchange Commission rules for pro forma presentations; however, the Company has included these combined results because it believes they provide a meaningful comparison for the periods presented. All combined financial information is unaudited and does not include any pro forma adjustments to reflect the American acquisition and related transactions. The combined financial information has been prepared by the Company’s management for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of what its results of operations, financial condition or other financial information would have been if the American acquisition and related transactions had occurred at the beginning of the period presented. In addition, the combined financial information does not reflect non-recurring charges incurred in connection with the American acquisition, nor any cost savings and synergies expected to result from the American acquisition (and associated costs to achieve such savings or synergies), nor any costs associated with severance, restructuring or integration activities resulting from the American acquisition.\nThe presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) are provided in the financial information tables below. Additionally, a reconciliation of Combined Revenues to revenues is provided in the financial information tables below.\nThe Company defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition expenses, loss on disposal of property and equipment, share-based compensation expenses, preopening expenses, class action litigation expenses, executive severance, gain on change in fair value of derivative, and other gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA for a particular segment or operation is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate overhead, which is not allocated to each segment or operation.\nAbout Golden Entertainment, Inc.\nGolden Entertainment, Inc. owns and operates gaming properties across two divisions – resort casino operations and distributed gaming.
