    "text": "BUFFALO, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Columbus McKinnon Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCO), a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of motion control products, technologies and services for material handling, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2018 fourth quarter and full year, which ended March 31, 2018. Fiscal year 2018 fourth quarter and full year results include the January 31, 2017 acquisition of STAHL CraneSystems (“STAHL”).\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Highlights (compared with prior-year period)\nSales for the quarter grew 16.6% to $214.1 million; organic sales increased 4.2% Achieved record gross margin of 34.8% in the quarter Fiscal year organic sales grew 6.8% with record gross margin of 33.9% Backlog expanded to $177.4 million and was up 16% over backlog at December 31, 2017 Strong cash from operations of $69.7 million in fiscal year Increasing STAHL synergies by $4 million to $15 million Paid down $60.1 million of debt in fiscal 2018, net leverage of 2.6x, ahead of target\n“We believe our strong financial results validate the effectiveness of our strategic plan, Blueprint 2021, to improve the earnings power of the Company as well as the execution driven focus provided by our operating system, E-PAS™ (Earnings Power Acceleration System). We had strong sales for the quarter and the year while achieving record gross margins for both periods,” commented Mark Morelli, President and CEO of Columbus McKinnon.\n“Our focus in fiscal 2019 will be on Phase II of our strategic plan which will simplify the business, improve productivity, ramp our growth engine and further transform our culture. We expect this to translate into expanding operating margins as well as continuing to deliver exceptionally strong cash generation. We have a solid balance sheet and are creating significant financial flexibility for our future growth initiatives.”\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Sales\n($ in millions) Q4 FY 18 Q4 FY 17 Change % Change Net sales $ 214.1 $ 183.7 $ 30.5 16.6 % U.S. sales $ 111.8 $ 104.2 $ 7.6 7.3 % % of total 52 % 57 % Non-U.S. sales $ 102.3 $ 79.5 $ 22.8 28.7 % % of total 48 % 43 % STAHL's January 2018 U.S. and non-U.S. sales were $1.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively. Volume drove growth in the U.S., EMEA region and Canada. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (“FX”) and the one month of STAHL, non-U.S. sales were up 2.0%.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Operating Results\n($ in millions) Q4 FY 18 Q4 FY 17 Change % Change Gross profit $ 74.6 $ 50.3 $ 24.3 48.2% Gross margin 34.8 % 27.4 % 740 bps Income (loss) from operations $ 16.3 $ (3.2 ) $ 19.5 NM Operating margin 7.6 % (1.7 )% 930 bps Net income (loss) $ 8.5 $ (4.7 ) $ 13.2 NM Diluted EPS $ 0.36 $ (0.22 ) $ 0.58 NM Adjusted EBITDA* $ 29.9 $ 24.4 $ 5.5 22.4% Adjusted EBITDA margin 13.9 % 13.3 % 60 bps *A non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization. Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income.\nAdjusted gross profit was $74.0 million, or 34.6% of sales. Adjustments included removing the $0.6 million benefit associated with insurance settlements. For more information on changes in gross profit, please see the attached tables.\nAdjusted income from operations was $20.6 million, which was up $3.7 million from the prior year. Adjustments include $3.9 million in STAHL integration costs, $0.4 million in legal costs related to litigation against previous insurance carriers, and debt repricing fees of $0.6 million, partially offset by cash received from a partial insurance settlement of $0.6 million. Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of GAAP income from operations to adjusted income from operations.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter and full year were 23.5% and 55.6%, respectively.\nNet income for the fourth quarter and full year were $8.5 million and $22.1 million, respectively. On an adjusted basis, net income for the fourth quarter and full year were $12.0 million and $46.8 million, which excludes STAHL integration costs, costs for a legal action against prior product liability insurance carriers, debt repricing fees, Magnetek litigation, and an insurance settlement received and includes a normalized tax rate. Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of GAAP net income and earnings per share to adjusted net income and earnings per share.\nGenerating Cash and Reducing Debt\nCash generated from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $18.4 million. Working capital as a percentage of sales was down to 17.9% compared with 18.6% as of March 31, 2017. Capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 were $14.5 million. Please see the attached additional data table for further details.\nTotal debt was $363.3 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $421.3 million at March 31, 2017. Net debt to net total capitalization at March 31, 2018 was 42.4%, compared with 50.2% at March 31, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2019 Outlook\nBacklog grew 16% to $177.4 million as of March 31, 2018 compared with $152.3 million at December 31, 2017 and was up 15% over backlog of $154.5 million at the end of fiscal 2017. Given the level of backlog and current market conditions, the Company expects revenue to grow 7% to 9% including the benefit of FX in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Research, selling and general and administrative (RSG&A) expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in the first quarter, excluding integration and realignment costs, with an additional $2 million in annualized RSG&A savings to be realized in the remainder of the year. U.S. GAAP pension accounting changes effective in fiscal 2019 will result in approximately $2 million of annual pension income being reported in other income and expense which will negatively impact income from operations on a comparative basis.\nMr. Morelli concluded, “The strong results for fiscal 2018 represent our team’s capability and the relevance of our Blueprint 2021 strategy. We executed well as our performance culture is taking hold. Our global leadership team and associates are pulling together to achieve our goals and I thank them for their efforts. As we further advance Phase II of our strategy supported by markets favorable for growth, I expect that we will build on our positive momentum. With the strength that we see in our markets, we anticipate solid performance in fiscal 2019 and earnings expansion that outpaces organic revenue growth.”\nTeleconference/webcast\nColumbus McKinnon will host a conference call and live webcast today at 10:00 AM Eastern Time, at which management will review the Company’s financial results and strategy.

Adjusted net income and diluted EPS are defined as net income and diluted EPS as reported, adjusted for certain items and to apply a normalized tax rate. Adjusted net income and diluted EPS are not measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, commonly known as GAAP and may not be comparable to the measures as used by other companies. Nevertheless, Columbus McKinnon believes that providing non-GAAP information, such as adjusted net income and diluted EPS, is important for investors and other readers of the Company’s financial statements and assists in understanding the comparison of the current quarter’s and current year's net income and diluted EPS to the historical periods' net income and diluted EPS, as well as facilitates a more meaningful comparison of the Company’s net income and diluted EPS to that of other companies.\nCOLUMBUS McKINNON CORPORATION\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\n($ in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nYear Ended March 31,\n2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ 8,466 $ (4,738 ) $ 22,065 $ 8,984 Add back (deduct): Income tax expense (benefit) 2,598 (3,688 ) 27,620 4,043 Interest and debt expense 4,661 3,568 19,733 10,966 Cost of debt refinancing — 1,303 — 1,303 Investment income 4 (96 ) (157 ) (462 ) Foreign currency exchange loss 834 342 1,539 1,232 Other (income) expense, net (239 ) 145 (701 ) (93 ) Depreciation and amortization expense 9,263 7,467 36,136 25,162 Acquisition deal, integration, and severance costs 3,917 5,675 8,763 8,815 Insurance recovery legal costs 356 1,359 2,948 1,359 Debt repricing fees 619 — 619 — Magnetek litigation — — 400 — Insurance settlement (621 ) — (2,362 ) — Acquisition inventory step-up expense — 8,852 — 8,852 CEO retirement pay and search costs — 3,085 — 3,085 Impairment of intangible asset — 1,125 — 1,125 Canadian pension lump sum settlements — — — 247 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA $ 29,858 $ 24,399 $ 116,603 $ 74,618\nSales $ 214,140 $ 183,688 $ 839,419 $ 637,123 Adjusted EBITDA margin 13.9 % 13.3 % 13.9 % 11.7 % Adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization.
