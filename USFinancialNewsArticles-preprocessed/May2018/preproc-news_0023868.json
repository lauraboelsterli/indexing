REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\nKirby joined the group in 2016 from British high-speed rail project HS2 to take up a newly created post and was tasked with a “group-wide transformation agenda”.\n“As we update our organization and move to more empowered business units with a much leaner center, it has become clear that we no longer need the Group Chief Operating Officer role for which Simon Kirby was recruited in autumn 2016”, Chief Executive Warren East said in the memo.\nEast has been trying to reshape Rolls during his three years in charge after declines in some of its older aero-engine programs and plunging demand for oil equipment.\n“I want to thank Simon for his huge contribution to reducing central costs as part of the transformation program, despite in doing so, working himself out of his own role”, East said.
