    "text": "Nameth Will Lead Efforts to Improve Access to Branded Pharmaceuticals and Enhance the Pharmacy Experience for All Blink Members\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Blink Health , the technology company solving America’s prescription drug price crisis, today announced that Michael Nameth, a healthcare industry leader with experience across managed care, pharmacy benefit management and specialty pharmaceuticals, has joined Blink Health as Executive Vice President, Cloud and Specialty Pharmacy. In this role, Nameth will lead the company’s efforts to ensure that all patients receive access to the lowest prices possible across branded, specialty and generic medications and to remove the complexity many patients experience when trying to fill their prescriptions.\nMost recently, Nameth was CEO of Aureus Health Services, a national specialty pharmacy that provides services to help patients and providers access pharmaceutical therapies. Previously, Nameth served as EVP of Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy, and prior to Walgreens, Nameth served as President of Wellpoint’s pharmacy benefit manager, NextRx, which was acquired by Express Scripts in 2009. Michael also co-founded the National Association of Specialty Pharmacy, where he continues to serve as a director.\n“Michael’s expertise across all aspects of pharmacy will be invaluable in our efforts to help patients access all therapies their providers prescribe for their health needs,” said Geoffrey Chaiken, co-founder and CEO, Blink Health. “His background makes him the ideal person to build our cloud pharmacy service that will give people more control over their prescriptions and ensure that everyone, regardless of insurance status, gets the lowest prices on their medications.”\n“For millions of people, branded and specialty medications play an important role in combating disease and improving lives, but they are often too expensive or difficult for patients to access,” said Nameth. “Blink Health’s combination of technology and pharmacy expertise uniquely positions the company to address the high cost prescription drug crisis, and I’m thrilled to join a team that is solving this problem.”\nMichael’s appointment at the company comes on the heels of the addition of former Express Scripts executive Susan Lang as Chief Strategy Officer. The company has also recently implemented prescription access programs with Lilly and Roche.\nAbout Blink Health\nBlink Health makes prescriptions affordable for everyone with the guaranteed lowest prices on nearly all generic medications commonly prescribed. As the first e-commerce service of its kind, Blink Health negotiates directly with prescription medication suppliers on behalf of all Americans and uses technology to bypass powerful intermediaries. Patients simply purchase their medications through Blink’s website or app and pick up their prescriptions at a local pharmacy.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180524005231/en/\nFor Blink Health\nBrooke Matthews\nBlinkHealthPR@BrewPR.com\nSource: Blink Health",
