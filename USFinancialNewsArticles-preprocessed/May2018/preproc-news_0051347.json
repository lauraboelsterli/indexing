    "text": "Iranian officers break up over response to U.S. calls for Iranian officers break up over response to U.S. calls for Fatma Schwarz | May 23, 2018 |\nANKARA (Reuters) – For all of Iran’s fierce verbal response to contemporary U.S. threats of more durable sanctions, some senior officers in Tehran imagine the door to diplomacy ought to keep open.

REUTERS/Morteza Nikoubazl/File Photo\nOn Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo introduced an inventory of sweeping calls for for Iran, together with abandoning nuclear enrichment, its ballistic missile program and its function in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, or face “the strongest sanctions in history”.\nFour senior Iranian officers contacted by Reuters interpreted Pompeo’s remarks as a “bargaining strategy”, just like Washington’s method to North Korea.\nLast 12 months U.S. officers have been urgent for more durable sanctions in opposition to Pyongyang and despatched an plane service to the area in a present of power earlier than relations eased to a degree the place President Donald Trump might maintain talks with North Korean chief Kim Jong Un.\n“America does not want to get involved in another war in the region. Iran also cannot afford more economic hardship … always there is a way to reach a compromise,” stated one of many Iranian officers, who was concerned in Iran’s nuclear talks with main powers for 2 years.\n“The era of military confrontations is over,” the official stated. Like others giving their views on relations with the United States, the official requested to not be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\nHowever, it will likely be troublesome for Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to again any diplomatic answer, as a result of doing so might undermine his credibility amongst his hardline energy base, who reject any detente with the West.\n“They (Americans) are lying. Even if Iran accepts all these demands, they will continue to demand more. Their aim is changing Iran’s regime,” stated one official who’s near Khamenei’s camp.\n“Americans can never be trusted. We don’t give a damn to their threats and sanctions,” he stated, echoing Khamenei’s public statements.\nPompeo’s speech didn’t explicitly name for a change in management in Iran, however he urged the Iranian folks to reject their clerical rulers. “CUP OF POISON”\nEarlier this month the United States withdrew from a 2015 multinational deal which restricted Iran’s nuclear program in return for lifting sanctions that had crippled the economic system.\nTehran says its proper to nuclear capabilities and its defensive missile program are non-negotiable.\nBut with Iran’s economic system so fragile, weakened by many years of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement, Khamenei might but take into account diplomacy over confrontation with the United States.\nSome insiders stated that, although troublesome, he might drink “the cup of poison,” as his predecessor Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini described it when he reluctantly agreed to a U.N.-mediated truce that ended the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq struggle.\n“For most Iranians, the economy is the main issue, not what Iran does in the region or the country’s nuclear program,” stated a senior Western diplomat in Tehran.\n“That is why Iranian leaders will show some flexibility despite the harsh rhetoric.” gtag('config', 'UA-114047264-2'); FILE PHOTO: A girl carries an image of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei at an occasion marking Resistance and Liberation Day within the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, May 25, 2017. REUTERS/Hassan Abdallah/File Photo TROUBLE AT HOME\nIt was Iran’s weak economic system that compelled Khamenei to present tentative backing for the 2015 nuclear settlement with main powers. The deal, engineered by pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, ended the nation’s financial and political isolation.\nThe institution’s core help comes from lower-income Iranians, who joined anti-government protests in January. The unrest was a reminder to authorities that they have been weak to fashionable anger fueled by financial hardship.\n“If they fail to manage the economy, then the regime will not be able to resist the pressure. It does not mean it will fall apart, but the economy could reach its worst ever breaking point,” stated Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born skilled on Iran on the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel.\nEuropean events to the nuclear deal try to rescue it after Washington’s exit by maintaining Iranian oil commerce and funding flowing. But they concede it will likely be troublesome.\nA 3rd Iranian official stated he anticipated that the United States would ultimately have to just accept some degree of Iranian uranium enrichment exercise and ballistic missile work, as a result of “these are Iran’s red lines”.\nIn his speech, Pompeo tried to quash discuss of struggle by saying Washington would carry punishing sanctions it’s now transferring to impose, restore diplomatic and industrial ties and permit Iran to have entry to superior know-how if Washington noticed tangible shifts in Iran’s insurance policies. “DECLARATION OF WAR”\nSeveral Iranian officers informed Reuters that the hardline elite, together with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), seen Pompeo’s calls for as a “declaration of war” in opposition to Iran.\nAnalysts stated the danger of a broader battle couldn’t be dominated out, regardless of operating counter to Trump’s personal acknowledged want to disentangle the United States from a technology of pricey conflicts within the Middle East.\n“If Americans push Iran to the corner … then Iran will have no other option but to react harshly,” stated Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leylaz. “This is what hawks want.”\nWhile Tehran has stated it will reply to any army aggression by concentrating on U.S. pursuits within the area and Israel, some consultants stated the nation would battle to defend itself in opposition to a direct, multi-fronted assault.\n“Iran has done well in proxy wars, but they cannot confront Israel or the U.S. in a direct war,” stated the Western diplomat. “They don’t have modern weapons.”\nShi’ite Muslim Iran backs President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil struggle, Shi’ite militias in Iraq, Houthi rebels in Yemen’s battle and Lebanon’s Hezbollah motion.\nWashington’s regional allies, Sunni Gulf Arab states and Israel — staunch foes of Tehran — have all praised the United States’ toughening stance on Iran.\nGRAPHIC: Iran’s nuclear program: tmsnrt.rs/2rvkaq6 Writing by Parisa Hafezi, Editing by Samia Nakhoul and Mike Collett-White ",
