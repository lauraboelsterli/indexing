Ben-Ari will oversee all product strategy, development, and expansion with a focus on driving enhanced revenue opportunities. He will join Top Hat’s executive team and report directly to CEO and co-founder Mike Silagadze.\n“In addition to bringing an abundance of startup and academic research experience to Top Hat, Eran has an impressive track record of driving product innovation and advancement,” said Silagadze. “With him at the helm of Top Hat’s product management and engineering, I’m confident we’ll fast track our ability to build on the exponential growth we’ve experienced while continuing to look for new ways to better serve our customers.”\nBen-Ari, a specialist in product strategy and growth within the startup environment, joins Top Hat from Kik Interactive, where he led a cross-functional team of more than 50 professionals. As the Chief Product Officer, Ben-Ari was instrumental in the launch of Kik’s decentralized ecosystem of digital services and the initial coin offering (ICO) of its own Kin cryptocurrency, which raised more than $100 million. Prior to that, Ben-Ari was the Vice President of Product at Rounds Entertainment, where he oversaw product, project management, quality assurance, creative, and user design to accelerate growth and improve product quality, before the company was acquired by Kik Interactive. Previously, he was the Vice President of Growth at Hola, where he led a cross-functional team of product, marketing, design, and front-end engineers, doubled the company’s monthly active users organically, and grew the number of downloads to 51 million from 24 million in 12 months without any paid acquisition.\n“Prior to joining the world of technology, I taught at a university and experienced firsthand the challenges of engaging students and providing them with superior learning experiences,” said Ben-Ari. “With its strong product portfolio, world-class investors, and strong executive team, Top Hat is uniquely positioned to help solve those challenges. And I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to be a part of that.”\nAbout Top Hat\nTop Hat’s interactive, cloud-based teaching platform enables professors to engage students inside and outside the classroom with compelling content, tools and activities.
