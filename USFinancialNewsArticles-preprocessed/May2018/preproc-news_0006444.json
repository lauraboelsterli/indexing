    "text": "AUDUBON, Pa., Globus Medical, Inc. (NYSE:GMED), a leading musculoskeletal solutions company, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nWorldwide sales were $174.4 million, an increase of 11.9% as reported, or 10.8% in constant currency First quarter net income was $39.5 million, or 22.7% of sales Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.39 Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.41 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was 35.4% of sales\n“We had a strong first quarter with worldwide sales up 11.9% over the first quarter of 2017 at $174 million,\" said CEO Dave Demski. \"We also realized $0.41 in non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first quarter, an increase of 31%. We had $12.8 million in revenue from Emerging Technologies, primarily due to robust demand for our ExcelsiusGPS ® robotics and navigation system. On a day-adjusted basis, our U.S. Spine business grew at 4.0% over last year.”\n“We are pleased with our first quarter performance - not only the continued excitement among surgeons and hospitals about ExcelsiusGPS ® , but also the above market growth we achieved in the U.S. with our core spine business and the solid operational improvements we saw in several important International markets. I’m very proud of our team’s ability to capitalize on our growth opportunities while maintaining fiscal discipline, as our bottom line grew as fast as our top line, even though we continue to invest heavily in Imaging, Navigation and Robotics as well as Trauma.\"\nFirst quarter sales in the U.S. increased by 12.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017. International sales increased by 10.1% over the first quarter of 2017 on an as-reported basis and 3.5% on a constant currency basis.\nFirst quarter GAAP net income was $39.5 million, an increase of 37.7% over the same period last year. Diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.39, as compared to $0.30 for the first quarter 2017. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.41, compared to $0.32 in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe company generated net cash provided by operating activities of $52.3 million and non-GAAP free cash flow of $39.9 million in the first quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $473.6 million. The company remains debt free.\n2018 Annual Guidance\nThe company increased guidance for full year 2018 sales to $695 million from $690 million and non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share to $1.52 from $1.50.\nConference Call Information\nGlobus Medical will hold a teleconference to discuss its 2018 first quarter results with the investment community at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today.

Additional information can be accessed at www.globusmedical.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. For example, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which represents net income before interest income, net and other non-operating expenses, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, provisions for litigation, technology in-licensing fee, and acquisition related costs, is useful as an additional measure of operating performance, and particularly as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period, as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance, and it removes the effect of our capital structure, asset base, income taxes and interest income and expense. Our management also uses non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Provision for litigation represents costs incurred for litigation settlements or unfavorable verdicts when the loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, or in the case of a favorable settlement, when income is realized. Acquisition related costs/licensing represents the change in fair value of business acquisition related contingent consideration; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses including but not limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations, severance, and information system conversion; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees, legal fees, and other acquisition related professional fees, as well as one time licensing fees.\nIn addition, for the period ended March 31, 2018 and for other comparative periods, we are presenting non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which represents net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the provision for litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, prior period adjustment and the tax effects of such adjustments. Prior period adjustments represent the cumulative impact of prior year adjustments related to depreciation, scrap and provision for excess and obsolete inventory, none of which were individually material to the related year's financial position or results of operations. We believe these non-GAAP measures are also useful indicators of our operating performance, and particularly as additional measures of comparative operating performance from period to period as they remove the effects of litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, prior period adjustments and the tax effects of such adjustments, which we believe are not reflective of underlying business trends. Additionally, for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and for other comparative periods, we also define the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow as the net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for the impact of restricted cash, less the cash impact of purchases of property and equipment. We believe that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating our overall financial performance for comparative periods as it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations and fund acquisitions. Furthermore, the non-GAAP measure of constant currency sales growth is calculated by translating current year sales at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior year period. We believe constant currency sales growth provides insight to the comparative increase or decrease in period sales, in dollar and percentage terms, excluding the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and constant currency sales growth are not calculated in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures do not include certain expenses that may be necessary to evaluate our liquidity or operating results. Our definitions of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and constant currency sales growth may differ from that of other companies and therefore may not be comparable. Additionally, we have recast prior periods for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nSafe Harbor Statements\nAll statements included in this press release other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and may be identified by their use of words such as “believe,” “may,” “might,” “could,” “will,” “aim,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “plan” and other similar terms.
