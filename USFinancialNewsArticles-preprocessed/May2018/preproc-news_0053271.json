As at March 31, 2018, the carrying value of these companies, which are regarded as associates of the Group, amounted to $0.2 million (RMB1.3 million) in aggregate.

Dragon Silver is mainly engaged in trading, production, processing and investment in precious metals and non-ferrous metals and related products.\nIn April 2018, the Group invested a total of RMB10 million (equivalent to approximately $1.5 million), through its China indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, in an agriculture project for development, planting and sales of primary agricultural products and plants cultivation in Hami City, Xinjiang, China. The project would occupy an area of about 250 mu (equivalent to about 166,000 sq. meters) to plant Hami red dates or any cash crops.

Debentures are held to receive coupon interest payments as well as to realize potential gains.
