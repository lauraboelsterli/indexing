(NASDAQ: DXPE) today announced financial results for the first quarter The following are results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the back of this press release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 financial highlights:\nSales increased 19.9 percent to $285.9 million, compared to $238.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, and 7.6 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.24 based upon 18.7 million diluted shares, compared to $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2017, based on 18.2 million diluted shares Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the first quarter was $17.9 million compared to $15.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 15.5 percent. EBITDA as a percentage of sales was 6.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, comparing the first quarter of 2018 versus 2017.\nDavid R. Little, Chairman and CEO, remarked, “During the first quarter of 2018 we experienced broad-based demand improvement across our key end markets and regions. DXP’s first quarter 2018 sales were $285.9 million, or a 19.9 percent increase over the first quarter of 2017. DXP’s positive results demonstrate how we have strengthened our business organically and through acquisitions. Organic sales increased 15.4 percent and acquisitions added $10.6 million in sales. EBITDA grew 15.5 percent. During the first quarter, sales were $175.4 million for Service Centers, $67.6 million for Innovative Pumping Solutions and $42.9 million for Supply Chain Services. Business segment operating income increased 25.6 percent year-over-year and increased 9.6 percent sequentially. Total DXP operating profit and EPS both grew on a double-digit percentage basis versus the prior year, reflecting the positive pull through and operating leverage we expect to continue. Our customers and suppliers look to DXP to provide a broad portfolio of products, value-added services and leading supply chain solutions. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress DXP is making. I am confident in our team’s ability to be customer driven experts in MROP solutions and deliver value to our customer operations and supply chains in 2018 and beyond.”\nKent Yee, CFO, added, “Our first quarter sequential and year-over-year financial results were great to see. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential sales increases. We announced the acquisition of Application Specialties, Inc., a leading provider of high tolerance and standard cutting tools, abrasives, coolants and machine shop supplies. We closed the ASI acquisition on January 1 st and are excited to welcome the ASI team to DXP. Total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2018 was $251.3 million. DXP’s secured leverage ratio or net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.4:1.0. We look forward to the momentum continuing and a positive fiscal year 2018.”\nWe will host a conference call regarding 2018 first quarter results on the Company’s website ( www.dxpe.com ) Tuesday, May 8, 2017 at 4 pm CST. Web participants are encouraged to go to the Company’s website at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the call to register, download and install any necessary audio software. The online archived replay will be available immediately after the conference call at www.dxpe.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nDXP supplements reporting of net income with non-GAAP measurements, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. This supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the unaudited GAAP measurements. Additional information regarding EBITDA and free cash flow referred to in this press release are included below under \"--Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information.\"\nThe Company believes EBITDA provides additional information about: (i) operating performance, because it assists in comparing the operating performance of the business, as it removes the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense as well as items not directly resulting from core operations such as interest expense and income taxes and (ii) the performance and the effectiveness of operational strategies. Additionally, EBITDA performance is a component of a measure of the Company’s financial covenants under its credit facility. Furthermore, some investors use EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. Management believes that some investors’ understanding of performance is enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable basis for comparing ongoing results of operations. By providing this non-GAAP financial measure, together with a reconciliation from net income, the Company believes it is enhancing investors’ understanding of the business and results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well the Company is executing strategic initiatives.\nAbout DXP Enterprises, Inc.\nDXP Enterprises, Inc. is a leading products and service distributor that adds value and total cost savings solutions to industrial customers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Dubai.
