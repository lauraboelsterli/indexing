    "text": "HOUSTON, May 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Contango Oil & Gas Company (NYSE American:MCF) (“Contango” or the “Company”) announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an operational update.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nSale of non-core Eagle Ford Shale assets for $21 million Production of 4.5 Bcfe for the quarter, or 50.0 Mmcfed Net income of $0.9 million for the quarter Adjusted EBITDAX, on a recurring basis, of $8.3 million for the quarter Commenced production from two more Pecos County wells in the Southern Delaware Basin, and a third well in April\nSummary First Quarter Financial Results\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.9 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, consistent with last year’s net income of $0.9 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share. Current year net income was positively impacted by a gain from the sale of our Eagle Ford Shale assets in Karnes County, Texas. Other positive items contributing to current year net income include higher revenues from higher oil and liquids prices, a higher percentage of production from oil and liquids, and lower depreciation, depletion, and amortization (“DD&A”) expense, partially offset by higher impairment expenses, a lower gain attributable to our investment in Exaro Energy III LLC (“Exaro”), and a loss on the mark-to-market value of our outstanding derivatives. Average weighted shares outstanding were approximately 24.8 million and 24.6 million for the current and prior year quarters, respectively.\nThe Company reported Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined below and on a recurring basis, of approximately $8.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $7.2 million for the same period last year, an increase attributable to higher revenues. Cash flow for the current quarter was $6.9 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.26 per share for the prior year quarter.\nRevenues for the current quarter were approximately $20.4 million compared to $19.4 million for the 2017 quarter. Despite lower production during the current quarter, the increase in crude oil and natural gas liquids prices was responsible for the increase in revenues. Revenues from the sale of crude oil and natural gas liquids increased to $11.8 million for the current quarter, compared to $8.3 million for the prior year quarter due to the increase in that production resulting from our Southern Delaware drilling program.\nProduction for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately 4.5 Bcfe, or 50.0 Mmcfe per day, within our previously provided guidance, compared to 57.6 Mmcfe per day for the first quarter of 2017. This expected year over year decline in equivalent production volumes is mitigated in part by the fact that the percentage of production from higher-value oil and natural gas liquids increased from 28% to 35%. As the year progresses, that percentage should continue to increase due to our oil-weighted drilling program. Crude oil and natural gas liquids production during the first quarter of 2018 was approximately 3,000 barrels per day, compared to approximately 2,700 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2017. Our production guidance for the second quarter of 2018 is expected to be between 41–46 Mmcfed, due to shutting in our offshore production for approximately two weeks for scheduled maintenance to install compression, normal production declines and the sale of our Eagle Ford Shale producing properties in Karnes County, Texas, partially offset by added production from our Southern Delaware Basin drilling activity, as we strive to continue to increase the percentage of production attributable to higher-value oil and natural gas liquids.\nThe weighted average equivalent sales price during the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $4.53 per Mcfe, compared to $3.75 per Mcfe for the same period last year, as we experienced increases of 29% and 12% in crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, respectively, compared to the prior year quarter, and due to the increase in the higher percentage of oil and liquids in the production mix.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were approximately $6.9 million, or $1.54 per Mcfe and within our previously provided guidance, compared to $6.8 million, or $1.32 per Mcfe, for the same period last year. Included in operating expenses are direct lease operating expenses, transportation and processing costs, workover expenses and production and ad valorem taxes. Operating expenses exclusive of production and ad valorem taxes were approximately $6.1 million, or $1.37 per Mcfe, for the current quarter compared to approximately $6.2 million, or $1.19 per Mcfe, for the prior year quarter. Our guidance for operating expenses for the second quarter of 2018, exclusive of production and ad valorem taxes, is between $5.9 to $6.4 million, which is consistent with the current quarter.\nDD&A expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $10.5 million, or $2.33 per Mcfe, compared to $11.8 million, or $2.27 per Mcfe, for the prior year quarter, a decrease primarily attributable to lower production during the quarter.\nImpairment and abandonment expense of oil and gas properties was $3.3 million for the current quarter. Included in this amount is $2.3 million related to the impairment of our Vermilion 170 offshore asset and $0.8 million related to expiring leases of unproved properties.\nTotal G&A expenses, inclusive of stock compensation expense, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $6.7 million, compared to $6.6 million, for the prior year quarter. Cash G&A expenses, i.e. G&A exclusive of stock compensation expense, were $5.3 million, or $1.18 per Mcfe, and $5.1 million, or $0.99 per Mcfe, respectively, for the two quarterly periods. For the second quarter of 2018, we have provided guidance of $4.9 million to $5.4 million for cash general and administrative expenses.\nGain from affiliates (i.e. Exaro Energy III) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $0.7 million, compared to a gain of $1.8 million for the same period last year.\nGain from sale of assets for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $9.4 million, which related to the sale of our operated Eagle Ford Shale assets located in Karnes County, Texas for a cash purchase price of $21 million.\n2018 Capital Program\nCapital costs incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were approximately $19.5 million, including $17.4 million for the drilling and completion of wells in the Southern Delaware Basin in Pecos County, Texas and $1.7 million in leasehold acquisition and other costs. Our capital expenditure budget for 2018 was originally forecasted to be approximately $54 million, including $52 million in the Southern Delaware Basin. As of March 31, 2018, our capital expenditure forecast for 2018 was approximately $57 million, including $52 million to drill and/or complete eight to nine wells, in our Southern Delaware Basin position.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $78.7 million of debt outstanding under our credit facility.\nDrilling Activity Update\nOur recent Southern Delaware Basin activity consists of the following:\nRiver Rattler #1H\nAs previously reported, the River Rattler #1H (44% WI, 33% NRI), our first Wolfcamp B test, was spud in December 2017. Production began in March 2018 at an initial 24-hour max IP rate of 1,416 Boed (74% oil) and an initial 30-day rate of 1,225 Boed (74% oil), making it our best well to date from an IP perspective. We continue to identify cost efficiencies in our drilling efforts, as evidenced by the fact that the Ragin Bull #3H, which immediately preceded this well, and River Rattler #1H have taken only 27 days from spud to TMD.\nRagin Bull #2H\nThe Ragin Bull #2H (49% WI, 37% NRI), our second Wolfcamp B test, was spud in January 2018. Production began in April 2018 at an initial 24-hour max IP rate of 805 Boed (68% oil). This well represents our fastest spud to total depth so far at 26.5 days.\nSidewinder #1H / Gunner #3H\nThe Sidewinder #1H (49% WI, 37% NRI), the first of two wells to be drilled from a common pad, was spud in March 2018. The Sidewinder was drilled into the Wolfcamp A horizon just south of the Rude Ram #1H Wolfcamp A completion, which has produced 155 MBoe in nine months. The Gunner #3H well (47% WI, 35% NRI) was spud in April 2018 and was drilled to a total measured depth of 20,167 feet, including a 10,067 foot lateral. This well will be a Wolfcamp B test in the same unit as the Gunner #2H Wolfcamp A completion, which so far is our best producing well to date having produced approximately 130 MBoe in six months. Both wells from this pad are expected to begin completion operations via a zipper frac strategy in June 2018.\nFor the remainder of the year, our capital expenditure budget calls for us to drill five to six more wells, with the next one being the Fighting Ace #2H. This well will target the Wolfcamp B formation and is expected to be spud in May 2018.\nManagement Commentary\nAllan D. Keel, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are excited about the recent results from our Southern Delaware Basin program, including the performance from our first two Wolfcamp B wells. We now have eight wells on production, with two more to come on in early July from the Sidewinder/Gunner pad we are currently drilling, one well in the Wolfcamp A and one in the Wolfcamp B. We were also pleased to be able to monetize our Karnes County position during the quarter for a value reflective of the downspacing potential in that position.\"\nSelected Financial and Operating Data\nThe following table reflects certain comparative financial and operating data for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Offshore Volumes Sold: Oil and condensate (Mbbls) 19 22 -14% Natural gas (Mmcf) 2,296 3,008 -24% Natural gas liquids (Mbbls) 78 84 -7% Natural gas equivalents (Mmcfe) 2,877 3,646 -21% Onshore Volumes Sold: Oil and condensate (Mbbls) 121 92 32% Natural gas (Mmcf) 617 720 -14% Natural gas liquids (Mbbls) 47 44 7% Natural gas equivalents (Mmcfe) 1,627 1,534 6% Total Volumes Sold: Oil and condensate (Mbbls) 140 114 23% Natural gas (Mmcf) 2,913 3,728 -22% Natural gas liquids (Mbbls) 125 128 -2% Natural gas equivalents (Mmcfe) 4,504 5,180 -13% Daily Sales Volumes: Oil and condensate (Mbbls) 1.6 1.3 23% Natural gas (Mmcf) 32.4 41.4 -22% Natural gas liquids (Mbbls) 1.4 1.4 -2% Natural gas equivalents (Mmcfe) 50.0 57.6 -13% Average sales prices: Oil and condensate (per Bbl) $ 62.76 $ 48.71 29% Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 2.96 $ 2.99 -1% Natural gas liquids (per Bbl) $ 23.97 $ 21.36 12% Total (per Mcfe) $ 4.53 $ 3.75 21%\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Offshore Selected Costs ($ per Mcfe) Lease operating expenses (1) $ 0.82 $ 0.93 -12% Production and ad valorem taxes $ 0.07 $ 0.13 -46% Onshore Selected Costs ($ per Mcfe) Lease operating expenses (1) $ 2.33 $ 1.81 29% Production and ad valorem taxes $ 0.36 $ 0.13 177% Average Selected Costs ($ per Mcfe) Lease operating expenses (1) $ 1.37 $ 1.19 15% Production and ad valorem taxes $ 0.17 $ 0.13 31% General and administrative expense (cash) $ 1.18 $ 0.99 19% Interest expense $ 0.31 $ 0.15 107% Adjusted EBITDAX (2) (thousands) $ 8,344 $ 7,154 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding (thousands) Basic 24,793 24,607 Diluted 24,841 24,641",
