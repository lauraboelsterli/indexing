Human Rights Council will hold a special session on Friday to debate the deteriorating human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the U.N. said on Tuesday.\n“The special session is being convened per an official request submitted this evening by Palestine and the United Arab Emirates, on behalf of the Arab Group of States, which has been supported by 26 States thus far,” the U.N. human rights office said in an emailed statement.\nThe special session is the first since the Council considered the situation in Myanmar in December 2017.\nReporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Hugh Lawson\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
