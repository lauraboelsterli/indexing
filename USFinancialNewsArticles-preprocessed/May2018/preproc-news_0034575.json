    "text": "(Reuters) - Former Uber Technologies cyber security chief Joe Sullivan is joining internet security firm Cloudflare Inc as its new chief security officer, a spokeswoman for Cloudflare said on Wednesday.\nSullivan was fired from Uber last year over what the ride-hailing firm said was his role in the handling of a 2016 data breach.\nSullivan, who has also worked for Facebook and eBay, said in a blog post bit.ly/2rNJF68 that he was joining Cloudflare as he sought a role in a company that wanted to push security out across the internet.\nReporting by Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ",
