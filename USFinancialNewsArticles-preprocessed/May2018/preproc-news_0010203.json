    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 4:29 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago L'Oreal snaps up South Korean cosmetics firm Nanda Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nPARIS (Reuters) - French cosmetics group L’Oreal ( OREP.PA ) on Wednesday said it had bought South Korean make-up and fashion firm Nanda, as industry leaders jostle for a slice of one of the world’s most dynamic beauty markets. FILE PHOTO: The logo of French cosmetics group L'Oreal is seen in front of the Arc de Triomphe during a public event in Paris, France, October 1, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Platiau\nL’Oreal did not disclose how much it had paid for the company, detailing only that Nanda, known for its fashion business Stylenanda and 3CE cosmetics brand, had a turnover of 127 million euros (111.7 million pounds) in 2017.\nThe acquisition was estimated at around 400 billion won (273.2 million pounds), Korean media previously reported.\nForeign investors including LVMH ( LVMH.PA ), Estee Lauder ( EL.N ) and Unilever ( UNc.AS ) are also among those betting on continued demand for Korean beauty products in Asian markets such as China, backed by the popularity of Korean pop culture.
