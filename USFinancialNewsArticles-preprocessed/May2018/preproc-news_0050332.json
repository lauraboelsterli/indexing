    "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will shorten his visit to India by a day in order to join cabinet discussions on Friday about new findings on the downing of passenger flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, Dutch news agency ANP said on Thursday.\nProsecutors investigating the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 said on Thursday they had identified the missile used to shoot down the plane on July 17, 2014, as coming from a Russian military unit.\nThe airliner with 298 people on board, two-thirds of them Dutch, was hit by a Russian-made missile over territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists. All those aboard died.\nReporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
