    "text": "Tampa, FL, May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DAS Health, a leading provider of health IT and management solutions, has secured a $6 million facility through Fifth Third Bank to be used primarily for future acquisitions and growth. DAS recently completed its fifth acquisition in a three-year time span, each using only DAS’ own internal operating cashflow (see https://dashealth.com/partnership-video ).\nDAS Health’s excellent track record of success in integrating services and staff has led to continued expansion, allowing the company to provide existing clients with improved services and support as well as expand the organization’s service area and client base. The largest national reseller of Aprima® Medical Software, DAS offers a broad spectrum of practice management, IT and patient care solutions. Recent acquisitions have added eMDs® Plus, Lytec™, and Medisoft® EHR and PM platforms as well as expanded DAS’ managed IT solutions. Additional service offerings include security risk assessments, MIPS/MACRA reporting & consulting, mental & behavioral health screenings, chronic care management, revenue cycle management (RCM) medical billing and value-based care solutions.\n“DAS is focused on helping independent physicians to thrive in a changing industry. This partnership with Fifth Third bank, along with our already strong operating results, allows us to rapidly expand our “buy-and-build” strategy, which in turn allows us to better serve our clients and find new ways for them to prosper,” David Schlaifer, DAS Health President and CEO, emphasized. “Although we have been courted by many banks, it was clear from the first conversation with Fifth Third that there was a culture match and they were the right partner for us going forward. We look to continue our rapid growth with the ultimate goal of helping clinicians across the United States focus on their patients, not worry about their business.”\n“The leadership, results and business model at DAS Health are truly impressive, and the focus on client success is remarkable,” Danny Riley, Senior Vice President of Fifth Third Bank added. “Notwithstanding DAS’ substantial success to date in acquiring companies using only its own internal cash flow, we believe we are only at the beginning of their long-term growth cycle and are excited to play a pivotal role in helping them to accelerate their growth capacity.”\nDAS’ continued growth has been celebrated with six consecutive years on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing privately held companies and is the only company to be named for eight consecutive years to the Tampa Bay Business Journal Fast 50 list. The company now serves nearly 2,000 clinicians and more than 600 physician practices nationwide.\n*Aprima is a registered trademark of Aprima Medical Software, Inc.\n* eMDs, eMDs Plus, Lytec, and Medisoft are trademarks of eMDs, Inc.\nAbout DAS Health\nDAS Health has been a leading provider of Health IT and management solutions and a trusted consultant to independent physician groups, hospitals and healthcare systems across North America since 2003.
