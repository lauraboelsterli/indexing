    "text": "INNSBRUCK, Austria (Reuters) - World Cup hosts Russia turned in another unconvincing display as Austria extended their winless run stretching back to October with a 1-0 victory in a friendly on Wednesday.\nSoccer Football - International Friendly - Austria vs Russia - Tivoli Stadion Tirol, Innsbruck, Austria - May 30, 2018 Russia's Yuri Zhirkov in action with Austria's Marko Arnautovic REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger The home side, who have not qualified for the finals, exposed defensive frailties in Stanislav Cherchesov’s team with Alessandro Schopf sending a neat finish past Igor Akinfeev following a fine run from Marko Arnautovic after 28 minutes.\nShorn of competitive football due to qualifying as hosts, Russia have spent the last two years playing friendlies against some of the world’s leading sides, but their preparations have been far from ideal.\nSoccer Football - International Friendly - Austria vs Russia - Tivoli Stadion Tirol, Innsbruck, Austria - May 30, 2018 Russia's Igor Akinfeev, Sergei Ignashevich, Anton Miranchuk, Vladimir Granat and team mates look dejected at the end of the match REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger Cherchesov’s spluttering team faced a barrage of criticism in the Russian media after suffering heavy home defeats by Brazil and France in March and the coach’s negative tactics were also questioned.\nSlideshow (8 Images) Russia have conceded 10 goals in their last four games and failed to win in six matches.\nSergei Ignashevich, who will turn 39 in July, came out of retirement to join the Russia squad ahead of the major global sporting showpiece, replacing the injured Ruslan Kambolov.\nBut the return of the veteran, who earned his 121st cap against Austria, did little to reduce Russia’s defensive woes and the defeat represented another big blow for Cherchesov’s team who clearly lack quality in every department.\nOn paper, however, Russia are still favorites to reach the World Cup knockout stages from a group including Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\nRussia host Turkey in their last warm-up in Moscow on June 5.\nReporting by Angel Krasimirov, editing by Ed Osmond\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
