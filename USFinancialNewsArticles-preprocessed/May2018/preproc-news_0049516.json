    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Direct communication between the leaders of North Korea and the United States is necessary, South Korea urged on Friday.\nThe comment followed a letter by U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday informing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un of his withdrawal from what would have been the two countriesâ€™ first ever summit, set for June 12 in Singapore.\nAt a meeting on Friday, security advisers to South Korean leader Moon Jae-in vowed to keep up efforts to improve ties between the two Koreas, which would contribute to better ties between Pyongyang and Washington and complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, a presidential press secretary told a news briefing.\nReporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ",
