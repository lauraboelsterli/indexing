All amounts are presented in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\nStephen Reid, President and CEO, commented, “We are pleased to report that the Franchise segment’s adjusted EBITDA has increased 69% compared to last year. The segment, which includes DLC, is off to a strong start in 2018, positioning us well for the balance of the year.”\nSelected Consolidated Financial Highlights:\nThree months ended (in thousands except per share amounts) March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Revenues $ 30,141 $ 13,694 Income (loss) from operations 1,442 (1,790 ) Adjusted EBITDA (1) 6,244 1,957 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to: (1) Shareholders 3,085 705 Non-controlling interests 3,159 1,252 Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) 21 % 14 % Proportionate share of adjusted EBITDA (1) 3,933 2,171 Free cash flow (1) (271 ) 180 Net loss for the period (2,039 ) (1,660 ) Net income (loss) attributable to: Shareholders (2,291 ) (1,630 ) Non-controlling interests 252 (30 ) Adjusted net income (loss) (1) 71 (1,247 ) Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to: (1) Shareholders (779 ) (1,249 ) Non-controlling interests 850 2 Diluted loss per share $ (0.06 ) $ (0.04 ) Adjusted loss per share (1) (0.02 ) (0.03 ) Dividend declared per share 0.0125 0.0125 We use non-GAAP measures to assess our overall performance.

Please see the “Non-IFRS Measures” section of the MD&A for additional information on these measures.\nQ1 2018 Operational Highlights\nOperational highlights include:\nSuccessfully navigating the new B20 mortgage guidelines; Investing for growth in the fitness industry; and Integration of new acquisitions.\nNavigating the new mortgage guidelines in Canada was front and centre this quarter for our portfolio company, Dominion Lending Centres Group (“DLC”). DLC is well positioned to help more Canadian consumers obtain a mortgage and has invested in broker recruiting and retention, as well as targeted marketing campaigns. The result of DLC’ efforts is higher year over year mortgage volumes (increasing from funded volumes of $6.8 billion in Q1 2017 to $7.0 billion in Q1, 2018) and increasing market share in most markets (increasing from 34.7% in Q1, 2017 to 35.7% in Q1, 2018).\nInvestments in support resources and expansion initiated in 2017 at Club16 Trevor Linden Fitness (“Club16”) are expected to well-position Club16 for future periods. Membership numbers have increased from 80,296 in Q1, 2017 to 82,811 in Q1, 2018; a 3% increase period over period.\nOur newest acquisitions have provided positive incremental value to the portfolio. Newton Connectivity Systems Inc. (“NCS”) underwent large scale integration and restructuring in 2017 and is now set up for short- and long-term growth. Impact Radio Accessories (“Impact”) has initiated many revenue growth initiatives and Astley Gilbert Limited (“AG”) is realizing value from their October 2017 acquisition expansion.\nQ1 2018 Financial Highlights\nPreviously, FAC issued 2018 guidance for our expected proportionate share of annual adjusted EBITDA from our four investees of approximately $21.5 million to $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This outlook is reaffirmed. Our results generally vary from quarter to quarter because of seasonal fluctuations in our business segments. Q1 tends to be a lower quarter for all businesses with increased revenues historically coming in Q2 and Q3. The explanations below reflect the changes from Q1, 2017 to Q1, 2018.\nRevenues for Q1 2018 increased $16.4 million primarily as a result of the acquisitions completed in 2017, although $0.1 million of this increase was related to higher funded mortgage volumes in the Franchise segment and $0.4 million is related to higher member numbers in the Consumer Products and Services segment. The acquisitions also drove majority of the increase in income from operations, with $2.3 million of the $3.2 million increase coming from the acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $4.3 million from $2.0 million in Q1 2017 to $6.2 million in Q1 2018. The quarter over quarter increase was the result of higher mortgage funded volumes, new acquisition earnings, and lower costs in both the Franchise segment and corporate head office.\nPlease see the Corporation’s MD&A and financial statements for additional information relating to the financial results.\nOverview of Financial Results for Segments\nWe currently operate a corporate head office and three business segments – Business Products and Services, Consumer Products and Services and Franchise. Please see the Corporation’s MD&A for a comprehensive discussion relating to the financial results for the segments.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nManagement presents certain non-IFRS financial measures which we use as supplemental indicators of our operating performance. Non-IFRS financial performance measures include EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA attributed to shareholders and NCI, proportionate share of investee EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow. Readers are cautioned that these non-IFRS measures should not be construed as a substitute or an alternative to applicable generally accepted accounting principle measures as determined in accordance with IFRS. Please see the Corporation’s MD&A for a description these measures and a reconciliation of these measures to their nearest IFRS measure.\nAbout Founders Advantage Capital Corp.\nThe Corporation is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange as an Investment Issuer (Tier 1) and employs a permanent investment approach.
