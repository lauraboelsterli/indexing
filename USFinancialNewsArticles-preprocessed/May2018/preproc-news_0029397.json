    "text": "(Corrects year of “Superman” in fourth paragraph to 1978 from 1987)\nLOS ANGELES, May 14 (Reuters) - Actress Margot Kidder, best known for playing Lois Lane in the “Superman” films in the 1970s and 1980s, has died at the age of 69, a funeral home in Montana said on Monday.\nThe Franzen-Davis Funeral Home in Livingston, Montana said on its website that Kidder passed away on Sunday at her home in the town. The cause of death was not immediately known.\nCanadian-born Kidder also appeared in the movie “The Great Waldo Pepper” and the 2014 children’s TV series “R.L. Stine’s The Haunting Hour,” for which she won an Emmy award.\nKidder shot to fame playing the intrepid reporter Lois Lane in 1978’s “Superman,” opposite Christopher Reeve, and reprised the role twice more in “Superman II” (1980) and “Superman III” (1983).\nIn the mid 1990s, she suffered a mental health breakdown and in a highly publicized episode she disappeared for four days. She was later diagnosed with biploar disorder.\nActing work dried up for several years, but Kidder later re-emerged with a guest starring role in TV shows like “Smallville” and “The L Word” and on stage including a 2002 Broadway production of “The Vagina Monologues.”\nShe also was a prominent political activist, campaigning against the Gulf War, energy fracking and in support of Democrat Bernie Sanders in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nKidder became an American citizen in 2005.\nShe was married three times, including a six-day union in 1979 with actor John Heard.\nReporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
