And for many families, that means long hours on the road getting to see as many college campuses as possible.\nFor those who can afford it, though, there is a jetset version of the last-minute college campus tour blitz.\nMagellan Jets offers a \" 10-hour jet card \" specifically for college tours. It starts at $57,000, according to the Magellan Jet website .\nThe price can go up depending on the aircraft model selected and the number of cities visited, a spokesperson for the company tells CNBC Make It .\n\"We know that this is a very hectic time of the year for clients with children deciding on which college to attend, and everyone knows that the best way to learn about a college is to visit the campus,\" says Magellan Jets. \"Let us take care of the headaches so you can concentrate on what is important... Your child's future!\" show chapters 7:57 AM ET Wed, 24 May 2017 | 01:52\nMagellan Jets, which has been offering the service since 2014, will take clients to any college, a spokesperson tells CNBC Make It.\nSo far in 2018, Magellan Jets has booked ten college jetset tours.
