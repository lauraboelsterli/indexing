    "text": "Software maker Symantec recouped some of its losses from last week , gaining nearly 10 percent Monday.\nShares closed at $21.40, after shedding 33 percent and roughly $6 billion in shareholder value Friday. The company announced during its quarterly earnings report last week it had launched an internal audit that could delay the company's annual report and hurt financials in the coming quarters.\nThe company behind Norton anti-virus software said Monday it will host a call with investors after the bell to address the audit and its financial outlook.\nMonday's surge makes for Symantec's best day since 2012. The stock is now down 23 percent on the year and more than 35 percent off its 52-week high.",
