    "text": "(Adds shares, detail on expenses, background)\nMay 24 (Reuters) - South African clothing and homeware retailer The Foschini Group (TFG) on Thursday reported a smaller than expected rise in full-year earnings, hurt by higher expenses, sending its shares down as much as 4.8 percent.\nThe retailer’s diluted headline earnings per share (EPS), excluding acquisition costs, for the year ended March 31 rose 3.3 percent to 1,125.7 cents, below an average estimate of 1,155 cents in a Reuters poll of 13 analysts.\nHeadline EPS is the main profit measure in South Africa and strips out certain one-off items.\nTotal group trading expenses increased by 28.1 percent over the previous year, due to a rise in employee, occupancy and other operating costs.\nThe company, whose long-time chief executive Doug Murray is expected to retire on Sept. 3, has expanded in developed markets with the purchase of Britain’s Whistles in 2016 and Hobbs last year, as a weak economy, tighter credit rules and tough competition hampered growth at home.\nRetail turnover rose 21.4 percent to 28.59 billion rand ($2.3 billion).\nShares in TFG were down 3.9 percent at 186.7 rand at 1302 GMT.\n$1 = 12.4360 rand Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ",
