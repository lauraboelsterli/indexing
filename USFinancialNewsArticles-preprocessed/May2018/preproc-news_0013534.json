The increase was driven primarily by higher volume at HII’s Newport News and Ingalls shipbuilding divisions.\nOperating income in the quarter was $191 million and operating margin was 10.2 percent, compared to $168 million and 9.7 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017. The increases in operating income and operating margin were mainly the result of a higher Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment compared to the prior year.\nDiluted earnings per share in the quarter was $3.48, compared to $2.56 in the same period of 2017. The increase was predominantly due to higher operating income and the non-operating portion of retirement benefit expense.\nFirst quarter cash from operations was $120 million and free cash flow 1 was $47 million, compared to $98 million and $40 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017.\nNew contract awards in the quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, primarily driven by an award for the detail design and construction of the amphibious transport dock LPD 29, bringing total backlog to approximately $22 billion as of March 31.\n“The first quarter was highlighted by revenue growth in all three business segments,” said Mike Petters, HII’s president and CEO. “With the Navy’s commitment to achieve its goal of 355 ships and Congress providing the necessary funding, HII stands ready to support construction of a larger fleet.”\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended March 31 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Sales and service revenues $ 1,874 $ 1,724 $ 150 8.7 % Operating income (loss) 191 168 23 13.7 % Operating margin % 10.2 % 9.7 % 45 bps Segment operating income (loss) 1 117 120 (3 ) (2.5 )% Segment operating margin % 1 6.2 % 7.0 % (72) bps Net earnings (loss) 156 119 37 31.1 % Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 3.48 $ 2.56 $ 0.92 35.9 % Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 44.8 46.4 1 Non-GAAP measures that exclude non-segment factors affecting operating income.

Segment Operating Results\nIngalls Shipbuilding\nThree Months Ended March 31 ($ in millions) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Revenues $ 585 $ 550 $ 35 6.4 % Segment operating income (loss) 1 64 66 (2 ) (3.0 )% Segment operating margin % 1 10.9 % 12.0 % (106) bps 1 Non-GAAP measures. See Exhibit B for definitions and reconciliations. Ingalls Shipbuilding revenues for the first quarter were $585 million, an increase of $35 million, or 6.4 percent, from the same period in 2017, due to increased revenues in amphibious assault ships, partially offset by decreased revenues in the Legend -class National Security Cutter (NSC) program. Higher amphibious assault ship revenues were the result of increased volumes on LPD 29 (unnamed), Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28) and Bougainville (LHA 8), partially offset by decreased volume on the delivered USS Portland (LPD 27). Lower NSC program revenues were primarily the result of decreased volume on Kimball (NSC 7), partially offset by increased volume on Stone (NSC 9) in the quarter.\nIngalls Shipbuilding segment operating income for the first quarter was $64 million, a decrease of $2 million from the same period last year. Segment operating margin in the quarter was 10.9 percent, compared to 12.0 percent in the same period last year. These decreases were primarily due to lower risk retirement on the NSC program, partially offset by higher risk retirement on the San Antonio -class (LPD 17) program.\nKey Ingalls Shipbuilding milestones for the quarter:\nAwarded $1.4 billion contract for LPD 29 construction Awarded $94 million advanced procurement contract for a 10th National Security Cutter\nNewport News Shipbuilding\nThree Months Ended March 31 ($ in millions) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Revenues $ 1,082 $ 971 $ 111 11.4 % Segment operating income (loss) 1 51 72 (21 ) (29.2 )% Segment operating margin % 1 4.7 % 7.4 % (270) bps 1 Non-GAAP measures. See Exhibit B for definitions and reconciliations. Newport News Shipbuilding revenues for the first quarter were $1.1 billion, an increase of $111 million, or 11.4 percent, from the same period in 2017, mainly due to higher revenues in aircraft carriers and naval nuclear support services. Higher aircraft carrier revenues were primarily the result of increased volumes on the execution contract for the refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH) of USS George Washington (CVN 73), the construction contract for John F. Kennedy (CVN 79) and the advance planning contract for Enterprise (CVN 80), partially offset by decreased volumes on the execution contract for the RCOH of the redelivered USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), the construction contract for the delivered USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) and the inactivation of the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN 65). The increase in naval nuclear support services revenues was primarily the result of higher volumes in submarine support and facility maintenance services, partially offset by lower aircraft carrier support volume.\nNewport News Shipbuilding segment operating income for the first quarter was $51 million, a decrease of $21 million from the same period last year. Segment operating margin was 4.7 percent for the quarter, compared to 7.4 percent in the same period last year. These decreases were primarily due to one-time bonus payments in 2018 related to recently enacted federal tax reform, as well as year-to-year variances in contract mix.\nKey Newport News Shipbuilding milestones for the quarter:\nInstalled a 400-metric ton fixture in the Joint Manufacturing Assembly Facility to revolutionize submarine construction and drive efficiencies in the Virginia- and Columbia- class submarine programs Achieved approximately 75% structural completion on the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy (CVN 79)\nTechnical Solutions\nThree Months Ended March 31 ($ in millions) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Revenues $ 233 $ 225 $ 8 3.6 % Segment operating income (loss) 1 2 (18 ) $ 20 111.1 % Segment operating margin % 1 0.9 % (8.0 )% 886 bps 1 Non-GAAP measures. See Exhibit B for definitions and reconciliations. Technical Solutions revenues for the first quarter were $233 million, an increase of $8 million, or 3.6 percent, from the same period in 2017, primarily due to higher revenues in oil and gas and fleet support services, partially offset by lower nuclear and environmental and integrated mission solutions revenues.\nTechnical Solutions segment operating income for the first quarter was $2 million, compared to an operating loss of $18 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily a result of the establishment of an allowance for accounts receivable on a nuclear and environmental commercial contract in 2017, partially offset by one-time bonus payments in 2018 related to recently enacted federal tax reform.\nKey Technical Solutions milestones for the quarter:\nReceived a notice to proceed from the Department of Energy to transition the Los Alamos Legacy Cleanup Contract to N3B, a joint venture led by SN3, part of HII’s Technical Solutions division, with partner BWXT Technical Services Group, Inc. Australia’s Department of Defence awarded a contract to Naval Shipbuilding Institute (NSI), a joint venture between HII’s Technical Solutions division and Kellogg Brown and Root’s (KBR) Government Services division, to establish and manage Australia’s new Naval Shipbuilding College.\nAbout Huntington Ingalls Industries\nHuntington Ingalls Industries is America’s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry.

When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use segment operating income (loss) and segment operating margin in addition to, and not as alternatives for, operating income and operating margin or any other performance measure presented in accordance with GAAP. They are measures that we use to evaluate our core operating performance. We believe that segment operating income (loss) and segment operating margin reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe these measures are used by investors and are a useful indicator to measure our performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of segment operating income (loss) and segment operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFree cash flow is not a measure recognized under GAAP. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We believe free cash flow is an important measure for our investors because it provides them insight into our current and period-to-period performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations. We also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSegment operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) for the relevant segment(s) before the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes.\nSegment operating margin is defined as segment operating income (loss) as a percentage of sales and service revenues.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures, net of related grant proceeds.\nFAS/CAS Adjustment is defined as the difference between expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits determined in accordance with GAAP (FAS) and the expenses for these items included in segment operating income in accordance with U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS).\nOperating FAS/CAS Adjustment is defined as the FAS/CAS Adjustment less the following components of net periodic benefit costs: interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost (credit) and actuarial loss (gain), and settlement and curtailment effects.\nNon-current state income taxes are defined as deferred state income taxes, which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state uncertain tax positions in the relevant period. These amounts are recorded within operating income. Current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income.\nWe present financial measures adjusted for the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes to reflect the company’s performance based upon the pension costs and state tax expense charged to our contracts under CAS. We use these adjusted measures as internal measures of operating performance and for performance-based compensation decisions.\nReconciliation of Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Segment Operating Margin\nThree Months Ended March 31 ($ in millions) 2018 2017 Ingalls revenues $ 585 $ 550 Newport News revenues 1,082 971 Technical Solutions revenues 233 225 Intersegment eliminations (26 ) (22 ) Sales and Service Revenues 1,874 1,724 Segment Operating Income (Loss) Ingalls 64 66 As a percentage of Ingalls revenues 10.9 % 12.0 % Newport News 51 72 As a percentage of Newport News revenues 4.7 % 7.4 % Technical Solutions 2 (18 ) As a percentage of Technical Solutions revenues 0.9 % (8.0 )% Segment Operating Income (Loss) 117 120 As a percentage of sales and service revenues 6.2 % 7.0 % Non-segment factors affecting operating income (loss): Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment 72 53 Non-current state income taxes 2 (5 ) Operating Income 191 168 Interest expense (15 ) (18 ) Non-operating retirement expense 18 (4 ) Other, net 1 1 Federal and foreign income taxes (39 ) (28 ) Net Earnings $ 156 $ 119 Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31 ($ in millions) 2018 2017 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 120 98 Less capital expenditures: Capital expenditure additions (75 ) (58 ) Grant proceeds for capital expenditures 2 — Free cash flow 47 40\nContacts: Jerri Fuller Dickseski (Media) jerri.dickseski@hii-co.com 757-380-2341 Dwayne Blake (Investors) dwayne.blake@hii-co.com 757-380-2104\nSource:Huntington Ingalls Incorporated",
