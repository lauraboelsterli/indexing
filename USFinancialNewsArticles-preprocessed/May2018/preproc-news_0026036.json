    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 3:27 AM / Updated 23 minutes ago BOJ governor signals debate on conditions for stimulus exit Leika Kihara 3 Min Read\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank could debate conditions for exiting from ultra-easy policy if prospects for achieving its inflation target improve, reminding markets his radical stimulus programme won’t last forever.
