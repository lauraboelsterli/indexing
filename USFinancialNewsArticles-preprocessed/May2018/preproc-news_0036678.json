( bit.ly/2GT7v6b )\nTwenty-three more people fell ill since the last update on May 9, bringing the total to 172 people from 32 states, the CDC said on Wednesday. ( bit.ly/2HhtHu6 )\nThree more states — Iowa, Nebraska, and Oregon — have also reported cases, the CDC said. Reporting by Mrinalini Krothapalli in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta",
