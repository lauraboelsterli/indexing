REUTERS/Simon Dawson\nThe book comes out 60 years after Bond’s first story about the bear named after the London train station where he is found following his arrival from Peru, “A Bear called Paddington”.\nBond went on to write more than 20 Paddington Bear books, of which 35 million copies have been sold worldwide, inspiring two films.\nDressed in his usual attire, a Paddington Bear figure greeted visitors to the cathedral on Wednesday, where a memorial service for Bond was held in November, and children took part in an arts and crafts session. Slideshow (2 Images)\n“It would be nice to think that it would carry on for another 60 years,” Jankel said of her father’s legacy. “And maybe beyond that, you never know.” Reporting by Lisa Keddie; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Alison Williams",
