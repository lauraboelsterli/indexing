REUTERS/Phil Noble\nReaffirming its full year outlook, the bank said gross mortgage lending was 1.4 billion pounds for the first quarter ended March 31, in line with earlier guidance, albeit down from the 2 billion pounds reported a year earlier.\nMortgage balances rose 10.4 percent to 33.9 billion pounds, while deposits grew to 31.1 billion - up 7.4 percent since March 31 2017.\n“We are focused on growing assets at the right price and quality in a competitive mortgage market and are pleased to report 10.4 percent year-on-year growth in our mortgage book,” Chief Executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia\nThe bank said it had seen “a stronger than expected” customer response to the launch of its Virgin Atlantic frequent flyer credit cards, and that a new distribution partnership with Aberdeen Standard Investments ( SLA.L ) was likely to increase its 13 percent core capital ratio by around 40 basis points.
