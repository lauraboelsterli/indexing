FILE PHOTO: A pumpjack of Austrian oil and gas group OMV is pictured in Auersthal, some 25 km (15 miles) north of Vienna February 20, 2014. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader\nThe group was monitoring political developments in the United States and the European Union very closely, said upstream chief Johann Pleininger at the annual shareholders’ meeting in Vienna.\n“The project has not come to a standstill, it is continuing,” Pleininger said, adding that “no investments have been made yet.”\nOMV signed a memorandum of understanding in May 2016 for projects in the Zagros area of western Iran and the Fars field in the south. In June 2017, OMV and Russia’s Gazprom Neft announced a memorandum of understanding to work in Iran’s oil sector. Reporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Adrian Croft",
