It was last down 0.4 percent and the sole European stock market trading in the red.\nWhile Italian markets have proved relatively resilient in the wake of the inconclusive election in March, a fresh election could put investor sentiment to the test.\n“Another election increases the probability of a League/5-Star government, which is the least market friendly outcome,” said Rabobank’s Lyn Graham-Taylor.\nA centre-right alliance led by the anti-immigrant League won the most seats in last month’s election and 5-Star emerged as the biggest single party. The centre-left Democratic Party (PD) came a distant third.\n“It could be more of a bargaining tool to get the PD to the table,” said Graham-Taylor, referring to 5-Star’s using talk of a snap election in its coalition negotiations with the PD.\nThe sell off in Italy’s bond market dragged Spanish and Portuguese bond yields 3-4 bps higher, while other bond yields in the single currency bloc were just a tad higher on the day.\nLatest inflation data from Germany and Italy provided some support for regional bond markets.\nAnnual inflation in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, slowed in April, data showed on Monday, pushing it further below the European Central Bank’s target of just under 2 percent for the euro zone as a whole.\nData from Italy meanwhile showed annual inflation slowed to 0.6 percent in April from 0.9 percent in March.\n“The German inflation data suggests another subdued inflation reading for the euro zone later in the week,” Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann said.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Additional reporting by Helen Reid\n ",
