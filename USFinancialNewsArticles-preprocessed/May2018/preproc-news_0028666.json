Healthcare Services segment net revenues of $5,657,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased $156,000 (3%) over last year’s third quarter primarily due to increased nursing home revenues and reduced bad debts.

These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results, performance and achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.

We understand that certain industry analysts and investors generally consider EBITDA to be one measure of the liquidity of the company, and it is presented to assist analysts and investors in analyzing the ability of the company to generate cash, service debt and to satisfy capital requirements. We believe increased EBITDA is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt and to satisfy capital requirements. EBITDA, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered an alternative to Net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash liquidity. Because EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other corporations. Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, is shown below. Healthcare Services Adjusted EBITDA and Pharmacy Adjusted EBITDA is the EBITDA for those facilities without any allocation of corporate overhead, impairment charges, the Deepwater Horizon Settlement Program gain, and gains on sale of businesses.\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Healthcare Services Adjusted EBITDA $ 603,000 $ 709,000 Pharmacy Adjusted EBITDA 1,130,000 299,000 Corporate Overhead Adjusted EBITDA (1,311,000 ) (1,328,000 ) Taxes and interest expense (6,000 ) (271,000 ) Other non-cash expenses and net change in operating assets and liabilities\n(449,000 ) (4,408,000 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operations $ (33,000 ) $ (4,999,000 ) SUNLINK HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.
