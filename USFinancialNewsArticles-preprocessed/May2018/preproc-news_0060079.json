    "text": "(Adds detail)\nMOSCOW, May 30 (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom said on Wednesday its first-quarter net income rose 11 percent to 371.6 billion roubles ($6 billion), thanks to higher gas prices and sales volumes, beating analysts’ expectations.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had on average expected Gazprom’s net income to come in at 338.3 billion roubles.\nGazprom generates almost two thirds of its gas sales in Europe, where it has a market share of around 34 percent.\nThe Kremlin-controlled company emerged largely unscathed from a seven-year investigation by the European Commission into its selling practices, making some concessions in pricing structure and allowing rivals a foothold in eastern Europe.\nGazprom said its revenues from gas sales to Europe jumped by 28 percent in January-March as prices rose by 17 percent, while sales volumes increased by 9 percent.\nThe company plans to further strengthen its exposure to Europe this year, reaching an all-time high in gas exports of almost 200 billion cubic metres.\nIn a sign of Russia’s rising energy might, Gazprom signed a deal last week with Turkey over the on-land portion of the TurkStream pipeline, which will run into southern Europe.\nGazprom said on Wednesday its total sales in January-March increased by 18 percent to 2.14 trillion roubles.\n$1 = 62.6524 roubles Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Tom Balmforth and Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
