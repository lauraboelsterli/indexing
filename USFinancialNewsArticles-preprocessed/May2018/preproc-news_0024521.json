Golden entered into agreements with Minh Chau Ltd. (\"Minh Chau\"), the owner of a small hotel and international entertainment and gaming club in Vietnam to manage the hotel and international entertainment and gaming club as well as acquire a minority share in Minh Chau. The agreement with Minh Chau also enables Golden to acquire a minimum 51% ownership interest in Minh Chau over the next three years.\nOn May 4, 2018, the Company was approved to increase the borrowing capacity on its Bank of Montreal Credit Agreement (\"BMO Credit Agreement\") by CAD 35.0 million ($27.1 million based on the exchange rate in effect on March 31, 2018) for construction of the Century Mile project. The Company will utilize funds from the amended BMO Credit Agreement and $25.0 million from its November 2017 common stock offering for the Century Mile project. The Company expects to finalize the amendment to the BMO Credit Agreement in the second quarter of 2018.\n\"We are pleased with the results of the first quarter. Our Canadian operations increased revenue by 7% in local currency and our United States operations increased revenue by 3%,\" Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger, Co-Chief Executive Officers of Century Casinos remarked. \"Adjusted EBITDA from our operations in Poland was negatively impacted, as expected, by the closure of casinos while awaiting re-licensing decisions,\" they continued. \"Construction of our largest and most significant project to date, the Century Mile racetrack and casino development, continues to be on budget and on track for an early 2019 opening.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n* The impact of foreign exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. The Company uses a Constant Currency basis to show the impact from foreign exchange rates on current period revenue compared to prior period revenue using the prior period's foreign exchange rates. In order to properly understand the underlying business trends and performance of the Company's ongoing operations, management believes that investors may find it useful to consider the impact of excluding changes in foreign exchange rates from the Company's operating revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings (loss) attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders and Adjusted EBITDA. Constant currency results are calculated by dividing the current quarter or year to date local currency segment results by the prior year's average exchange rate for the quarter or year and comparing them to actual U.S. dollar results for the prior quarter or year. The average exchange rates for the current quarter and the prior year first quarter are reported in Item 1 of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n** The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders before interest expense (income), net, income taxes (benefit), depreciation, amortization, non-controlling interest (earnings) losses and transactions, pre-opening expenses, acquisition costs, non-cash stock-based compensation charges, asset impairment costs, (gain) loss on disposition of fixed assets, discontinued operations, (gain) loss on foreign currency transactions and other, gain on business combination and certain other one-time items, such as acquisition costs. Intercompany transactions consisting primarily of management and royalty fees and interest, along with their related tax effects, are excluded from the presentation of net earnings (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA reported for each segment. Not all of the aforementioned items occur in each reporting period, but have been included in the definition based on historical activity. These adjustments have no effect on the consolidated results as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA is not considered a measure of performance recognized under US GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a valuable measure of the relative performance of the Company and its properties. The gaming industry commonly uses Adjusted EBITDA as a method of arriving at the economic value of a casino operation. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to compare the relative operating performance of separate operating units by eliminating the above mentioned items associated with the varying levels of capital expenditures for infrastructure required to generate revenue and the often high cost of acquiring existing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by the Company's lending institution to gauge operating performance. The Company's computation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies within the gaming industry. Please see the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings (loss) attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders above.\n*** The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure. Management uses this margin as one of several measures to evaluate the efficiency of the Company's casino operations.\nCENTURY CASINOS, INC.
