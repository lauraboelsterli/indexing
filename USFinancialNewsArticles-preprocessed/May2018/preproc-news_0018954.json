As reimbursement models become more focused on value-based care and as consumers take greater control over healthcare decisions, these tools will empower pharmacies to be a core healthcare destination within their local community,” said Al Babbington, CEO of PrescribeWellness.\nThrough the acquisition of the VoicePort assets, PrescribeWellness will extend and elevate its offering of combined solutions that connect patients via voice, text, email and mobile to their pharmacists, doctors and other healthcare providers.

PrescribeWellness has extended its complete patient relationship management solution for retail, health system, 340B and specialty pharmacies.\nWith the growing physician shortage, the complications associated with data interoperability and the movement towards value-based care, pharmacists will play an increasingly important role in the continuum of care, with empowered consumers demanding seamless integration of their preventive healthcare needs.\nThe PrescribeWellness solution suite helps pharmacies streamline their ability to get paid for clinical services and participate in value-based payment models, such as shared savings and performance-based reimbursements.
