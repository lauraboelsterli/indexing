The Company’s production of natural gas and oil was 72.3 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), an increase of 13% over the first quarter of 2017, with 68.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas and 677.8 thousand barrels (MBbls) of oil and condensate.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Ultra Petroleum’s average realized natural gas price was $2.68 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), which includes realized gains on commodity hedges. Excluding the realized gains from commodity derivatives, the Company’s average price for natural gas was $2.66 per Mcf, compared to $3.15 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2017. The Company’s average realized oil and condensate price was $60.36 per barrel (Bbl), which includes realized gains on commodity hedges, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Excluding the realized gains from oil commodity derivatives, the Company’s average price for oil was $60.90 per Bbl as compared to $47.29 per Bbl for the same period in 2017.\nUltra Petroleum’s reported net income was $47.5 million, or $0.24 per diluted share. Ultra reported adjusted net income(2) of $55.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nPinedale Horizontal Program\nWB 9-23\nA-1H WB 9-23\nA-2H WB 8-25\nA-1H WB 9-23\nA-3H Lateral Length 10,400’ 11,000’ 9,900’ 10,900’ Lateral Net to Gross 78% 82% 54% 47% Lateral Net Sand 8,112’ 9,020’ 5,346’ 5,123’ Completion Stages 49 49 35 33 DC&E costs ($millions) $10.0 $9.0 $8.3 $8.4 1 st Production Month Nov 17 Feb 18 Apr 18 Apr 18 IP (24-hr) MMcfe/d 51 54.5 28.5 11.7 Initial Oil Rate (Bopd) 705 873 441 146 % oil 8% 10% 9% 7% “Based on encouraging early results, we have significantly ramped up horizontal well development and now plan to drill 25-30 horizontal wells this year while maintaining our $400 million capital expenditure guidance. We believe, on average, the horizontal program can provide strong economic returns at, or even materially below, current strip pricing,” said Brad Johnson, Interim Chief Executive Officer.\nPinedale Vertical Program\nDuring the first quarter, the Company and its partners brought online 48 gross (35.9 net) vertical wells in Pinedale. The average initial production (IP) rate for new operated vertical wells brought online in the first quarter of 2018 was 7.7 million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) per day.\nUnless pricing improves, the Company plans to devote a significant amount of its remaining capital spending for 2018 to drilling horizontal wells, which provide superior economic returns to vertical wells.\n“As we transition our Pinedale field development from the legacy vertical well program to our new best-in-class horizontal well opportunity, the reaffirmation of our borrowing base and leverage covenant amendment provides the flexibility to manage the business in a disciplined fashion while maintaining compliance with all debt covenants. With liquidity in excess of $400 million, cash flow positive assets and an inside maturity nearly four years away, Ultra is well positioned to continue executing its long-term business plan to maximize shareholder value,\" added Brad Johnson.\nHedging Activity\nUltra Petroleum has continued to increase its hedging position since its last update provided on February 28, 2018. The purpose of these hedges is to provide a more certain and visible cash flow stream to ensure compliance with debt covenants if gas pricing were to materially weaken from current strip pricing over the next two years. The table below provides a summary of the hedges in place as of May 8, 2018:\nNYMEX Q2 2018 Q3 2018 Q4 2018 Q1 2019 Q2 2019 Q3 2019 Q4 2019 Natural Gas Swaps: Volume (MMBtu/d) 770,000 770,000 763,370 820,000 220,000 220,000 220,000 $/MMBtu $ 2.88 $ 2.88 $ 2.90 $ 2.94 $ 2.79 $ 2.79 $ 2.79 Oil Swaps: Volume (Bbl/d) 6,467 6,500 6,500 6,000 6,000 4,000 3,000 $/Bbl $ 60.59 $ 60.61 $ 60.45 $ 58.46 $ 59.16 $ 58.59 $ 59.23 Basis Swap Contracts: NW Rockies basis swap volume (MMBtu/d) (a) - financial 353,846 400,000 304,348 270,000 120,000 120,000 120,000 NW Rockies basis swap volume (MMBtu/d) (a)- physical 170,000 170,000 57,283 — — — — Price differential ($/MMBtu) $ (0.67 ) $ (0.68 ) $ (0.70 ) $ (0.73 ) $ (0.77 ) $ (0.77 ) $ (0.77 ) (a) Represents swap contracts that fix the basis differentials for gas sold at or near Opal, Wyoming and the value of natural gas established on the last trading day of the month by the NYMEX for natural gas swaps for the respective period.\n2018 Guidance\nIn 2018, the Company is focused on capital efficiency, cash flow visibility and accelerating the horizontal program, while producing free cash flow.\nProduction : Ultra is increasing its 2018 annual production guidance to 285-295 Bcfe. In the second quarter, the average daily production rate is expected to range between 780-800 MMcfe/d, and includes production of 1.1 Bcfe from the Utah assets. With less capital allocated to vertical drilling than originally planned, second quarter volumes are forecasted to decline slightly, with production from horizontal wells providing growth later in the year.\nExpenses : The following table presents the Company's expected per unit of production expenses for the second quarter of 2018. Production tax guidance assumes a $2.75 per MMBtu Henry Hub natural gas price and a $68.00 per Bbl NYMEX crude oil price:\nCosts Per Mcfe 2Q 2018 Lease operating expenses $ 0.30 – 0.34 Facility lease expense $ 0.08 – 0.09 Production taxes $ 0.27 – 0.29 Gathering fees, net $ 0.27 – 0.32 Transportation charges $ 0.00 – 0.00 Depletion and depreciation $ 0.67 – 0.70 General and administrative-cash $ 0.01 – 0.03 Interest expense $ 0.51 – 0.53 Total costs per Mcfe $ 2.11 – 2.30 Income Tax : The Company does not expect any tax expense during 2018.\nHeadquarters to be Relocated to Englewood, Colorado\nLater this year, the Company plans to relocate its headquarters from Houston, Texas to Englewood, Colorado with an expected effective date of and closure of the Houston office as of September 30, 2018. “Our office in the Denver area has long served as the hub for our operations, with over 65 employees. Consolidating our Houston and Denver activities into one office provides enhanced focus and cost savings as we pursue increased shareholder value,” said Brad Johnson.\n“On behalf of the Board of Directors, we want to thank all of our Houston-based employees for their many contributions to Ultra. Garland Shaw, our Chief Financial Officer, and Garrett Smith, our General Counsel, will not be relocating to Colorado, but we expect them to remain with the Company in the coming months to help manage this transition as we embark on a search for a new CFO and a new General Counsel,” said Evan Lederman, Chairman of the Board.\nConference Call Webcast Scheduled for May 10, 2018\nUltra Petroleum’s first quarter 2018 results conference call will be available via webcast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (10:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time) Thursday, May 10, 2018.

However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and the results of the Company’s peers and of prior periods.\nManagement presents the following measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company's performance is measured relative to the performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.\n(1) Operating Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating and other non-cash items. Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of operating cash flow is useful as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production Company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. The Company has also included this information because changes in operating relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the Company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Operating cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(2) Adjusted Net Income is defined as Net income adjusted to exclude certain charges or amounts in order to exclude the volatility associated with the effects of non-recurring charges, non-cash mark-to-market gains or losses on commodity derivatives, non-cash ceiling test impairments and other similar items such as post- petition interest which represents interest expense related to the prepetition debt agreements incurred as part of our emergence from chapter 11 proceedings.\n(3) Adjusted Net Income Margin is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by Total operating revenues plus Realized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, if any.\n(4) Adjusted Operating Cash Flow Margin is defined as Operating Cash Flow divided by Total operating revenues plus Realized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, if any.\n(5) Earnings before interest, taxes, depletion and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is defined as Net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest, taxes, depletion and amortization and certain other non-recurring or non-cash charges. Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA is useful as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production Company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(6) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total operating revenues plus Realized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives, if any.\n(7) For the three months ended March 31, 2017, excludes postpetition interest expense that represents interest for the period beginning April 29, 2016 through March 31, 2017.\n(8) For the three months ended March 31, 2017, reorganization items, net and contract settlement expense are considered non-recurring items and are excluded from operating cash flow.\n(9) In conjunction with emergence from chapter 11 on April 12, 2017, the Company issued shares of New Equity to holders of Existing Common Shares at a conversion ratio of 0.521562. As a result, the basic and fully diluted share counts have been presented to reflect this conversion as if it had occurred as of January 1, 2017.\nAbout Ultra Petroleum\nUltra Petroleum Corp. is an independent energy company engaged in domestic natural gas and oil exploration, development and production.
