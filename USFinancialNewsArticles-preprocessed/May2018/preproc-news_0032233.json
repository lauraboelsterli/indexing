(NYSE American:EVBN), a community financial services company serving Western New York since 1920, announced that its wholly owned insurance subsidiary, The Evans Agency, LLC, has acquired the business of Richardson & Stout Insurance (“R&S”) of Wellsville, N.Y., effective July 1, 2018. The transaction will bring The Evans Agency’s annualized premiums to over $100 million.\nThis strategic acquisition significantly deepens The Evans Agency’s leadership bench, broadens its geographic footprint, leverages the two agencies’ complementary products and services, and provides a bigger platform through which to further scale the business.\nThe transaction will be transparent for customers, who will continue to receive the excellent products and service they have received from Richardson & Stout. All current R&S employees will join The Evans Agency, including co-owners Richard Ewell, Ian Whitehouse, and Aaron Whitehouse.\n“We’re excited to be welcoming new customers and a superb team of insurance professionals to The Evans Agency family,” said Robert G. Miller, Jr., President of The Evans Agency, LLC. “The joining of these local insurance agencies further demonstrates Evans’ commitment to the Western New York community and enhances our dedication of providing quality, cost-saving insurance solutions to local businesses, families and individuals.”\nFounded in 1913, The Evans Agency, LLC has grown from a small town, family-owned insurance agency to a dynamic multi-location professional insurance and risk management operation providing personal, commercial and employee benefits solutions throughout Western New York. Richardson & Stout represents the 16th insurance acquisition completed by Evans.\n“Our agency has known and worked with Bob Miller and his team at The Evans Agency for 25 years, through our affiliation with Combined Financial Services, a cluster group of agencies in Western New York,” said Aaron M. Whitehouse, President of Richardson & Stout Insurance. “Richardson & Stout and The Evans Agency each have a 100 year plus history of providing insurance products and services to protect businesses and families, and we are looking forward to continuing this rich tradition.”\nThe roots of Richardson & Stout Insurance can be traced to the beginning of the last century, starting with The Brown Agency, founded in 1903 and the Forrest H. Allen Agency, formed in 1929. After several mergers and acquisitions, the Brown & Stout Agency and Allen, Dygert, & Hauser, Inc. merged their operations to become Richardson & Stout Insurance in 1998.\n“The combination of the capabilities of both companies will provide our customers with a single point of contact for all their insurance, employee benefits and financial services needs,” said Richardson & Stout Vice President Rich Ewell.\nThe agency will be known as Richardson & Stout Insurance, a division of The Evans Agency, and will remain in its current location at 80 N. Main Street in Wellsville. The office phone (585) 593-4296 will also remain unchanged.\nTerms of the deal were not announced.\nAbout Evans Bancorp, Inc.\nEvans Bancorp, Inc. is a financial holding company and the parent company of Evans Bank, N.A., a commercial bank with $1.4 billion in assets and $1.1 billion in deposits at March 31, 2018. Evans is a full-service community bank, with 14 financial centers providing comprehensive financial services to consumer, business and municipal customers throughout Western New York.
