Billionaires of Indian origin, based in the Gulf, have a collective net worth of $26.4 billion.\n“Having made their fortunes these top businessmen are now investing heavily, both in the region as well as in India.”\nMr Samir Salya received his award at a glittering ceremony held at Five Palm Jumeirah, Dubai, UAE earlier this month.\nHe said he was ‘delighted’ to be in such esteemed company, adding: “It’s a real honour to have made the final 100 - and recognition of the great work my teams continue to do in the region and beyond.”\nReign Holdings, which began life in the UK and UAE in 1995, now delivers projects all around the world, and has invested heavily in the Dubai tourism market.\nends\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180529005957/en/\nIgniyte Limited\nClaire Donnelly\nJournalist\nclaire@igniyte.com\n07538 000271\nSource: Reign Holdings",
