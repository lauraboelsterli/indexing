    "text": "CAMARILLO, Calif., May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Semtech Corporation (Nasdaq:SMTC), a leading supplier of high performance analog, mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms, today reported unaudited financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which ended April 29, 2018. The Company also announced that its board of directors increased the authorization of an additional $250 million of repurchases under the existing stock repurchase program, which brings the total authorization to approximately $272 million. Prior to the increase, the Company had approximately $22 million remaining from the authorization that was last expanded in May 2015.\nNet sales computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), were $130.4 million, after being reduced by $21.5 million of share-based compensation associated with the previously-announced accelerated vesting of the Warrant issued to Comcast (“Warrant”). Excluding the offset associated with the Warrant, net sales were $151.9 million (“non-GAAP net sales”).\nHighlights for the First Fiscal Quarter 2019\nRecord quarterly bookings Record quarterly bookings and net sales of LoRa-related products Accelerated the vesting of the Comcast Warrant Repurchased approximately 645,144 shares for approximately $25 million Board approved a $250 million increase in stock repurchase authorization Cash flow from operations of $35M or 27% of net sales\nResults on a GAAP basis for the First Fiscal Quarter 2019\nNet sales were $130.4 million, after $21.5 million reduction related to the Warrant Gross margin was 54.8% SG&A expenses were $41.4 million R&D expenses were $26.2 million Tax provision was a benefit of $17.5 million, of which $15.8 million related to the release of a valuation reserve Net income was $12.4 million or $0.18 per diluted share\nTo facilitate a complete understanding of comparable financial performance between periods, the Company also presents performance results net of certain non-cash items and items that are not considered reflective of the Company’s core results over time. The Company’s non-GAAP measures of net sales, gross margin, net income, earnings per diluted share, and free cash flow exclude certain items as described below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nResults on a non- GAAP basis for the First Fiscal Quarter 2019 (see the list of non-GAAP items and the reconciliation of these to the most relevant GAAP items set forth in the tables below):\nNon-GAAP net sales were $151.9 million Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.4% Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $28.8 million Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $23.7 million Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9% Non-GAAP net income was $32.0 million or $0.47 per diluted share\nAs the Warrant has now been fully-vested, the Company will not record additional expense related to the Warrant in future periods. In consideration of discussions held with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has decided that in future earnings releases it will no longer adjust net sales for the impact of the Warrant for any comparable historical periods presented. The Company will instead provide GAAP net sales for historical periods presented and will separately disclose the impact of the Warrant on the financial statement line items impacted by the Warrant.\nMohan Maheswaran, Semtech’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated “The momentum from our strategic growth engines in the IOT, Datacenter and Mobile markets resulted in solid Q1 fiscal year 2019 results. Led by record results from our LoRa business, we are off to a very encouraging start to the year and, with record bookings in Q1, we anticipate that fiscal year 2019 should be another record year for the Company.\"\nGAAP Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook\nNet sales are expected to be in the range of $155.0 million to $167.0 million Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 60.8% to 61.8% SG&A expense is expected to be in the range of $36.1 million to $37.1 million R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $27.1 million to $28.1 million Intangible amortization expense is expected to be approximately $7.5 million Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $2.0 million Tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19% to 21% Earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.33 Fully-diluted share count is expected to be approximately 68.5 million shares Share-based compensation is expected to be approximately $11.0 million, categorized as follows: $0.3 million cost of sales, $2.1 million R&D and $8.6 million SG&A Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $4.8 million Depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $5.7 million\nNon-GAAP Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook\nNon-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the range of 61.0% to 62.0% Non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be in the range of $27.0 million to $28.0 million Non-GAAP R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $24.5 million to $25.5 million Non-GAAP Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $2.0 million Non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the range of 16% to 18% Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.58\nWebcast and Conference Call\nSemtech will be hosting a conference call today to discuss its first quarter of fiscal year 2019 results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time. An audio webcast will be available on Semtech’s website at www.Semtech.com under the “Investor Relations” section. A replay of the call will be available through June 29, 2018 at the same website or by calling (855) 859-2056 and entering conference ID 6939726\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, this release includes a non-GAAP presentation of net sales, gross margin, SG&A expenses, R&D expenses, operating margin, net income, earnings per diluted share and free cash flow. The Company's measure of free cash flow is calculated as cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures. The Company’s non-GAAP measures of net sales, gross margin, SG&A expenses, R&D expenses, operating margin, net income and earnings per diluted share exclude the following items, if any:\nShare-based compensation, including the Warrant-related impact Amortization of purchased intangibles and impairments Restructuring, transaction and other acquisition or disposition-related expenses and gains on dispositions Litigation expenses or dispute settlement charges or gains Environmental reserves Equity in net losses of equity method investments\nTo provide additional insight into the Company's second fiscal quarter outlook, this release also includes a presentation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures including gross margin, SG&A expenses, R&D expense, effective tax rate and earnings per diluted share.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude the items identified above because such items are either operating expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred by the Company in the normal course of the Company’s business operations or are not reflective of the Company’s core results over time. These excluded items may include recurring as well as non-recurring items, and no inference should be made that all of these adjustments, charges, costs or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. For example: certain restructuring and integration-related expenses (which consist of employee termination costs, facility closure or lease termination costs, and contract termination costs) may be considered recurring given the Company’s ongoing efforts to be more cost effective and efficient; certain acquisition and disposition-related adjustments or expenses may be deemed recurring given the Company's regular evaluation of potential transactions and investments; and certain litigation expenses or dispute settlement charges or gains (which may include estimated losses for which we may have established a reserve, as well as any actual settlements, judgments, or other resolutions against, or in favor of, the Company related to litigation, arbitration, disputes or similar matters, and insurance recoveries received by the Company related to such matters) may be viewed as recurring given that the Company may from time to time be involved in, and may resolve, litigation, arbitration, disputes, and similar matters.\nNotwithstanding that certain adjustments, charges, costs or expenses may be considered recurring, in order to provide meaningful comparisons, the Company believes that it is appropriate to exclude such items because they are not reflective of the Company's core results and tend to vary based on timing, frequency and magnitude.\nAs previously noted, in future earnings releases, the Company will no longer adjust net sales for the impact of the Warrant for any comparable historical periods presented. In this current earnings release, the Company has excluded the recognized cost of the Warrant from non-GAAP net sales because the Warrant cost relates to a non-routine, non-cash equity award provided to Comcast as an incentive for Comcast to deploy a network based on technology developed by the Company and the Warrant will not have an ongoing impact on revenues in future periods. Historically, there has been virtually no correlation between the amount of net sales recognized on sales generated in support of the achievement of milestones and the cost recognized for the Warrant, since the achievement of the milestones was not dependent on the achievement of sales targets, but instead the cost was recognized based upon (i) Comcast reaching certain milestones related to the construction and deployment of the LoRaWAN™ network, and (ii) the then current fair value of the Company’s common stock for the unvested Tranches of the Warrant. As a result of the pattern in which the cost was recognized, the Warrant created variability that made comparability between periods difficult. Due to the above reasons and the fact that the Warrant is now fully vested, when internally evaluating the Company’s performance, management has excluded the cost of the Warrant from net sales and gross margin. As a result, management believes that non-GAAP net sales and non-GAAP gross margin are useful additional supplemental information.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's comparable financial performance between periods. In addition, the Company’s management generally excludes the items noted above when managing and evaluating the performance of the business. The financial statements provided with this release include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP results for the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2018 and first quarter of fiscal year 2019, along with a reconciliation of forward-looking earnings per diluted share to its most comparable GAAP measure for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company is unable to include a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP measure of the non-GAAP tax rate to the corresponding GAAP measure as this is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded from this non-GAAP measure. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a potentially significant impact on our GAAP financial results. These additional non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, based on the Company’s current expectations, estimates and projections about its operations, industry, financial condition, performance, results of operations, and liquidity.
