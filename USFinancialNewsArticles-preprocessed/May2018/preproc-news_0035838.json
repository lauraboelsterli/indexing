    "text": "NEW YORK, May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Just weeks after obtaining a landmark injunction blocking the proposed sale of a majority stake of Xerox Corp. (\"Xerox\") to Fujifilm Holdings (\"Fuji\"), shareholders of Xerox have obtained an unprecedented settlement agreement terminating the Fuji deal outright.\nIn addition to the termination of the deal, the settlement terms include the resignation of a majority of the Xerox Board's directors and its CEO, appointments of new, independent directors and executive leadership, a fair and open future nomination process for directors, and a commitment to begin evaluating all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.\nRepresented by Co-Lead Counsel Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, Grant & Eisenhofer, and Kessler, Topaz, Meltzer & Check, Xerox shareholders brought suit in January 2018 after the Company announced a change-of-control transaction with Fuji. As alleged by the suing shareholders, the underpriced deal allowed Fuji to take control of 50.1% of the Company at an unfair price. Among other conflicts, the shareholders alleged that Xerox CEO Jeff Jacobson understood his job was in jeopardy and gave Fuji a sweetheart deal in exchange for a promise that he could run the combined company, all at Xerox shareholders' expense.\nLead plaintiffs for the class are the Asbestos Workers Philadelphia Pension Fund, Carpenters Pension Fund of Illinois, and the Iron Workers District Council of Philadelphia & Vicinity Benefit & Pension Plan.\nConflicted deal may serve as a watershed moment in governance\nOn April 27, the shareholders achieved a precedent-setting injunction against the deal from New York State Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager, who prohibited Xerox and Fuji from consummating the transaction on a preliminary basis. In an extraordinary opinion, Justice Ostrager noted that Fuji was contributing no cash for acquiring control of Xerox and that the proposed deal failed to pay Xerox shareholders a premium for selling control of the company. The Quote: : \"This transaction was largely negotiated by a massively conflicted CEO in breach of his fiduciary duties to further his self-interest and approved by a Board, more than half of whom were perpetuating themselves in office for five years without properly supervising Xerox's conflicted CEO.\"\nImportantly, the settlement with the Xerox Board does not resolve pending claims against Fuji, which Justice Ostrager found to have likely aided and abetted the board's breaches during the original, conflicted deal. Even though the proposed deal will not move forward, Fuji will continue to face substantial litigation risk for its conduct, as the new Xerox Board attempts to find an alternative suitor for Xerox or renegotiate a better deal with Fuji. Notably, Fuji and Xerox currently operate a joint venture that manufactures and distributes Xerox products in the Asia-Pacific region. As revealed when Xerox and Fuji announced the transaction, the contracts governing the joint venture contained previously undisclosed change-of-control provisions that created complications for any sale of Xerox to other strategic acquirors. By refusing to dismiss their claims against Fuji, lead plaintiffs aim to secure a more level playing field for all bidders and to help ensure that Fuji will not take further actions to disadvantage Xerox's shareholders for its own benefit.\nThe litigation and subsequent termination surrounding the tainted deal should have long-lasting legal implications, strongly encouraging boards to insure negotiations with potential buyers are conducted by non-conflicted parties.\n\"It took months of aggressive litigation to provide Xerox shareholders with the fair and open sales process they were entitled to all along. This settlement clearly shows the value that can be created when determined investors and their counsel act decisively to challenge corporate misconduct,\" said Mark Lebovitch, a partner with Bernstein Litowitz.\n\"We are optimistic that conditions have now been created that will enable a new value-maximizing transaction for Xerox shareholders to be achieved,: added James Sabella, a director at Grant & Eisenhofer.\nKessler Topaz partner Justin Reliford said: \"This litigation should serve as a warning to corporate fiduciaries who place their own interests ahead of the shareholders they serve. Undivided loyalty is a requirement of the job.\"\nThe case is captioned: In re Xerox Corp., Consolidated Shareholder Litigation; Index Number: 650766/18.\nAbout Bernstein Litowitz\nThe top-ranked securities litigation firm in the U.S. (ISS Securities Class Action Services), BLB&G has obtained over $31 billion on behalf of investors.
