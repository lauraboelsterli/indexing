    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc. (NASDAQ: OBCI) announced today its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nThe Company reported record first quarter 2018 net sales of $8.4 million compared to net sales of approximately $8.2 million in the first quarter 2017, an increase of approximately $163,000 or 2.0%.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $523,000, compared to net income of approximately $504,000 in the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per common share during the first quarter of 2018 was $0.06, compared to diluted earnings per common share of $0.05 for the first quarter of 2017.\n(In thousands except per share data)\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet sales\n$ 8,384\n$ 8,221\nPre-tax income\n$ 679\n$ 740\nNet income\n$ 523\n$ 504\nEarnings – per common share diluted\n$ 0.06\n$ 0.05\nDividends declared per common share\n$ 0.06\n$ 0.00\nMr. Dornau, the Company's President and CEO, commented: \"The 2018 first quarter record net sales do not fully reflect the many accomplishments and successes the Company had. The Company continued to increase sales of its newer line of chlorine dioxide products, with the placement of our branded NosGUARD product in a major national automotive retailer with approximately 5,000 retail stores. In addition, as previously reported, we commenced shipments to a national mass transit railroad company to supply Performacide ® for the sanitizing of their entire fleet of railroad cars. We also continued to see increased sales growth of our chlorine dioxide group of private label products thru one of our national distributors for use in commercial and residential fire, mold and water damage restoration markets. Additionally, we have seen significant growth in the hydroponics market for the control of both mold and mildew in greenhouses.\nIn the first quarter the Company expanded distribution of its enzyme fuel treatment product Star Tron ® to one of the world's largest retailers.\"\nMr. Dornau continued, \"We believe the extended unseasonably cold weather throughout most of the country negatively impacted our marine product sales in the first quarter of 2018. Sales to our major marine retail and wholesale distributors were lower compared to the prior period with the delay of the recreational boating season.\"\nMr. Dornau concluded, \"Despite the delay in the start of the recreational boating season, we continue to increase distribution of our products and brand awareness. We look forward to successful sales in the second quarter in the marine markets as the weather improves across the United States.\"\nJeff Barocas, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, stated: \"Our expansion project at the manufacturing, distribution and warehouse facilities of our Kinpak Inc. subsidiary is nearing completion. We are in the final phase of construction and anticipate being fully operational in the latter part of the second quarter. You can see an aerial view of our expanded facility on the cover of our 2017 Annual Report at www.oceanbiochem.com .\"\nAbout Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc.:\nOcean Bio-Chem, Inc. manufactures, markets and distributes a broad line of appearance and maintenance products for the marine, automotive, power sports, recreational vehicle and outdoor power equipment markets under the Star brite®, Star Tron®, Odor Star®, Outdoor Collection and other brand names within the United States of America and Canada.
