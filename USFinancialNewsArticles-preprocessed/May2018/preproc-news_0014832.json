    "text": "0 COMMENTS Managers at many mutual funds have one less thing to worry about after a Securities and Exchange Commission move this past week.\nThe SEC proposed a fix for an issue that could have forced some funds to change their auditors for conflict-of-interest reasons, which had the potential to be laborious and expensive.\nThe issue concerns the SEC’s rules governing how far an auditor can go in having a financial link to the funds they audit. Funds say the SEC’s existing rule on the matter is too broad and could have forced funds to change auditors even when it wasn’t warranted.\nThe issue first came to the fore in 2016 when fund giant Fidelity Management & Research Co. requested and was granted an exemption from the rule. Now, the SEC has proposed a series of changes to its auditor-independence rules to address the issue permanently.\n“It’s a huge step forward,” said Susan Ferris Wyderko, president and chief executive of the Mutual Fund Directors Forum, which represents independent directors of funds. “It’s a common-sense interpretation.”\nFidelity couldn’t be reached for comment; PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which audits some Fidelity funds, declined to comment.\nAn SEC spokesman couldn’t be reached for comment.\nUnder an SEC provision known as the Loan Rule, audit firms aren’t allowed to both audit a fund and borrow money from a lender that owns a stake of 10% or more in the same fund. The rule is meant to ensure that the audit firm is fully independent and can perform a tough, impartial audit.\nBut the mutual-fund industry, which had about $50 trillion in assets last year, has argued the Loan Rule encompasses business relationships that don’t jeopardize an audit firm’s independence.\nSome funds ran afoul of the Loan Rule, for instance, because some mutual-fund shares are held by bank-owned brokerages that keep the shares in omnibus accounts. These accounts can nominally give a bank a large stake in a mutual fund even though the shares actually are owned by many individual investors who deal with the broker. But if the banks also lent money to the audit firms, the Loan Rule could have been in play.\nUnder the new SEC proposal determining whether there is a conflict, the commission will now focus only on whether a lender is the beneficial owner of a fund’s shares, rather than just the owner of record.\nThe 10% threshold will be replaced by a standard of whether the owner of a fund’s shares exercises “significant influence” over it.\nThe SEC’s proposed changes will be open for public comment for 60 days.\nWrite to Michael Rapoport at Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com",
