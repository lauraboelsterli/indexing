But just in case you need another reason to snuggle your pet, here's one: Animals provide mental and health benefits that can serve you well in your professional life.\nEmployers like Google and Amazon have already caught on to this fact, and many workplaces are now pet-friendly. A number of billionaire tech titans are proud pet owners, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk .\nHere are three science-backed ways owning a pet can contribute to your success:\n1. They reduce stress Science indicates that pets can help lower stress levels and feelings of anxiety. In a study , participants were exposed to a stressful situation and tasked with stroking a rabbit, turtle or toy versions of said animals. The toys had no effect on relieving their stress but petting the actual animals did — even for those participants who initially said they don't like animals.\nGetty Images | Hero Images Studies show that pets provide a number of emotional and mental health benefits. In another study, dogs were found to reduce pre-exam stress levels in college students , and the American Heart Association released an official statement in 2013 noting that pet ownership diminishes stress.\nWhile many working adults are used to living in a constant state of stress, workplace and happiness researchers Annie McKee and Emma Seppälä say that it can take a heavy mental and emotional toll on you, eventually crippling your success .\n2. They boost your mood Pets can help deter feelings of sadness or mild depression because they keep loneliness at bay . Studies also show that playing with pets can promote a positive mood and causes your brain to release feel good neurotransmitters like oxytocin, which creates a sense of calmness, and serotonin , which regulates your mood.\nAnd a positive outlook on life is actually essential to success, according to Virgin Group founder Richard Branson . The billionaire says that he was able to build the multinational corporation because he didn't focus on the negative aspects of other airlines and what they were doing wrong.\nGetty Images Sir Richard Branson \"Positive thinking is [an] incredibly powerful tool,\" says Branson. \"Simply put: positive, proactive behavior spurs positive, proactive behavior.\"\n3. They help you socialize\nNot only do pets offer companionship, but they can help",
