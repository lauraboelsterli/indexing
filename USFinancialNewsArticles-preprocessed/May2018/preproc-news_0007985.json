indicators of performance, consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a commonly used non-GAAP measure when comparing our results with those of other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, , and earnout adjustments. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets primarily recognized in business combinations, as well as the effect of earnout gains and losses, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended (dollars in thousands) 3/31/2018 3/31/2017 % Change 3/31/2018 3/31/2017 % Change Net income $ 64,499 $ 40,357 59.8 % $ 249,340 $ 119,440 108.8 % Plus: Income taxes 29,729 14,790 101.0 % (21,749 ) 60,806 -135.8 % Interest income and expense, net 10,566 12,170 -13.2 % 32,769 37,088 -11.6 % Depreciation and amortization 17,717 17,703 0.1 % 53,563 53,898 -0.6 % Earnout adjustments 416 495 -16.0 % (1,597 ) 1,315 -221.4 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 122,927 $ 85,515 43.7 % $ 312,326 $ 272,547 14.6 % Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended (dollars in thousands) 3/31/2018 3/31/2017 % Change 3/31/2018 3/31/2017 % Change Revenue, as reported $ 1,124,100 $ 1,086,418 3.5 % $ 3,297,774 $ 3,217,228 2.5 % Adjusted EBITDA 122,927 85,515 43.7 % 312,326 272,547 14.6 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 10.9 % 7.9 % 9.5 % 8.5 %\nSelected Financial Data (Continued)\nReconciliation of Net Income Excluding the Impact of Tax Reform\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company views Net Income excluding the impact of Tax Reform, a non-GAAP measure, as an important indicator of performance, consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the Company’s performance. Net Income excluding the impact of Tax Reform is defined as GAAP Net Income adjusted to exclude the impact of Tax Reform. We believe this is an important calculation to show company performance without the benefits of Tax Reform. Management is incented to perform via metrics without the impact of Tax Reform.
