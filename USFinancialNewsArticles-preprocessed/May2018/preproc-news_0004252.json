GLOBAL TOP NEWS • U.S. Treasury Secretary says having good trade talks in China A U.S. trade delegation in China has been having very good conversations, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, as he heads into the second and likely last day of talks in Beijing. • Trading in Samsung Elec shares surges after stock split Shares in Samsung Electronics opened at 53,000 won each after a 50:1 stock split which makes it easier for retail investors to buy into the South Korean technology giant. • Ex-Volkswagen CEO Winterkorn charged in U.S. over diesel scandal The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday disclosed the filing of criminal charges against former Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German automaker's diesel emissions cheating. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading at 10,658.00, down 0.5 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee is expected to open higher against the dollar amid a minor pullback in the U.S. currency ahead of the closely watched non-farm payroll data. • Indian government bonds are likely to trade little changed ahead of a weekly debt auction today, amid concerns over overall demand. The yield on the benchmark 7.17% bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.71 percent - 7.76 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • The S&P 500 ended lower on Thursday after a choppy session as disappointing earnings reports from several companies offset strong economic data. • Asian shares stepped back while the Japanese yen held onto overnight gains as financial markets turned their attention to the looming U.S. payrolls data for fresh catalysts. • The dollar held steady against a basket of currencies, having retreated from four-month highs on profit-taking, with the focus on whether U.S. jobs data will provide the spark for another push higher. • U.S. Treasury yields slid on Thursday, pressured by falls in Europe after a surprising drop in euro zone inflation that could constrain the European Central Bank's efforts to unwind its monetary stimulus this year. • Oil prices held steady after shedding earlier gains, as market jitters kicked in over the prospect of geopolitical risks from possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran. • Gold prices were little changed as investors awaited key U.S. jobs data due later in the day, while the dollar held steady after declining from 2018 highs hit earlier this week.
