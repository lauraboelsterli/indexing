    "text": " 2:44 a.m. ET Share\nEric Greitens has resisted stepping down amid multiple criminal charges St. Louis Metropolitan Police Dept. via Reuters Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens appears in a police booking photo.\nBy Shayndi Raice\nMissouri’s Republican-held House and Senate called a special session to consider impeaching embattled GOP Gov. Eric Greitens.\nThe decision Thursday comes amid mounting pressure on the governor to resign over criminal charges that he tied up and photographed an undressed woman with whom he was having an affair, without having obtained her consent. He has also been charged with felony computer tampering over his alleged use of a charity donor list during his 2016 campaign. His trial begins in St. Louis on May 14.\nThe special session will begin on May 18 and could last for up to 30 days.\n“The process has monumental consequences, and the gravity of what we are commencing is not taken lightly,” said Senate Leader Ron Richard, a Joplin Republican. The legislators said the special session would give special committees assigned to investigate allegations against the governor more time to finish their work. During the session, the House can consider articles of impeachment, which would require a simple majority vote of 82 members before moving onto the Senate. The Senate would appoint judges to conduct an impeachment trial.",
