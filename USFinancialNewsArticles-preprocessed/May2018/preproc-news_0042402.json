    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 7:35 PM / Updated 31 minutes ago Former Indian central bank boss says won't apply for top BoE job\nLONDON (Reuters) - Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Wednesday he did not intend to apply for the job of governor of the Bank of England which is due to come vacant next year. FILE PHOTO: Then Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan listens to questions during a news conference at the RBI headquarters in Mumbai, India, August 9, 2016. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo\n“I have a very good job at the University of Chicago and I actually am an academic, not a professional central banker. I am very happy where I am,” Rajan told reporters after an event in London hosted by the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, where he is a finance professor.\n“I think I’ve said all I can say. I’m not going to apply for a job anywhere, absolutely.”\nAsked what he would do if he were approached to fill the role, he said he had already answered a similar question.\nRajan was the RBI’s governor until September 2016 and has been mentioned by analysts as a possible future BoE governor after Mark Carney - who previously headed Canada’s central bank - steps down at the end of June 2019.
