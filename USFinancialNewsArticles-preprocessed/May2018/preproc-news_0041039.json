The increase was primarily due to more fulfilled sales orders from customers for the three months ended March 31, 2018 than the same period in 2017.\nRevenues from other agricultural products increased by $0.79 million, or 20.9%, to $4.56 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $3.77 million for the same period of last year.

The increase was mainly due to the increase in sales volume of yew trees since the public realized the air purification function of the yew trees.\nGross profit and Gross Margin\nTotal cost of goods sold increased by $2.74 million, or 51.3%, to $8.08 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $5.34 million for the same period of last year.

The increase in selling and distribution expenses was also a result of increased promotion expenses as the Company enhanced its online sales promotions, partially offset by decreased rent expense of warehouse and salary expenses due to more effective cost control during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.33 million, or 51.5%, to $0.96 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $0.63 million for the same period of last year.
