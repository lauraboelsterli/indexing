    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MGX Minerals Inc. (“MGX” or the “Company”) (CSE:XMG) (OTCQB:MGXMF) (FSE:1MG) is pleased to announce it has acquired an additional 10,331.32 acres of Oil and Gas Leases (“Leases”) located within the Company’s unitized 80,380-acre Blueberry Unit (“Blueberry Unit”). The newly acquired leases are located within the proposed 3D seismic geophysical survey area, which is scheduled to commence in August and will include approximately 9,000 data points. To date the Company has conducted a paleontology survey and is nearing completion of the archeological survey.\nUnder terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Agreement”), MGX has the option to earn a Net Revenue Interest (“NRI”) on 9,158.4 gross/net acres within the Company’s area of mutual interest. Details of the Agreement are as follows:\nPurchase Price of US$145,000. An initial installment of $50,000 has been paid with the remaining installments due on September 5, 2018 ($50,000) and March 5, 2019 ($45,000). Seller delivered 83.0% NRI on 8,481.53 acres, and 82.5% on remaining 677.31 acres. On or before December 15, 2021, MGX will drill a well on the largest of the acquired leases to a TVD of 8,000' or to a depth sufficient to test the Cane Creek Shale (Cycle 21) of the Paradox Formation. MGX has the option to extend the drilling obligation for an additional three years in exchange for payment of an additional $100,000. MGX also has an option to acquire an additional lease covering 1,172.48 acres if and when that lease is issued by the BLM.\nThe Blueberry Unit (oil, gas and lithium) and Lisbon Valley Claims (lithium) now consists of approximately 115,000 acres of oil and gas leases and 118,000 acres of largely overlying and contiguous mineral claims. Brine content within the Lisbon Valley oilfield have been historically reported as high as 730 ppm lithium (Superior Oil 88-21P).\nThe Project is being simultaneously explored for oil, gas, lithium and other brine minerals to determine locations for deployment of the Company’s lithium and mineral extraction technology.\nBlueberry Unit\nMGX is currently earning a 75% working interest in the Project, with the remaining interest primarily controlled by the Paradox Partner. The Paradox Partner has been engaged by MGX as subcontracted operator of the Project. The Project is host to National Instrument (N.I) 51-101 estimated prospective resources (the “Estimate”) consisting of leasehold and royalty interests in San Juan County, Utah and Miguel County. Colorado. The estimate was prepared by the Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”), an independent qualified reserves evaluator within the meaning of N.I. 51-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (“NI 51-101”), with an effective date of June 30, 2017. The Estimate was prepared in accordance with N.I. 51-101 and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation.\nEstimated Gross Volumes Unrisked Prospective (Recoverable) Hydrocarbon Resources Leasehold Interest in San Juan County, Utah and San Miguel County, Colorado of MGX MINERALS INC.
