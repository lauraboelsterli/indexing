    "text": "FCC says net neutrality rules will end in June Published 4 Hours Ago Getty Images Federal Communication Commission Chairman Ajit Pai\nThe Federal Communications Commission said in a notice Thursday that 2015 landmark U.S. open internet rules will cease around June 10.\nThe FCC in December repealed the Obama era \"net neutrality\" rules, which will allow internet providers to block or slow websites as long as they disclose the practice. The FCC said the new rules take effect 30 days from Friday, which is around June 10.\nA group of states and others have filed suit to try to block the new rules from taking effect. The revised rules were a win for providers like AT&T and Comcast , but are opposed by internet firms like Facebook and Alphabet .\n( Disclosure: Comcast is parent of NBCUniversal and CNBC. ) Related Securities ",
