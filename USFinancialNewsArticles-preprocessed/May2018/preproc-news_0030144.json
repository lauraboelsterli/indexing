    "text": "Pittsburgh’s Jordy Mercer got hit by a Tony Watson pitch with the based loaded in the eighth inning Saturday to give the Pirates their fifth straight win, 6-5 over the visiting San Francisco Giants.\nIt was 5-5 when Josh Bell opened the eighth with a double and moved to third on Corey Dickerson’s groundout. Watson intentionally walked Francisco Cervelli, and pinch hitter David Freese loaded the bases with an infield single.\nWatson (1-2) then hit Mercer in the left leg to bring home Bell.\nSan Francisco has lost a season-worst six straight.\nPirates starter Chad Kuhl gave up three runs and six hits in six innings, with six strikeouts and four walks. Closer Felipe Vazquez (2-0) got the final five outs.\nSan Francisco starter Jeff Samardzija had his longest outing of the season, allowing five runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings, with five strikeouts and two walks.\nAfter the start of the game was delayed about 90 minutes by rain, the Pirates took a 2-0 lead in the first on Bell’s sacrifice fly and Corey Dickerson’s RBI single.\nSan Francisco tied it in the second. Evan Longoria hit a first-pitch home run, his eighth, to left-center to make it 2-1. One out later, Alen Hanson hit his fourth homer, a line drive to right, to make it 2-2.\nThe Giants took their first lead of the series in the third when Andrew McCutchen led off by stretching a single into a double and later scored on Brandon Crawford’s sacrifice fly, making it 3-2.\nGregory Polanco planted a ball just over the wall in right-center, his eighth homer, with one out in the third for a 3-3 tie.\nCervelli hit a two-out, two-run homer in the sixth after Bell reached on a base hit for a 5-3 Pirates lead.\nIn the seventh, McCutchen hit a one-out double and scored on Brandon Belt’s two-out single to pull the Giants to within 5-4.\nIn the eighth, Austin Jackson tied it 5-5 with a double off the wall in left, driving in Hanson, who had a one-out single. Hanson left the game after scoring because of an unspecified injury he apparently suffered running the bases.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
