Her hire follows the departure of PJ Bye who retired from HSBC at the end of 2017.\nIn January, HSBC combined the SSA and financial institutions (FIG) syndicate desks for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region under the joint leadership of Asif Sherani and Mark Pearce.\nSharaka will work with Sherani.
