    "text": "MT-3724 Phase Ib Ongoing; Combination Studies Expected to Start in 2H18\nAUSTIN, Texas, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Molecular Templates, Inc. (Nasdaq:MTEM) (“Molecular”), a clinical-stage oncology company focused on the discovery and development of the company’s proprietary engineered toxin bodies (ETBs), which are differentiated, targeted, biologic therapeutics for cancer, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $49.3 million. Molecular’s current cash balance is expected to fund operations into late 2019.\n“We are very pleased with the clinical results we have generated to date for MT-3724, which we expect to enter Phase II studies in relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients in the second half of 2018,” said Eric Poma, Ph.D., CEO and CSO of Molecular Templates. “In the next twelve months, we expect our clinical pipeline to expand significantly as we file INDs for MT-4019 as well as our ETBs targeting HER2 and PD-L1.”\nCompany Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nCorporate\nAt the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting in April 2018, preclinical data were presented for Molecular’s ETBs targeting PD-L1 (which incorporates Molecular’s Antigen Seeding Technology – a differentiated immune-oncology approach) and HER2. On March 2, 2018, Molecular closed a $10 million debt facility with Perceptive Advisors. The proceeds were used to repay an existing debt facility with Silicon Valley Bank and will support Molecular’s build out of its GMP manufacturing facility, to support Molecular’s own pipeline as well as partnerships. The first tranche of $5 million was received in 1Q18 and the second tranche of $5 million is due to be received in 3Q18.\nMT-3724\nMT-3724 (an ETB targeting CD20) is in an ongoing Phase Ib expansion study intended to better define the single agent overall response rate in heavily pre-treated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients with additional updates expected in 2Q18. Molecular also expects to initiate Phase II combination studies with MT-3724 in earlier lines of DLBCL in 2H18.\nMT-4019\nMT-4019 (an ETB candidate designed to target CD38-expressing myeloma cancer cells) is progressing through IND enabling studies. Takeda and Molecular are evaluating CD38 ETBs and could potentially select a drug candidate for development by the end of 3Q18. If the two companies do not select a joint candidate for development, Molecular anticipates filing an IND application for MT-4019 in 3Q18 and initiating a Phase I clinical trial in 2H18.\nResearch\nMolecular expects to file an IND application for an ETB targeting HER2 in 4Q18. Molecular expects to file an IND application for an ETB targeting PD-L1 (with antigen seeding) in 1Q19. Several other ETB candidates are in pre-clinical development, targeting both solid and hematological cancers.\nTakeda Multi-Target Collaboration\nIn December 2017, Takeda selected two targets for further research using Molecular’s ETBs. This triggered $4 million in milestone payments, which were paid by Takeda in 2Q18.\nFinancial Results\nThe net loss attributable to common shareholders for the first quarter was $8.7 million, or $0.32 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $1.6 million, or $7.56 per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2017.\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.5 million, compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were comprised of grant revenue from the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas, and revenues from collaborative research and development agreements. Total research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $6.7 million, compared with $1.1 million for the same period in 2017. Total general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.9 million, compared with $1.8 million for the same period in 2017.\nAbout Molecular Templates\nMolecular Templates is a clinical-stage oncology company focused on the discovery and development of differentiated, targeted, biologic therapeutics for cancer. We believe our proprietary biologic drug platform technology, referred to as engineered toxin bodies, or ETBs, provides a differentiated mechanism of action that may address some of the limitations associated with currently available cancer therapeutics. ETBs utilize a genetically engineered form of Shiga-like Toxin A subunit, or SLTA, a ribosome inactivating bacterial protein, that can be targeted to specifically destroy cancer cells.
