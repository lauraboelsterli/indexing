    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trevali Mining Corporation (“ Trevali ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX:TV) (BVL:TV) (OTCQX:TREVF) (Frankfurt:4TI) reports its majority-owned subsidiary Rosh Pinah Zinc Corporation (Proprietary) Limited (“ RPZC ”) in Namibia will, subject to receipt of Companies Registration Office and Registrar approval, undertake a partial share buy-back of issued RPZC shares under agreements with its Namibian shareholders.\nRPZC will acquire issued shares tendered under the agreements for an aggregate amount of approximately NAD291,000,000 (approximately USD$24,260,000). The tendered shares will subsequently be cancelled by RPZC’s treasury.\nFollowing the cancellation of the tendered shares, Trevali’s effective beneficial ownership in RPZC will increase from approximately 80 percent to approximately 90 percent.\nRPZC Beneficial Ownership Structure:\nGroup Beneficial RPZC Ownership (Pre-Transaction) Beneficial RPZC Ownership (Post-Transaction) Trevali 80 % 90 % Namibian shareholders 20 % 10 % “We welcome this opportunity to strengthen our involvement in Rosh Pinah, which globally is an upper-quartile zinc deposit in terms of grade and tonnage,” stated Dr. Mark Cruise, Trevali’s President and CEO. “Following our recent mineral reserve and resource updates at Rosh Pinah, which remains open for expansion, we have commissioned an independent engineering study examining potential production optionality given the deposit’s almost 50-year history of resource-reserve replacement and growth. Trevali views its operations and investment in Namibia as a long-term relationship to the mutual benefit of all groups involved.”\nRosh Pinah remains on-track for its 2018 production guidance (1) of 105-115 million pounds of payable zinc, 5.7-6.0 million pounds payable lead and 123,000-129,000 ounces of payable silver, on a 100 percent basis. Key strategic improvements started in late-2017 produced significant improvements in overall performance and has positioned the site well for the year with increasing metal output planned for the second half of 2018 as higher-grade stopes are sequenced.\n(1) Constitutes forward-looking information; see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.\nABOUT TREVALI MINING CORPORATION\nTrevali is a zinc-focused, base metals company with four mines: the wholly-owned Santander mine in Peru, the wholly-owned Caribou mine in the Bathurst Mining Camp of northern New Brunswick, its 80% owned Rosh Pinah mine in Namibia and its 90% owned Perkoa mine in Burkina Faso.\nThe shares of Trevali are listed on the TSX (symbol TV), the OTCQX (symbol TREVF), the Lima Stock Exchange (symbol TV), and the Frankfurt Exchange (symbol 4TI).
