In addition, the transaction also received U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance, U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval, and U.S. Federal Communications Commission consent Tentative deal with the Power Workers' Union (PWU) demonstrates management's commitment to building relationships with union leadership through alignment of business goals in agreement negotiations New methodology and proactive approach to storm restoration efforts results in all-time Company record for speed of service restoration after nearly 500,000 customers lost power in mid-April ice storm Senior management further strengthened by the announcements of accomplished leaders in the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Corporate Development Officer roles\n\"The first quarter demonstrated Hydro One's true potential through strong execution and an unwavering determination to succeed,\" said Mayo Schmidt, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hydro One. \"The Company's growing list of achievements is a result of our leadership team's uncompromising commitment to customer service and storm restoration, as well as their resolve in driving excellence to deliver cost savings through productivity improvement plans that will flow back to customers and shareholders. Finally, our all-party, all-issues settlement agreements in three states and anti-trust clearance show significant progress in achieving milestones to combine with Avista.\"\nSelected Consolidated Financial and Operating Highlights\nThree months ended March 31,\n(amounts throughout in millions of Canadian dollars, except as otherwise noted)\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\n1,576\n1,658\nPurchased power\n751\n889\nRevenues, net of purchased power 1\n825\n769\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n222\n167\nIncome related to acquisition of Avista\n(12)\nâ€”\nAdjusted net income attributable to common shareholders 1\n210\n167\nBasic earnings per common share (EPS)\n$0.37\n$0.28\nDiluted EPS\n$0.37\n$0.28\nAdjusted basic EPS 1\n$0.35\n$0.28\nAdjusted diluted EPS 1\n$0.35\n$0.28\nNet cash from operating activities\n376\n471\nCapital investments\n305\n350\nAssets placed in-service\n145\n228\nTransmission: Average monthly Ontario 60-minute peak demand (MW)\n19,815\n19,795\nDistribution: Electricity distributed to Hydro One customers (GWh)\n7,406\n6,967\n1\nNon-GAAP Measures - Hydro One uses financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP) and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. Hydro One calculated the non-GAAP measures by adjusting certain US GAAP measures for specific items that impact comparability but which the Company does not consider part of normal, ongoing operations. Refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section of the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of these items.\nKey Financial Highlights\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $222 million (2017 - $167 million), a 32.9% increase from last year, and EPS of $0.37 (2017 - $0.28). Adjusted EPS, which exclude the impact of $12 million income related to the Avista acquisition, was $0.35 for the quarter.\nRevenues, net of purchased power, for the first quarter were higher than last year by 7.3%. This increase reflects higher transmission revenues driven by the OEB's decision on the 2017-2018 transmission rates filing, and increased transmission and distribution revenues due to higher energy consumption resulting from seasonal weather.\nThe comparability of first quarter earnings was positively impacted by higher transmission revenues driven by the timing of OEB's decision on the 2017-2018 transmission rate filing, lower corporate support costs, which were partially offset by costs relating to Hydro One's response to the Northeastern storms; and lower financing charges primarily due to revaluation of the deal-contingent foreign exchange forward contract, partially offset by interest on the Convertible Debentures issued in August 2017.\nHydro One continues to invest in the reliability and performance of Ontario's electricity transmission and distribution systems, address aging power system infrastructure, facilitate connectivity to new generation sources, and improve service to customers. The Company made capital investments of $305 million during the first quarter, and placed $145 million worth of new assets in-service.\nSelected Operating Highlights\nManagement's focus on delivering industry-leading customer service further contributed to the rising trend of distribution customer satisfaction, now up six percentage points to 74% over the same period last year.\nOn March 1, the Company successfully completed the integration of 400 contact centre employees, who were previously contracted out, to advance Hydro One's renewed customer-centric service culture. Critically, contact centre performance metrics rose during the transition. When compared with the end of 2017, first quarter results for overall customer satisfaction with calls rose by four points to 94%, customer issues resolved on the first call jumped four points to 89%, and billing accuracy reached 99.7%.\nThe Company was also recognized with two Achieving Communications Excellence awards from the Canadian Public Relations Society for its meaningful community engagement projects.\nHydro One and Avista have achieved numerous key milestones in the regulatory approval process for the proposed merger, including all-party, all-issues settlement agreements filed in Washington in March, and Alaska and Idaho in April. A settlement in principle with all parties in the Oregon proceeding was reached in May. The settlement agreements remain subject to approval by the respective commissions. The companies also achieved approval from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January, antitrust clearance under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in April, and consent from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in May. Hydro One and Avista continue to anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2018.\nThe Company continues to drive a company-wide productivity improvement initiative resulting in additional cost savings in the first quarter, with a significant portion of savings culminating from more competitive procurement practices. Adopting industry best practices and streamlined processes, the Company is sourcing materials and services at lower costs compared to previous years.\nHydro One and PWU reached a tentative settlement of a two-year collective agreement covering approximately 4,000 employees in critical front line roles. This agreement recognizes the significant contributions employees make in maintaining the supply of power across the province while delivering value to customers and shareholders. Union members will now vote on this tentative agreement with the outcome anticipated by the end of the second quarter of 2018.\nThe Company continued to build its reputation at home and abroad for storm relief and operational excellence. In January, the Company received an Emergency Assistance Award from the Edison Electric Institute for support efforts following Hurricane Irma in Florida last September. In March, it mobilized nearly 175 employees to help restore power following a storm in Boston and Baltimore that left approximately one million people without power. Following a severe rain, ice and wind storm that hit Ontario in mid-April, the Company restored power to nearly 500,000 customers in four days. Through a new approach to storm planning and response execution, this set a new Company record for restoration time by surpassing the previous six-day effort from the last, large scale ice storm in March 2016.\nThe Company further strengthened its leadership team by adding proven, experienced, highly-regarded executives.\nPatrick Meneley joined Hydro One as Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Development Officer on March 1. Meneley was most recently EVP, Wholesale Banking at TD Bank Group and Vice Chair and Head of Global Corporate and Investment Banking for TD Securities. At Hydro One, he assumes responsibility for leading strategy, innovation and mergers and acquisitions.\nThe Company also welcomed Paul Dobson as Chief Financial Officer March 1. Dobson was most recently CFO for Direct Energy Ltd. in Houston, Texas, where he was responsible for overall financial leadership of a $15 billion revenue business with three million customers in Canada and the U.S. Dobson took over the finance, treasury, controller, audit, technology and regulation functions.\nCommon Share Dividends\nFollowing the conclusion of the first quarter, on May 14, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of $0.23 per share to be paid on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 12, 2018. This represents a dividend increase of 5% since the last increase in May 2017. This second annual consecutive increase reflects the Company's expectation of continued long-term earnings growth and demonstrates the true potential of Hydro One through strong management.\nSupplemental Segment Information\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(millions of dollars)\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\nTransmission\n421\n367\nDistribution\n1,145\n1,279\nOther\n10\n12\nTotal revenues\n1,576\n1,658\nRevenues, net of purchased power\nTransmission\n421\n367\nDistribution\n394\n390\nOther\n10\n12\nTotal revenues, net of purchased power\n825\n769\nIncome (loss) before financing charges and taxes\nTransmission\n213\n164\nDistribution\n157\n153\nOther\n(12)\n(14)\nTotal income before financing charges and taxes\n358\n303\nCapital investments\nTransmission\n190\n209\nDistribution\n114\n138\nOther\n1\n3\nTotal capital investments\n305\n350\nAssets placed in-service\nTransmission\n38\n82\nDistribution\n105\n146\nOther\n2\n0\nTotal assets placed in-service\n145\n228\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the Company's first quarter 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).
