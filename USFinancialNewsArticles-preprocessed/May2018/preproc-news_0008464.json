As defined, core earnings include interest income and expense as well as realized losses on interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk. Management believes that the presentation of core earnings is useful to investors because it can provide a useful measure of comparability to our other REIT peers, but has important limitations. We believe core earnings as described above helps evaluate our financial performance without the impact of certain transactions but is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, core earnings should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net income or net income per basic share computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides GAAP measures of net income and net income per basic share available to common stockholders for the periods presented and details with respect to reconciling the line items to core earnings and related per average basic common share amounts:\nFor the Quarters Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) GAAP Net income available to common stockholders $ 229,607 $ 98,208 $ 129,832 $ 105,617 $ 157,524 Adjustments: Net other-than-temporary credit impairment losses 1,158 18,179 11,468 13,509 18,701 Net unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives (81,419 ) (28,074 ) (9,204 ) (5,802 ) (4,896 ) Net unrealized (gains) losses on financial instruments at fair value (14,466 ) 47,637 (19,042 ) (67,762 ) (72,243 ) Net realized (gains) losses on sales of investments — 586 (1 ) (4,541 ) (5,167 ) (Gains) losses on extinguishment of debt (9,670 ) (12,742 ) 1 48,014 — Realized (gains) losses on terminations of interest rate swaps — — — 16,143 — Net realized (gains) losses on Futures (1) (16,424 ) (8,204 ) 3,267 6,914 2,084 Core Earnings $ 108,786 $ 115,590 $ 116,321 $ 112,092 $ 96,003 GAAP net income per basic common share $ 1.22 $ 0.52 $ 0.69 $ 0.56 $ 0.84 Core earnings per basic common share (2) $ 0.58 $ 0.62 $ 0.62 $ 0.60 $ 0.51 (1) Included in net realized gains (losses) on derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Realized losses on our interest rate swaps are the periodic net settlement payments made or received. For the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures throughout this section, interest expense includes net payments on our interest rate swaps, which is presented as a part of Realized gains (losses) on derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest rate swaps are used to manage the increase in interest paid on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment. Presenting the net contractual interest payments on interest rate swaps with the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities reflects our total contractual interest payments. We believe this presentation is useful to investors because it depicts the economic value of our investment strategy by showing actual interest expense and net interest income. Where indicated, interest expense, including interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic interest expense. Where indicated, net interest income reflecting interest payments on interest rate swaps, is referred to as economic net interest income.\nThe following table reconciles the GAAP and non-GAAP measurements reflected in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGAAP\nInterest\nIncome\nGAAP\nInterest\nExpense\nNet Realized\nLosses on\nInterest\nRate\nSwaps\nEconomic\nInterest\nExpense\nGAAP\nNet\nInterest\nIncome\nNet\nRealized\nLosses on\nInterest\nRate\nSwaps\nOther (1) Economic\nNet\nInterest\nIncome\nFor the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 $ 297,132 $ 149,251 $ 2,612 $ 151,863 $ 147,881 $ (2,612 ) $ 143 $ 145,412 For the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 $ 301,957 $ 144,204 $ 4,369 $ 148,573 $ 157,753 $ (4,369 ) $ (61 ) $ 153,323 For the Quarter Ended September 30, 2017 $ 296,813 $ 140,358 $ 3,489 $ 143,847 $ 156,455 $ (3,489 ) $ (167 ) $ 152,799 For the Quarter Ended June 30, 2017 $ 288,644 $ 137,955 $ 3,486 $ 141,441 $ 150,689 $ (3,486 ) $ (350 ) $ 146,853 For the Quarter Ended March 31, 2017\n$ 251,344 $ 110,231 $ 4,106 $ 114,337 $ 141,113 $ (4,106 ) $ (519 ) $ 136,488 (1) Primarily interest income on cash and cash equivalents.\nThe table below shows our average earning assets held, interest earned on assets, yield on average interest earning assets, average debt balance, economic interest expense, economic average cost of funds, economic net interest income, and net interest rate spread for the periods presented.\nFor the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands) (dollars in thousands) Average\nBalance Interest Average\nYield/Cost Average\nBalance Interest Average\nYield/Cost Assets: Interest-earning assets (1) : Agency MBS $ 3,880,870 $ 33,342 3.4 % $ 3,730,939 $ 27,632 3.0 % Non-Agency RMBS 1,150,135 22,004 7.7 % 1,372,359 30,205 8.8 % Non-Agency RMBS transferred to consolidated VIEs 896,139 52,107 23.3 % 1,141,388 60,134 21.1 % Residential mortgage loans held for investment 13,265,821 189,822 5.7 % 9,091,646 132,854 5.8 % Total $ 19,192,965 $ 297,275 6.2 % $ 15,336,332 $ 250,825 6.5 % Liabilities and stockholders' equity: Interest-bearing liabilities: Repurchase agreements collateralized by: Agency MBS (2)\n$ 3,253,529 $ 16,140 2.0 % $ 3,120,531 $ 11,473 1.5 % Non-Agency RMBS 411,143 3,025 2.9 % 745,920 5,532 3.0 % Re-Remic repurchase agreements 828,745 7,727 3.7 % 605,366 4,669 3.1 % RMBS from loan securitizations 2,763,631 25,358 3.7 % 1,328,324 9,978 3.0 % Securitized debt, collateralized by Non-Agency RMBS 200,374 2,825 5.6 % 318,756 5,012 6.3 % Securitized debt, collateralized by loans 9,185,049 96,788 4.2 % 7,121,397 77,673 4.4 % Total $ 16,642,471 $ 151,863 3.7 % $ 13,240,294 $ 114,337 3.5 % Economic net interest income/net interest rate spread $ 145,412 2.5 % $ 136,488 3.0 % Net interest-earning assets/net interest margin $ 2,550,494 3.0 % $ 2,096,038 3.6 % Ratio of interest-earning assets to interest bearing liabilities 1.15 1.16 (1) Interest-earning assets at amortized cost (2) Interest includes cash paid on swaps The table below shows our Net Income, Economic Net Interest Income and Core Earnings, each as a percentage of average equity.
