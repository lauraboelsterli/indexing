(OTCQB:FALC), a market leader in storage software, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased with our Q1 performance and resultant financial results, which continued the return to profitability delivered in Q3 and Q4 of 2017,” stated Todd Brooks, CEO of FalconStor. “Our products play a key role in efficiently managing and protecting critical data within enterprises around the world. Given our improved financial stability and continually improving operational efforts, our focus for the balance of 2018 will shift to further product innovation and strategic growth.”\nFinancial Overview:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Change\nPeriod to Period ( in millions except per share data) 2018 2017 Total revenue $ 5.0 100 % $ 6.0 100 % $ (1.0 ) (17 )% Total cost of revenue $ 0.8 15 % $ 1.5 24 % $ (0.7 ) (48 )% Total operating expenses $ 3.7 74 % $ 5.7 95 % $ (2.1 ) (36 )% Operating income (loss) (GAAP) $ 0.6 11 % $ (1.1 ) (19 )% $ 1.7 * Net income (loss) (GAAP) $ 0.5 10 % $ (1.1 ) (18 )% $ 1.6 * Diluted EPS GAAP $ (0.05 ) $ (0.03 ) $ (0.02 ) For the three months ended March 31, 2018 we delivered net GAAP operating income of $0.6 million on revenues of $5.0 million. Included in operating results above for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $0.0 million and $0.4 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively.\nDeferred revenue at March 31, 2018 was $13.1 million, compared with $18.4 million at December 31, 2017.

Our cash balance at March 31, 2018 was $4.6 million, compared with $1.0 million at December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended, ( in millions except per share data) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Revenue $ 5.0 $ 6.3 $ 6.0 Bookings $ 5.0 $ 5.7 $ 5.5 Non-GAAP Expenses $ 4.6 $ 4.7 $ 7.0 Non-GAAP Gross Margin 85 % 83 % 77 % Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) $ 0.4 $ 1.5 $ (0.9 ) Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) $ 0.3 $ 1.5 $ (0.9 ) Non-GAAP Diluted EPS $ — $ 0.03 $ (0.02 ) Cash (used in) provided by operations $ 1.2 $ (1.0 ) $ 0.1 Non-GAAP results exclude the effects of stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and the effects of our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock.

The Company’s management refers to these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures (which should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, their comparable GAAP measures) in this press release because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency into the supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude (i) restructuring costs, (ii) effects of our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, and (iii) non-cash stock-based compensation charges and any potential tax effects. For a reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, please refer to our Non-GAAP Operating Data GAAP Reconciliation, presented in this release.\nAbout FalconStor Software\nFalconStor Software, Inc.
