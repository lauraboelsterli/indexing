Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Given the intensity of conversation and capital formation, one might think that the age of the blockchain is well-established. Yet blockchain adoption by corporations is at the earliest stage, according to a survey from Gartner Inc.\nOnly 1% of 3,138 chief information officers at companies surveyed by Gartner last year said they had “any kind of blockchain adoption” within their organizations, according to results released by the IT research firm Thursday. CIO Journal’s Angus Loten has the story . Gartner Fellow David Furlonger tells him there were multiple issues preventing adoption, including the “immaturity of underlying technical components,” a lack of adequate technical and business governance models, and implementation and integration challenges.\nStill, Mr. Furlonger warned that blockchain is a transformative technology, and businesses that give up on it entirely risked being left behind.\nTECHNOLOGY NEWS\nToyota Motor and General Motors back a Wi-Fi-based technology known as DSRC for vehicle connectivity, while Ford Motor and BMW support fast-tracking fifth-generation cellular broadband. WILLY KURNIAWAN/REUTERS 5G race pits Ford, BMW against GM, Toyota. General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. support a Wi-Fi-based technology known as DSRC, or dedicated short-range communication, that allows cars to link to “smart” traffic lights designed to smooth congestion and provide warnings about accidents or poor weather conditions ahead. The WSJ’s Chester Dawson reports that Ford Motor Co ., BMW AG and other auto makers are pressing the Trump administration to allow them to leapfrog that system by fast-tracking fifth-generation cellular broadband in automobiles.\nFlood of trademark applications from China alarms U.S. officials. Patent and trademark officials tell the Journal’s Jacob Gershman that cash incentives could be a factor. As part of a national effort to ramp up intellectual-property ownership, China’s provincial governments are paying citizens hundreds of dollars in Chinese currency for each trademark registered in the U.S. Officials say many China filings appear to be rife with false information.\nWalmart bets $15 Billion for 75% stake in India e-commerce giant. If the union with Flipkart Group works, Walmart Inc. would be well-positioned for e-commerce in the world’s second-most-populous nation, the WSJ reports . Flipkart says it has more than 100 million customers.\nGDPR is the latest sign of the EU’s growing power in global regulation. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, which takes effect later this month, has prompted a number of tech companies to change their data collecting habits, and not just for users in Europe, the WSJ’s Daniel Michaels reports . Apple Inc. , Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. say they have updated their global privacy rules in anticipation of the new law.\nHouse Democrats plan to release 3,000 Russian-linked Facebook ads. The Democrats are preparing to soon release the ads, which Facebook identified as bought by the pro-Kremlin Internet Research Agency, the WSJ’s Deepa Seetharaman reports . The cache will show the images of the ads, which groups the ads targeted, how much they cost and how many Facebook users viewed them.\nSolution to privacy? Give Facebook and Google more of our data. With personal information often outside the user’s control, one solution could be creating a central authority to manage all data, suggests WSJ tech columnist Christopher Mims . Giving companies like Facebook and Alphabet Inc. ‘s Google even more data might seem like the opposite of protecting it. But both companies already have the start of the infrastructure required to support such a massive undertaking.\nRobocalls are getting worse. Robocalls hit an estimated 3.4 billion in April, an increase of 900 million over the previous year, the New York Times reports. One reason for the flood: the dismissal in court of a federal definition of an auto dialer. The Federal Communications Commission has yet to deliver new guidance.\nHow Cambridge Analytica turned clicks into votes . The Guardian talks to former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie about how the company transformed data collected from 32,000 U.S. voters taking a personality test into a data set of millions with hundreds of data points per person.\nWho’s Guarding Facebook’s data? Until 2014, when Facebook limited third-party apps like quizzes from obtaining user information, academics were able to compile profiles of users with techniques similar to those employed by Aleksandr Kogan, the psychology professor, at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica affair. There’s no guarantee that such data was properly secured and some academics tell the New York Times that data could have been copied and sold to marketers or political consulting firms.\nFacebook opens AI labs in Pittsburgh, Seattle. And with the openings, the company is putting pressure on local universities in search of the same talent to drive their own efforts, the New York Times reports . Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon already recognized a talent exit in 2015 when Uber Technologies Inc. opened a self-driving lab in the city.\nZTE asks for stay of U.S. ban on selling to company. ZTE Corp. , the Chinese telecommunications firm in the crossfire of a U.S.-China trade fight, has asked the U.S. government for a stay of its order banning American companies from selling to the firm, the Journal’s Dan Strumpf reports . ZTE relies on U.S. companies for a number of crucial parts, including semiconductors for its phones and components used in its telecommunications equipment.\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nFood giant Nestlé is taking over Starbucks retail marketing and sales business, agreeing to pay more than $7 billion for the rights to sell the chain’s coffee, tea and food products in grocery stores and other outlets. (WSJ)\nThe Trump administration’s proposed changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement seeks to force Mexican factories to pay more for labor—or send auto jobs back to the U.S. or Canada. (WSJ)\nOil prices rallied to a three and a half year high on Monday, with the U.S. benchmark breaking above $70 a barrel . (WSJ)\nLava and toxic gases continued to spew in neighborhoods from Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano, with 26 homes destroyed since the eruption began on Thursday and authorities ordering evacuations of 1,800 people .
