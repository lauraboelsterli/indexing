REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\nThe restriction on the stake sale in GM Korea was one of tools that will prevent GM from leaving the South Korean market, the nation’s Finance Minister, Kim Dong-yeon, told a press conference.\nThe Detroit car maker and state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) have agreed on $7.15 billion of investments, including a $2.8 billion debt-for-equity swap for existing loans GM Korea owed to its parent, to rescue the unit. GM and KDB will sign a binding deal on May 11, the minister said. Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin, Writing by Ju-min Park; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman",
