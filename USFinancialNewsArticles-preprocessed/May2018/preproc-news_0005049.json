FILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\nPfizer shares, which have struggled to benefit from the surge in stock market prices since Donald Trump’s election in 2016, dipped just over 1 percent in response to the results.\nThe company said that Ibrance had raked in sales of $933 million (683 million pounds) in the first quarter, up 37.4 percent from a year earlier but missing analysts’ estimates of $956.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThat likely reflects strong competition from Novartis’ ( NOVN.S ) Kisqali and Lilly’s ( LLY.N ) recently approved Verzenio.\nXeljanz, which is approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, posted sales of $326 million, well below $398.5 million expected by analysts.\nPfizer, which is exploring options for a consumer healthcare business that some estimates value at $20 billion, said it expected to make a decision in 2018 on any sale of a business which includes Centrum vitamins and Advil painkillers.\nQuarterly profit topped Wall Street estimates on stronger-than-expected sales of pneumonia vaccine Prevnar and the company also reaffirmed its 2018 forecast.\nNet profit rose to $3.56 billion, or 59 cents per share, in the latest quarter ended April 1 from $3.12 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, topping estimates of 74 cents.\nTotal revenue rose 1 percent to $12.91 billion, while analysts were expecting $13.13 billion.\nThe company holds a conference call with analysts at 10 a.m. eastern time to discuss the results.
