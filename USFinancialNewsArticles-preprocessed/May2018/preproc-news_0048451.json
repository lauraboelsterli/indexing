    "text": "7 COMMENTS The Federal Bureau of Investigation moved to dismantle a large network of hacked routers and storage devices that Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO -0.25% and U.S. and Ukraine authorities said could be used to launch a massive cyberattack or knock hundreds of thousands of internet users offline.\nThe FBI said late Wednesday that it has seized control of the internet domain that was used by the computer network’s “command and control” server to issue instructions to infected devices. The agency said it has begun an effort to clean up the estimated half-million infected devices.\nThat effort will take some time, security researchers say. Researchers and Ukranian authorities warned earlier that the network could be used to launch an attack timed to the final match in soccer’s UEFA Champions League competition taking place Saturday in Kiev.\nThe hacked devices, which span 54 countries, are infected with sophisticated software called VPNFilter that can install other software or even internal changes that render the devices unusable , according to Craig Williams, a security researcher with Cisco.\nThe network had grown quietly since 2016 but expanded rapidly within Ukraine around May 8, with systems in the country now making up about half of the infected machines on the network, Mr. Williams said Wednesday before the FBI’s announcement.\n“They’re clearly targeting Ukraine,” he said. “The fact that we saw this being spun up so quickly is evidence that something is being planned.”\nUkrainian authorities, in an earlier statement, said they believed this could be a precursor to a cyberattack by Russia targeted to the Champions League final.\nA representative from the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., didn’t respond to requests for further comment.\nUkraine has blamed Russia for a wave of disruptive cyberattacks that have shut down electricity and hacked computers across the country over the past three years. Ukraine was the main target of last year’s Petya computer virus, cybersecurity researchers believe, an attack launched shortly before a national holiday celebrating the adoption of Ukraine’s constitution.\nEarlier this year, authorities in the U.S. and U.K. blamed Russia for the Petya outbreak . Russia has called the accusations “baseless.”\nThe FBI said that the network of hacked computers was created by a group known as APT 28, or Fancy Bear, which has also been linked to the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee. U.S. authorities said last year that APT 28 is made up of hackers working for the Russian intelligence service.\nIt is unclear what comes next, researchers and authorities say. But VPNFilter has the capabilities to install software that can steal sensitive information from the network such as passwords or even data on power plants or factory-floor computers, Mr. Williams said.\nThe FBI’s takedown will prevent recently infected or rebooted devices from receiving instructions from the command-and-control server, but the many routers and storage devices that had already downloaded these instructions before the FBI’s takedown remain under the control of the hackers until they are restarted, said Vikram Thakur a technical director with security vendor Symantec .\nWhoever built the network could launch a new virus like Petya, attack power plants or disrupt computer systems connected to the coming Champions League game, Mr. Williams said. After a cyberattack, the creators could cover their steps by wiping out the infected device’s software, effectively leaving hundreds of thousands of people without internet access, he said.\n“The reality is, this attacker has limitless options,” Mr. Williams said.\nAccording to Cisco, the VPNFilter malware affects certain Linksys routers built by Belkin International Inc. as well as some built by Netgear Inc., NTGR -0.74% SIA Mikrotīkls (MikroTik), and TP-Link Technologies Co. and some storage devices built by QNAP Systems, Inc.\nMany of these devices can be taken over using known well-known attacks or default administrative passwords, Mr. Williams said.\nNetgear and TP-Link published security advisories Wednesday saying the companies are investigating the VPNFilter malware. They advised users to update their routers’ software and to avoid using the default passwords.\nThe other device makers didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday issued a warning about VPNFilter , saying that the software “has the potential to cut off internet access for hundreds of thousands of users.”\nAfter years of focusing on personal computers, hackers have increasingly turned to the so-called Internet of Things—routers, storage devices, video recorders and other internet-connected devices—that don’t typically run antivirus software and are can often be accessed using default usernames and passwords.\nIn 2016, a network of about 300,000 such infected devices caused a widespread internet outage in the U.S. by launching a massive online attack against an internet service provider.\nWrite to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com",
