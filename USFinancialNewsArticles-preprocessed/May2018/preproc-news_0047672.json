FILE PHOTO: European Commissionner Cecilia Malmstrom (not pictured) and European Commissioner Phil Hogan hold a news conference on the EU-Mexico trade agreement, in Brussels, Belgium, April 23, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Vidal\nEU leaders agreed last week to cooperate with the United States on trade issues including market liberalization as long as Washington did not impose import tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.\nAsked if these proposals satisfied Washington, Malmstom said “I think they don’t think it is enough.” Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek",
