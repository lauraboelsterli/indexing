REUTERS/Leah Millis Highlights\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s new chief lawyer said that if his client agrees to an interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, it should be limited to a few hours and focus on Russian tampering in the 2016 election. When asked what questions might be appropriate, the former New York mayor and lawyer Rudy Giuliani said : “Was there some agreement with the Russians? Was there any meeting of Trump with the Russians?”.\nReuters interviews with more than a dozen small to mid-sized manufacturing executives and recent U.S. economic data reveal Trump’s protectionist trade policy is starting to lead some of them to take a more cautious approach , and forcing them to put new investment and hiring plans on hold.\nThe North American unit of a Chinese customs inspection firm said it would suspend checks on cargoes of scrap metal from the United States for a month , effectively halting all imports of U.S. scrap.\nWorld\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani inspects an honour guard during his ceremonial reception in New Delhi, India, February 17, 2018.

Colombia has already issued 33 licenses and hopes to grow as much as 40.5 tons a year of medical marijuana - accounting for roughly 44 percent of licenses issued globally.\nBusiness\nWorld stocks were set for their biggest weekly loss since the middle of March, while the dollar hovered near highs hit on its recent rally as investors awaited jobs data from the United States.\nThe U.S. Justice Department has filed criminal charges against former Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn , accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German automaker’s diesel emissions cheating.\nAT&T told a federal judge it should reject any request by the U.S. Justice Department to force it to divest its DirecTV unit or Turner networks as part of approving its proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner.\nA month after India’s central bank barred regulated lenders from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions , trading volumes have surged dramatically alongside a sharp rally in prices.\nVideo\nAntony Currie and Richard Beales talk about Tesla’s biggest-ever quarterly loss, the electric-car maker’s ambitions, and boss Elon Musk’s impatience with Wall Street analysts on the company’s earnings call – and what that means for its capital-raising prospects.\n ",
