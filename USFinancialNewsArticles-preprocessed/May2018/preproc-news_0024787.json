    "text": "PHOENIX, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Republic Bank of Arizona, (OTCBB:RBAZ) (“RBAZ”) (“Bank”) announced a net income of $130,000, or $0.08 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a net income of $51,000, or $0.03 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nPresident and CEO Ralph Tapscott stated “Not only have we started the year stronger than last year, but we expect to hit our full year projection based on our team, our pipeline, and our local economies. It is our team of dedicated bankers that I commend for growing our core deposits and allowing us to shed higher-cost and less relationship oriented deposits. Loan production started the year slowly, but production has been significant in the past 45 days, and this will be evident in our next quarterly release.”\nMr. Tapscott continued “Our capital is strong and will support continued growth, our asset quality is exceptional, and our team is committed to growing relationships that will manifest in loan and core deposit growth, with a corresponding growth in core earnings. Reflecting on the past year, we converted our charter, changed our bank name and rebranded, and we moved our banking location on March 19, 2018. Our team’s work continues to be reflected in our Bauer Five-Star bank rating.”\nMarch 31, 2018 Highlights Include:\nTotal interest income of $1,204,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 outpaced total interest income of $1,044,000 for the same period of the prior year, and equates to an increase of 15.33%. Total deposits of $99,036,000 were down $9,453,000 from December 31, 2017, but total deposits are up 30% from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. In the most recent quarter we allowed some higher priced and more price sensitive deposits to roll out. Changes in deposit composition, coupled with the payoff of FHLB term advances, have allowed RBAZ’s cost of funds to decrease by 37.8% during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Quarterly non-interest expense for March 31, 2018 increased 13.5% and 7.8% over quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Approximately half of that increase is associated with double occupancy costs that will normalize after May 31, 2018.\nThe Bank remains “well capitalized” as follows:\nMarch 31, 2018\n(%) Ratio to be Well\nCapitalized (%) Leverage Ratio 12.49 5.00 Common Equity Tier 1 25.53 6.50 Tier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets 25.53 8.00 Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets 26.80 10.00 About the Company\nRepublic Bank of Arizona is a locally owned community bank in Phoenix, Arizona.
