    "text": "SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Abraxas Petroleum Corporation (NASDAQ:AXAS) today reported financial and operating results for the three months\nFinancial Highlights for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nThe three months ended March 31, 2018 resulted in:\nProduction of 944 MBoe (10,485 Boepd) Revenue of $40.6 million Net income of $10.8 million, or $0.07 per share Adjusted net income (a) (excluding certain non-cash items) of $14.9 million, or $0.09 per share EBITDA (a) of $27.0 million Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants of $27.2 million (a)\n(a) See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures below.\nOperational Highlights for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018:\nFour Delaware Basin wells currently being fracture stimulated Seven Bakken/Three Forks wells scheduled for May/June fracture stimulation First quarter 2018 average daily production of 10,485 Boepd representing approximately 54% and 19% production growth over first and fourth quarter 2017, respectively Second quarter 2018 production guidance of 9,000-9,500 Boepd accounts for planned well downtime associated with offsetting fracture stimulations\nDelaware Basin\nIn Ward County, Texas, Abraxas is currently in the process of fracture stimulating the Company’s 660’ downspacing test at Caprito. The four-well downspacing test consists of two Wolfcamp A2 wells, the Caprito 99-301H and Caprito 99-311H, and two Wolfcamp A1 wells, the Caprito 99-202H and Caprito 99-211H. Abraxas experienced 7\" casing integrity issues on the Caprito 99-301H and the 99-311H during the completion. The Caprito 99-301H was fully remediated and the completion of that well continues. The Caprito 99-311H will require minor remediation work following the completion of the other three wells. Abraxas plans to flow back three of the four wells while remediating the Caprito 99-311H. The Company plans to finish the completion of the Caprito 99-311H immediately following the remediation work. Henceforth, Abraxas will be utilizing tie-back strings during the completion to eliminate the risk of further 7\" casing integrity issues. Abraxas does not anticipate that these issues or delays will have any material impact on Abraxas' guidance laid out below. Abraxas owns a 57.8% working interest in the Caprito 99-301H, Caprito 99-311H, Caprito 99-202H and Caprito 99-211H.\nAbraxas recently participated in two non-operated Wolfcamp wells with approximately 5,000' laterals on the Company’s newly acquired acreage in Winkler County, Texas. The wells averaged 1,110 Boepd (963 barrels of oil per day, 883 mcf of natural gas per day) (1) over their first 30 days of production. Abraxas owns a 30% working interest in each well.\nAbraxas is currently drilling two 5,000’ lateral wells, the Greasewood 201H and 301H. These wells are being drilled on Section 94, Block F, which is three sections north of the Company’s previous drilling activity in Ward County, Texas. The two-well pad consists of one Wolfcamp A1 well, the Greasewood 201H, and one Wolfcamp A2 well, the Greasewood 301H. Abraxas owns a 100% working interest in the Greasewood 201H and 301H.\nWilliston Basin\nIn McKenzie County, North Dakota, Abraxas expects to begin the fracture stimulation of the Yellowstone 5H-7H and the Lillibridge 9H-12H wells in May and June, respectively. Both pads are expected to begin flowback in July. Abraxas owns a 52% working interest in the Yellowstone 5H-7H and a 25-29% working interest in the Lillibridge 9H-12H.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Production and Guidance Update\nProduction for the first quarter of 2018 averaged approximately 10,485 Boepd (6,715 barrels of oil per day, 13,180 mcf of natural gas per day, 1,573 barrels of NGL per day). Abraxas did not complete or put any wells onto production during the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter of $31.4 million consisted of $17.1 million for drilling and completions and $14.3 million for acquisitions.\nAbraxas is providing the following second quarter 2018 production, operating cost and capital expenditure guidance. Abraxas brought down or plans to bring down several high rate producing wells in the Bakken and Delaware Basin for planned offsetting fracture stimulations. Abraxas anticipates first production volumes from the new well completions and a return of production from the shut-in wells late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. Quarterly lease operating expense (\"LOE\") guidance is biased toward the high end of annual guidance due to the associated costs with frac protecting wells from offsetting fracture stimulations. Capital expenditures for the second quarter includes approximately $20 million for planned acquisitions. Production guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018 remains unchanged at 10,000-12,000 Boepd at a planned capital expenditure budget of $140 million.\n2Q18E\nLow\nHigh\nProduction Total (Boepd) 9,000 9,500 % Oil 63% % NGL 15% % Natural Gas 22% Operating Costs LOE ($/Boe) $5.00 $6.00 Production Tax (% Rev) 7.5% 8.0% Cash G&A ($mm) $2.2 $2.4 CAPEX ($mm) $50 (1) The 30-day average rates represent the highest 30 days of production and do not include the impact of natural gas liquids and shrinkage at the processing plant and include flared gas.\nComments\nBob Watson, President and CEO of Abraxas, commented, “Despite continued midstream curtailments for both oil and gas in the first quarter of 2018, we remained in the middle of our production guidance. We continue to benefit from strong underlying well performance with shallower than anticipated declines. In the second quarter, we brought down or plan to bring down numerous high rate offsetting producing wells as we undertake a busy completion schedule. The completion of these seven Bakken and four Delaware Basin wells will lead to a substantial ramp in volumes in the third quarter of 2018.\n“We continue to work a number of deals around our existing assets in the Delaware Basin. Our ultimate objective is to prudently add acres and trade around our core position. With success, our acreage position will become more contiguous and lead to a more efficient and economic development of the asset. We look forward to updating you on the results of these efforts.”\nConference Call\nAbraxas Petroleum Corporation (NASDAQ:AXAS) will host its first quarter 2018 earnings conference call at 11 AM ET on May 9, 2018.

Such factors may include, but may not be necessarily limited to, changes in the prices received by Abraxas for crude oil and natural gas. In addition, Abraxas’ future crude oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon Abraxas’ level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. Further, Abraxas operates in an industry sector where the value of securities is highly volatile and may be influenced by economic and other factors beyond Abraxas’ control. In the context of forward-looking information provided for in this release, reference is made to the discussion of risk factors detailed in Abraxas’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the past 12 months.\nABRAXAS PETROLEUM CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (In thousands except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Financial Results: Revenues $ 40,630 $ 18,802 Net income 10,779 13,690 Net income per share – basic $ 0.07 $ 0.09 Net income per share – diluted $ 0.06 $ 0.09 Capital expenditures - acquisitions 14,293 — Capital expenditures - drilling and completion 17,062 10,957 Total capital expenditures 31,355 10,957 EBITDA (a) 27,014 11,718 Adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items (a) 14,873 4,930 Adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items (a) , per share – basic $ 0.09 $ 0.03 Adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items (a) , per share – diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.03 Liquidity (a) 76,395 97,811 Weighted average shares outstanding – basic 165,133 154,118 Weighted average shares outstanding – diluted 167,243 156,813 Production from Continuing Operations: Crude oil per day (Bblpd) 6,715 3,748 Natural gas per day (Mcfpd) 13,180 10,428 Natural gas liquids per day (Bblpd) 1,573 1,336 Crude oil equivalent per day (Boepd) 10,485 6,822 Crude oil equivalent (MBoe) 944 614 Realized Prices, net of realized hedging activity: Crude oil ($ per Bbl) $ 53.29 $ 47.62 Natural gas ($ per Mcf) 2.00 2.18 Natural gas liquids ($ per Bbl) 15.70 10.84 Crude oil equivalent ($ per Boe) 39.00 31.61 Expenses: Lease operating ($ per Boe) $ 4.84 $ 6.71 Production taxes (% of oil and gas revenue) 7.7 % 8.6 % General and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation ($ per Boe)\n$ 2.27 $ 3.20 Cash interest ($ per Boe) 1.27 0.64 Depreciation, depletion and amortization ($ per Boe)\n10.74 8.75 (a) See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures below.\nABRAXAS PETROLEUM CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DATA (In thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Cash $ 5,645 $ 1,618 Working capital (22,574 ) (34,361 ) Property and equipment – net 258,988 237,767 Total assets 292,649 273,806 Long-term debt - less current maturities 107,287 87,354 Stockholders’ equity 117,684 106,308 Common shares outstanding 165,882 165,890 Working capital per bank loan covenants (a) (8,096 ) (23,262 ) (a) Excludes current maturities of long-term debt and current derivative assets and liabilities in accordance with our bank loan covenants.\nThis working capital calculation excludes the unused commitment amount which is included for our current ratio calculation.\nABRAXAS PETROLEUM CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (In thousands except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues: Oil $ 35,994 $ 15,502 Gas 2,377 1,982 Natural gas liquids 2,223 1,303 40,594 18,787 Other 36 15 40,630 18,802 Operating costs and expenses: Lease operating 4,569 4,118 Production and ad valorem taxes 3,113 1,620 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 10,130 5,374 General and administrative (including stock-based compensation of $586 and $770, respectively) 2,728 2,737 20,540 13,849 Operating income 20,090 4,953 Other (income) expense: Interest expense 1,329 507 Amortization of deferred financing fees 96 137 Loss on sale of non-oil and gas assets 3 — Loss (gain) on derivative contracts 7,883 (9,381 ) 9,311 (8,737 ) Income before income tax 10,779 13,690 Income tax benefit — — Net income $ 10,779 $ 13,690 Net income per common share - basic $ 0.07 $ 0.09 Net income per common share - diluted $ 0.06 $ 0.09 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 165,133 154,118 Diluted 167,243 156,813 ABRAXAS PETROLEUM CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo fully assess Abraxas’ operating results, management believes that, although not prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America, EBITDA is an appropriate measure of Abraxas' ability to satisfy capital expenditure obligations and working capital requirements. EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, deferred income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, impairments, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, and stock-based compensation. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity. EBITDA excludes some, but not all items that affect net income and may vary among companies. The EBITDA presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe have also disclosed Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants. Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. Our management believes that information regarding Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants is material to an understanding of our financial condition and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods presented.\n(In thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 10,779 $ 13,690 Net interest expense 1,329 507 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 10,130 5,374 Amortization of deferred financing fees 96 137 Stock-based compensation 586 770 Unrealized loss (gain) on derivative contracts 4,094 (8,760 ) EBITDA $ 27,014 $ 11,718 EBITDA $ 27,014 $ 11,718 Expenses related to equity offering/loan amendments/permitted acquisitions 202 3,790 Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants $ 27,216 $ 15,508 This release also includes a discussion of “adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items,” which is also a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income, excluding ceiling test impairment and unrealized changes in derivative contracts. Management believes that net income calculated in accordance with GAAP is the most directly comparable measure to adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items. The calculation of adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nUnrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts are based on mark-to-market valuations which are non-cash in nature and may fluctuate drastically from period to period. As commodity prices fluctuate, these derivative contracts are valued against current market prices at the end of each reporting period in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815: Derivatives and Hedging as amended and interpreted, which requires Abraxas to record a gain or loss based on the calculated value difference from the previous period-end valuation for open contracts. For example, NYMEX oil prices on March 31, 2017 were $50.60 per barrel compared to $64.94 on March 31, 2018; therefore, the mark-to-market valuation changed considerably from period to period.\n(In thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 10,779 $ 13,690 Unrealized loss (gain) on derivative contracts 4,094 (8,760 ) Adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items $ 14,873 $ 4,930 Net income per share – basic $ 0.07 $ 0.09 Net income per share – diluted $ 0.06 $ 0.09 Adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items, per share – basic $ 0.09 $ 0.03 Adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items, per share – diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.03 Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.\n(In thousands) March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Borrowing base $ 175,000 $ 115,000 Cash and cash equivalents 5,645 1,061 Revolving credit facility - outstanding borrowings (104,000 ) (18,000 ) Outstanding letters of credit (250 ) (250 ) Liquidity $ 76,395 $ 97,811\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006607/en/\nAbraxas Petroleum Corporation\nGeoffrey King, 210-490-4788\nVice President – Chief Financial Officer\ngking@abraxaspetroleum.com\nwww.abraxaspetroleum.com\nSource: Abraxas Petroleum Corporation",
