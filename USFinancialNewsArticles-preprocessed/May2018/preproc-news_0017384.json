Capital allocated to non-portfolio assets is not included in the calculation.\nThe returns on invested capital in the PT MBS and structured MBS portfolios were approximately (15.8)% and 7.4%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018. The combined portfolio generated a return on invested capital of approximately (12.6)%.\nCapital Allocation Structured Security Portfolio Pass-Through Interest-Only Inverse Interest Portfolio Securities Only Securities Sub-total Total March 31, 2018 Market value $ 202,393,486 $ 1,524,545 $ 910,915 $ 2,435,460 $ 204,828,946 Cash equivalents and restricted cash (1) 5,766,540 - - - 5,766,540 Repurchase agreement obligations (193,819,649 ) - - - (193,819,649 ) Total (2) $ 14,340,377 $ 1,524,545 $ 910,915 $ 2,435,460 $ 16,775,837 % of Total 85.5 % 9.1 % 5.4 % 14.5 % 100.0 % December 31, 2017 Market value $ 207,178,811 $ 1,476,697 $ 1,036,624 $ 2,513,321 $ 209,692,132 Cash equivalents and restricted cash (1) 8,619,350 - - - 8,619,350 Repurchase agreement obligations (200,182,751 ) - - - (200,182,751 ) Total (2) $ 15,615,410 $ 1,476,697 $ 1,036,624 $ 2,513,321 $ 18,128,731 % of Total 86.1 % 8.2 % 5.7 % 13.9 % 100.0 % (1) Amount excludes restricted cash of $118,430 and $133,510 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, related to trust preferred debt funding hedges.

Prepayments\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company received approximately $5.1 million in scheduled and unscheduled principal repayments and prepayments, which equated to a 3-month constant prepayment rate (“CPR”) of approximately 8.6% for the first quarter of 2018. Prepayment rates on the two MBS sub-portfolios were as follows (in CPR):\nPT Structured MBS Sub- MBS Sub- Total Three Months Ended Portfolio Portfolio Portfolio March 31, 2018 7.2 16.8 8.6 December 31, 2017 7.2 16.9 8.8 September 30, 2017 5.2 18.8 8.3 June 30, 2017 5.9 20.4 9.9 March 31, 2017 4.8 18.8 8.8 Portfolio\nThe following tables summarize the MBS portfolio as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\n($ in thousands) Weighted Percentage Average of Weighted Maturity Fair Entire Average in Longest Asset Category Value Portfolio Coupon Months Maturity March 31, 2018 Fixed Rate MBS $ 202,393 98.8 % 4.20 % 319 1-Jan-48 Interest-Only MBS 1,525 0.8 % 3.45 % 227 25-Dec-39 Inverse Interest-Only MBS 911 0.4 % 4.70 % 276 25-Apr-41 Total MBS Portfolio $ 204,829 100.0 % 4.20 % 318 1-Jan-48 December 31, 2017 Fixed Rate MBS $ 207,179 98.8 % 4.21 % 321 1-Dec-47 Interest-Only MBS 1,476 0.7 % 3.43 % 229 25-Dec-39 Inverse Interest-Only MBS 1,037 0.5 % 5.01 % 278 25-Apr-41 Total MBS Portfolio $ 209,692 100.0 % 4.21 % 320 1-Dec-47\n($ in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Percentage of Percentage of Agency Fair Value Entire Portfolio Fair Value Entire Portfolio Fannie Mae $ 179,874 87.8 % $ 178,581 85.2 % Freddie Mac 24,729 12.1 % 30,896 14.7 % Ginnie Mae 226 0.1 % 215 0.1 % Total Portfolio $ 204,829 100.0 % $ 209,692 100.0 %\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Weighted Average Pass Through Purchase Price $ 109.00 $ 109.06 Weighted Average Structured Purchase Price $ 6.02 $ 6.02 Weighted Average Pass Through Current Price $ 104.68 $ 107.13 Weighted Average Structured Current Price $ 7.42 $ 7.06 Effective Duration (1) 4.712 3.832 (1) Effective duration is the approximate percentage change in price for a 100 basis point change in rates. An effective duration of 4.712 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 4.712% decrease in the value of the MBS in the Company’s investment portfolio at March 31, 2018. An effective duration of 3.832 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 3.832% decrease in the value of the MBS in the Company’s investment portfolio at December 31, 2017. These figures include the structured securities in the portfolio but not the effect of the Company’s funding cost hedges. Effective duration Quote: s for individual investments are obtained from The Yield Book, Inc. Financing and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding repurchase obligations of approximately $193.8 million with a net weighted average borrowing rate of 1.94%. These agreements were collateralized by MBS with a fair value, including accrued interest, of approximately $205.5 million, and cash pledged to counterparties of approximately $0.1. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s liquidity was approximately $5.1 million, consisting of unpledged MBS and cash and cash equivalents.\nWe may pledge more of our structured MBS as part of a repurchase agreement funding, but retain cash in lieu of acquiring additional assets. In this way, we can, at a modest cost, retain higher levels of cash on hand and decrease the likelihood we will have to sell assets in a distressed market in order to raise cash.

Hedging\nIn connection with its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company economically hedges a portion of the cost of its repurchase agreement funding and also its junior subordinated notes by entering into derivative financial instrument contracts. The Company has not elected hedging treatment under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in order to align the accounting treatment of its derivative instruments with the treatment of its portfolio assets under the fair value option election. As such, all gains or losses on these instruments are reflected in earnings for all periods presented. As of March 31, 2018, such instruments were comprised entirely of Eurodollar futures contracts.\nThe tables below present information related to outstanding Eurodollar futures contracts at March 31, 2018.\n($ in thousands) As of March 31, 2018 Repurchase Agreement Funding Hedges Average Weighted Weighted Contract Average Average Notional Entry Effective Open Expiration Year Amount Rate Rate Equity (1) 2018 $ 73,333 2.03 % 2.41 % $ 206 2019 100,000 2.41 % 2.69 % 284 2020 100,000 2.64 % 2.81 % 166 2021 100,000 2.80 % 2.84 % 39 Total / Weighted Average $ 94,667 2.53 % 2.72 % $ 695\n($ in thousands) As of March 31, 2018 Junior Subordinated Debt Funding Hedges Average Weighted Weighted Contract Average Average Notional Entry Effective Open Expiration Year Amount Rate Rate Equity (1) 2018 $ 26,000 1.71 % 2.39 % $ 133 2019 26,000 1.63 % 2.69 % 276 2020 26,000 1.95 % 2.81 % 225 2021 26,000 2.22 % 2.84 % 162 Total / Weighted Average $ 26,000 1.89 % 2.70 % $ 796 (1) Open equity represents the cumulative gains (losses) recorded on open futures positions from inception. Book Value Per Share\nThe Company's Book Value Per Share at March 31, 2018 was $4.13. The Company computes Book Value Per Share by dividing total stockholders' equity by the total number of shares outstanding of the Company's Class A Common Stock. At March 31, 2018, the Company's stockholders’ equity was $52.6 million, with 12,743,959 Class A Common shares outstanding.\nStock Repurchase Plan\nOn March 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of Bimini Capital Management, Inc. (the “Company”) approved a Stock Repurchase Plan (“Repurchase Plan”). Pursuant to the Repurchase Plan, the Company may purchase up to 500,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock from time to time, subject to certain limitations imposed by Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including, without limitation, open market transactions. The Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares, and it expires on November 15, 2018. The authorization for the Share Repurchase Plan may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Company’s Board of Directors in its discretion at any time.\nThrough March 31, 2018, the Company had not repurchased any shares under the Repurchase Plan. Subsequent to that date, and through May 7, 2018, the Company has repurchased 11,900 shares for a net cost of approximately $26,000 and a weighted average price of $2.20 per share.\nManagement Commentary\nCommenting on the first quarter, Robert E. Cauley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “As 2018 got underway the market environment changed. Starting in January the specter of inflation may have finally appeared, and the rates market reacted forcefully. Evidence of pricing pressures in the economic data and legislation out of Washington that will add materially to the budget deficit over the next few years caught the market by surprise and interest rates rose quickly over the first six weeks of the quarter. The 10-year US treasury came within a few basis points of 3% for the first time since early 2014. The treasury curve steepened and market participants reconsidered their expectations for future rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. For their part, Fed officials were very consistent in support for continued gradual rate hikes. While last Labor Day the 10-year treasury was close to 2% and the market was only expecting one more rate hike by the end of 2018, the outlook was much different by February of 2018. As reflected in Fed funds futures, the market expects two more rate hikes in 2018, in addition to the hike in March. Funding pressures in the short-term funding markets emerged and Libor, the primary floating rate index, moved from less than 1.70% (3-month Libor) at the end of 2017 to approximately 2.31% by March 31, 2018.\n“The sell-off in the rates market reversed in late February/early March as the Trump administration announced potential tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. This was followed in short order by counter-threats from essentially all US trading partners and in turn more threats from the administration. The latter were met with even more counter-threats. The prospect of a meaningful trade war spooked the markets and equities sold off as interest rates rallied. These fears diminished meaningfully in April and the markets have stabilized. With these fears reduced, and a potentially significant flare up in Syria that in the end was short lived, the markets have once again focused on the economic data. The data remains generally very strong and public pronouncements by Fed officials support market expectations of at least two more rate hikes in 2018. Equity markets have recovered and with early first quarter earnings announcements coming in quite strong, fear has receded from the market. Volatility – both in the equity market and rates market – spiked mid-quarter, but has since come back down, and in a substantial way in the case of the rates market.\n“The mortgage market suffered throughout the quarter and most agency mortgages performed far worse than comparable duration treasuries. While the fourth quarter of 2017 was a great quarter for agency MBS, as other risk assets appeared quite rich on a relative basis and mortgages benefitted, this trend reversed in the first quarter of 2018. Going forward, prepayment fears are very benign and the resulting drop-off in the supply of new mortgages should help off-set reduced purchases by the Federal Reserve. However, as the yield curve continues to flatten, driven by progressively higher funding rates for levered mortgage investors, returns in the mortgage market are likely to remain weak.\n“The performance of the Royal Palm portfolio was consistent with what we observed in the agency mortgage market generally. Our higher coupon, fixed rate pass-throughs under-performed our hedges and led to a 15.8% negative return for the quarter. The structured portfolio generated a 7.4% positive return but coupled with the fact the capital allocation was approximately 86%/14% in favor of pass-throughs the combined portfolio generated a negative 12.6% return. Because of the magnitude of the underperformance of pass-throughs portfolio the resulting margin call activity prevented us from growing the portfolio during the quarter, and on a mark to market basis the portfolio actually declined in market value from approximately $210 million at December 31, 2017 to approximately $205 million at March 31, 2018. The market has stabilized so far in the second quarter and we are hopeful to resume growing the portfolio soon as the Company is otherwise cash flow positive.\n“Orchid Island did not raise additional capital during the quarter. None-the-less the advisory services segment generated approximately $2.1 million in revenue – our highest quarterly total to date.”\nSummarized Financial Statements\nThe following is a summarized presentation of the unaudited consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and the unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
