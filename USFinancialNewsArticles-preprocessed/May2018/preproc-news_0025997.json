    "text": "SINGAPORE, May 10 (Reuters) - Singapore-listed commodity trader Wilmar International Ltd posted a 40.6 percent fall in its first-quarter net profit on Thursday, citing weaker performance in its tropical oils segment and seasonal losses in its sugar business.\nThe company, whose top shareholders include U.S. agricultural trader Archer Daniels Midland Co, reported a net profit of $203.3 million for the three months ended March, compared with $342 million a year ago.\nWilmar posted a core net profit, which excludes non-operating items, of $183.5 million, compared with $293 million a year earlier.
