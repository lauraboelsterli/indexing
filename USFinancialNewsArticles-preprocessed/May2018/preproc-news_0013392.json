    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TPI Composites, Inc. (Nasdaq:TPIC), the only independent manufacturer of composite wind blades with a global footprint, ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nNet sales of $254.0 million Total billings of $223.7 million Net income of $8.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share EBITDA of $21.0 million, with an EBITDA margin of 8.3% Adjusted EBITDA of $27.4 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.8%\nKPIs Q1'18 Q1'17 Sets¹ 569 636 Estimated megawatts² 1,464 1,460 Dedicated manufacturing lines³ 46 44 Manufacturing lines installed⁴ 38 39 Manufacturing lines in startup⁵ 10 9 Manufacturing lines in transition⁶ 4 - Number of wind blade sets (which consist of three wind blades) invoiced worldwide in the period. Estimated megawatts of energy capacity to be generated by wind blade sets invoiced in the period. Number of manufacturing lines that are dedicated to our customers under long-term supply agreements. Dedicated manufacturing lines for Q1’17 includes seven lines for GE Wind that were not renewed after December 31, 2017. Number of manufacturing lines installed and either in operation, startup or transition. Number of manufacturing lines in a startup phase during the pre-production and production ramp-up period. Number of manufacturing lines that were being transitioned to a new wind blade model during the period.\n“We started the year on a positive note as we delivered another strong quarter of operational and financial performance,” said Steven Lockard, TPI Composites’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “We remain focused on our strategy to grow globally, diversify our customer base and expand profitability. So far this year, we have signed supply agreements for a total of five lines representing potential contract revenue of up to $1.2 billion over the terms of the agreements. These include four manufacturing lines with Vestas, with an option for additional lines, in a new manufacturing hub in Yangzhou, China and an additional line with Vestas in Izmir, Turkey.”\n“TPI also continues to demonstrate additional commercial capabilities for our advanced composites expertise. In March, we announced a joint development agreement with Navistar, Inc. to design and develop a Class 8 truck comprised of a composite tractor and frame rails. We remain opportunistic in our diversification plans into the strategic markets. As a reminder, the Navistar agreement brings our development program count in strategic markets to a total of five.”\n“Finally, as we’ve talked about previously, 2018 will be an investment year, however, we still estimate that we will deliver top line growth of approximately 10% this year. We remain focused on our commitment to grow our wind business, improve our operational effectiveness, drive profitability and continue to drive down the levelized cost of wind energy while continuing to develop and explore additional opportunities in other strategic markets,” concluded Mr. Lockard.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet sales for the quarter increased by $45.4 million or 21.7% to $254.0 million compared to $208.6 million in the same period in 2017. Total billings increased by $12.3 million or 5.8% to $223.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $211.4 million in the 2017 period. Net sales of wind blades were $234.2 million for the quarter as compared to $195.7 million in the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher average sales prices due to the mix of wind blade models produced during the quarter compared to the same period in 2017. This was partially offset by a 10.5% decrease in the number of wind blades produced during the quarter compared to the same period in 2017. The favorable impact of the currency movements on consolidated net sales was 3.4% and on total billings was 3.9% for the quarter.\nTotal cost of goods sold for the quarter was $225.7 million and included aggregate costs of $14.7 million primarily related to startup costs in our new plants in Turkey and Mexico and for our new customer, Senvion, in Taicang, China. This compares to total cost of goods sold of $188.7 million for the same period in 2017, including aggregate costs of $6.2 million related to startup costs in our new plants in Turkey and Mexico. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales of wind blades decreased slightly during the quarter as compared to the same period in 2017, driven by improved operating efficiencies and the impact of net savings in raw material costs, partially offset by the increase in startup and transition costs. The unfavorable impact of the currency movements on consolidated cost of goods sold was 4.6% for the quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $11.2 million as compared to $8.3 million for the same period in 2017. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses were 4.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up from 4.0% in the same period in 2017. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by increased personnel costs from filling our key global positions to support our growth and diversification strategy, additional depreciation expense related to our enhanced corporate infrastructure, the costs related to the implementation of ASC 606, our work related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and a year over year increase in share-based compensation costs of $0.5 million.\nNet income for the quarter was $8.6 million as compared to $5.2 million in the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the reasons set forth above. Diluted earnings per share was $0.24 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.15 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nEBITDA for the quarter increased to $21.0 million, compared to $14.5 million during the same period in 2017. The EBITDA margin increased to 8.3% compared to 7.0% in the 2017 period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased to $27.4 million compared to $17.6 million during the same period in 2017. The Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 10.8% compared to 8.4% during the same period in 2017.\nCapital expenditures were $11.7 million for the quarter compared to $16.9 million during the same period in 2017. Current year capital expenditures were primarily related to new facilities and expansion or improvements at existing facilities and costs to enhance our information technology systems.\nWe ended the quarter with $138.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and net cash was $11.1 million as compared to net cash of $24.6 million at December 31, 2017.\n2018 Outlook\nFor 2018, the Company is providing the following guidance:\nNet sales of between $1.0 billion and $1.05 billion Total billings of between $1.0 billion and $1.05 billion Adjusted EBITDA of between $75 million and $80 million Fully diluted earnings per share of between $0.38 and $0.42 Sets delivered of between 2,500 and 2,525 Average sales price per blade of between $125,000 and $130,000 Estimated megawatts of sets delivered to be between 6,950 and 7,100 Dedicated manufacturing lines under long-term agreements at year end to be between 51 and 55 Manufacturing lines installed at year end to be 47 Manufacturing lines in startup during the year to be 12 Manufacturing lines in transition during the year to be 14 Startup and transition cost of between $58 million and $61 million Capital expenditures to be between $85 million and $90 million (approx. 85% growth related) Effective tax rate to be between 40% and 42% Depreciation and amortization of between $30 million and $35 million Interest expense of between $11.5 million and $12.5 million Share-based compensation expense of between $10 million and $11 million\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nTPI Composites will host an investor conference call this afternoon, Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 5:00pm ET.
