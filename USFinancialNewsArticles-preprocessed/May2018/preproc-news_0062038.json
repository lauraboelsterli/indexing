Aluminium ingots which were made at the Rusal Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter are seen in this illustration taken May 25, 2018. Picture taken May 25, 2018. REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin/Illustration\nThe U.S. Treasury in April imposed sanctions against billionaire Oleg Deripaska and the eight companies in which he is a large shareholder, including giant aluminium exporter Rusal, in response to what it called “malign activities” by Russia.\nDeripaska controls 66 percent of En+, which in turn controls 48 percent of Rusal.
