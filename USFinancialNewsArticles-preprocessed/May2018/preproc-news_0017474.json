    "text": "NEW YORK, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Atento S.A. (NYSE: ATTO), the largest provider of customer-relationship management and business-process outsourcing services in Latin America, and among the top five providers globally, today announced its first-quarter 2018 operating and financial results. All comparisons in this announcement are year-over-year and in constant-currency (CCY), unless noted otherwise, and may differ from 6K due to certain intra-group eliminations.\nSummary\n($ in millions except EPS)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nCCY Growth\nIncome Statement\nRevenue\n490.4\n468.0\n+4.5%\nEBITDA (1)\n49.8\n50.2\n-1.0%\nEBITDA Margin\n10.1%\n10.7%\n-0.6 p.p.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n49.8\n53.6\n-6.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n10.1%\n11.5%\n-1.4 p.p.\nNet Income (2)\n(1.7)\n9.0\nn.m.\nRecurring Net Income (2)\n7.8\n12.5\n-40.3%\nEarnings Per Share (2)\n($0.02)\n$0.12\nRecurring Earnings Per Share (2)\n$0.10\n$0.17\nCashflow, Debt and Leverage\nFree Cash Flow (3)\n(34.9)\n(8.3)\nNet Debt\n394.4\n368.9\nLeverage (x)\n1.8x\n1.6x\n(1)\nEBITDA is defined as profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations before net finance costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude restructuring costs, site relocation costs and other items not related to our core results of operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures defined by IFRS. The most directly comparable IFRS measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is profit/(loss) for the year/period from continuing operations.\n(2)\nReported Net Income and Earnings Per Share and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Earnings Per Share refer only to continuing operations. Reported and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, for the period ended March 31, 2018, were calculated considering the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 73,909,056. For the period ended March 31, 2017, the number of ordinary shares was 73,909,056. Recurring Earnings and EPS attributable to Owners of the parent\n(3)\nWe define Free Cash flow before interest and acquisitions as operating cashflow minus Capex payments and income tax expenses.\nAlejandro Reynal, Atento´s Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We continued delivering solid top line growth and revenue diversification in the first quarter of 2018, driven by 8% increase in revenues from Multisector clients supported by broad-based country gains. During the quarter we leveraged our Company expanded capabilities in digital customer experience and back office to provide even greater value to our clients and to continue extending our market leadership into the digital age.\"\nMauricio Montilha, Atento´s Chief Financial Officer, said, \"The first quarter results were aligned with the Company's expectations, as mentioned in the short term trends provided within the guidance for the year. EBITDA Margins totaled 10.1% in the quarter with Americas posting margin improvement and Brazil in line with short term guidance. We are encouraged by improving trends in Q1 2018 versus Q4 2017 in Brazil and expect margins to recover throughout the year.\"\nMr. Reynal concluded, \"We are reaffirming our financial guidance for the year and remain confident that in 2018 we will continue to make great progress for Atento. The macro environment continues to evolve favorably and support revenue growth. As we accelerate the execution of our growth strategy, we remain the reference partner for the CRM BPO needs of clients and help them to unveil the full potential of the digital transformation throughout the customer lifecycle.\"\nFirst Quarter Consolidated Operating Results\nAll comparisons in this announcement, unless otherwise noted, are year-over-year and in constant-currency (CCY).\nConsolidated revenues grew by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2018, driven by the strong growth from Americas and Brazil, as well as Multisector clients. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 4.8% in the quarter.\nRevenues from Multisector increased 7.9% in Q1, representing 61.4% of total revenues, up 1.5 p.p. year-on-year. Revenues from Telefónica continued to present stability, down 0.6% in Q1, and our revenues from higher value-added solutions totaled 25.0% in the quarter, down 1.3 p.p. on changes in client mix.\nEBITDA in the quarter totaled $49.8 million, down 1.0% year-on-year, while EBITDA margins totaled 10.1%, down 0.6 p.p. versus the same period of 2017. The drop in EBITDA margin is mostly explained by lower margins in Brazil, partially offset by improved margins in Americas. Margins in EMEA were stable.\nIn the quarter, recurring net income attributable to owners of the parent company reached $7.8 million, implying Recurring EPS of $0.10 vs $0.17 in the previous year. The lower recurring EPS can be traced to the drop in Adjusted EBITDA combined with higher taxes. Effective Tax Rate affecting Recurring Net Income was 51.3% vs 36.6% in Q1 2017 and is expected to normalize throughout the year.\nFree cash flow before interest and acquisitions was negative $34.9 million, mostly driven by higher one-off working capital, that is expected to be normalized throughout the year. Capex payment as percentage of revenues was 2.7%, compared to 2.2% in Q1 2017.\nAt the end of the first quarter, Atento's gross debt totaled $494.6 million, down 6.5% YoY, while net debt stood at $394.4 million versus $368.9 million in Q1 2017. The net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8x compared to 1.6x both in Q4 2017 and Q1 2017, reflecting lower cash position.\nAdjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.\nSegment Reporting\n($ in millions)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nCCY growth\nBrazil Region\nRevenue\n238.9\n238.4\n+3.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n26.4\n34.3\n-20.2%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n11.1%\n14.4%\n-3.3 p.p.\nOperating Income/(loss)\n(1.2)\n8.4\nn.m.\nAmericas Region\nRevenue\n190.6\n173.4\n+9.7%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n21.0\n17.4\n+18.5%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n11.0%\n10.0%\n+1.0 p.p.\nOperating Income/(loss)\n1.9\n1.9\n-11.0%\nEMEA Region\nRevenue\n63.9\n56.7\n-2.4%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n5.0\n4.5\n0.0%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n7.8%\n7.9%\n-0.1 p.p.\nOperating Income/(loss)\n0.4\n(0.9)\nn.m.\nBrazil Region\nIn the quarter, revenues in Brazil grew 3.6% year-on-year, driven mostly by 4.6% growth in revenues from Multisector clients, as a reflection of higher value added solutions growth. Revenue mix from Multisector increased 0.6 p.p. to 69.0%, as new wins from commercial activity remains solid, while revenues from Telefónica grew 1.4%, reflecting higher volumes in the region.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $26.4 million in Q1, while margin decreased 3.3 p.p. points to 11.1%, following Q4 2017 trends. While the continued weakness in volumes still lag economic recovery, we expect that the operational plans being executed should drive margins recovery in the second half of the year.\nAmericas Region\nRevenue growth was once again strong in Americas in the quarter, up 9.7% over the last year. Multisector continued to increase significantly, up 13.9% year-on-year, driven by volume increases specially in Argentina, Chile and Colombia. The strong performance pushed Multisector up 3.1 p.p. versus Q1 2017 to 59.6% of revenues. Revenues from Telefónica increased by 1.7%, reflecting continued positive results in Argentina, Mexico and Chile.\nIn the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA totaled $21.0 million, with margins up 1.0 p.p. to 11.0%, reflecting normalized profitability levels in contracts implemented during 2017.\nEMEA Region\nEMEA revenues decreased 2.4% in the quarter, as a result of a 8.0% decrease in Telefónica revenues, driven by lower volumes, partially offset by the strong 7.8% growth in Multisector, reflecting higher volumes from non-TEF Telcos. In the quarter, revenue mix from Multisector was up 3.7 p.p. to 38.9% of revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter totaled $5.0 million, with margins of 7.8% stable year-on-year, as a result of higher volumes from Multisector combined with operational efficiency initiatives implemented in the period.\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\nIn the quarter, operating cash flow totaled negative $17.0 million, while free cash flow before interest and acquisitions was negative $34.9 million, reflected by higher one-off working capital, that we expect to be normalized throughout the year. Capex payments totaled at 2.7% of revenues, versus 2.2% in Q1 2017.\nAt the end of Q1 2018, Atento held Cash and Cash equivalents of $100 million and revolving credit facilities of $104 million, out of which $90 million were undrawn, implying total liquidity of $190 million. Total net debt with third parties was $394.4 million and the Adjusted LTM EBITDA to net debt ratio was 1.8x, up from the 1.6x in both Q4 2017 and Q1 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nWe expect a favorable macro environment combined with stable regulatory frameworks which should support growth in 2018 and should compensate for potential political uncertainties arising from Presidential Elections in Colombia (May), Mexico (July) and Brazil (October).\nFor Fiscal 2018, we are targeting:\nGuidance\nConsolidated Revenue Growth (CCY)\n3% to 6%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin Range (CCY)\n11% to 12%\nNet Interest Expense Range\n$40MM to $45MM\nCash Capex (% of Revenue)\n3.5% to 4.0%\nEffective Tax Rate impacting Rec. Net Income\n35% to 38%\nDiluted Share Count\n~73.9MM shares\nCash Conversion as % of Adj. EBITDA\n35% to 40%\nShort Term trends\nWe expect Q1 and Q2 2018 revenues to be at the bottom range of the guidance. In terms of profitability, we expect seasonally lower Adjusted EBITDA Margins below guidance in Q1 and Q2.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, May 08, 2018 at 11:00 am ET to discuss its financial results.

Non-recurring items can be summarized as demonstrated below:\n(a)\nRestructuring costs incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily included restructuring activities and other personnel costs that were not related to our core results of operations. Restructuring costs incurred in three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily relates to the costs to adapt the organization in Argentina to the lower level of activities and the investments made in Brazil to implement a lower-cost operating model.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Earnings to profit/(loss):\nFor the three months ended March 31,\n($ in millions)\n2017\n2018\n(unaudited)\nProfit/(loss) from continuing operations\n9.0\n(1.7)\nAmortization of acquisition related intangible assets (a)\n6.8\n5.7\nRestructuring costs (b) (*)\n3.4\n-\nChange in fair value of financial instruments (c)\n-\n3.1\nNet foreign exchange (loss)/gain\n(3.3)\n2.8\nTax effect (d)\n(3.4)\n(2.4)\nTotal of add-backs\n3.5\n9.2\nAdjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) (unaudited)\n12.5\n7.5\nAdjusted Earnings per share (in U.S. dollars) (**) (unaudited)\n0.17\n0.10\nAdjusted Earnings attributable to Owners of the parent (non-GAAP) (unaudited)\n12.5\n7.8\nAdjusted Earnings per share attributable to Owners of the parent (in U.S. dollars) (**) (unaudited)\n0.17\n0.10\n(*)\nWe define non-recurring items as items that are limited in number, clearly identifiable, unusual, are unlikely to be repeated in the near future in the ordinary course of business and that have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations. Non-recurring items can be summarized as demonstrated below:\n(a)\nAmortization of acquisition related intangible assets represents the amortization expense of customer base, recorded as intangible assets. This customer base represents the fair value (within the business combination involving the acquisition of control of Atento Group) of the intangible assets arising from service agreements (tacit or explicitly formulated in contracts) with Telefónica Group and with other customers.\n(b)\nRestructuring costs incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily included restructuring activities and other personnel costs that were not related to our core results of operations. Restructuring costs incurred in three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily relates to the costs to adapt the organization in Argentina to the lower level of activities and the investments made in Brazil to implement a lower-cost operating model.\n(c)\nSince April 1, 2015, the Company designated the foreign currency risk on certain of its subsidiaries as net investment hedges using financial instruments as the hedging items. As a consequence, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument, related to the effective portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income (equity) as from that date. The gains or losses related to the ineffective portion are recognized in the statements of operations and for comparability, and those adjustments are added back to calculate Adjusted Earnings.\n(d)\nThe tax effect represents the impact of the taxable adjustments based on tax nominal rate by country. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the effective tax rate after moving non-recurring items is 51.1% and 49.3%, respectively.\n(**) Adjusted Earnings per share is calculated based on weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding of 73,909,056 as of March 31, 2017 and 2018.\nFinancing Arrangements\nAs of March 31,\n($ in millions, except Net Debt/Adj.

Net debt with third parties is not a measure defined by IFRS and it has limitations as an analytical tool. Net debt with third parties is neither a measure defined by or presented in accordance with IFRS nor a measure of financial performance, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative financial measure determined in accordance with IFRS. Net debt is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n2.\nAdjusted EBITDA LTM (Last Twelve Months) is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain acquisition and integration related costs, restructuring costs, management fees, site-relocation costs, financing fees and other items, which are not related to our core results of operations.\nFree Cash Flow:\nFor the three months\nended March 31,\n($ in millions)\n2017\n2018\n(unaudited) (***)\nOperating Cash Flow (1)\n7.7\n(17.0)\nCash Capex (2)\n(10.3)\n(13.4)\nIncome Tax Paid\n(5.7)\n(4.5)\nFree Cash Flow before interest and acquisitions\n(8.3)\n(34.9)\nAcquisitions\n0.0\n0.0\nNet Financial Expenses (3)\n(13.7)\n(20.2)\nFree Cash Flow (FCF)\n(22.0)\n(55.1)\n(1)\nWe define Operating Cash flow as Net Cash flow from/(used in) operating activities (as per 6K) adding back net interest and income tax expenses.\n(2)\nDoes not consider acquisitions\n(3)\nInterest payments related to the 2022 SSN are done every February and August, until Bond maturity in August 2022. Q1 2018 includes hedge adjustments of negative $3.1 million and withholding taxes of negative $1.6 million, versus hedge adjustments of positive $1.5 million and no withholding taxes in Q1 2017.\n(***) These preliminary results are unaudited and are based on management's initial review of operations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and remain subject to the completion of the Company's customary annual closing and review procedures.
