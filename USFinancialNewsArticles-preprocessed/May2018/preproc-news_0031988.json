FILE PHOTO: Rugby Union - Premiership - Wasps v Northampton Saints - Ricoh Arena, Coventry, Britain - April 29, 2018 Wasps' James Haskell gestures to the fans after the match Action Images/Andrew Boyers\nHaskell, who made over 200 appearances in 13 years at Wasps in two spells, was recalled by England coach Eddie Jones during this year’s Six Nations after nearly a year out of the squad.\nThe 33-year-old forward, who has earned 77 England caps, was not named in the squad for next month’s tour of South Africa and needed to stay in England to boost his hopes of playing in the 2019 World Cup.\n\"It's no secret that I want to continue my international career for as long as possible,\" Haskell told Northampton's website www.northamptonsaints.co.uk .\n“The only way I can do that is by putting my best foot forward in club rugby and helping Saints fight their way back into contention for silverware.”\nHaskell was hampered by injuries last season and made 15 Premiership appearances for Wasps, who finished third in the standings, six places above Northampton.\nEngland, who lost their last three Six Nations games, play South Africa in three tests in June.
