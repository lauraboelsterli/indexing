(the \"Company\" or \"Atkore\") (NYSE: ATKR) announced earnings for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended March 30, 2018.\n\"Once again, Atkore delivered strong results, as shown in our second quarter of fiscal 2018. We realized double-digit growth in Net sales, Adjusted EBITDA and Earnings per share through organic volume growth, productivity savings and accretive earnings from acquisitions,\" commented John Williamson, Atkore President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\"We're pleased to raise our full-year guidance based upon continued execution of our growth strategy, strong management practices and disciplined use of our business system that enable Atkore to deliver value for our customers and shareholders,\" Williamson added.\nOn March 30, 2018, the Company sold the assets of FlexHead Industries, Inc. and SprinkFLEX, LLC (together \"Flexhead\"). The Flexhead businesses manufacture commercial flexible sprinkler head connection products for use in a variety of markets, including for industrial, commercial, cold storage, institutional and clean room applications.\nOn January 8, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of Communications Integrators, Inc. (\"Cii\"), a manufacturer of modular, prefabricated power, voice and data distribution systems located in Tempe, Arizona for a total purchase price, including contingent consideration, of $4.0 million.\n2018 Second Quarter Results\nThree months ended (in thousands)\nMarch 30, 2018 March 31, 2017 Change % Change Net sales Electrical Raceway $ 324,787 $ 270,995 $ 53,792 19.8 % Mechanical Products & Solutions 120,310 102,180 18,130 17.7 % Eliminations (97 ) (384 ) 287 (74.7 )% Consolidated operations $ 445,000 $ 372,791 $ 72,209 19.4 % Adjusted EBITDA Electrical Raceway $ 56,404 $ 46,687 $ 9,717 20.8 % Mechanical Products & Solutions 16,722 15,457 1,265 8.2 % Unallocated (7,785 ) (6,022 ) (1,763 ) 29.3 % Consolidated operations $ 65,341 $ 56,122 $ 9,219 16.4 % Net sales increased by $72.2 million, or 19.4% to $445.0 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018 compared to $372.8 million for the prior-year period. Net sales increased $31.7 million due to the acquisitions of Marco Cable Management, Flexicon Limited, Calpipe Industries, LLC and Cii over the past twelve months. Additionally, net sales increased $24.3 million due to higher net average selling prices resulting from the pass-through impact of higher input costs of copper and steel and higher freight costs, and increased market prices for PVC electrical conduit and fittings products. Lastly, net sales increased $12.7 million partly due to higher volume of products sold within the Mechanical Products & Solutions segment, partially offset by lower volume of armored cable and fittings products sold within the Electrical Raceway segment.\nGross profit increased by $21.5 million, or 24.6% to $109.2 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to $87.6 million for the prior-year period. Gross margins increased to 24.5% for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to 23.5% for the prior-year period. Gross margins increased primarily due to increased market prices for PVC electrical conduit and fittings products, partially offset by the pass-through impact of higher input costs of steel and copper and higher freight costs.\nNet income increased by $23.6 million, or 124.8% to $42.6 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018 compared to $18.9 million for the prior-year period primarily due to a pre-tax gain on the sale of the assets of the Flexhead businesses of $26.7 million and higher operating income of $10.9 million. Partially offsetting the increase is a pre-tax gain on sale of a joint venture of $5.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, higher interest expense of $4.1 million and higher income tax expense of $3.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $9.2 million, or 16.4% to $65.3 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018 compared to $56.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to incremental Adjusted EBITDA from acquisitions over the past twelve months, increased volume and improved productivity costs, partially offset by higher average input costs of steel, copper and freight net of higher average selling prices and higher incentive-based compensation expense during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.79 for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to $0.28 in the prior-year period. Adjusted net income per diluted share increased by $0.23 to $0.63 for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to $0.40 for the prior-year period.\nSegment Results\nElectrical Raceway\nElectrical Raceway Net sales increased by $53.8 million, or 19.8%, to $324.8 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018 compared to $271.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to $31.7 million of additional sales resulting from acquisitions over the past twelve months and $23.1 million resulting from the pass-through impact of higher average input costs of copper and increased market prices for PVC electrical conduit and fittings products. The increase in sales was partially offset by lower volume of $4.3 million primarily of armored cable and fittings and flexible electrical conduit and fittings product categories.\nElectrical Raceway Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 30, 2018 increased by $9.7 million, or 20.8%, to $56.4 million from $46.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margins remained relatively flat at 17.4%. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was largely due to increased market prices for PVC electrical conduit and fittings products and incremental Adjusted EBITDA resulting from acquisitions over the past twelve months, partially offset by an increase in average input costs that exceeded our increase in average selling prices for armored cable and fittings products.\nMechanical Products & Solutions (\"MP&S\")\nMP&S Net sales increased by $18.1 million, or 17.7%, for the three months ended March 30, 2018 to $120.3 million compared to $102.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to $16.8 million of higher volume of products sold within the mechanical pipe and metal framing and fittings product categories.\nMP&S Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.3 million, or 8.2%, to $16.7 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018 compared to $15.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margins decreased to 13.9% for the three months ended March 30, 2018 compared to 15.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to higher volume of products sold, partially offset by an increase in average input costs which exceeded the increase in average selling prices.\nFull-Year 2018 Guidance\nThe Company is updating its expectation of fiscal year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $250.0 - $260.0 million (includes $2 million reduction from the sale of Flexhead) and its expectation of fiscal year 2018 Adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range to $2.40 - $2.50.\nReconciliations of the forward-looking full-year 2018 outlook for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income per diluted share are not being provided as the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliations.\nConference Call Information\nAtkore management will host a conference call today, May 8, 2018, at 8 a.m. Eastern time, to discuss the Company's financial results.

The Company assumes no obligation to update the information contained herein, which speaks only as of the date hereof.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release includes certain financial information, not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Because not all companies calculate non-GAAP financial information identically (or at all), the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, these measures should not be considered substitutes for the performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. See non-GAAP reconciliations below in this press release for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in evaluating the performance of our business, and we use each in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and as indicators of business performance and profitability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin allow us to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before: depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, income tax expense (benefit), restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, consulting fees, multi-employer pension withdrawal, certain legal matters, transaction costs, gain on sale of a business, gain on sale of joint venture and other items, such as inventory reserves and adjustments and realized or unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when presented in conjunction with comparable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") measures, is useful for investors because management uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the performance of our business.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales.\nNet Income Margin\nWe define Net Income Margin as Net income as a percentage of Net sales.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share\nWe use Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share in evaluating the performance of our business and profitability. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing the Company's results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure provide an indication of performance and profitability excluding the impact of unusual and or non-cash items. We define Adjusted net income as net income before consulting fees, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation, intangible asset amortization, gain on sale of joint venture, certain legal matters and other items. We define Adjusted net income per share as basic and diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impact of consulting fees, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation, intangible asset amortization, gain on sale of joint venture, certain legal matters and other items. Beginning in March 2018, the Company has excluded the impact of intangible asset amortization from the calculation of Adjusted Net income.\nLeverage Ratio - Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define leverage ratio as the ratio of net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing twelve month (\"TTM\") basis. We believe the leverage ratio is useful to investors as an alternative liquidity measure.\nATKORE INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC.
