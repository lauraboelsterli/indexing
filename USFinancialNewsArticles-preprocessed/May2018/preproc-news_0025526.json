We are pleased with our activity level in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, most of which occurred toward the end of the quarter, as well as our activity level quarter to date,” said Arthur H. Penn, Chairman and CEO. “Our growing portfolio, increases in LIBOR, and the doubling of PSSL should provide a strong tailwind to growing our earnings stream.”\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nIn May 2018, we doubled the financial capacity of PSSL. We and Kemper each increased our respective debt and equity investments in PSSL while continuing to own 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of each of the outstanding first lien secured debt and equity interests. Our commitments to fund first lien secured debt to PSSL were increased by $64.3 million and our commitments to fund equity interests in PSSL were increased by $27.6 million. Additionally, PSSL’s credit facility was amended to, among other things, allow for borrowing of up to $420.0 million at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions.\nThrough April 30, 2018, we have made investments totaling $62.8 million and PSSL has made investments totaling $43.0 million (of which $12.4 million was purchased from the Company).\nOn April 5, 2018, our board of directors approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the Small Business Credit Availability Act). As a result, the asset coverage requirements applicable to us for senior securities will be reduced from 200% to 150%, effective as of April 5, 2019, subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements.\nPennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC\nAs of March 31, 2018, PSSL’s portfolio totaled $221.2 million, consisted of 30 companies with an average investment size of $7.4 million and had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.6%. As of September 30, 2017, PSSL’s portfolio totaled $100.0 million, consisted of 18 companies with an average investment size of $5.6 million and had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.2%.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, PSSL invested $79.9 million (of which $6.2 million was purchased from the Company) in six new and three existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.4%.

This compares to investment income for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, which was $13.2 million and $25.9 million, respectively, and was attributable to $12.0 million and $23.3 million from first lien senior debt and $1.2 million and $2.6 million from second lien secured debt and subordinated debt, respectively. The increase in investment income compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to the growth of our portfolio.\nExpenses\nExpenses for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $7.1 million and $23.9 million, respectively. Base management fee for the same periods totaled $1.9 million and $3.8 million, incentive fee totaled $0.4 million (including $0.2 million on unrealized gains accrued but not payable) and $0.5 million (including $0.4 million on unrealized gains accrued but not payable), debt related interest and expenses totaled $3.5 million and $17.0 million (including $10.9 million in amendment costs on our multi-currency, senior secured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, and debt issuance costs on our 3.83% Series A notes due 2023, or the 2023 Notes), general and administrative expenses totaled $1.1 million and $2.2 million and provision for taxes totaled $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. This compares to expenses for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, which totaled $5.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively. Base management fee for the same periods totaled $1.7 million and $3.3 million, incentive fee totaled $0.5 million (including $(0.1) million on unrealized gains accrued but not payable) and $1.9 million (including $0.5 million on unrealized gains accrued but not payable), Credit Facility expenses totaled $2.0 million and $3.8 million, general and administrative expenses totaled $0.9 million and $1.9 million and provision for taxes totaled $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The increase in expenses compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to the expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Facility amendment and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes in the current period, which was partially offset by a reduction in incentive fees.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income totaled $9.4 million and $7.5 million, or $0.24 and $0.20 per share, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively. Net investment income totaled $8.0 million and $14.9 million, or $0.27 and $0.53 per share, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in net investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the growth of our portfolio, partially offset by higher recurring debt related interest and expense. The decrease in net investment income for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Facility amendment and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes in the current period.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nSales and repayments of investments for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $46.6 million and $195.7 million, respectively, and net realized gains (losses) totaled $1.5 million and $(1.3) million, respectively. Sales and repayments of investments for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $71.5 million and $141.9 million, respectively, and net realized gains totaled $2.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The change in realized gains/losses was primarily due to changes in the market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized.\nUnrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments, the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes\nFor the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, we reported net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments of $(0.6) million and $2.9 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, we reported net change in unrealized depreciation on investments of $2.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, our net unrealized appreciation on investments totaled $5.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on our investments compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital market conditions, the financial performance of certain portfolio companies and the reversal of unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments that were realized.\nFor the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, our Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes had a net change in unrealized depreciation of $5.3 million and $8.4 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, our Credit Facility had a net change in unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of less than $0.1 million and $(1.0) million, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, our net unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes totaled $5.4 million and $(3.1) million, respectively. The net change in unrealized depreciation compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets.\nNet Change in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nNet change in net assets resulting from operations totaled $15.6 million and $17.5 million, or $0.40 and $0.46 per share, respectively, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018. This compares to a net change in net assets resulting from operations of $7.3 million and $16.1 million, or $0.25 and $0.57 per share, respectively, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the net change in net assets from operations compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to the growth of our portfolio, partially offset by the expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Facility amendment and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes in the current period.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.\nThe annualized weighted average cost of debt for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment of 0.375% on the Credit Facility, amendment costs and debt issuance costs, was 7.40% and 2.91%, respectively (excluding amendment and debt issuance costs, amounts are 3.91% and 2.91%, respectively).\nAs of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had $190.2 million and $253.8 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, respectively. The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 3.79% and 3.18%, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had $214.8 million and $121.2 million of unused borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, respectively, subject to the regulatory restrictions.\nAs of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had cash equivalents of $48.4 million and $18.9 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur operating activities used cash of $111.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, and our financing activities provided cash of $142.1 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily from a follow-on equity offering and the issuance of the 2023 Notes, partially offset by net repayments under the Credit Facility.\nOur operating activities used cash of $116.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017, and our financing activities provided cash of $131.7 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily from a follow-on equity offering and net borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nDISTRIBUTIONS\nDuring the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, we declared distributions of $0.285 and $0.570 per share, respectively, for total distributions of $11.0 million and $21.5 million, respectively. For the same periods in the prior year, we declared distributions of $0.285 and $0.570 per share, respectively, for total distributions of $8.7 million and $16.3 million, respectively. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for taxation purposes may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of each calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe Company makes available on its website its report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and stockholders may find the report on its website at www.pennantpark.com .\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD.
