    "text": "BETHESDA, Md., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AGNC Investment Corp. (Nasdaq: AGNC) (\"AGNC\" or the \"Company\") announced today that its subsidiary MTGE Management, LLC has entered into an amendment to its management agreement with MTGE Investment Corp. (Nasdaq: MTGE) (\"MTGE\") in connection with the proposed acquisition of MTGE by Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NYSE: NLY). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.\nPursuant to the amendment, MTGE Management, LLC will continue to manage MTGE through the closing of the merger and for a short transitional period following the merger. In addition to regular monthly management fees payable for ongoing service, MTGE Management, LLC will be paid a termination fee of $41.7 million. Importantly, AGNC will retain all of its investment capabilities; personnel, including the employees responsible for investing on MTGE's behalf; and infrastructure.\n\"As AGNC's relationship with MTGE nears its end with MTGE's pending acquisition, we are extremely proud of what we, through our asset management subsidiary, have accomplished at MTGE and for its shareholders,\" said Gary Kain, AGNC's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer. \"From MTGE's initial public offering in 2011 through May 1, 2018, our portfolio management team has guided MTGE to an aggregate total stock return of 107%, or over 11% annualized. MTGE's performance in 2017 was particularly favorable, as it posted a total stock return of over 30% and an 18% economic return.\"\nFor further information or questions, please contact Investor Relations at (301) 968-9300 or IR@AGNC.com .\nABOUT AGNC INVESTMENT CORP.\nAGNC Investment Corp. is an internally-managed real estate investment trust that invests primarily in residential mortgage-backed securities for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise or a U.S. Government agency.
