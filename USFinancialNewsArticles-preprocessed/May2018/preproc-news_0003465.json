    "text": "May 4, 2018 / 10:12 AM / Updated 38 minutes ago Kremlin says still waiting for U.S. talks to set up Putin-Trump summit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Friday it was still waiting for substantive talks with the United States to set up a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump. FILE PHOTO: Russia's President Vladimir Putin talks to U.S. President Donald Trump during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 7, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo\nTrump said in March that the two leaders would meet soon, but since then already poor ties between Washington and Moscow have deteriorated further over the conflict in Syria and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Friday that there was still no clarity on a possible meeting between the two leaders and that no further steps had been taken by Washington to arrange it.\n“We are waiting,” Peskov said.
