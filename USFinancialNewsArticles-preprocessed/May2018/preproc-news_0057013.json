    "text": "0 COMMENTS Could titanium dioxide—a common ingredient in sunscreen—help buildings act as air purifiers? That’s the goal of Pureti, a Cincinnati-based manufacturer that offers a façade-cladding treatment in which titanium dioxide nanoparticles are sprayed onto the components of a building’s exterior. When ultraviolet rays hit the treated surface, they set off chemical processes that burn away grime and convert contaminants such as nitrogen dioxide into nontoxic minerals and water vapor. The result: a self-cleaning structure that also cleanses the air around it.\nThe technology is getting its first residential application at 570 Broome Street in Manhattan, a 54-unit apartment tower where the Pureti-treated façade is currently being installed. According to Pureti chief executive Glen Finkel, the treatment increases a developer’s cost by less than 5%. The technology was developed in partnership with Neolith by TheSize, the company behind the sintered stone slabs used at 570 Broome.\nNewsletter Sign-up Researchers at Louisiana State University performed lab tests and a field study with Pureti’s technology and determined it was effective 50% to 70% of the time, depending on environmental conditions. Using that research as a foundation, Pureti calculated that the treated façade at 570 Broome will have an environmental impact equivalent to removing 625 cars from the road. “One building is not going to really change things,” Mr. Finkel says. “But if cities begin to adopt this technology, they could transform their outdoor environments.”\nPureti is collaborating with several European countries through a program known as iScape, backed by the European Commission, that helps cities develop sustainable strategies to fight air pollution. As part of the project, Pureti is finalizing an agreement to treat a portion of the port of Barcelona later this year.\nPureti has also partnered with NASA to develop new products for the agency, which has explored self-cleaning-surfaces and photocatalytic solutions for use on Earth and in space. A spokeswoman for NASA said its work with Pureti demonstrated that the coatings could keep surfaces clean and reduce maintenance costs—a benefit for space agencies and luxury developers alike.\nWrite to Katherine Clarke at katherine.clarke@wsj.com",
