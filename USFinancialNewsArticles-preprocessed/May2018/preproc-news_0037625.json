    "text": "NEWPORT BEACH, CA, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADVANTIS CORPORATION (OTC PINK: ADVT) announced it is finalizing a contract to acquire a percentage of Herb N Works, the premier creative branding and marketing company in the cannabis industry. According to Advantis CEO, Darren Cherry, “final valuations and ownership ratios are being worked out, and completion of the agreement is imminent.”\nAdvantis is quickly scaling its business to handle the increased demand of its flagship product, Amster-Can. The patented canning and storage solution has gained traction, while establishing its brand name recognition throughout the industry. As the company grows, Cherry says he is constantly establishing logistical efficiencies and keeps an eye out for relationships that further supports the company’s current and future needs to expand. “Herb N Works has expertise in social media, graphic design, and web programming along with their marketing acumen and established client base,” Cherry explained. “Business is exploding, and we have a product and client base that will appreciate the product mix that Herb N Works represents. Joy vape cartridges and extracts, Happy J’s Premium Chocolate, and H&J Family Farms are just a few of the brands they have helped grow.” Herb N Works specializes in branding, content creation, event planning and marketing strategies, created by a marketing staff with decades of experience. “Not only will we have additional high-demand brands to represent, but we’ll have access to graphic artists, web designers, and social media experts that will help further establish our brand name in the marketplace. We’ll be able to develop our marketing material in-house, which is a huge cost savings, as well. The synergy of this deal will create a direct benefit to the bottom line,” Cherry stated.\nCherry says that when the deal is complete, he intends on putting the synergy to work immediately. “The first step will be to redesign our marketing, media, and web presentation,” Cherry said. “This deal will support our operational structure and allow us to put forth a more well-branded online face.” Cherry shared some private comments about the company’s current web presence and says that he is well aware of how the company needs to improve in the area. “Our operations have been so focused on expansion and client acquisition, that we had no focus on our media presence. That is about to change.” Cherry says that while he continues to expect over twenty percent quarter over quarter revenue growth based on current Amster-Can orders, there is a tremendous leap the company is poised to make. According to Cherry, “The demand for Amster-Can is driving our effort to build significantly greater canning capacity to fill that demand; I mean on a much more industrial scale. We could currently be canning a hundred times as much as we are now, if we had more canning capacity. That is no exaggeration; this is how much demand we have right now. While we continue to focus on expanding on our capacity for the next stage of our growth, it is paramount to create, maintain and nourish a professionally designed public image through social media channels. We also need the online presence to more effectively market our own products, partners, and of course the upcoming pet division. This deal allows us to do all of that,” Cherry concluded.\nAdvantis wishes to thank Investors Hangout for mentioning the company in their podcast.\nLinks to Advantis websites can be found at advantiscorp.com , rosin6.com , elixicure.com , and amstercan.com\nAbout Advantis Corporation\nAdvantis Corporation (ADVT) focuses on the development of innovative products that supply the medical, research, and pharmaceutical industries.
