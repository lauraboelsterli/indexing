    "text": "LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament should not be given powers to overturn the result of the 2016 referendum on membership of the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said on Monday as opponents seek a great say on the Brexit deal.\n“The withdrawal bill is about ensuring we leave the EU in a smooth and orderly manner. It is not a mechanism for overturning the referendum,” the spokesman said ahead of a debate in the upper house of parliament on the legislation that will end Britain’s EU membership.\nAmendments to that legislation to give parliament a greater say over final deal would weaken Britain’s negotiating position, the spokesman said.
