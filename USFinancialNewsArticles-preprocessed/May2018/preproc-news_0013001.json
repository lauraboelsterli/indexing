    "text": "CLEVELAND, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (\"TransDigm Group\") (NYSE: TDG) announced today that on May 2, 2018, its wholly-owned subsidiary, TransDigm UK Holdings plc (the \"Company\"), priced its private offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior subordinated notes due 2026 (the \"Notes\"). The Notes will be issued at a price of 99.240% of their principal amount. The Notes will be guaranteed by TransDigm Group, its wholly-owned subsidiary, TransDigm Inc., and all of TransDigm Inc.'s existing and future domestic subsidiaries on a senior subordinated basis. The offering is expected to close on May 8, 2018.\nTransDigm Group intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with the proceeds of $700 million in additional tranche E term loans, to replenish the cash used to fund the purchase price for its acquisitions of the Kirkhill elastomers business and Extant Components Group Holding, Inc. This cash and the remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including potential future acquisitions, dividends or repurchases under its stock repurchase program.\nThe Notes and related guarantees were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\"), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and the related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption from the Securities Act, applicable state securities or blue sky laws and foreign securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities, nor shall there be any sales of securities mentioned in this press release in any state or foreign jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or foreign jurisdiction.\nAbout TransDigm Group\nTransDigm Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today.

All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TransDigm Group's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, TransDigm Group.

Further information regarding the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results can be found in TransDigm Group's Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports that TransDigm Group or its subsidiaries have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
