    "text": "HOUSTON, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Electric Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AETI), a leading supplier of power delivery solutions for the global energy industry, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFor the quarter, the company reported revenue of $8.3 million, up 3% compared with the first quarter of 2017 but down from the $12.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to reduced backlog in the company’s oil and gas sector entering 2018.\nThe company reported a 32% improvement in backlog, up from year ending backlog of $18.9 million to $24.9 million. This backlog increase included a multi-million dollar marine vessel project award and will be recognized as revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2018.\nThe Company reported an EBITDA loss (a non-U.S. GAAP measure) of $2.5 million for the quarter, compared with an EBITDA loss of $2.2 million in Q1 of 2017 and an EBITDA breakeven in Q4 2017.\nIn the quarter, the company also announced a 10 year extension of its BOMAY joint venture in China.\n\"Although we saw backlog growth in Q1 and are seeing recovery in our traditional drilling and marine businesses, our financial results in Q1 were unacceptable and liquidity remains tight,” said Charles Dauber, AETI president and chief executive officer.\nOn May 7 th , the company announced it has engaged Oppenheimer & Co. as its exclusive investment banker to assist in addressing liquidity and strategic options for growth.\n“We are pleased with the progress Oppenheimer has made in providing us with multiple options to strengthen our balance sheet and enable us to execute our growth plan,” said Dauber.\nConference Call\nAETI will conduct a conference call at 11 a.m. EST on May 15, 2018 to discuss the results with analysts, investors and other interested parties.
