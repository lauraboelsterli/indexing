    "text": "PHOENIX, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mobivity Holdings Corp. (OTCQB:MFON), maker of the award-winning re•currency platform that increases customer visits and spend in restaurants, retail, and personal care brands today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31 st , 2018 (“Q1 2018”).\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nUnder the new accounting standard, ASC606, new customer wins largely contributed to increasing total revenue to $3.7 million, representing a 75% increase over first quarter 2017 revenue of $2.1 million.\nTotal minimum contract values increased to more than $21 million.\nGross margins climbed to 79% under the new ASC606 accounting standard.\nDeferred revenue increased to $1.6 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $1.4 million as of March 31, 2017.\nA major Consumer Packaged Goods (“CPG”) brand contributed to a large contract win during the quarter and this growing partnership has begun joint selling Mobivity’s re•currency platform to its more than 700 restaurant brand clients.\nDennis Becker, Mobivity Chairman and CEO, commented, “I’m pleased to report that during the first quarter of this year we drove strong growth in our sales pipeline that is now bearing fruit and accelerating topline revenue performance. Our mission all along has been to empower brick and mortar brands with the ability to leverage data in driving consumer behavior to improve business performance – and the market is starting to take notice like never before. Current events, including Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony to Congress, highlight just how powerful data is in shaping consumer behavior. The fact that the outcome of a presidential election may have been swayed by leveraging consumer data to target information speaks volumes as to the immense power data can have on influencing the behavior of people. High profile events, such as Facebook’s implication in the 2016 presidential election, are creating an awakening to the power of data across all industries and we’re now well positioned to lead in the transformation of brick and mortar commerce to a data driven world.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results:\nMobivity Holdings Corp.

A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in the tables of today's press release. Non-GAAP adjusted net income is supplemental to results presented under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are used by management to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis of Mobivity's operating performance and liquidity. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of Mobivity's business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other similar measures reported in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Mobivity\nBrick and mortar stores struggle to manage customer connections in a digital world.
