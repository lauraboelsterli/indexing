    "text": "Leading Pharmaceutical Industry Executive Brings Prescription Drug Pricing Expertise to New Role\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Blink Health , the technology company solving for America’s prescription drug price crisis, today announced that Susan Lang, one of the country’s foremost experts in prescription medication pricing, benefits management, and pharmacy networks, has joined Blink Health as Chief Strategy Officer. Lang spent six years as the Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain officer at Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit management company in the U.S., where she managed over $50B in drug spend and founded Econdisc, one of the largest group purchasing organizations of generic medications in the country. In her new role, Lang will lead Blink Health's strategic development process and oversee the company's supply chain efforts, including the company’s pharmacy network.\nMost recently, Lang founded healthcare consulting firm XIL Consulting, where she serves as an industry consultant specializing in market access and drug pricing. Earlier in her career, she spent 15 years on the clinical side managing hospitals and working with caregivers.\n“Susan’s unmatched experience in prescription medication pricing, strategic business development, and health economics will help us accelerate our ability to make prescription medications affordable for everyone,” said Geoffrey Chaiken, co-founder and CEO, Blink Health. “In addition, Susan’s work in clinical settings with caregivers and patients gives her a rich understanding of people’s healthcare needs. Susan shares our passion for making the prescription drug market more equitable and is an outstanding addition to our executive team.\"\n“Blink Health’s technology, values, and business model uniquely positions the company to make the complicated pharmaceutical supply chain more transparent and patient-friendly,” said Lang. “I’m excited to join Blink Health’s world-class team to help develop new models and partnerships that create value for patients and pharmacies while offering the lowest prices on prescription drugs to Americans who need them most.”\nAbout Blink Health\nBlink Health makes prescriptions affordable for everyone with the guaranteed lowest prices on nearly all generic medications commonly prescribed.
