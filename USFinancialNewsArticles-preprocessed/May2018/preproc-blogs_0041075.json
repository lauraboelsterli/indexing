Here’s essential reading on today’s developments.\nMUST READS FROM WSJ CITY\nTwo anti-establishment parties poised to take power in Italy have finalised a coalition agreement that challenges the constraints of the euro. That sets up a possible fight with European leaders who only recently steered the common currency through a deep crisis.\nTwo cryptocurrency firms have talked to US regulators about the possibility of obtaining banking licences, a move that would allow startups to broaden the products they offer. The notion is relatively new in the crypto space, which has drawn scrutiny from US officials for allowing rapid growth in transactions outside the regulated financial system.\nWhen Argentina issued a 100-year bond it was taken by many as a case of market froth. Investors could hardly get more enthusiastic about emerging markets than lending for a century to a country that averaged a default every 25 years, James Mackintosh writes. So with Argentina now asking for a rescue from the IMF, were the sceptics were right? Not so much.\nThe former Russian spy poisoned in the UK more than two months ago has been released from hospital. Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were exposed to a nerve agent in March. The UK blamed Moscow. The hospital said Skripal’s recovery would continue elsewhere.\nPayPal has long been the king of peer-to-peer payments and a big player in online payments, but has had a very limited presence in stores, writes Paul J Davies for Heard on the Street. The company’s acquisition of a fast-growing Swedish payments company called iZettle is a smart but expensive way to fill that gap.\nA relatively calm week in markets nonetheless saw some important developments. Oil prices continued to surge, as did borrowing costs in the US. MSCI named the Chinese companies it will soon admit to its indexes. Smaller American stocks outpaced their more famous cousins, and Italy gave investors a fright. Here are five things that shaped markets this week.\nWeekend Reading: Why the Royal Wedding is bad news for Prince William impersonators, a new sexism probe at Coutts, and Mohammed bin Salman’s guide to getting rich.\nIN THE PAPERS\nLewd Hat Prompts New Sexism Probe at Coutts — WSJ\nSanctions-Hit Deripaska Quits Russia’s EN+ Board — Reuters\nUK’s Plan for Customs Union ‘Backstop’ Faces Tests in Brussels — FT (£)\nUS Scrapped Training Exercise With South Korea Involving B-52s — WSJ\nPlastic Waste Discovered in Remotest Part of the Ocean — The Times (£)\nMARKETS TODAY\nUS stocks were heading for weekly losses, and showed signs of stalling on Friday as uncertainty over politics, trade policies and interest rates kept investors subdued. Heavy losses accumulated earlier in the week among shares of utilities and real-estate companies were also set to drag the three main US indexes for the week.\nAmong the political risks were new government proposals in Europe, doubts over the US/North Korea summit in June and trade talks with China. A rally in oil and rising bond yields stoked bets on rising inflation, which could pressure earnings.\nIn Europe, stocks closed down on the day but notched moderate gains for the week. The exception: Italy, where shares continued to struggle as investors weighed the country’s political risk. Italian banks bore the brunt of losses: Unione de Banchi Italiane fell 7.8% while UniCredit shed 2.7%. The euro was a little lower against the dollar.\nIn London, Paddy Power Betfair led the index higher, gaining 2.3%. The bookmaker’s stock gained more than 21% this week after a favourable legal ruling opened up the US market.\nShare this: Previous Dirty Japanese Data",
