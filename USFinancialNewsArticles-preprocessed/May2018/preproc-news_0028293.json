    "text": "CINCINNATI, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Workhorse Group Inc. (NASDAQ: WKHS ), an American technology company focused on providing sustainable and cost-effective electric mobility solutions to the transportation sector, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Operational Highlights\nAnnounced an expanded partnership with UPS for up to 1000 N-GEN electric delivery vans. Deployed the first N-GEN production intent vehicle executing live deliveries in the San Francisco Bay Area. Received patent for HorseFlyâ„¢ truck-launched drone delivery system from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Initiated change-over to production facility in preparation for assembly of N-GEN and W-15 platforms, increasing line capacity to 30 units per day. In partnership with Dana, unveiled a new city delivery vehicle, built on the Workhorse E-series platform. Closed a private placement, led by existing investors and insiders including company CEO and director Steve Burns, as well as directors H. Benjamin Samuels and Gerald Budde.\nManagement Commentary\n\"The first quarter was both productive and eventful across all of our vehicle and aircraft platforms, but it was also a period that signified the beginning of a greater evolution for our company,\" said Workhorse CEO Steve Burns. \"In Q1 we began adapting the manufacturing facility to account for the large-scale production plans we have for our N-GEN electric delivery van as well as our W-15 electric pickup. With a more streamlined operation, we will look to make significant progress in reducing our sizeable backlog and remain committed to our production goal of 2,000 vehicles, with positive gross material margins on those vehicles, by the end of 2018.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nSales for the first quarter of 2018 were recorded at $0.6 million, down from $1.6 million in the same period of 2017 as well as from a record performance in Q4 2017 where the company demonstrated our improved production capability.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 26% to $2.4 million from $1.9 million in the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increases in legal and consulting expenses for the planned SureFly spinoff as well as employee salaries and benefits due to increased headcount during the period.\nResearch and development expenses decreased 28% to $2.3 million from $3.2 million in the same period last year. The decrease in research and development expenses was due primarily to decreases in prototype expenses for both the United States Postal Service (USPS) Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) and SureFly.\nTotal operating expenses decreased 8% to $4.7 million from $5.1 million in the first quarter of last year. The decrease in total operating expenses was due to decreases in prototype expenses for both the USPS NGDV and SureFly, which was offset by increases in legal and consulting expenses for the planned SureFly spinoff as well as employee salaries and benefits due to increased headcount during the period.\nNet loss was $6.4 million, compared with a net loss of $7.9 million in the same period last year. This is due primarily to more favorable gross profit.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $0.8 million compared to $4.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nWorkhorse management will hold a conference call today (May 9, 2018) at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss these results.\nWorkhorse management will host the presentation, followed by a question and answer period.\nU.S. dial-in: 1-877-407-0792\nInternational dial-in: 1-201-689-8263\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.
