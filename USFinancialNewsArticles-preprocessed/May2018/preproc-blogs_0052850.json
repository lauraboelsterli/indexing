    "text": "Supermarket Publix suspends political giving amid anti-NRA protest organized by Parkland survivors Published 15 Hours Ago The Associated Press Jonathan Ernst | Reuters David Hogg, a student at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, site of a February mass shooting which left 17 people dead in Parkland, Florida, thrusts his fist in the air as he speaks during the \"March for Our Lives\" event demanding gun control after recent school shootings at a rally in Washington, March 24, 2018.\nThe Publix supermarket chain says it's suspending political contributions as it reevaluates its giving policy after students from the Parkland, Florida high school where 17 people were killed called for a boycott because it supports a candidate aligned with the National Rifle Association .\nStudent activists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School staged \"die in\" protests at two Publix stores Friday. They are upset over contributions Publix made to Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam, who has called himself an NRA sellout. @davidhogg111: .@Publix is a #NRASellOut In Parkland we will have a die in the Friday (the 25th) before memorial day weekend. Starting at 4pm for 12 min inside our 2 Publix stores. Just go an lie down starting at 4. Feel free to die in with us at as many other @Publix as possible.\nPublix announced earlier this week that it would \"reevaluate\" its donations amid the outcry. In another statement Friday it announced it would halt its contributions for now.\nThe statement emailed by Publix spokeswoman Maria Brous said the company would \"suspend corporate-funded political contributions as we reevaluate our giving processes.\" show chapters",
