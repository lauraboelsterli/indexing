The funds were used by Venezuela and Mozambique to pay works carried out by Brazilian firms.\nBrazilian President Michel Temer had earlier warned that if Congress did not approve covering the payment, the government would have been considered as having defaulted on the loans.\n($1 = 3.5511 reais)",
