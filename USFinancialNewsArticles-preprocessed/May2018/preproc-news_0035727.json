FILE PHOTO: A branded sign is displayed outside a William Hill betting shop in London, Britain July 25, 2016. REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo\nWilliam Hill expects total gaming net revenue to fall by 35-45 percent, while Paddy Power sees a 33-43 percent decline in its machine gaming revenue.\nRival GVC Holdings Plc ( GVC.L ) said it expects to be able to reposition its business within two years following implementation, with fully mitigated impact of about 120 million pounds on its core earnings.\nThe cut to two pounds from the current 100 pounds curtails a major source of revenue for high street bookmakers and potentially puts jobs at risk.
