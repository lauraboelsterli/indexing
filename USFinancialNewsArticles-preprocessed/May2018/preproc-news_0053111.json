French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian attends a meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, France, May 18, 2018.

This posture risks endangering the region more,” Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Inter radio.\nHe said Paris would continue to implement the agreement even if it did agree with the U.S. that Iran’s ballistic missile activity and regional hegemonic ambitions needed to be curbed.
