    "text": "LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HFF Real Estate Limited (HFF) announces the £90.8 million acquisition financing of CAA House, two interconnected office buildings totaling 222,269 square feet in London’s Covent Garden, Midtown submarket.\nThe HFF team worked on behalf of the borrower, Seaforth Land Holdings Limited, to secure the five-year loan through Blackstone’s Real Estate Debt Strategies division. In conjunction with this acquisition loan, Blackstone is also extending financing toward the refurbishment of the property.\nCAA House comprises two buildings at 1 Kemble Street and 45-59 Kingsway that are connected via a two-story link bridge on the first and second floors. Originally developed as “Space House” in 1969, the properties were listed in 2015 as “Grade II” by English Heritage. 1 Kemble Street is a 16-storey, 138,556-square-foot building and 45 Kingsway has 62,607 square feet within eight storeys. The property offers parking for 22 vehicles and common basements offering 21,106 square feet of ancillary accommodation. Located in the dynamic Covent Garden submarket, CAA House is close to many of London’s iconic entertainment and cultural offerings, including Leicester Square, Soho, Covent Garden Piazza, Royal Opera House, Somerset House, the British Museum and the Theatre District. Additionally, Covent Garden has become a world-renowned shopping and leisure destination attracting more than 45 million visitors per year. CAA House is well served by transport being situated close to Holborn, Covent Garden and Temple tube stations as well as the new Elizabeth Line station at Tottenham Court Road set to open this year.\nTyler Goodwin, CEO of Seaforth Land, comments: “As a value investor and a fiduciary, Blackstone’s facility helps us generate a compelling risk adjusted return while maintaining a conservative loan to value ratio. Blackstone and HFF have been a pleasure to work with, particularly given the exceptionally competitive market for this off-market transaction. They immediately recognised our vision for place-making with unique and creative office and retail space. We’re looking forward to returning ‘Spacehaus’ to the London office market as a celebration of mid-century modern Brutalist architecture.”\nMichael Zerda, Managing Director and Head of Europe for Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies, said: “This transaction is an excellent example of Blackstone’s ability to provide senior loans against high quality real estate, in support of high calibre borrowers at competitive terms. CAA House is a prominent landmark in London’s Covent Garden, and Seaforth Land sought a low-leverage yet flexible lending solution which fits squarely within our investment parameters.”\nThe HFF debt placement team included senior managing director Michael Kavanau and managing director Edward Daubeney.\nAbout Seaforth Land Holdings Limited\nSeaforth Land is a real estate operating partner for professional and institutional investors.
