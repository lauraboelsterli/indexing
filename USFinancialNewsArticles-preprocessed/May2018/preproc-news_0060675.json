    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - State-controlled PetroChina will this year start building two underground natural gas storage sites in China’s southwest at a total cost of 5.3 billion yuan ($825.7 million), the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: PetroChina's logo is seen at its petrol station in Beijing, China, March 21, 2016. Picture taken March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Co will build the facilities, which will ensure combined annual supply of 1.28 billion cubic metres of gas on completion in 2022, in Tongluoxia and Huangcaoxia in the municipality of Chongqing, Xinhua said.\nChina is aiming to turn hundreds of wells, including in mountainous Chongqing, into storage facilities for gas piped over from Myanmar and Turkmenistan, after a severe winter supply crunch left it short of the clean-burning fuel.\nThe PetroChina unit plans to build six gas storage sites in Chongqing, Xinhua said, after which the region will become China’s largest underground gas storage base.\nPetroChina did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
