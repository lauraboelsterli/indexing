    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, CSI Compressco LP (\"CSI Compressco\") (NASDAQ: CCLP) today announced first quarter 2018 consolidated financial results.\nConsolidated revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $85.4 million compared to $83.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $65.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenues increased 3% driven by a 29% increase in Aftermarket Services. Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $15.7 million compared to a net loss of $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $15.6 million in first quarter of 2017.\nSelected key operational and financial metrics are as follows:\nOrders for new equipment sales in the first quarter of 2018 were $71.5 million, which included a previously announced $67 million order for large horsepower equipment to be fabricated for a midstream operator in the Permian Basin. This equipment is expected to ship during the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019. Backlog for new equipment sales was $102.5 million as of March 31, 2018. Overall, service fleet utilization increased 100 basis points (bps) compared to the end of the fourth quarter, to 84.2%. Utilization for large horsepower equipment, greater than 1000 hp per unit, increased to 92.9%, up 60 bps sequentially. Distributable cash flow (1) for the quarter was $4.9 million, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 0.64X Completed a $350 million private offering of senior secured notes due 2025 to retire existing bank revolver debt and increase liquidity to fund growth capital opportunities and for general partnership purposes. Adjusted EBITDA (1) was $19.2 million compared to $21.0 million in the fourth quarter.\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the nearest GAAP number on Schedules B, and C\nAs of March 31, 2018, aggregate compression services fleet horsepower totaled 1,085,088 and the fleet utilization rate was 84.2%. Utilization of our highest horsepower category, equipment of greater than 1000 horsepower per unit, was 92.9% at the end of the quarter. We define the fleet utilization rate as the aggregate compressor package horsepower in service divided by the aggregate compressor package fleet horsepower as of a given date. We do not exclude idle horsepower under repair or horsepower that is otherwise impaired from our calculation of utilization rate.\nUnaudited results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior quarter and the corresponding prior year quarter are presented in the accompanying financial tables.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nQ1-18 vs.\nQ4-17\nQ1-18 vs.\nQ1-17\n(In Thousands, Except Ratios, and Percentages)\nNet loss\n$ (15,737)\n$ (10,673)\n$ (15,593)\n(47)%\n(1)%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$ 19,190\n$ 21,022\n$ 19,873\n(9)%\n(3)%\nDistributable cash flow (1)\n$ 4,886\n$ 5,368\n$ 7,093\n(9)%\n(31)%\nQuarterly cash distribution per unit\n$ 0.1875\n$ 0.1875\n$ 0.1875\n—\n—\nDistribution coverage ratio (1)\n0.64x\n0.73x\n1.09x\n—\n—\nFleet capital expenditures\n$ 15,245\n$ 6,886\n$ —\n121%\n—\nNet cash provided/(used) by operating activities\n$ (365)\n$ 14,496\n$ 1,821\n(103)%\n(120)%\nFree cash flow(1)\n$ (17,404)\n$ 3,083\n$ (5,394)\n—\n—\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the nearest GAAP number on Schedules B and C.\nOwen Serjeant, President of CSI Compressco, commented, \"The compression market continues to be in the midst of a robust recovery as each of our operations continue to see an increase in inquiries and demand for equipment. The Compression Services business continues to see growing demand for higher horsepower equipment for major oil plays in North America to compress and move millions of cubic feet of associated gas. The areas with the most activity and demand include the Permian and Eagle Ford Basins as well as the SCOOP/STACK areas in Oklahoma. CSI Compressco is well positioned in those basins with over 60% of our operating horsepower deployed in these territories. To better support market demand for our products, we now expect to invest in 2018 between $90 and $110 million in growth and maintenance capital. We expect all growth capital to be supported by contracts before they are built. Given the growing demand for large horsepower equipment, we expect our growth capital to primarily focus on units of over 1,000 horsepower with our core customers in the basins we have the most penetration. This allows for maximum operational efficiencies in areas where customers need additional horsepower for either gas lift and/or gas gathering operations.\"\n\"Compression Services revenue was $53.7 million in the first quarter. Compression services margins of 41.6% included approximately $1 million of labor and parts costs to restart equipment in the Texas region following unusually cold freezing weather conditions in January. Additionally, the first quarter included approximately $1 million of other non-recurring field related costs.\"\n\"As demand continues to grow and lead times extend, we have been reviewing pricing with our customers and have increased our compression services rates up to 15% as opportunities come up and contracts roll over. These increases will begin to be reflected in our second quarter 2018 results. We are working closely with our customers on this to ensure we satisfy their capacity and equipment reliability needs as well as reflect today's pricing, which has been trending up within this industry.\"\n\"Complementing our Compression Services business is our new unit sales activities. After record bookings in the first quarter of 2018, our backlog ended the quarter at $102.5 million. We are able to fabricate this equipment in our facility in Midland, Texas assuring competitive lead times and pricing. Activity in this business continues to remain strong with increasing quotation activities for North America and Latin America.\"\n\"Our Aftermarket Services business continues to excite and delivered exceptional growth year over year. We have been able to leverage our Compression Services footprint, resources and operational competencies to deliver high levels of Aftermarket Services to our customers in areas such as spare parts, overhauls, reapplication engineering and site technical support. As we focus on this business and invest in it in terms of resources on a focused basis, we expect to see this growth to continue well into 2018 and 2019.\"\n\"Finally, we estimate that the overall compression fleet size in North America is greater than 10 million horsepower today and expect approximately another one million horsepower will be added through 2018 and 2019. We expect to fabricate and deploy approximately 115,000 horsepower to our fleet in 2018, which would put our fleet at approximately 1.2 million horsepower. We remain the only vertically integrated company in this space which gives us a competitive advantage on building and deploying the new build equipment faster and more cost effectively. With the recent successful completion of the $350 million secured bond offering, we have the capital available to respond to these opportunities. We expect our returns will continue to improve with the price increases that we are successfully attaining.\"\nForward-Looking Guidance\nProjected 2018 total capital expenditures are expected to be between $90 million and $110 million, inclusive of $15 million to $20 million for maintenance capital expenditures. We expect to fund these capital expenditures from the recently completed bond offering. We are also expecting to have in place an asset based revolver of $50 million to provide incremental liquidity. Our new debt structure without maintenance covenants allows us to better respond to investment opportunities.\nAs a result of the service price increases that we are attaining, which will gain traction in the second quarter of 2018, and the new equipment sales backlog that we will start delivering in the second quarter of 2018, and when combined with the new equipment being deployed to our fleet, we expect to see a material improvement in Adjusted EBITDA from our first quarter, 2018 run rate. We expect total year adjusted EBITDA to be between $95 million and $100 million. We expect total year revenue to be between $385 million and $400 million. A reconciliation of expected Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP financial measure is included on Schedule D.\nConference Call\nCSI Compressco will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results today, May 7, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The phone number for the call is 1-866-374-8397. The conference will also be available by live audio webcast and may be accessed through CSI Compressco's website at www.csicompressco.com .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Cash Distribution on Common Units\nOn April 20, 2018, CSI Compressco announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared a cash distribution attributable to the first quarter of 2018 of $0.1875 per outstanding common unit, which will be paid on May 15, 2018 to common unitholders of record as of the close of business on May 1, 2018. The distribution coverage ratio (which is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure defined and reconciled to the closest GAAP financial measure below) for the first quarter of 2018 was 0.64X.\nCSI Compressco Overview\nCSI Compressco is a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage.

Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by the Partnership's management to:\nassess the Partnership's ability to generate available cash sufficient to make distributions to the Partnership's unitholders and general partner; evaluate the financial performance of its assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; measure operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of our competitors; and determine the Partnership's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures.\nThe Partnership defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and before certain non-cash charges consisting of impairments, bad debt expense attributable to bankruptcy of customer, non-cash costs of compressors sold, equity compensation, fair value adjustments of our Preferred Units, administrative expenses under the Omnibus Agreement paid in equity using common units, severance expense, write-off of unamortized financing costs, and software implementation expense.\nDistributable cash flow is used as a supplemental financial measure by the Partnership's management, as it provides important information relating to the relationship between our financial operating performance and our cash distribution capability. Additionally, the Partnership uses distributable cash flow in setting forward expectations and in communications with the board of directors of our general partner. The Partnership defines distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less current income tax expense, maintenance capital expenditures, interest expense, and severance expense, plus non-cash interest expense.\nThe Partnership believes that the distribution coverage ratio provides important information relating to the relationship between the Partnership's financial operating performance and its cash distribution capability. The Partnership defines the distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total quarterly distribution payable, which includes, as applicable, distributions payable on all outstanding common units, the general partner interest and the general partner's incentive distribution rights.\nThe Partnership defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, net of sales proceeds. Management primarily uses this metric to assess our ability to retire debt, evaluate our capacity to further invest and grow, and measure our performance as compared to our peer group of companies.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, free cash flow or other similarly titled measures of other entities, as other entities may not calculate these non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner as CSI Compressco. Management compensates for the limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating this knowledge into management's decision making process. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that CSI Compressco has available for distributions or that the Partnership plans to distribute for a given period, nor should they be equated to available cash as defined in the Partnership's partnership agreement.\nSchedule B - Reconciliation of Net Income/(Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio (unaudited)\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\n(In Thousands, Except Ratios)\nNet income/(loss)\n$ (15,737)\n$ (10,673)\n$ (15,593)\nInterest expense, net\n11,433\n11,232\n10,383\nProvision for income taxes\n1,314\n593\n813\nDepreciation and amortization\n17,367\n17,280\n17,295\nNon-cash cost of compressors sold\n324\n1,768\n2,316\nEquity compensation\n(604)\n(933)\n956\nSeries A Preferred transaction costs\n—\n—\n37\nSeries A Preferred fair value adjustments\n1,552\n1,561\n1,865\nUn-amortized financing costs charged to expense\n3,541\n—\n—\nOmnibus expense paid in equity\n—\n—\n1,746\nSeverance\n—\n—\n55\nSoftware implementation\n—\n194\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 19,190\n$ 21,022\n$ 19,873\nLess:\nCurrent income tax expense\n1,218\n311\n691\nMaintenance capital expenditures\n4,337\n6,936\n4,580\nInterest expense\n11,433\n11,232\n10,383\nSeverance\n—\n—\n55\nPlus:\nNon-cash interest expense\n2,684\n2,955\n3,053\nDistributable cash flow\n4,886\n5,498\n7,217\nCash distribution attributable to period\n7,616\n7,389\n6,512\nDistribution coverage ratio\n0.64x\n0.74x\n1.11x\nSchedule C - Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (unaudited)\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017:\nResults of Operations (unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\n(In Thousands)\nCash from operations\n(365)\n14,496\n1,821\nCapital expenditures, net of sales proceeds\n(17,039)\n(11,413)\n(7,215)\nFree cash flow\n(17,404)\n3,083\n(5,394)\nSchedule D - Reconciliation of Expected Adjusted EBITDA To Income/(Loss) Before Income Taxes\nThe following table reconciles projected total year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to income/(loss) before income taxes.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance\nLow Range\nHigh Range\n(In Thousands)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 95,000\n$ 100,000\nUn-amortized financing costs charged to expense\n3,600\n3,500\nSeries A Preferred fair value adjustments\n1,600\n1,500\nEquity compensation\n2,200\n2,600\nNon-cash cost of compressors sold\n2,500\n1,800\nDepreciation and amortization\n70,000\n74,000\nInterest expense, net\n52,000\n54,000\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$ (36,900)\n$ (37,400)\n with multimedia: releases/csi-compressco-lp-announces-first-quarter-2018-results-and-provides-total-year-financial-guidance-300643322.html\nSOURCE CSI Compressco LP",
