    "text": "Delivers sales and EPS growth over prior year; reaffirms full-year guidance\nNEW PORT RICHEY, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Welbilt, Inc. (NYSE:WBT), today announced financial results for its 2018 first quarter.\n2018 First Quarter Highlights\nNet sales were $350.4 million, an increase of 6.8 percent from prior year; Organic Net Sales increased 3.7 percent Net earnings were $12.5 million, an increase of 150.0 percent; Adjusted Net Earnings were $21.8 million, an increase of 105.7 percent Diluted net earnings per share were $0.09, an increase of 125.0 percent; Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share were $0.15, an increase of 87.5 percent Earnings from operations were $41.6 million, an increase of 17.8 percent; as a percent of net sales, earnings from operations were 11.9 percent, an increase of 110 basis points Adjusted Operating EBITDA was $55.3 million, an increase of 4.3 percent; Adjusted Operating EBITDA margin was 15.8 percent, a decrease of 40 basis points\n2018 Guidance\nNet sales growth: between 7.0 and 10.0 percent (organic +1.0 to +4.0 percent, acquisition +5.0 percent, foreign currency translation +1.0 percent) Adjusted Operating EBITDA margin: between 19.5 and 21.0 percent Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share: between $0.80 and $0.90 per share, based on a forecast of 141.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding and including a $0.02 benefit from the acquisition of Crem International, inclusive of integration costs\n\"We are pleased to begin 2018 with strong organic growth, driven by new rollouts with large chain customers in both the Americas and EMEA,” said Hubertus Muehlhaeuser, Welbilt’s President and CEO. \"Organic Net Sales increased in the Americas segment, with stronger hot-side product sales related to the rollouts more than offsetting lower KitchenCare ® aftermarket sales. In the EMEA segment, Organic Net Sales increased with higher hot-side product sales related to a rollout with a large chain customer and higher sales of Merrychef ® high-speed ovens. In the APAC segment, Organic Net Sales decreased due to lower Fabristeel ® project sales and a decrease in KitchenCare aftermarket sales.\"\n“Operationally, Adjusted Operating EBITDA increased year-over-year again for the 11th consecutive quarter driven by the continued solid execution of our Simplification and Right-Sizing initiatives and the benefits from higher volumes. However, our Adjusted Operating EBITDA margin decreased slightly as these benefits were offset by less favorable mix primarily from lower KitchenCare aftermarket sales, and from ramp-up costs related to the new rollouts that began this quarter. We see the impacts from mix and ramp-up costs as temporary and we expect to deliver higher year-over-year Adjusted Operating EBITDA - both in absolute dollars and as a percent of sales - in 2018.\"\n\"We are reaffirming our 2018 annual guidance today. We expect to continue benefiting from increased sales to large chain customers and for demand from general market customers to improve as we progress through the year. We expect to see gradually increasing benefits from our recently-announced customer wins and more immediate growth benefits from the Crem International acquisition. We expect our Simplification and Right-Sizing initiatives, hedging activities and additional price increases to offset the inflationary impacts from rising material and freight costs, which would allow us to achieve another year of margin and earnings growth,\" concluded Muehlhaeuser.\nSegment Discussion\nNet sales in our Americas segment for the first quarter were $280.2 million, a 4.7 percent increase compared to last year's first quarter. Third-party Net Sales were $249.9 million, a 5.1 percent increase (+4.5 percent organic, +0.6 percent foreign currency translation) compared to the prior year quarter. The Organic Net Sales increase was primarily driven by higher sales of hot-side products for new rollouts for large chain customers, partially offset by lower KitchenCare aftermarket sales. First quarter adjusted operating EBITDA in the Americas segment was $47.6 million compared to $46.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted operating EBITDA margin was 17.0 percent in the first quarter versus 17.5 percent in the same period last year, a decrease of 50 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating EBITDA margin was primarily driven by unfavorable product mix, costs related to starting up the new rollouts and higher compensation expense, which were partially offset by savings from our Simplification and Right-Sizing initiatives.\nNet sales in our EMEA segment for the first quarter were $81.0 million, a 19.5 percent increase versus $67.8 million in last year's first quarter. Third-party Net Sales were $64.1 million, an 18.9 percent increase (+4.6 percent organic, +14.3 percent foreign currency translation). The Organic Net Sales increase was driven primarily by higher sales of hot-side products for a new rollout with a large chain customer and strong Merrychef high-speed oven sales, plus higher KitchenCare aftermarket sales. First quarter adjusted operating EBITDA in the EMEA segment was $14.1 million compared to $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted operating EBITDA margin was 17.4 percent in the first quarter versus 18.9 percent in the same period last year, a decrease of 150 basis points. The adjusted operating EBITDA margin decrease was primarily driven by higher compensation expense and increased overhead costs, which were partially offset by savings from our Simplification and Right-Sizing initiatives.\nNet sales in our APAC segment for the first quarter were $43.5 million, a 4.3 percent increase from $41.7 million in last year's first quarter. Third-party Net Sales were $36.4 million, unchanged from last year's first quarter (-3.3 percent organic, +3.3 percent foreign currency translation). The Organic Net Sales decrease was driven primarily by lower Fabristeel project sales and a decrease in KitchenCare aftermarket sales, partially offset by improved sales of hot-side products. First quarter adjusted operating EBITDA in the APAC segment was $5.5 million, unchanged from last year's first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted operating EBITDA margin was 12.6 percent for the first quarter of 2018 versus 13.2 percent for the same period in the prior year. The adjusted operating EBITDA margin decrease was primarily driven by increased overhead costs.\nLiquidity Discussion\nNet cash used by operating activities in the first quarter was $153.5 million compared to $164.4 million in last year's first quarter. Net cash provided by investing activities in the first quarter was $128.1 million compared to $111.0 million in last year's first quarter. Both the current year and prior year amounts for net cash used by operating activities and net cash provided by investing activities reflect the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, which is applicable to accounts receivable securitization programs and requires gross presentation and classification changes between the operating and investing sections on the consolidated statements of cash flows including retrospective recasting of prior period information for comparability. Free Cash Flow was a $25.4 million use of cash in the quarter, a 52.4 percent improvement from a $53.4 million use of cash in last year's first quarter. During the quarter, net borrowings on our debt agreements increased by $54.9 million compared to an increase of $80.4 million in last year's first quarter. Our ending cash balance was $153.8 million, an increase of $25.4 million in the quarter. The majority of our cash is held by our international subsidiaries.\nConference Call and Webcast\nWelbilt will host a live conference call to discuss its 2018 first quarter earnings on Monday, May 7, 2018 at 10:00 am ET.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn this release, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed below to evaluate our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed as a supplement to our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing performance of our operating businesses, provides greater transparency into our results of operations and is consistent with how management evaluates the Company’s operating performance and liquidity. In addition, these non-GAAP measures address questions we routinely receive from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to similar data we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. None of the non-GAAP measures presented should be considered as an alternative to net earnings, earnings from operations, net cash used in operating activities, net sales or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our use of these terms may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures related to our 2018 guidance are not provided in this press release because it would take unreasonable efforts to provide such reconciliations.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn this release, we refer to Free Cash Flow, which represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus cash receipts on our beneficial interest in sold receivables. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in measuring our ability to generate cash internally to fund initiatives such as debt repayment, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter of 2018, we updated our definition of Free Cash Flow to include cash receipts on beneficial interest in sold receivables, which is now recorded in net cash provided by investing activities with the adoption of the accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 effective January 1, 2018. Free Cash Flow reconciles to net cash used in operating activities presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Free Cash Flow: Net cash used in operating activities $ (153.5 ) $ (164.4 ) Capital expenditures (3.7 ) (4.9 ) Cash receipts on beneficial interest in sold receivables 131.8 115.9 Free Cash Flow $ (25.4 ) $ (53.4 ) Adjusted Operating EBITDA\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a U.S. GAAP basis, management also reviews our results on an \"Adjusted Operating EBITDA\" basis. Adjusted Operating EBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest, income taxes, other expense - net, depreciation and amortization plus certain items such as gain or loss from impairment or disposal of assets, restructuring expense, separation expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and acquisition-related transaction costs. Management uses Adjusted Operating EBITDA as the basis on which it evaluates our financial performance and makes resource allocation and other operating decisions. Management considers it important that investors review the same operating information that it uses. Adjusted Operating EBITDA reconciles to net earnings presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in millions, except percentage data) 2018 2017 Adjusted Operating EBITDA: Net earnings $ 12.5 $ 5.0 Income taxes 0.3 2.1 Other expense — net (1) 8.5 1.8 Loss on early extinguishment of debt — 3.2 Interest expense 20.3 23.2 Earnings from operations 41.6 35.3 (Gain) loss from impairment or disposal of assets — net (0.1 ) 0.4 Restructuring expense 0.4 4.6 Separation expense 0.1 0.9 Amortization expense 7.9 7.8 Depreciation 4.2 4.0 Transaction costs (2) 1.2 — Total Adjusted Operating EBITDA $ 55.3 $ 53.0 Adjusted Operating EBITDA margin (3) 15.8 % 16.2 % (1) Prior year presentation adjusted for $0.3 million of periodic pension costs that have been reclassified from Selling, general and administrative expenses to Other expense - net in accordance with the adoption of accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2017-07. (2) Transaction costs of $1.2 million include professional services and other direct acquisition costs in connection with the acquisition of Crem. (3) Adjusted Operating EBITDA margin in the section above is calculated by dividing Adjusted Operating EBITDA by net sales. Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share\nIn this release, we refer to Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share. We define Adjusted Net Earnings as net earnings before the impact of certain items, including gain or loss from impairment or disposal of assets, restructuring expense, separation expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and acquisition-related transaction costs, net of taxes. Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share represents Adjusted Net Earnings while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the respective period. We believe these measures are helpful to investors in assessing our ongoing performance of its underlying businesses before the impact of certain items. Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share reconcile to net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, respectively, presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in millions, except share data) 2018 2017 Adjusted Net Earnings: Net earnings $ 12.5 $ 5.0 (Gain) loss from impairment or disposal of assets — net (0.1 ) 0.4 Restructuring expense 0.4 4.6 Separation expense 0.1 0.9 Loss on early extinguishment of debt — 3.2 Transaction costs (1) 9.0 — Tax effect of adjustments (2) (0.1 ) (3.5 ) Total Adjusted Net Earnings $ 21.8 $ 10.6 Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share: Diluted net earnings per share $ 0.09 $ 0.04 (Gain) loss from impairment or disposal of assets — net per share — — Restructuring expense per share — 0.03 Separation expense per share — 0.01 Loss on early extinguishment of debt per share — 0.02 Transaction costs per share (1) 0.06 — Tax effect of adjustments per share (2) — (0.02 ) Total Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share $ 0.15 $ 0.08 (1) Transaction costs include a loss of $7.8 million related to a foreign currency hedge of the acquisition purchase price for Crem and $1.2 million of professional services and other direct acquisition costs. (2) The tax effect of adjustments is determined using the statutory tax rates for the countries comprising such adjustments. Third-party Net Sales and Organic Net Sales\nIn this release, we refer to Third-party Net Sales and Organic Net Sales. Third-party Net Sales reflect net sales for the segment excluding intersegment sales. Organic Net Sales reflect net sales before the impact from foreign currency translation which is calculated by translating current period balances at prior period rates. We believe these measures are helpful to investors in assessing the ongoing performance of our underlying businesses. Third-party Net Sales and Organic Net Sales reconcile to net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 vs. 2017 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Americas EMEA APAC Welbilt Organic Net Sales 4.5 % 4.6 % (3.3 )% 3.7 % Foreign currency translation 0.6 % 14.3 % 3.3 % 3.1 % Third-party Net Sales 5.1 % 18.9 % — % 6.8 % Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Consolidated: Total sales $ 404.7 $ 377.0 Less: Intersegment sales (54.3 ) (49.0 ) Net sales (as reported) 350.4 328.0 Foreign currency translation (10.3 ) — Organic Net Sales $ 340.1 $ 328.0 Americas: Net sales $ 280.2 $ 267.5 Less: Intersegment sales (30.3 ) (29.8 ) Third-party Net Sales 249.9 237.7 Foreign currency translation (1.4 ) — Organic Net Sales $ 248.5 $ 237.7 EMEA: Net sales $ 81.0 $ 67.8 Less: Intersegment sales (16.9 ) (13.9 ) Third-party net sales 64.1 53.9 Foreign currency translation (7.7 ) — Organic Net Sales $ 56.4 $ 53.9 APAC: Net sales $ 43.5 $ 41.7 Less: Intersegment sales (7.1 ) (5.3 ) Third-party net sales 36.4 36.4 Foreign currency translation (1.2 ) — Organic Net Sales $ 35.2 $ 36.4\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507005348/en/\nWelbilt, Inc.\nRich Sheffer, +1 727-853-3079\nVice President Investor Relations, Risk Management and Treasurer\nRichard.sheffer@welbilt.com\nSource: Welbilt, Inc.",
