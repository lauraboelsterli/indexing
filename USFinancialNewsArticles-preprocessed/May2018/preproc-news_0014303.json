    "text": "May 5, 2018 / 7:27 PM / Updated an hour ago Southampton denied by Everton's last-minute equaliser Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - EVERTON 1 SOUTHAMPTON 1\nSouthampton moved out of the Premier League relegation places with a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park on Saturday but were denied victory by an equaliser in the fifth minute of added time.\nSubstitute Nathan Redmond headed their goal from Cedric’s cross 11 minutes after coming on at halftime.\nSouthampton defender Maya Yoshida was sent off in the 85th and deep into added time Tom Davies equalised with a shot that took a heavy deflection.\nThe Saints now have 33 points, ahead of Swansea City, whom they visit on Tuesday, on goal difference.\nEverton are comfortable in eighth place but fans distributed leaflets protesting about what they called “the awful football we’ve endured for a number of years”.
