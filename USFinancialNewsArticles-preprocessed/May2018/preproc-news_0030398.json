    "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady this week at a nine-year high after data showed the pace of consumer price gains easing, a Reuters survey showed on Monday.\nTwenty-one of 25 analysts surveyed expect the Banco de Mexico to hold its rate MXCBIR=ECI steady at 7.50 percent, pausing for the second meeting in a row after a string of hikes.\nData this month showed annual inflation in April cooled to its lowest level since late 2016, following a path projected by policymakers. Inflation ended last year at a 16-1/2 year high.\nFour analysts expected a 25 basis point hike, with some highlighting the recent slide of the peso that could push up import prices. The peso has shed more than 4 percent this month.\n“We think that the board (of the central bank) has the space to take a ‘wait and see’ posture before raising the reference rate again, although we recognize that the scenario ahead is difficult to evaluate,” Banorte said in a note to clients.\nBanorte is among banks that expect policymakers to hold rates steady this week.\nThe Banco de Mexico’s interest rate decision will be released Thursday at 1 p.m. local time (1800 GMT).\nThe median of the poll showed the benchmark rate ending the year at 7.50 percent.\nReporting by Miguel Angel Gutierrez; Editing by Tom Brown\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
