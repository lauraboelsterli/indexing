    "text": "Read the tweets that got these people blocked on Twitter by President Donald Trump A federal judge ruled Wednesday that President Donald Trump cannot block people from following him on Twitter. Trump has more than 35 million followers on the social media platform. Seven people whom Trump blocked last year sued him over the action. President Donald Trump\nThey tweeted these insults at President Donald Trump , and now they've beaten Trump â€” in court.\nThe ruling came in response to a suit by seven people who had been blocked, personally by Trump, last year on Twitter.\nThe individuals were joined in their suit by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.\nA lawyer for the institute said she knows of several hundred people, at least, who have been blocked by Trump on Twitter, but the actual number of blocked accounts is likely much higher.\nBelow are the people who sued Trump over their being blocked, and the tweets that landed them in the president's crosshairs.\nRebecca Buckwalter, Washington-based writer and political consultant",
