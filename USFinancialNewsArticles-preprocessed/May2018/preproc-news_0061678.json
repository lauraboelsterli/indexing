Vericel also intends to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 562,500 shares of common stock on the same terms and conditions. The offering is subject to market conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering. All of the shares in the offering are to be sold by Vericel.
