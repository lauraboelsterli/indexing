    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 11:37 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago Brazil lawmaker Terra says gov't proposal would change Petrobras pricing policy Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBRASILIA, May 24 (Reuters) - Brazilian congressman Osmar Terra said on Friday that the government of President Michel Temer is now proposing that a 10-percent reduction in diesel prices be stretched out for 30 days and that state-led oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA no longer change fuel prices on a daily basis but adjust them monthly.\nTerra, who until earlier this year was Temerâ€™s Minister of Social and Agrarian Development, told reporters after he emerged from a meeting with representatives of the striking truckers that they may end their nationwide blockade of key roadways on Friday or Saturday, if guaranteed that Congress would pass a law to reduce fuel taxes and set a minimum freight cost.
