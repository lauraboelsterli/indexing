    "text": "TORONTO, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mandalay Resources Corporation (\"Mandalay\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:MND) today announced changes to its Board of Directors and senior executive team. Effective immediately, Dr. Mark Sander has resigned as President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Mandalay. Replacing Dr. Sander as President and Chief Executive Officer is Dominic Duffy, currently Chief Operating Officer of Mandalay.\nDr. Sander is withdrawing his nomination for election to the Board at Mandalay’s Annual General and Special Meeting on May 16, 2018. Mandalay’s board of directors (the “Board”) would like to thank Dr. Sander for his long-term service to Mandalay both as a founder and key executive.\nThe Board selected Mr. Duffy as Dr. Sander’s replacement based on their view that Mandalay would be best served at this time by an operations-oriented leader with a detailed understanding of Mandalay’s existing operations and proven experience at productivity and cost management. Mr. Duffy successfully restarted Cerro Bayo after its acquisition from Coeur D’Alene Mines in 2010 and has been the Company’s Chief Operating Officer since 2013, overseeing operational performance success at Costerfield and the successful turnaround program at Björkdal.\nSpeaking about the change in leadership, Bradford Mills, Chairman of Mandalay commented, “I want to thank Dr. Sander for his many years of service to Mandalay and his critical role as a founder of the Company. Mark has helped the Company weather the operational crisis triggered by the Cerro Bayo accident and positioned the Company to grow from its base of existing operations. I am very pleased to welcome Dominic Duffy to the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Dominic has demonstrated his commitment to delivering efficient, low-cost operations, which I believe is a critical next step for Mandalay and a key objective for the Company.”\nDominic Duffy brings 20 years of extensive technical and operational management experience, having worked at numerous operations throughout Australia and Latin America. Prior to joining Mandalay Resources, Mr. Duffy most recently worked for Coeur d’Alene Mines and Hecla Mining Company in South America.\nGiven Mr. Duffy’s operational expertise, the Company will not be appointing a new Chief Operating Officer at the moment.\nFor Further Information:\nDominic Duffy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nGreg DiTomaso\nDirector of Investor Relations\nContact:\n647.260.1566\nAbout Mandalay Resources Corporation:\nMandalay Resources is a Canadian-based natural resource company with producing assets in Australia and Sweden, and care and maintenance and development projects in Chile.
