    "text": "FRLF is building out its Vegas-based operations, including: extraction engineering, ecommerce marketing solutions, & project mgt structure\nLAS VEGAS, NV, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Freedom Leaf Inc. ( OTCQB: FRLF ), a group of diversified, international, vertically-integrated hemp business and cannabis media companies, announced today that Las Vegas-based, Nevada State Senator, Richard S. Segerblom, who led the drive for the legalization of marijuana in Nevada, has agreed to join the Freedom Leaf Board of Directors. The other Directors include: Paul Pelosi Jr., Chairman, Freedom Leaf CEO Clifford J. Perry and Freedom Leaf EVP Raymond P. Medeiros.\nSenator “Tick” Segerblom commented: “Freedom Leaf shares my vision that Las Vegas is the perfect home for marijuana and hemp companies. Nevada’s corporate laws and tax structure are second to none. Joining the Freedom Leaf Board enables me to take that message throughout the nation, Canada and the world.”\nSenator Segerblom is a third generation Nevadan, and the fourth generation of his family to serve as a representative in the Nevada legislature. Senator Segerblom introduced the first medical marijuana bill into Nevada legislature and helped lead the drive for the legalization of cannabis in Nevada with the passage of the 2016 Yes On Question 2 Campaign.\nFreedom Leaf’s Chairman of the Board, Paul Pelosi, Jr., commented: “We are pleased to welcome Nevada Senator “Tick” Segerblom to the Freedom Leaf team and offer congratulations to Freedom Leaf’s management for continuing to recruit people with similar commitments to health, social, fiscal and environmental responsibilities.”\nChairman Pelosi went on to say: “We look forward to working with Senator Segerblom to bring industrial hemp back into the mainstream through our leading magazine, online digital properties, production and distribution of high-quality wellness products.”\nFreedom Leaf Co-Founder and CEO, Clifford J. Perry, commented: “It is a great honor to have Senator Segerblom join the Board of The Marijuana Legalization Company ®, and recognize Freedom Leaf’s commitment to building the local cannabis industry in Nevada. No one has done more than Senator Segerblom to advance the cause of freedom and build Las Vegas as the world leader in hemp, medical, and recreational marijuana.”\nFreedom Leaf has also been hard at work focusing on building out its Las Vegas staff with experienced professionals both inside and outside of the hemp industry. In recent months, FRLF has brought on three executives from its recently announced acquisition as well as: a new Managing Director, National Sales Director, and an Extraction Engineer – all of whom have significant industry experience and contacts.\nIn April, Freedom Leaf hired Rodrigo Chavez as Managing Director. Chavez has over eight years of operations & technology consultant experience and previously managed business operations for Weedmaps in Europe. Weedmaps is the world’s leading Cannabis dispensary locator and Marijuana advertiser. Chavez is an operations manager with a focus on sales development in emerging markets and has worked over four years within the emerging cannabis industry in Spain, Germany, Netherlands, and the UK.\nFreedom Leaf has also recently brought on Joe Reed as National Sales Director. Reed has over two decades of sales management and distribution experience under his belt, during which time he has developed an extensive network of distributors and wholesalers both domestic and international. Reed will play a crucial role in building Hempology revenue by developing distributor relationships and establishing our sales team.\nIn March, Freedom Leaf hired Mr. Nick Shi, a Biomedical Engineering graduate of Purdue University, to optimize the extraction and distillation processes of Leafceuticals Inc. Shi will be focusing on continuously improving hemp CBD yields, processing time, and product quality at the Leafceuticals Inc. extraction lab in North Las Vegas.\nAbout Freedom Leaf Inc.®\nFreedom Leaf Inc. , The Marijuana Legalization Company®, is a group of diversified, international, vertically-integrated hemp businesses and cannabis media companies.
