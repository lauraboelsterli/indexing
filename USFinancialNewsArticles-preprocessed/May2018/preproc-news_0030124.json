    "text": "May 13, 2018 / 6:43 PM / Updated an hour ago Bruges win Belgian title with draw at closest rivals Standard Liege Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Club Bruges won the Belgian league title for a second time in three years after scoring a disputed equaliser to secure a 1-1 draw at their closest challengers Standard Liege on Sunday that put them clear of the chasing field with one round to play.\nBruges, who have now won 15 titles, came back after conceding early to equalise three minutes before halftime but Ruud Vormer handled the ball before setting up Jelle Vossen for the goal.\nThe referee consulted the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) after the incident but still awarded the goal to the disbelief of the home supporters.\nCypriot international Konstantinos Laifis’ 11th minute goal had given Standard early hope they might take the title race into the last round of matches next Sunday.\nStandard, who started four points adrift with two matches to play, remain on course for second place and a spot in the preliminary rounds of next season’s Champions League after third placed Anderlecht were beaten 1-0 at Ghent.\nBruges moved onto 46 points with Standard on 42 and Anderlecht on 40.
