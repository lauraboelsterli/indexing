    "text": "The St. Louis Cardinals teed off on Padres pitchers Friday night at Petco Park in San Diego.\nPaul DeJong’s three-run homer in the second off Padres rookie left-hander Eric Lauer was the first of five home runs hit by the Cardinals in a 9-5 win over the Padres.\nFour of the home runs came against Lauer in 2 1/3 innings.\nRight-hander Luke Weaver (3-2) shut out the Padres on four hits and a walk with four strikeouts over five innings to get credit for the win.\nMarcell Ozuna and former Padre Jedd Gyorko opened the second with singles when DeJong drove a changeup on the ninth pitch of a duel with Lauer 398 feet to left-center for his eighth homer of the season.\nThe home run snapped a string of 11 straight scoreless innings worked by Lauer.\nThen in the third inning, Harrison Bader, Ozuna and Gyorko all homered off Lauer.\nBader opened the inning with his second homer, a 396-foot drive to left. After Lauer retired Jose Martinez on a fly to right, Ozuna pulled a 371-foot homer into the left field corner.\nThen Gyorko struck with a 410-foot drive into the second deck in left. It was the infielder’s eighth homer against his original team. He went 3-for-5 Friday night and is now 21-for-42 as a Cardinal against the Padres.\nDeJong got his career-high fourth RBI in the fifth with a run-scoring single against Bryan Mitchell, who was making his first appearance out of the Padres bullpen after losing his spot in the rotation. Tommy Pham made it 9-0 in the sixth with a two-run homer off Mitchell.\nLauer (1-2) allowed six runs on seven hits (including the four home runs) and a walk in 2 1/3 innings. Mitchell allowed three runs on six hits and three walks over 5 2/3 innings.\nThe Padres scored five times against the Cardinals bullpen on run-scoring doubles by A.J. Ellis and Jose Pirela (his first extra-base hit since April 15), a triple by Franchy Cordero and Travis Jankowski’s first homer of the season leading off the ninth. St. Louis reliever Luke Gregerson also balked in a run in the final frame.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
