    "text": "INDIANA, Pa., May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Commonwealth Bank (the \"Bank\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of First Commonwealth Financial Corporation (NYSE:FCF), today announced that it has priced a private offering of $50 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2028 (the “10-Year Notes”), and $50 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2033 (the “15-Year Notes,” and, collectively with the 10-Year Notes, the \"Notes\"). The offerings are expected to close on or about May 21, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe Notes will be unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Bank and will be subordinated in right of payment to all of the Bank's existing and future senior indebtedness, including claims of depositors and general creditors, and will rank equally in right of payment with any other unsecured, subordinated indebtedness that the Bank incurs in the future that ranks equally with the Notes.\nThe 10-Year Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate per annum of 4.875%, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on May 21, 2018, to but excluding June 1, 2023. From and including June 1, 2023, the 10-Year Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR plus 184.5 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, through maturity or earlier redemption. The 10-Year Notes will mature on June 1, 2028, unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms.\nThe 15-Year Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate per annum of 5.500%, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1of each year, beginning on May 21, 2018, to but excluding June 1, 2028. From and including June 1, 2028, the 15-Year Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR plus 237 basis points payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, through maturity or earlier redemption. The 15-Year Notes will mature on June 1, 2033, unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms.\nThe 10-Year Notes are redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on June 1, 2023, and on each interest payment date thereafter. The 15-Year Notes are redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on June 1, 2028, and on each interest payment date thereafter. The Notes are also redeemable by the Bank, in whole but not in part, at any time upon certain specified events. Any redemption will be at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and will be subject to, and require, prior regulatory approval. The Notes are not subject to early repayment at the option of holders thereof. The Bank intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, funding potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities. The Notes are intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.\nThe Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption under Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. This press release is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any offer or sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The Notes will not be savings accounts or deposits of any bank and will not be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.\nSandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. is serving as the sole book-running manager for the offering, and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company, is serving as the co-manager for the offering.\nAbout First Commonwealth Financial Corporation\nFirst Commonwealth Financial Corporation (NYSE:FCF), headquartered in Indiana, Pennsylvania, is a financial services company with 140 banking offices in 22 counties throughout Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as a Corporate Banking Center in Cleveland, Ohio and mortgage offices in Hudson and Dublin, Ohio.
