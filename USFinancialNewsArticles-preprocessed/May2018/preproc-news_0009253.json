    "text": "CARMEL, Ind., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nNet income of $15.1 million increased by 65% compared with March 31, 2017 Earnings of $0.50 per common share increased by 28% compared with March 31, 2017 Total assets of $3.7 billion increased by $282.7 million, or 8% compared to December 31, 2017 Return on average assets of 1.79% for three months ended March 31, 2018 Multi-family mortgage closings of $453.1 million for three months ended March 31, 2018 Closed its acquisition of Joy State Bank on January 2, 2018 Previously announced a 20% increase in dividends, to $.06 per common share\nMerchants Bancorp (the \"Company\" or \"Merchants\") (Nasdaq: MBIN), parent company of Merchants Bank of Indiana, today reported first quarter 2018 net income of $15.1 million, or $0.50 per common share. This compared with $9.1 million, or $0.39 per common share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nEach of the Company's business segments' net income increased in the first quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2017. Multi-family Mortgage Banking income increased by 56%, Mortgage Warehousing increased by 22%, and Banking increased by 148%.\n\"Our businesses once again delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2018 with solid loan and deposit growth, while maintaining an industry-leading efficiency ratio and an innovative, consistent approach to loan origination that has built deep, long-term customer relationships. We have also continued to implement our strategic plans to make Merchants even more successful into the future,\" said Michael Petrie, Chairman and CEO of Merchants.\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets increased $282.7 million, or 8%, to $3.7 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $3.4 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to increases in loans, loans held for sale, and trading securities. Return on average assets was 1.79% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with 1.39% at March 31, 2017.\nTotal loans receivable before allowance for loan losses increased $198.5 million, or 14%, to $1.6 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to growth in multi-family and healthcare financing, as well as residential real estate loans.\nAsset Quality\nThe allowance for loan losses increased by $1.4 million, to $9.7 million, at March 31, 2018, compared with $8.3 million at December 31, 2017. The increase reflected higher loans held for investment, while non-performing loans increased to $4.9 million, or 0.31% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared with $3.1 million, or .23% of total loans, at December 31, 2017.\nTotal Deposits\nTotal deposits increased $119.0 million, or 4%, to $3.1 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to growth in certificates of deposit and demand deposits during the quarter, while total brokered deposits declined by 5% to $897.4 million, or 29% of total deposits.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased $10.0 million, or 53%, to $29.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $19.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was due to both loan growth and higher loan yields. The average balance of loans, including loans held for sale, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased by $658.0 million, or 41%, to $2.2 billion, compared with $1.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The average yield on loans increased 41 basis points, to 4.44%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with 4.03% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net interest margin increased to 2.52% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with 2.17% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $3.5 million, or 63%, to $8.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017. Interest expense on deposits increased $3.2 million, or 86%, to $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 41 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, to 1.27%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with 0.86% for the same period in 2017, and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $467.8 million, or 26%, to $2.2 billion for the three months The increase in deposits was primarily due to growth in certificate of deposits and demand deposits, as well as custodial accounts of existing warehouse customers. The increase in the cost of deposits was due to the overall increase in interest rates since last year.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $6.6 million, or 49%, to $20.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due to a 23 basis point increase in our interest rate spread, to 2.06%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 1.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, coupled with the overall growth in our interest-earning assets, particularly in loans and loans held for sale, period to period. Our net interest margin increased 35 basis points to 2.52% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 2.17% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income increased by $3.2 million, or 40%, to $11.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due to an increase of $5.5 million, or 100%, in the gain on sale of loans, primarily associated with an increase in the volume of multi-family loan sales in the secondary market. These increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in loan servicing fees that were negatively impacted by a $893,000 fair market value adjustment in mortgage servicing rights.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $3.6 million, or 55%, to $10.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $6.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to a $2.6 million, or 67%, increase in salaries and employee benefits. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was due primarily to an increase in the number of employees resulting from business growth, higher commissions related to higher multi-family volume, and additional hiring associated with becoming a publicly traded company. Despite the increase in salaries and benefits, the efficiency ratio remained relatively stable at 32.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 30.7% the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense decreased $927,000, or 17%, to $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was due primarily to the lower tax rates under the recent federal income tax reform legislation, partially offset by a 34% increase in pre-tax income over the same period. The effective tax rate was 23.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with 38.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAbout Merchants Bancorp\nMerchants Bancorp is a diversified bank holding company headquartered in Carmel, Indiana operating multiple lines of business with a focus on Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\") multi-family housing and healthcare facility financing and servicing, mortgage warehouse financing, retail and correspondent residential mortgage banking, agricultural lending and traditional community banking.

As such, the reader should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is below. Net Income Available to Common Shareholders excludes preferred stock. Tangible common equity is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets and preferred stock from the calculation of total assets. Tangible Assets is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and intangible assets.
