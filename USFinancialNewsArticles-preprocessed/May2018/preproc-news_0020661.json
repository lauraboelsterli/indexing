(TSX:MG) (NYSE:MGA) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We had a strong start to the year, reporting record first quarter results and increasing our outlook for sales and earnings. We continue to position Magna for the emerging mobility ecosystem as demonstrated by the recently announced partnership with Lyft.”\nPlease click HERE for full first quarter Financial Statements and MD&A.\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 (2) Reported\nSales $ 10,792 $ 8,900\nIncome from operations before income taxes $ 851 $ 793\nNet income attributable to Magna International Inc. $ 660 $ 577\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.83 $ 1.51\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures (1)\nAdjusted EBIT $ 875 $ 818 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 1.84 $ 1.53 All results are reported in millions of U.S. dollars, except per share figures, which are in U.S. dollars (1) Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted diluted earnings per share and Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP, and as a result may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures by other companies. A reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures is included in the back of this press release.\n(2) 2017 amounts included in this Press Release have been adjusted for our adoption of the new revenue standard (Accounting Standard Codification 606) and recast for our new reportable segments. THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018\nWe posted sales of $10.79 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 21% over the first quarter of 2017. The strong growth was achieved despite light vehicle production that declined 2% in North America and was essentially unchanged in Europe, both compared to the first quarter of 2017. We delivered sales growth in each of our operating segments, most notably in our Complete Vehicles segment, which contributed approximately 60% of the increase in sales in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and net divestitures, sales increased 14%.\nAdjusted EBIT increased 7% to $875 million in the first quarter of 2018 resulting in an adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales of 8.1% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 9.2% in the first quarter of 2017. This margin decline was largely driven by an increase in the proportion of sales generated in our Complete Vehicles segment, which have a significantly lower margin as a percentage of sales than our consolidated average, as well as higher launch costs.\nIncome from operations before income taxes and net income attributable to Magna International Inc. were $851 million and $660 million for the first quarter of 2018, increases of 7% and 14%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 21% to $1.83 in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting higher income from operations before income taxes, a lower income tax rate primarily as a result of U.S. tax reform, and the favourable impact of a reduced share count. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $1.84 compared to $1.53 for the first quarter of 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we generated cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.03 billion, and invested $455 million in operating assets and liabilities. Investment activities for the first quarter of 2018 were $357 million, including $243 million in fixed asset additions and a $114 million increase in investments, other assets and intangible assets.\n“We had a strong start to the year, reporting record first quarter results and increasing our outlook for sales and earnings. We continue to position Magna for the emerging mobility ecosystem as demonstrated by the recently announced partnership with Lyft.”\n- Don Walker, Magna’s Chief Executive Officer\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/9b2aa63a-cfe9-4e35-bfcc-6a0fefca3a3e\nRETURN OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we paid dividends of $118 million. In addition, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $103 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nYesterday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 with respect to our outstanding Common Shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This dividend is payable on June 8, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 25, 2018.\nSEGMENT SUMMARY (2)\n($Millions unless otherwise noted) For the three months ended March 31, Sales Adjusted EBIT 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Body Exteriors & Structures $ 4,619 $ 4,167 $ 452 $ 340 $ 349 $ (9 ) Power & Vision 3,190 2,963 227 358 328 30 Seating Systems 1,470 1,335 135 130 116 14 Complete Vehicles 1,660 527 1,133 19 6 13 Corporate and Other (147 ) (92 ) (55 ) 28 19 9 Total Reportable Segments $ 10,792 $ 8,900 $ 1,892 $ 875 $ 818 $ 57\nFor the three months ended March 31, Adjusted EBIT as a\npercentage of sales 2018 2017 Change Body Exteriors & Structures 7.4 % 8.4 % (1.0 )% Power & Vision 11.2 % 11.1 % 0.1 % Seating Systems 8.8 % 8.7 % 0.1 % Complete Vehicles 1.1 % 1.1 % 0.0 % Consolidated Average 8.1 % 9.2 % (1.1 )% For further details on our segment results, please see our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position and our Interim Financial Statements.\nUPDATED 2018 OUTLOOK\nCurrent Previous Light Vehicle Production (Units)\nNorth America\nEurope\n17.3 million\n22.6 million\n17.4 million\n22.4 million Segment Sales\nBody Exteriors & Structures\nPower & Vision\nSeating Systems\nComplete Vehicles\n$17.3 - $18.1 billion\n$12.3 - $12.9 billion\n$5.5 - $5.9 billion\n$6.4 - $6.8 billion\n$16.6 - $17.4 billion\n$11.8 - $12.4 billion\n$5.3 - $5.7 billion\n$6.0 - $6.4 billion Total Sales $40.9 - $43.1 billion $39.3 - $41.5 billion Adjusted EBIT Margin (3) 7.9% - 8.2% 7.9% - 8.2% Equity Income (included in EBIT) $335 – $375 million $335 – $375 million Interest Expense, net Approximately $90 million Approximately $90 million Income Tax Rate (4) 22% - 23% 22% - 23% Net Income attributable to Magna $2.4 - $2.6 billion $2.3 - $2.5 billion Capital Spending Approximately $1.8 billion Approximately $1.8 billion (3) Adjusted EBIT Margin is the ratio of Adjusted EBIT to Total Sales.\n(4) The Income Tax Rate has been calculated using Adjusted EBIT and is based on current tax legislation.
