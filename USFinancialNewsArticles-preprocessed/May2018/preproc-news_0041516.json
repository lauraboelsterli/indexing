    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - BMW ( BMWG.DE ) is expanding a recall of vehicles in Britain, which it launched last week, by 88,000 cars to a total of 390,000, in the wake of a BBC investigation which found that some vehicles could cut out completely while being driven.\nFILE PHOTO: Raindrops cover the bonnet of a BMW car in London, Britain, February 23, 2017. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo “BMW has chosen to expand on its existing battery connector recall by also replacing the blower-regulator wiring harness on affected 3 Series models,” the German carmaker said on Friday.\n“This involves replacing two wiring connections on the cars already affected and recalling an additional 88,000 cars in the UK.”\nReporting by Costas Pitas; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
