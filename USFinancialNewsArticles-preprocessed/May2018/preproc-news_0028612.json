(NASDAQ: PERI), a global innovator in delivering digital marketing solutions for brands that are relentlessly focused on their consumer experience, announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights*\n(In millions, except per share data)\nThree months ended March 31, 2017 2018 % Search and other revenues $ 37.6 $ 31.6 (16)% Advertising revenues $ 24.4 $ 29.3 20% Total Revenues $ 62.0 $ 60.9 (2)% GAAP Net Income (Loss) $ (2.1) $ 0.1 Non-GAAP Net Income $ 2.8 $ 3.0 7% Adjusted EBITDA $ 3.5 $ 4.3 23% GAAP Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share $ (0.03) $ 0.00 Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.04 $ 0.04 * Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures follows.\nDoron Gerstel, Perion’s CEO commented, “During the first quarter, we continued to execute on initiatives to streamline our business and advance our turnaround strategy. Our progress is evident by the 23% improvement in adjusted EBITDA and increase of our cash and cash equivalents to $41.7 million.”\n“Moreover, our efforts to strengthen Undertone’s solution offering and value proposition to the market by combining our insight-driven creative studio with a platform that delivers the right message at the right time over a vetted network of premium publisher sites, has led to a 20% year-over-year increase in our Advertising revenues,” Mr. Gerstel added “We’re encouraged by customer response to Undertone’s newly Synchronized Digital Branding holistic platform, that creates a unified experience across a variety of display and social touchpoints to quality-conscious brands.”\n“Simultaneously, the Search business continues to provide steady free cash flow to support our investments in Undertone, strengthens our balance sheet and reduces our debt by $14.4 million from $64.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $50.2 million in the end of the first quarter of 2018. Mr. Gerstel continued. “Our long-term partnership with Bing remains strong, positioning us well to provide a comprehensive and compelling search solution to quality publishers around the globe.”\nMr. Gerstel concluded, “We executed according to plan during the first quarter and I am increasingly confident, based on the results we achieved, that Perion is on the right track. As a result, we are reaffirming our outlook for full year 2018.”\nFinancial Comparison for the First Quarter of 2018:\nRevenues: Revenues decreased by 2%, from $62.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $60.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. This decrease, was primarily a result of Search and other revenues declining 16%, offset by Advertising revenues increasing by 20% as compared to the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in Search and other revenues is primarily due to churn of our legacy products and the second quarter of 2017 network cleanup. The increase in the Advertising revenues attributed to increase in brand spend in the first quarter of 2018.\nCustomer Acquisition Costs and Media Buy (\"CAC\"): CAC in the first quarter of 2018 was $31.9 million or 52% of revenues, compared to $30.1 million, or 48% of revenues in the first quarter of 2017. In Search, the increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the churn of our legacy products, while in Advertising, the increase is mainly attributed to product mix and due to the effect of header bidding and Chrome ad blocker.\nNet Income: On a GAAP basis, net Income in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.1 million as compared to net loss of $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP Net Income: In the first quarter of 2018, non-GAAP net income was $3.0 million, or 5% of revenues, compared to $2.8 million, or 4% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA: In the first quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $4.3 million, or 7% of revenues, compared to $3.5 million, or 6% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash and Cash Flow from Operations: As of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits were $41.7 million. Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 was $14.6 million compared to $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nShort-term Debt, Long-term Debt and Convertible Debt: As of March 31, 2018, total debt was $50.2 million, compared to $60.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nPerion satisfies all the financial covenants associated with its public debt.\n2018 Guidance\nManagement reiterated its expectations of Adjusted EBITDA of $28 million to $32 million for the full year of 2018.\nConference Call\nPerion will host a conference call to discuss the results today, May 10, 2018, at 10 a.m. ET.

Additionally, in September 2014, the Company issued convertible bonds denominated in New Israeli Shekels and at the same time entered into a derivative arrangement (SWAP) that economically exchanges the convertible bonds as if they were denominated in US dollars when the bonds were issued. The Company excludes from its GAAP financial measures the fair value revaluations of both, the convertible bonds and the related derivative instrument, and by doing so, the non-GAAP measures reflect the Company’s results as if the convertible bonds were originally issued and denominated in US dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency. Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is defined as operating income excluding stock-based compensation expenses, depreciation, restructuring costs, acquisition related items consisting of amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairments, acquisition related expenses, gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements and certain accounting entries under the business combination accounting rules that require us to recognize a legal performance obligation related to revenue arrangements of an acquired entity based on its fair value at the date of acquisition.\nThe purpose of such adjustments is to give an indication of our performance exclusive of non-cash charges and other items that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Furthermore, the non-GAAP measures are regularly used internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions, and we believe that they are useful to investors as a consistent and comparable measure of the ongoing performance of our business. However, our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ materially from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the last table of this press release.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains historical information and forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the business, financial condition and results of operations of Perion.
