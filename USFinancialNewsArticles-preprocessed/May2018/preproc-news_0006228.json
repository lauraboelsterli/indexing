    "text": "MUNCIE, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ontario Systems , a leading provider of enterprise revenue cycle management software to the healthcare, accounts receivable management, and government markets, announced today that it has acquired Justice Systems, Inc., a leading provider of court case management software, and electronic payments solutions to government clients including state and municipal court systems.\nOntario Systems and Justice Systems are leading players in the growing government software sector, both with over 35-year histories of providing trusted solutions to their clients. The acquisition reflects Ontario’s continuing commitment to accelerating its strong growth trajectory in the attractive government marketplace.\n“This alignment is about growth and seizing a strong market opportunity where we feel we can offer an enhanced solution,” says Ron Fauquher, Ontario Systems CEO. “Combining our people, products, and market strategies provides tremendous benefits to the markets we jointly and uniquely serve.”\nThe merger marries JSI’s court case management and electronic payments capabilities with the receivables workflow and payment follow-up automation of Ontario Systems, creating a closed loop payment and enterprise workflow solution for state and local court systems, including prosecutors and public defender offices.\n“Our product and market strategies are complementary in important ways,” says Jay Moorman, Ontario Systems Vice President and General Manager of the SLG business unit. “By blending products that focus on different parts of the court case workflow and payment processing spectrum, we are providing a collaborative solution where this market currently has a gap.”\nMoorman says the merger is expected to provide the market a more effective solution. “The acquisition creates a more complete solution to government entities challenged by budgets and complexity. Improved workflow and integrated tools facilitate service to constituents while helping to manage costs,” he said.\n“This partnership represents an exciting opportunity, not only for our customers in the state and local government market, but for the OS and JSI organizations,” says Ernie Sego, Co-founder and CEO/President of Justice Systems. “Joining forces with a company who shares our philosophy where people and customers come first was my top priority and we found that with Ontario Systems.
