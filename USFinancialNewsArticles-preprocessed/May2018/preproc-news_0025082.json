Test Growth: The company reported 677 GPS Cancer® commercial tests were ordered in Q1 2018, up from 606 in Q4 2017. Key Publication : In Q2 2018, results of a company sponsored study were published in Oncotarget, a peer-reviewed bio-medical journal. The study results demonstrate the significant gains in accuracy by performing tumor/normal DNA and RNA sequencing and the risks associated with high error rates of tumor only sequencing. https://nanthealth.com/Oncotarget Publication New National GPS Cancer Payer: In Q1 2018, as previously announced, the company signed a new GPS Cancer reimbursement contract with a large, national healthcare IT company. New Lab Services Arrangement: In Q1 2018, as previously announced, the company signed a laboratory services agreement with a 20+ facility hospital system for the availability of GPS Cancer testing to its patient community. Expanded International Adoption: In Q1 2018, as previously announced, the company signed a strategic reseller agreement with a partner in the United Kingdom for the provision of molecular analysis services for clinical studies and other research initiatives. FDA Submission: In Q1 2018, as previously announced, the company submitted a 510(k) premarket notification application to the FDA for tumor/normal DNA sequencing.\n“We are excited about the opportunity to feature GPS Cancer and our new liquid biopsy platform in 11 presentations at next month’s American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, a significant and auspicious milestone for NantHealth,” said Sandeep (Bobby) Reddy, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of NantHealth. “In conjunction with these presentations, we plan to unveil to the oncology community at ASCO and commence the commercial launch of our liquid biopsy test, a 26 analyte test for circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) extracted from patient blood permits non-invasive detection of expressed biomarkers and monitoring of response to immunotherapies such as Keytruda® or Opdivo® or resistance to anti-androgens such as Xtandi®.”\nSoftware and Services Highlights:\nPayer Engagement (NaviNet): In Q1 2018, NantHealth’s industry leading Document Exchange solution was upgraded to include an enhanced document viewer and the ability for payers to tag and categorize documents. In Q1 2018, as previously announced, the company signed a three-year renewal contract with a total contract value of approximately $17 million. Clinical Decision Support (Eviti): In Q1 2018, introduced new dual eligibility features, enabling payers to concurrently manage dual membership patients covered under Medicare and Medicaid, and drug shortage configuration features that provide improved management of high cost drugs. Connected Care: In Q1 2018, released DeviceConX5.14 (MDE), the first MDI solution to adopt the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. In Q1 2018, released VitalsConX2.1, with support for offline mode, enabling clinicians to continue nurse rounding when connectivity is lost and to submit data to the EMR once connectivity is restored. In Q2 2018, completed first CE Mark submission for the DeviceConX software platform.\n“Our 2018 first quarter performance reflects a 17% increase in consolidated revenue and a substantially improved gross margin over the prior year period,” said Paul Holt, Chief Financial Officer of NantHealth. “We were delighted to see continued growth of our SaaS business, with revenue increasing 9% over the same quarter last year. Our year over year improvement in operating results was positively impacted by our revenue growth and the restructuring program, implemented late last year.”\nBusiness and Financial Highlights\nIn August 2017, NantHealth sold its provider/patient engagement assets to Allscripts to focus on core competencies and accelerate the plan to achieve profitability. As a result, the company has classified the current and prior period operating results of its provider/patient engagement business as discontinued operations. All results presented below represent the company’s continuing operations.\nThe company adopted a new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018. Please note that the financial results presented below include both amounts “as presented,” which reflect implementation of the new revenue recognition standard, as well as amounts prior to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard to allow for comparability against historical results. Starting in fiscal year 2019, the company will no longer present its GAAP and Non-GAAP financial results under the previous revenue recognition standard. For additional information and reconciliations of our financial results between the new and previous revenue recognition standard, see the additional tables included in this press release and in the company’s Form 10-Q to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, total net revenue as presented was $22.3 million.

The Company’s management believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information regarding operational performance, because it enhances an investor’s overall understanding of the financial results for the Company’s core business. Additionally, it provides a basis for the comparison of the financial results for the Company’s core business between current, past and future periods. Other companies may define these measures in different ways. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP per share numbers are calculated based on one class of common stock and do not incorporate the effects, if any, of using the two-class method.\nAbout NantHealth, Inc.\nNantHealth, Inc., a member of the NantWorks ecosystem of companies, is a next-generation, evidence-based, personalized healthcare company enabling improved patient outcomes and more effective treatment decisions for critical illnesses.
