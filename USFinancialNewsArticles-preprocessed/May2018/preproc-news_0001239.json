    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. (“SCI”) (OTCQB:SCIA), a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced materials for physical vapor deposition thin film applications who works closely with end users and OEMs to develop innovative, customized solutions, today reported its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nDan Rooney, President & CEO, stated, “We continued to build on our 2017 achievements during the first quarter of this year. Substantial increases in revenue and gross profit led to $0.02 of income applicable to common shares versus a loss of $(0.01) a year ago. Orders for thin film solar products accelerated throughout the quarter resulting in a quarter-end backlog that was nearly 90% higher than at 2017 year-end. Customer deposits totaled more than $1.6 million in the first quarter 2018.\n\"We are encouraged by developments in the global thin film solar market, led by manufacturing installations coming on line and announcements of new projects. We are actively working to extend our presence in this growing market and during the first quarter we received orders from several thin film solar production facilities. Thin film solar revenue for the first six months of this year is expected to exceed the 2017 annual amount.”\nMr. Rooney continued, “We expect to be profitable in each quarter of 2018. The incremental improvement in product mix attributable to higher solar revenue will particularly benefit gross profit and net income attributable to common shares based on orders booked, deposits received and forecasts from customers.”\nRevenue\nRevenue increased 35% to $1,846,858 for the first quarter 2018 from $1,371,916 for the same period last year due to higher volumes of thin film solar and photonics products, and higher pricing for photonics products attributable to increased raw material costs. Thin film solar revenue is expected to be higher in each of the remaining quarters of 2018 versus the same periods last year due to increased demand.\nOrder backlog was $3.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.9 million at 2017 year-end and on the same date last year.\nGross prof it\nFirst quarter 2018 gross profit increased 37% to $462,012 from $336,985 a year ago principally due to the revenue factors noted above. Gross profit margin was 25.0% and 24.6% for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses (general and administrative expense, marketing and sales expense and research and development expense) were $373,799 compared to $365,939, an increase of 2% due to higher marketing and sales expense versus a year ago to support the Company’s growth strategy.\nIncome (Loss) Applicable to Common Shares\nIncome applicable to common shares was $71,199 or $0.02 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2018 versus a loss of $(46,486), or $(0.01) per share last year.\nEBITDA*\nEarnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased 136% to $206,624 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $87,585 for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to first quarter 2018 net income versus a loss the prior year.\nFor the first three months of 2018, adjusted EBITDA, which excludes non-cash stock based compensation, was $227,210 versus $134,446 a year ago.\nCash and Total Debt Outstanding\nCash on hand of $1,976,455 at March 31, 2018, increased 115% from 2017 year-end principally due to a significant increase in customer deposits.\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $1,280,180 for the first quarter 2018 from $136,170 the prior year. The significant increase in customer deposits was the key factor contributing to the first quarter 2018 amount, which primarily relates to orders for thin film solar products to be shipped in the second and third quarters of 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s total debt outstanding was $519,000, a 32% decrease compared to the same date last year. During the first quarter of this year the Company incurred a new capital lease obligation of approximately $105,000 for additional manufacturing equipment to increase production capacity.\nAbout SCI Engineered Materials, Inc.\nSCI Engineered Materials is a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced materials for PVD thin film applications that works closely with end user and OEMs to develop innovative, customized solutions.
