As previously announced, the Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018. The impact to first quarter revenue due to the adoption of ASC 606 was $33.5 million or 9% of year over year growth; As Adjusted revenue of $384.7 million was flat year over year after the effect of foreign exchange (down 1% before the effect of foreign exchange). Organic revenue decreased 1% year over year. Operating Income: GAAP operating income of $94.7 million compared to $41.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. The impact to first quarter operating income due to ASC 606 was $42.7 million; As Adjusted operating income of $71.9 million was up 6% year over year. Diluted Earnings per Share (“EPS”): GAAP diluted EPS of $1.71 compared to $0.42 for the first quarter of 2017. The impact due to ASC 606 was $0.88; As Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.24 was up 31% year over year.\nDeferred revenue for the Company as of March 31, 2018 was $583.2 million (based on ASC 606 standards). Under ASC 605 standards, deferred revenue as of March 31, 2018 was $695.9 million, up 5% year over year; Americas was $617.2 million, up 4% year over year and Non-Americas was $78.7 million, up 8% year over year. After adjusting for the effect of foreign exchange and acquisitions and dispositions, total Company deferred revenue (based on ASC 605 standards) was up 3%, Americas was up 4% and Non-Americas was down 2%, each as compared to March 31, 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Segment Results\nAmericas\nGAAP revenue of $345.7 million was up 10% year over year both after and before the effect of foreign exchange; As Adjusted revenue of $311.5 million was down 2% year over year both after and before the effect of foreign exchange; GAAP operating income of $106.4 million was up 85% year over year; As Adjusted operating income of $71.6 million was up 2% year over year.\nNon-Americas\nGAAP revenue of $72.5 million was up 8% year over year after the effect of foreign exchange (up 1% before the effect of foreign exchange); As Adjusted revenue of $73.2 million was up 8% year over year after the effect of foreign exchange (up 2% before the effect of foreign exchange); GAAP operating income of $20.4 million was up 12% year over year; As Adjusted operating income of $21.2 million was up 13% year over year.\nSee attached Schedules 4 and 5 for additional detail.\nDeclares Quarterly Dividend\nDun & Bradstreet today announced that it has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.5225 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on June 8, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 23, 2018.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) results, the Company evaluates performance and reports on a total company basis and on a business segment level basis its results (such as revenue, operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate and diluted earnings per share) on an “As Adjusted” basis. The term “As Adjusted” refers to the following: the elimination of the impact of ASC 606; the elimination of the effect on revenue due to purchase accounting fair value adjustments to deferred revenue; restructuring charges; other non-core gains and charges that are not in the normal course of our business (such as gains and losses on sales of businesses, impairment charges, effect of significant changes in tax laws and material tax and legal settlements); acquisition and divestiture-related fees (such as costs for bankers, legal fees, diligence costs, retention payments, and contingent consideration adjustments); and acquisition-related intangible amortization expense. A recurring component excluded from our “As Adjusted” results is our restructuring charges, which we believe do not reflect our underlying business performance. Such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period. Additionally, our “As Adjusted” results exclude the results of Discontinued Operations.\nWe also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another, both after and before the effects of foreign exchange. The change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting both our prior and current periods by a constant rate. As a result, we monitor our “As Adjusted” revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange.\nWe also analyze “As Adjusted” revenue growth on an organic basis because management believes this information provides important insight into the underlying/ongoing performance of the business. Organic revenue excludes the estimated revenue contribution from acquired businesses for one year from the date of the acquisition and net divested revenue which we define as the historical revenues from the divested businesses net of the annual ongoing future revenue streams resulting from the commercial arrangements entered into in connection with such divestitures.\nWe may from time to time use the term sales, which we define as the annual value of committed customer contracts. This term is often referred to as bookings or commitments by other companies.\nWe also monitor free cash flow as a measure of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. Free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and additions to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of investments.\nWe also monitor deferred revenue after adjusting for the effect of foreign exchange, dispositions, acquisitions and the impacts of the write-down of deferred revenue due to purchase accounting.\nWe believe that the use of our non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors. Non-GAAP results are presented only as a supplement to the financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader’s understanding of our underlying financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as an alternative measure of revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted EPS or net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related notes are presented and defined in Schedules 4 and 5 attached to this press release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Teleconference\nAs previously announced, Dun & Bradstreet will provide commentary on our first quarter and full year 2018 in a conference call with the investment community on Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 8 a.m. ET. Live audio, as well as a replay of the conference call will be accessible on Dun & Bradstreet's Investor Relations Web site at http://investor.dnb.com .\nAbout Dun & Bradstreet ®\nDun & Bradstreet (NYSE: DNB) grows the most valuable relationships in business.

Not Meaningful The following defines the non-GAAP measures used to evaluate performance: In addition to reporting generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) results, the Company evaluates performance and reports on a total company basis and on a business segment level basis its results (such as revenue, operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate and diluted earnings per share) on an “As Adjusted” basis. The term “As Adjusted” refers to the following: the elimination of the impact of ASC 606; the elimination of the effect on revenue due to purchase accounting fair value adjustments to deferred revenue; restructuring charges; other non-core gains and charges that are not in the normal course of our business (such as gains and losses on sales of businesses, impairment charges, effect of significant changes in tax laws, and material tax and legal settlements); acquisition and divestiture-related fees (such as costs for bankers, legal, due diligence, retention payments, and contingent consideration adjustments); and acquisition-related intangible amortization expense. A recurring component excluded from our “As Adjusted” results is our restructuring charges, which we believe do not reflect our underlying business performance. Such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period. Additionally, our “As Adjusted” results exclude the results of Discontinued Operations. Management reviews operating results on an “As Adjusted” basis on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures. Management further establishes annual and long-term compensation such as salaries, target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on performance on an “As Adjusted” basis and a significant percentage weight is placed upon performance on an “As Adjusted” basis in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved. Management believes that by reflecting these adjustments to our GAAP financial measures, business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that support our long-term growth strategy rather than being influenced by the potential impact one of these items can have in a particular period on their compensation. The Company adjusts for these items because they do not reflect the Company’s underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. We believe that the use of our non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors.\nWe also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another, both after and before the effects of foreign exchange. The change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting both our prior and current periods by a constant rate. As a result, we monitor our “As Adjusted” revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange.\nWe also analyze “As Adjusted” revenue growth on an organic basis because management believes this information provides important insight into the underlying/ongoing performance of the business. Organic revenue excludes the estimated revenue contribution from acquired businesses for one year from the date of the acquisition and net divested revenue which we define as the historical revenues from the divested businesses net of the annual ongoing future revenue streams resulting from the commercial arrangements entered into in connection with such divestitures.\nWe may from time to time use the term “sales”, which we define as the annual value of committed customer contracts. This term is often referred to as “bookings” or “commitments” by other companies.\nWe monitor free cash flow as a measure of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. Free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividend payments and additions to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of investments.\nFree cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for, or superior to, net cash flows provided by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe also monitor deferred revenue after adjusting for the effect of foreign exchange, dispositions, acquisitions and the impacts of the write-down of deferred revenue due to purchase accounting.\nThis financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006338/en/\nDun & Bradstreet\nDeborah McBride, 973-921-5714\nMedia\nmcbrided@dnb.com\nor\nKathy Guinnessey, 973-921-5892\nInvestors/Analysts\nKathy.Guinnessey@dnb.com\nSource: Dun & Bradstreet",
