(NYSE American:LGL) (the “Company” or “LGL”), announced its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nSummary of Q1 2018 Financial Results:\nRevenues of $5.9 million, up 5.7% compared to Q1 2017 Net income of $0.04 per share, in line with the prior year quarter Order backlog improved 22.2% to $13.3 million at March 31, 2018 from $10.9 million at March 31, 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $0.06 per share, compared to $0.12 per share for Q1 2017 Excluding the impact of dilution from the 2 million shares issued in Q4, 2017, adjusted EBITDA would have been $0.11 per share for Q1, 2018.\nCommenting on the Company’s Q1 2018 results, Executive Chairman and CEO, Michael J. Ferrantino, Sr. stated, “I am pleased to report that both revenues and backlog increased, and our book to bill ratio continued to be very positive. We experienced growth of 5.7% in revenues over the prior year quarter, while at the same time backlog increased over 22%, exceeding $13 million at the end of the quarter. This strong performance in sales and revenues, combined with our continued profitability, validates our strategy of developing higher margin, market-driven, highly engineered assemblies in the defense and aerospace markets.”\nMr. Ferrantino continued, “We have demonstrated our commitment and are continuing to work in pursuit of shareholder value. With our available funds, as well as our much improved operations we continue to look, both inside and outside our industry, where our management expertise will facilitate rapid top and bottom-line growth.”\nIn closing, Mr. Ferrantino added, “The Company is off to a great start and is positioned to perform well in 2018. We are looking forward to continuing to provide value to our dedicated employees, customers, and shareholders, and would like to thank you all for your support.”\nAbout The LGL Group, Inc.\nThe LGL Group, Inc., through its two principal subsidiaries MtronPTI and PTF, designs, manufactures and markets highly-engineered electronic components used to control the frequency or timing of signals in electronic circuits, and designs high performance frequency and time reference standards that form the basis for timing and synchronization in various applications.\nHeadquartered in Orlando, Florida, the Company has additional design and manufacturing facilities in Yankton, South Dakota, Wakefield, Massachusetts and Noida, India, with local sales offices in Hong Kong, Sacramento, California and Austin, Texas.\nFor more information on the Company and its products and services, contact James Tivy at The LGL Group, Inc., 2525 Shader Rd., Orlando, Florida 32804, (407) 298-2000, or visit www.lglgroup.com and www.mtronpti.com .\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

These adjustments to our GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income Before Income Taxes to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:\nFor the three months ended (in 000's, except shares and per share\namounts)\nMarch 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Net income before income taxes $ 194 $ 114 Interest (income) expense (12 ) 6 Depreciation and amortization 122 187 Non-cash stock compensation 7 7 Recovery of note receivable (4 ) — Adjusted EBITDA $ 307 $ 314 Basic per share information: Weighted average shares outstanding 4,696,415 2,675,466 Adjusted EBITDA per share $ 0.07 $ 0.12 Diluted per share information: Weighted average shares outstanding 4,806,196 2,688,484 Adjusted EBITDA per share $ 0.06 $ 0.12\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005195/en/\nThe LGL Group, Inc.\nJames Tivy, 407-298-2000\njtivy@lglgroup.com\nSource: The LGL Group, Inc.",
