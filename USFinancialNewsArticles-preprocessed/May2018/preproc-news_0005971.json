These purchases were executed under the Company's stock repurchase program. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $127.9 million remaining under its current repurchase program.\nDividends\nOn March 22, 2018, the Company paid $9.9 million to stockholders of record on March 1, 2018, for the quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock.\nAdditionally, on April 26, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock, payable on June 14, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 24, 2018.\nFinancial Guidance\nConsequent with the introduction of the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606, the Company announced it would begin using billings as a key measure of business progress.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide investors with important perspectives into the Company’s ongoing business performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. All financial data is presented on a GAAP basis except where the Company indicates its presentation is on a non-GAAP basis.\nSet forth below are reconciliations of the Company’s reported GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics.\nXPER-E\nXPERI CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (in thousands) (unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cash flows from operating activities: Net loss $ (33,017 ) $ (11,029 ) Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash from operating activities: Depreciation of property and equipment 1,775 1,834 Amortization of intangible assets 27,166 28,554 Stock-based compensation expense 7,408 7,081 Deferred income tax (6,743 ) (37,950 ) Amortization of premium or discount on investments and other 1,012 87 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (7,059 ) (7,132 ) Unbilled contracts receivable, net 31,123 30,620 Other assets (770 ) 6,575 Accounts payable (609 ) (3,292 ) Accrued legal fees (787 ) 1,499 Accrued and other liabilities (17,543 ) 183 Deferred revenue 2,694 1,932 Net cash from operating activities 4,650 18,962 Cash flows from investing activities: Purchases of property and equipment (768 ) (565 ) Purchases of short-term investments -
