    "text": "HONOLULU, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Hawaiian, Inc. (NASDAQ:FHB) (the “Company”) announced today the pricing of a secondary offering of 15,300,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $27.75 per share. The shares have been offered by an affiliate of BNP Paribas, the Company’s parent. The selling stockholder has also granted the underwriters a 30‑day option to purchase up to an additional 1,530,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling stockholder. The offering is expected to close on May 10, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nIn connection with the public offering, the Company has also agreed to repurchase from the selling stockholder a number of shares of common stock equal to approximately $81.8 million (the “direct share repurchase”). The per-share price to be paid by the Company is the same price paid by the underwriters in the public offering.\nCompletion of the public offering and the direct share repurchase will reduce BNP Paribas’ beneficial ownership stake in the Company from approximately 61.9% to 49.9% (or 48.8%, if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of the Company’s common stock is exercised in full).\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank Securities and J.P. Morgan are acting as underwriters for the offering.\nThe offering has been made only by means of a prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may”, “might”, “should”, “could”, “predict”, “potential”, “believe”, “expect”, “continue”, “will”, “anticipate”, “seek”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “projection”, “would”, “annualized” and “outlook”, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect our future results and financial condition, see our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, the prospectus described in this press release.\nInvestor Relations Contact: Media Contact: Kevin Haseyama, CFA Susan Kam (808) 525‑6268 (808) 525‑6254 khaseyama@fhb.com skam@fhb.com\nSource:First Hawaiian, Inc.",
