In a difficult market, we took measures to preserve and increase our liquidity, reduce operating costs and position our company for the eventual upturn in rates. Our operating initiatives created about $35.0 million in 2018 liquidity, including the net proceeds from a $44.5 million sale of a VLCC and a refinancing that resulted in the elimination of debt maturities for the next 13 months.”\nAngeliki Frangou continued, “In addition, we fixed 77.2% of our available days for the year, of which 32.3% include upside through profit sharing arrangements. We are also returning capital to stockholders, both through a dividend, providing a 11.0% current yield, and share repurchases, which year to date provided an additional 4.0% return.\"\nHIGHLIGHTS — RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nDividend of $0.02 per share of common stock\nOn May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors of Navios Acquisition declared a quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2018 of $0.02 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on June 27, 2018 to stockholders of record as of June 21, 2018. The declaration and payment of any further dividends remain subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, Navios Acquisition’s cash requirements as measured by market opportunities and restrictions under its credit agreements and other debt obligations and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem advisable.\nSale and leaseback agreement\nOn March 31, 2018, Navios Acquisition entered into a $71.5 million sale and leaseback agreement to refinance the outstanding balance on the existing facility on four product tankers. The proceeds were received in April 2018 and have been used to extinguish $69.25 million of indebtedness. The agreement provides for 24 quarterly payments of $1.5 million each plus interest at LIBOR plus 305 bps per annum. Navios Acquisition has an obligation to purchase the vessels at the end of the sixth year for $35.8 million. Navios Acquisition has no further maturities on its credit facilities for the next 13 months.\nCommercial and technical management fees fixed until May 2020\nNavios Acquisition fixed the fees of its vessels under its existing management agreement with Navios Tankers Management Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Navios Maritime Holdings Inc. (“Navios Holdings”), for an additional two-year period until May 28, 2020, following the expiration of the current fixed fee period, at a daily fee of: (a) $6,500 per MR2 product tanker and chemical tanker vessel; (b) $7,150 per LR1 product tanker vessel; and (c) $9,500 per VLCC. The increase represents a weighted average increase of 1.2% in the management fees of the fleet. Drydocking expenses are reimbursed at cost for all vessels.\nSale of a VLCC\nOn March 29, 2018, the Company sold to Navios Maritime Midstream Partners L.P. (“Navios Midstream”) the Nave Galactic, a 2009-built VLCC vessel of 297,168 dwt for a sale price of $44.5 million. The gain on sale of the vessel amounted to $0.03 million. As a result of this transaction, the Nave Galactic has been substituted by the Nave Equinox and the Nave Pyxis, two MR2 product tankers, as collateral under the 8 1/8% Secured Bond due 2021. On March 23, 2018, Navios Acquisition prepaid $26.8 million, being the respective tranche of the facility for the Nave Equinox and the Nave Pyxis.\nStock repurchase program\nAs of May 9, 2018, Navios Acquisition has repurchased 6,156,244 shares for approximately $5.0 million, under the $25.0 million stock repurchase program, providing an additional return of 4.0% to our stockholders.\nTime charter coverage\nNavios Acquisition currently owns 35 vessels, of which seven are VLCCs, 26 are product tankers and two are chemical tankers.\nCurrently, Navios Acquisition has contracted 77.2% of its available days on a charter-out basis for 2018, which is expected to generate revenues of approximately $111.9 million for 2018. The average contractual net daily charter-out rate for the 62.5% of the available days that are contracted on base rate and/or on base rate with profit sharing is expected to be $14,008 for 2018.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFor the following results and the selected financial data presented herein, Navios Acquisition has compiled its consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The quarterly information for 2018 and 2017 was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the respective periods.\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three Month\nPeriod ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n(unaudited) Three Month\nPeriod ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(unaudited) Revenue $ 46,150 $ 64,482 Net (loss)/ income $ (24,466 ) $ 5,615 Adjusted net (loss)/ income $ (17,920 ) ( 1) $ 5,615 Net cash (used in)/provided by operating activities $ (11,416 ) $ 27,636 EBITDA $ 8,760 $ 37,381 Adjusted EBITDA $ 15,009 (1) $ 37,381 (Loss)/ earnings per share (basic) $ (0.16 ) $ 0.04 Adjusted (loss)/income per share (basic) $ (0.11 ) (1) $ 0.04 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net (loss)/income and Adjusted (loss)/income per share (basic) for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 in this document excluded: (i) $6.0 million of negative effect on equity/ (loss) in net earnings of affiliated companies, relating to the sale of the Shinyo Kannika by Navios Midstream; (ii) $0.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation; and (iii) $0.03 million of gain from sale of the Nave Galactic. Adjusted net (loss)/income and Adjusted (loss)/income per share (basic) for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 were further adjusted to exclude $0.3 million write-off of deferred finance costs.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net (loss)/ income and Adjusted (loss)/income per share (basic) are non-GAAP financial measure and should not be used in isolation or substitution for Navios Acquisition’s results (see Exhibit II for reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA).\nThree month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 decreased by $18.3 million, or 28.4%, to $46.2 million, as compared to $64.5 million for the same period of 2017. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in the market rates during the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017. Available days of the fleet decreased to 3,181 days for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 3,207 days for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The time charter equivalent rate, or TCE Rate, decreased to $14,205 for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, from $19,475 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.\nNet loss for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $24.5 million as compared to $5.6 million net income for the same period of 2017. The decrease was mainly due to a: (a) $22.4 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA; (b) $6.0 million of negative effect on equity/ (loss) in net earnings of affiliated companies, relating to the sale of the Shinyo Kannika by Navios Midstream; (c) $0.7 million increase in direct vessel expenses; (d) $0.4 million decrease in interest income; (e) $0.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation; (f) $0.3 million write-off of deferred finance costs; and (g) $0.1 million increase in interest expense and finance cost.\nAdjusted EBITDA, affected by the items described in the table above, decreased by approximately $22.4 million to $15.0 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $37.4 million for the same period of 2017. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was mainly due to: (a) an $18.3 million decrease in revenue, as described above; (b) a $2.6 million increase in time charter expenses mainly due to the accrued backstop commitment to Navios Midstream; (c) a $1.1 million decrease in equity /(loss) in net earnings of affiliated companies (excluding the $6.0 million of negative effect on equity/ (loss) in net earnings of affiliated companies, relating to the sale of the Shinyo Kannika by Navios Midstream); (d) a $0.2 million increase in other expense, net; and (e) a $0.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation.\nFleet Employment Profile\nThe following table reflects certain key indicators of the performance of Navios Acquisition and its core fleet for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThree month period ended March 31, 20 18\n(unaudited) 201 7\n(unaudited) FLEET DATA Available days (1) 3,181 3,207 Operating days (2) 3,166 3,202 Fleet utilization (3) 99.5 % 99.8 % Vessels operating at period end 35 36 AVERAGE DAILY RESULTS Time charter equivalent rate per day (4) $ 14,205 $ 19,475 Navios Acquisition believes that the important measures for analyzing trends in its results of operations consist of the following:\n(1) Available days: Available days for the fleet are total calendar days the vessels were in Navios Acquisition’s possession for the relevant period after subtracting off-hire days associated with major repairs, drydocking or special surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. (2) Operating days : Operating days are the number of available days in the relevant period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a relevant period during which vessels actually generate revenues. (3) Fleet utilization: Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that Navios Acquisition’s vessels were available for generating revenue, and is determined by dividing the number of operating days during a relevant period by the number of available days during that period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company’s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs, dry dockings or special surveys. (4) TCE Rate: Time charter equivalent rate per day is defined as voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of available days during the period. The TCE Rate per day is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to present the actual daily earnings generated by vessels of various types of charter contracts for the number of available days of the fleet.

Net cash used in financing activities $ (43,733 ) $ (9,688 ) Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net (loss)/ income and Adjusted (loss)/ income per share (basic) are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or as substitution for Navios Acquisition’s results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).\nEBITDA represents net (loss)/income before interest and finance costs, before depreciation and amortization, before income taxes and before stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA in this document represents EBITDA excluding certain items as described under “Financial Highlights”. Adjusted net (loss)/ income and Adjusted (loss)/ income per share (basic) represent Net (loss)/ income and (loss)/ income per share (basic), excluding certain items as described under “Financial Highlights”. We use Adjusted EBITDA as liquidity measure and reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by/ (used in) operating activities, the most comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measure. EBITDA is calculated as follows: net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities adding back, when applicable and as the case may be, the effect of: (i) net increase/(decrease) in operating assets; (ii) net (increase)/decrease in operating liabilities; (iii) net interest cost; (iv) amortization of deferred finance costs and other related expenses; (v) equity/ (loss) in net earnings of affiliates, net of dividends received; (vi) payments for dry dock and special survey costs; (vii) impairment charges; (viii) gain on sale of assets; (ix) gain/ (loss) on debt repayment; and (x) stock- based compensation. Navios Acquisition believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are each the basis upon which liquidity can be assessed and present useful information to investors regarding Navios Acquisition’s ability to service and/or incur indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, meet working capital requirements and pay dividends. Navios Acquisition also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used: (i) by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions; (ii) to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates; and (iii) by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Navios Acquisition’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of Navios Acquisition’s performance. Furthermore, our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nEXHIBIT III\nVessels Type Year Built/Delivery DWT Date Owned Vessels Nave Polaris Chemical Tanker 2011 25,145 Nave Cosmos Chemical Tanker 2010 25,130 Nave Velocity MR2 Product Tanker 2015 49,999 Nave Sextans MR2 Product Tanker 2015 49,999 Nave Pyxis MR2 Product Tanker 2014 49,998 Nave Luminosity MR2 Product Tanker 2014 49,999 Nave Jupiter MR2 Product Tanker 2014 49,999 Bougainville MR2 Product Tanker 2013 50,626 Nave Alderamin MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,998 Nave Bellatrix MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,999 Nave Capella MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,995 Nave Orion MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,999 Nave Titan MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,999 Nave Aquila MR2 Product Tanker 2012 49,991 Nave Atria MR2 Product Tanker 2012 49,992 Nave Orbit MR2 Product Tanker 2009 50,470 Nave Equator MR2 Product Tanker 2009 50,542 Nave Equinox MR2 Product Tanker 2007 50,922 Nave Pulsar MR2 Product Tanker 2007 50,922 Nave Dorado MR2 Product Tanker 2005 47,999 Nave Atropos LR1 Product Tanker 2013 74,695 Nave Rigel LR1 Product Tanker 2013 74,673 Nave Cassiopeia LR1 Product Tanker 2012 74,711 Nave Cetus LR1 Product Tanker 2012 74,581 Nave Estella LR1 Product Tanker 2012 75,000 Nave Andromeda LR1 Product Tanker 2011 75,000 Nave Ariadne LR1 Product Tanker 2007 74,671 Nave Cielo LR1 Product Tanker 2007 74,671 Nave Buena Suerte VLCC 2011 297,491 Nave Quasar VLCC 2010 297,376 Nave Synergy VLCC 2010 299,973 Nave Spherical VLCC 2009 297,188 Nave Photon VLCC 2008 297,395 Nave Neutrino VLCC 2003 298,287 Nave Electron VLCC 2002 305,178\nSource:Navios Maritime Acquisition",
