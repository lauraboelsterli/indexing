    "text": "Xander Bogaerts hit a grand slam in the bottom of the third inning as the Boston Red Sox closed out April with a 10-6 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Monday night at Fenway Park.\nThe Red Sox set a team record with 19 wins in April. Boston also tied the major league record set by the 1996 Montreal Expos by hitting its sixth grand slam before May 1.\nBogaerts hit his second grand slam of the season and third of his career. He also recorded his fourth three-hit game of the season.\nMitch Moreland added a solo home run and bases-loaded walk for the Red Sox, who scored at least 10 runs for the fifth time. Andrew Benintendi lifted a sacrifice fly, Eduardo Nunez hit an RBI single and Rafael Devers had an RBI groundout and scored on an error.\nSalvador Perez and Lucas Duda drew bases-loaded walks and Jon Jay hit an infield single in a three-run first for the Royals. Whit Merrifield hit a pair of RBI doubles, and Alcides Escobar also hit an RBI double for Kansas City.\nThe Royals lost Mike Moustakas after his first plate appearance due to a right forearm contusion. Moustakas was hit by a pitch and X-rays were negative.\nBoston recorded its 21st win in 28 games without Mookie Betts for the second straight game due to a hamstring injury.\nNeither starter made it past the fifth.\nBoston’s Eduardo Rodriguez labored through the first inning and allowed five runs on five hits in four innings. Since Rodriguez did not qualify for the win due to official scoring rules, Hector Velazquez (4-0) was awarded the victory after pitching two scoreless innings.\nKansas City’s Jason Hammel (0-3) endured his worst start of the season, allowing eight runs and eight hits in 4 2/3 innings. It was the seventh time the right-hander allowed at least eight runs in a game.\nThe Royals loaded the bases in the first when Rodriguez hit Moustakas on the elbow and took a 1-0 lead when Perez walked on four pitches. After getting the first out, Rodriguez walked Duda, and Jay hit an infield single to Nunez at second base.\nMoreland made it 3-1 by driving a 1-0 fastball into the right field seats leading off the second. An inning later, Moreland worked a full-count walk to make it 3-2, and Bogaerts drove a full-count fastball over the Green Monster in left field and on to Lansdowne Street for a 6-3 lead.\nDoubles by Escobar and Merrifield in the fourth made it a one-run game, but Boston took a 7-5 lead on a sacrifice fly by Benintendi in the bottom half.\nNunez’s single in the fifth made it 8-5 and knocked out Hammel. Moreland made it 9-5 in the seventh when he scored on a groundout by Devers, who scored from second when third baseman Cheslor Cuthbert dropped Jackie Bradley Jr.’s pop up.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
