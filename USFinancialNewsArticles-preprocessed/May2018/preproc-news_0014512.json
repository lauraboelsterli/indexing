Operating margin improved, and our business development pipeline increased sequentially, following a strong quarter of contract awards,\" said Sudhakar Kesavan, ICF's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer .\n\"Revenue growth reflected higher year-on-year demand from both our government and commercial client sets, led by strong results from the commercial energy and international government markets and positive year-on-year growth in commercial marketing services. Operating income increased despite significant investments in capture and proposal activities around disaster recovery opportunities.\n\"At the end of the 2018 first quarter, our business development pipeline was $4.4 billion. We are pleased that we are seeing opportunities where we can use our expertise on contracts funded by both the Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These opportunities, as well as further clarity with respect to forthcoming RFPs from jurisdictions affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, are expected to result in a considerable increase in our pipeline during this year's second quarter,\" Mr. Kesavan noted.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue was $302.8 million, a 2.2 percent increase from $296.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.

The midpoint of our total revenue guidance is equivalent to 2.9 percent growth, which equates to approximately 4 percent growth in service revenue. The midpoint of our diluted EPS guidance reflects an estimated year-on-year increase of 16.7 percent, after normalizing 2017 EPS for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to range from $3.60 to $3.80. Per-share guidance is based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 19.1 million. Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million.\n\"Full year 2018 guidance continues to contemplate no significant benefit from the increase in appropriations for federal civilian agencies included in the two-year federal government budget, given the time it takes for funds to become available to the agencies and departments. Similarly, this year's guidance does not include any significant new disaster recovery-related contract wins that might occur,\" concluded Mr. Kesavan.\n1 Non-GAAP EPS, Service Revenue, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP measurements to the most applicable GAAP number is set forth below. The presentation of non-GAAP measurements may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAbout ICF\nICF (NASDAQ:ICFI) is a global consulting services company with over 5,000 specialized experts, but we are not your typical consultants.

While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may define similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently and, accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how we define these measures.\n(3) Subcontractor and Other Direct Costs is Direct Costs excluding Direct Labor and Fringe Costs.\n(4) Acquisition-related expenses related to closed acquisitions consisting primarily of consultant and other outside third-party costs.\n(5) Special charges related to severance for staff realignment: These costs are mainly due to either involuntary employee termination benefits for Company officers who have been terminated as part of a consolidation or reduction in operations, or collective termination benefits of an identifiable group of employees terminated as part of a discontinued service offering.\n(6) Special charges related to office closures: These costs are exit costs associated with terminated leases or full office closures. These exit costs include charges incurred under a contractual obligation that existed as of the date of the accrual and for which we will either continue to pay until the contractual obligation is satisfied but with no economic benefit to us.\n(7) EBITDA Margin Percent and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Percent were calculated by dividing the non-GAAP measure by the corresponding revenue.\n(8) Income tax effects were calculated using an effective U.S. GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and 31.2% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nICF International, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 19,292\n$ 11,809\nContract receivables, net\n167,170\n168,318\nContract assets\n128,522\n123,197\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\n15,010\n11,327\nIncome tax receivable\n7,008\n5,596\nRestricted cash - current\n—\n11,191\nTotal Current Assets\n337,002\n331,438\nProperty and Equipment, net\n37,260\n38,052\nOther Assets:\nGoodwill\n694,338\n686,108\nOther intangible assets, net\n35,861\n35,304\nRestricted cash - non-current\n1,273\n1,266\nOther assets\n21,287\n18,087\nTotal Assets\n$ 1,127,021\n$ 1,110,255\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$ 68,601\n$ 75,074\nContract liabilities\n32,281\n38,571\nAccrued salaries and benefits\n46,542\n45,645\nAccrued subcontractors and other direct costs\n34,711\n47,508\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n25,069\n17,572\nTotal Current Liabilities\n207,204\n224,370\nLong-term Liabilities:\nLong-term debt\n231,490\n206,250\nDeferred rent\n13,955\n15,119\nDeferred income taxes\n36,386\n33,351\nOther\n15,485\n15,135\nTotal Liabilities\n504,520\n494,225\nCommitments and Contingencies\nStockholders' Equity:\nPreferred stock, par value $.001;
