    "text": "EditorsNote: fixes “Kendrys” in second graf\nThe Toronto Blue Jays scored three runs in the 10th inning, two on wild pitches, to defeat the Minnesota Twins 7-4 Tuesday night in Minneapolis.\nKendrys Morales hit two home runs for the Blue Jays, who have won three in a row, including the first two games of the three-games against the Twins. Minnesota has lost 11 of its past 12 games.\nJoe Mauer and Eddie Rosario homered for the Twins.\nKevin Pillar led off the 10th inning with a double against John Curtiss (0-1). It was Pillar’s 10th consecutive hit that went for extra bases. Morales was walked intentionally. Pillar then stole third and Morales then stole second before Luke Maile walked to load the bases.\nPillar scored on a wild pitch. An infield single by Aledmys Diaz scored pinch runner Gift Ngoepe, and Maile scored on a wild pitch by Matt Magill to give Toronto a 7-4 lead.\nTyler Clippard (4-0) pitched a perfect ninth to earn the win and Roberto Osuna pitched a perfect 10th to pick up his eighth save of the season.\nToronto starter Marco Estrada allowed four runs, seven hits and one walk in five-plus innings. He struck out three.\nTwins starter Kyle Gibson allowed two runs, five hits and two walks and struck out six in five innings.\nThe Twins scored twice in the first. Mauer hit his first homer of the season, and Max Kepler walked and scored on Rosario’s double.\nThe Blue Jays scored two runs in the fifth to tie the game.\nMorales, who replaced Steve Pearce as DH in a late lineup change, hit his second homer of the season to lead off the fifth. Morales had ended his 0-for-21 drought with a second-inning single. Maile singled, Curtis Granderson walked, and Justin Smoak hit an RBI single to score the second run.\nMorales hit his second homer of the game in the sixth against Twins reliever Ryan Pressly to give Toronto a 3-2 lead.\nThe Twins regained the lead, 4-3, in the bottom of the sixth when Eduardo Escobar doubled before Rosario hit his fourth homer of the season.\nThe Blue Jays tied the game at 4 against Addison Reed in the eighth. Smoak walked, Yangervis Solarte doubled and Pillar hit a sacrifice fly.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
