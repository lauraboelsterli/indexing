FILE PHOTO: Rugby Union - Rugby World Cup 2023 Host Country Announcement - Royal Garden Hotel, London, Britain - November 15, 2017 Bill Beaumont Chairman of World Rugby during the press conference Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs\nThe risk of serious injury from collision in the professional game has grown in tandem with the sport becoming faster and more open over the years, leading to calls for new rules to halt the rising tide of injuries.\nWorld Rugby’s trials aim to change player behaviour by lowering the acceptable height of the tackle through a series of revised on-field and off-field sanctions.\n“As a rugby father with sons playing at the elite and community level, I am committed to ensuring that rugby remains at the forefront of injury-prevention, specifically in the area of concussion,” World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont said.\nResearch commissioned by the governing body revealed that while 76 percent of head injuries occur in the tackle, the risk of injury to both players from contact when the tackler is upright is 4.3 times greater than in a low-contact tackle (when the tackler bends at the waist).\nAt the U-20 Championship in France, which begins next week, a high tackle warning will be issued if the tackler does not bend at the waist when tackling and there is clear and obvious head contact for either player.\nTwo high tackle warnings for the same player will trigger an automatic one-match ban.\nThe trial does not change the law in any way, but does introduce post-match sanctioning through the citing process.\nThe law defining what constitutes a high tackle will be altered on a trial basis for the U20 Trophy, the dates and location of which are yet to be decided.\nCurrently the acceptable height of a tackle according to Law 9.13 is the line of the shoulders, but this will lowered to “below the nipple line”, the governing body said.\n“This trial is designed to remove the tackler’s head from a high-risk situation through a deterrent based on a combination of law amendment, sanction and technique change,” said World Rugby Chief Medical Officer Dr Martin Raftery.
