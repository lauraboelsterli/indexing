    "text": "0 COMMENTS Italian government bonds and Spanish stocks sell off Treasury yields edge down further below the 3% mark Oil prices down U.S. stocks stalled Friday as investors parsed the cancellation of a landmark summit between the U.S. and North Korea and political concerns rattled European markets.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50 points, or 0.2%, to 24763 ahead of a holiday-lengthened weekend. The S&P 500 lost 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.1%. The U.S. stock market is closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.\nStock indexes around the world had closed broadly lower Thursday after President Donald Trump called off a much-awaited summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, citing “open hostility” from North Korea.\nThe move drummed up fresh uncertainty among investors over U.S. relations in the region. Still, many investors remain convinced that the rekindled tensions are driven by a new aggressive negotiating style favored by upstart politicians—including Mr. Trump—and that they are unlikely to cause disruption in the longer term.\nPeople walking by a Wall Street sign close to the New York Stock Exchange in April. Photo: shannon stapleton/Reuters “What I have been seeing for the past 6 months is that there are a lot more opportunities than there was last year, there’s just more stuff happening,” said Christian Ryther, manager of Curreen Capital Management, who has been adding risk to his portfolio.\nDespite some wobbles, the S&P 500 remained up 0.3% on the week, supported by gains in shares of utilities and real-estate companies—bondlike stocks that tend to do well in times of market volatility.\nAdvances in those sectors helped offset steep losses in the S&P 500 energy sector, which fell Friday and headed toward a sharp weekly loss as U.S. crude oil prices tumbled.\nU.S. crude was last down 2.7% to $68.80 a barrel after major oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled they might be willing to relax global production caps . The selling weighed on the energy sector, with shares of Hess falling 6.3% and Newfield Exploration shedding 5.7%.\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 headed toward a 1.2% weekly decline as investors weighed signs of political risk being reawakened in the eurozone.\nAntiestablishment parties are heading a new Italian government, while Spain is submerged in a corruption scandal that could lead to new elections.\nThe developments led investors to dump Italian government bonds, sending yields on the 10-year bond to its highest level since 2014.\n“We are avoiding Italian risk because there’s a contagion fee there,” said Angus Sippe, a fund manager at Schroders, an asset manager with about $600 billion under management. “In the [eurozone] periphery, you clearly see political risk.”\nSpanish stocks came under pressure, too, with the benchmark IBEX 35 index down 2.5% after the country’s main-opposition Socialist Party filed a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.\nA court ruled Thursday that Mr. Rajoy’s party had benefited financially from an illegal kickback scheme. The group has said it would appeal the ruling.\nWhile new elections can’t be called while the motion is running its course, it could eventually lead to Mr. Rajoy being unseated—at a time when Spanish politics have been shaken by the independence push of Catalonia, one of its wealthier regions.\nIn fixed-income markets, U.S. government bonds extended a recent rally, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note recently trading at 2.952%, compared with 2.981% Thursday.\nYields, which fall as bond prices rise, have pulled back in recent days as bubbling geopolitical tensions and signs that the Federal Reserve would be willing to remain on a gradual pace of interest-rate increases have helped drive up demand for Treasurys.\nWrite to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com",
