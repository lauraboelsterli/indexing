    "text": "GREENSBORO, N.C., May 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Qorvo® (Nasdaq:QRVO), a leading provider of innovative RF solutions that connect the world, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The new repurchase program includes approximately $126 million authorized under a prior program.\nUnder the share repurchase program, share repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations. The program does not require the Company to repurchase a minimum number of shares and does not have a fixed term, and it may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.\nAbout Qorvo\nQorvo (Nasdaq:QRVO) makes a better world possible by providing innovative RF solutions at the center of connectivity.
