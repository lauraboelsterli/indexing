    "text": "May 12, 2018 / 3:56 PM / Updated 3 hours ago Tennis-Thiem beats Anderson for first time to reach Madrid final Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMay 12 (Reuters) - Austrian Dominic Thiem beat Kevin Anderson for the first time at the seventh attempt to reach the Madrid Open final for the second successive year on Saturday.\nThe fifth seed won 6-4 6-2 as he continued the scintillating form that ended top seed Rafa Nadal’s year-long unbeaten run on clay the day before.\nSouth African Anderson, seeded sixth, was playing in his first Masters 1000 semi-final but faded after a solid start.\nWhile Thiem had a 0-6 record against Anderson, the pair had never met on the Austrian’s favoured clay surface, and the longer rallies suited his heavy baseline game.\nThiem needed a single break of serve in the opening set and broke twice in the second to wrap up victory.\nHe will play either Alexander Zverev or Canadian Denis Shapovalov in Sunday’s final.
