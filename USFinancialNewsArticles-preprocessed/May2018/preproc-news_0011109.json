    "text": "New cars sold in the U.S. must now have backup cameras to help drivers avoid accidents.\nA federal regulation took full effect Wednesday requiring the rearview cameras and video displays on new models.\nSafety advocates say the cameras will help prevent accidents in which pedestrians — often children — are run over because a driver can't see them.\nCongress passed a law in 2008 requiring regulators to enact measures requiring the adoption of technology to greatly improve rearview visibility.\nAfter years of delays, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced the camera requirement in 2014, giving automakers several years to prepare.\nMany higher-end models and mainstream vehicles with extra safety packages already have rearview cameras. But the technology will now be standard in even the cheapest of new cars.\n\"The regulation is a monumental advancement of safety for children, pedestrians, bicyclists and other vulnerable road users,\" said Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, in a statement.\nBackover crashes kill more than 200 people annually and injure more than 12,000.\nMore from USA Today:\nTesla accused of violating Nikola Motor patents with electric semi truck, sues for $2B\nFord kills the Taurus, Fiesta and Fusion: What we loved and hated about the cars\nNissan sales plunge, Ford, others also down in April as auto industry cools off",
