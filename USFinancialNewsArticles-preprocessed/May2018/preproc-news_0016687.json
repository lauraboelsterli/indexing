    "text": "HOUSTON, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) today announced financial results for its 13-week third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nSales increased 6.1% to $14.3 billion Gross profit increased 5.6% to $2.7 billion; gross margin decreased 9 basis points to 18.65% Operating income increased 11.5% to $486 million; adjusted operating income increased 7.1% to $536 million Earnings Per Share ¹ (EPS) increased $0.19 to $0.63; adjusted EPS increased $0.16 to $0.67\nFirst 39 Weeks of Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nSales increased 6.0% to $43.4 billion Gross profit increased 4.8% to $8.2 billion; gross margin decreased 23 basis points to 18.82% Operating income increased 9.8% to $1.6 billion; adjusted operating income increased 5.5% to $1.8 billion Earnings Per Share ¹ (EPS) increased $0.33 to $1.85; adjusted EPS increased $0.43 to $2.19\n“We had a solid quarter, driven by strong top-line results that translated into healthy gross profit dollar growth,” said Tom Bené, Sysco’s president and chief executive officer. “Despite some ongoing cost challenges, we remain on target to deliver on our current three-year plan.”\n¹Earnings Per Share (EPS) are shown on a diluted basis unless otherwise specified. Adjusted financial results exclude certain items, which primarily include restructuring, acquisition-related costs, loss on debt extinguishment, tax benefits from a retirement plan contribution and certain impacts of tax law changes. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures are included in this release.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nU.S. Foodservice Operations\nSales for the third quarter were $9.7 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to the same period last year.

Food cost inflation was 2.6% in U.S. Broadline, as measured by the estimated change in Sysco's product costs, primarily in the meat, dairy and produce categories.\nOperating expenses increased $69 million, or 6.0%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating expenses increased $68 million, or 5.9%, due mainly to increased supply chain and selling expenses.\nOperating income was $695 million, an increase of $6 million, or 0.9%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating income was $697 million, an increase of $8 million, or 1.2% compared to the prior year period.\nInternational Foodservice Operations\nSales for the third quarter were $2.8 billion, an increase of 10.7% compared to the same period last year.\nGross profit increased 12.9% to $583 million, and gross margin increased 40 basis points to 20.84%, compared to the prior year period.\nOperating expenses increased $63 million, or 12.6%, compared to the same period last year.

Adjusted operating income was $45 million, an increase of $5 million, or 11.6% compared to the prior year period.\nFirst 39 Weeks of Fiscal 2018 Results\nU.S. Foodservice Operations\nSales for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018 were $29.2 billion, an increase of 5.2% compared to the same period last year. Local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations grew 3.3% for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018, of which 2.8% was organic, and total case volume grew 2.0%, of which 1.6% was organic.\nGross profit increased 4.3% to $5.8 billion; and gross margin decreased 16 basis points to 19.89%. Food cost inflation was 3.2% in U.S. Broadline, as measured by the estimated change in Sysco's product costs, primarily in the meat, dairy and produce categories.\nOperating expenses increased $174.1 million, or 5.0%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating expenses increased $172.9 million, or 5.0%, driven primarily by an increase in selling and supply chain expenses.\nOperating income was $2.2 billion, an increase of $66.9 million, or 3.2%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating income was $2.2 billion, an increase of $68.2 million, or 3.2% compared to the prior year period.\nInternational Foodservice Operations\nSales for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018 were $8.6 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to the same period last year.\nGross profit increased 6.3% to $1.8 billion, and gross margin decreased 48 basis points to 20.98% compared to the prior year period.\nOperating expenses increased $139 million, or 9.2%, compared to the same period last year.

Adjusted operating income was $218 million, a decrease of $36 million, or 14.1%, compared to the same period last year.\nImpact of Tax Benefits\nDuring the quarter, the tax rate was 9.5% due to various benefits. As a result of this rate, earnings per share growth of 43.2% exceeded operating income growth of 11.5%. These tax benefits included a benefit from a contribution of $330 million to de-risk and fund our defined-benefit retirement plan, which was deductible using fiscal 2017 tax rates, tax benefits from stock option exercises and additional tax credits.\nCapital Spending and Cash Flow\nCash flow from operations was $1.1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018, which was $42 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018 was $768 million, which was $81 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both cash flow from operations and free cash flow are largely driven by reduced cash taxes that were paid and increased earnings, partially offset by a contribution to our defined-benefit retirement plan.\nCapital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of plant and equipment, totaled $356 million for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018, which was $39 million lower compared to the same period last year.\nConference Call & Webcast\nSysco will host a conference call to review the Company’s third quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on Monday, May 7, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. A live webcast of the call, accompanying slide presentation and a copy of this news release will be available online at investors.sysco.com .\nKey Highlights: 13-Week Period Ended 39-Week Period Ended Financial Comparison: March 31, 2018 Change March 31, 2018 Change Sales $14.3 billion 6.1% $43.4 billion 6.0% Gross profit $2.7 billion 5.6% $8.2 billion 4.8% Gross Margin 18.65 % -9 bps 18.82 % -23 bps GAAP: Operating expenses $2.2 billion 4.4% $6.5 billion 3.6% Certain Items $49.8 million -22.5% $135.8 million -28.4% Operating Income $485.9 million 11.5% $1.6 billion 9.8% Operating Margin 3.39 % 16 bps 3.78 % 13 bps Net Earnings $330.1 million 38.5% $981.8 million 17.3% Diluted Earnings Per Share $0.63 43.2% $1.85 21.7% Non-GAAP (1) : Operating Expenses $2.1 billion 5.2% $6.4 billion 4.6% Operating Income $535.8 million 7.1% $1.8 billion 5.5% Operating Margin 3.73 % 3 bps 4.09 % -2 bps Net Earnings $355.6 million 28.9% $1.2 billion 19.7% Diluted Earnings Per Share $0.67 31.4% $2.19 24.4% Case Growth: U.S. Broadline 2.4% 2.0% Local 2.6 % 3.3 % Sysco Brand Sales as a % of Cases: U.S. Broadline 37.38% 31 bps 37.71% 36 bps Local 45.87 % 62 bps 45.97 % 55 bps Note:\n(1) A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in this release.\nIndividual components in the table above may not sum to the totals due to the rounding.\nAbout Sysco\nSysco is the global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other customers who prepare meals away from home.

Such forward-looking statements reflect the views of management at the time such statements are made and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These statements include: our expectations regarding our strategic investments across our business, including, but not limited to, our supply chain transformation in Europe, our investments in our selling organization, including marketing associates in the U.S., and the impact of such investments on our local sales, and investments in our technology, including, but not limited to, enhancements to the ordering process; our expectations regarding the success of Sysco France; our expectations regarding customer loyalty and local customer case growth; our expectations regarding the rise of restaurant sales; our expectations regarding local customer growth and our customers’ experience; statements regarding the execution of our strategic priorities and satisfaction of our customers’ needs; statements regarding product inflation and other economic trends in the United States and abroad; statements regarding the execution of our long-term plans, including investments in necessary capability across the International business and leveraging our position as a platform for future growth; expectations regarding the trajectory of our top line growth; our expectations regarding future performance and growth, including cash flow performance and free cash flow; expectations regarding adjusted operating leverage for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018; expectations regarding gross profit growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018; our expectations regarding our effective tax rate, our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and the positive impact of the Tax Act generally, including on our cash savings and our use thereof, and on our three-year financial plan earnings targets; our expectations with respect to achieving our three-year financial targets through fiscal 2018 and our new three-year financial targets through fiscal 2020; the negative impact of inbound freight challenges on our gross profit dollars; statements regarding Sysco brand growth, including growing product breadth, revitalization efforts and new products from our Cutting Edge Solutions process; expectations regarding lower than anticipated capital expenditures; and expectations regarding our earnings per share for fiscal 2018 and 2019. The success of our plans and expectations regarding our operating performance, including expectations regarding our three-year financial objectives, are subject to the general risks associated with our business, including the risks of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, crop conditions, work stoppages, intense competition, technology disruptions, dependence on large regional and national customers, inflation risks, the impact of fuel prices, adverse publicity, and labor issues. Risks and uncertainties also include risks impacting the economy generally, including the risks that the current general economic conditions will deteriorate, or consumer confidence in the economy or consumer spending, particularly on food-away-from-home, may decline. Market conditions may not improve. If sales from our locally managed customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from regional and national customers, our gross margins may decline. Our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives depends largely on the success of our various business initiatives, including efforts related to revenue management, expense management, our digital e-commerce strategy and any efforts related to restructuring or the reduction of administrative costs. There are various risks related to these efforts, including the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame, if at all, and may prove costlier than expected; the risk that the actual costs of any initiatives may be greater or less than currently expected; and the risk of adverse effects to our business, results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings, and the associated changes to our business, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. Our plans related to and the timing of any initiatives are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts, we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. Capital expenditures may vary based on changes in business plans and other factors, including risks related to the implementation of various initiatives, the timing and successful completion of acquisitions, construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or cancellations of capital spending. Periods of high inflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have a negative impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-away-from-home market, and may negatively impact our sales, gross profit, operating income and earnings, and periods of deflation can be difficult to manage effectively. Fluctuations in inflation and deflation, as well as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, are beyond our control and subject to broader market forces. Expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and risks, including compliance with local laws, regulations and customs and the impact of local political and economic conditions, including the impact of Brexit, and such expansion efforts, including our Brakes acquisition, may not be successful. Any business that we acquire, including the Brakes transaction, may not perform as expected, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. The Brakes Group acquisition will require a significant commitment of time and company resources, and realizing the anticipated benefits from the transaction may take longer than expected. Expectations regarding the financial statement impact of any acquisitions may change based on management’s subjective evaluation. Meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings, available cash and the success of our various strategic initiatives. For a discussion of additional factors impacting Sysco’s business, see the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2017, as filed with the SEC, and the company’s subsequent filings with the SEC. Sysco does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.\nSysco Corporation and its Consolidated Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSysco Corporation and its Consolidated Subsidiaries\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)\nImpact of Certain Items\nSysco’s results of operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017 are impacted by restructuring costs consisting of: (1) expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016, as a result of which we incurred costs to convert to a modernized version of our established platform as opposed to completing the implementation of an ERP; (2) professional fees related to our three-year strategic plan; (3) restructuring expenses within our Brakes Group operations; and (4) severance charges related to restructuring. In addition, fiscal 2018 results of operations are impacted by business technology transformation initiative costs, facility closure charges, multiemployer pension (MEPP) withdrawal charges and debt extinguishment charges. Our results of operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017 are also impacted by the following acquisition-related items: (1) intangible amortization expense and (2) integration costs. All acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2018 and 2017 that have been excluded relate to the Brakes acquisition. The Brakes acquisition also resulted in non-recurring tax expense in fiscal 2017, primarily from non-deductible transaction costs. Sysco’s results of operations for fiscal 2018 are also impacted by reform measures from the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The impact for fiscal 2018 includes: (1) a provisional estimate of a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, (2) a net benefit from remeasuring Sysco’s accrued income taxes, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax rates and (3) a benefit from contributions made to fund Sysco’s tax-qualified United States (U.S.) pension plan (the Plan). These fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 items are collectively referred to as \"Certain Items.\"\nManagement believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, interest expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company's underlying operations, facilitating comparisons on a year-over-year basis and (2) removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that, as a result, are difficult to include in analysts' financial models and our investors' expectations with any degree of specificity.\nAlthough Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions, the Brakes Group is significantly larger than the companies historically acquired by Sysco, with a proportionately greater impact on Sysco’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, Sysco is excluding from its non-GAAP financial measures for the relevant period solely those acquisition costs specific to the Brakes acquisition. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco’s results for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, interest expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented.

Sysco considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. However, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. In the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities.\n39-Week\nPeriod Ended\nMar. 31, 2018 39-Week\nPeriod Ended\nApr. 1, 2017 39-Week\nPeriod Change\nin Dollars Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 1,124,187 $ 1,082,424 $ 41,763 Additions to plant and equipment (372,612 ) (413,776 ) 41,164 Proceeds from sales of plant and equipment 16,910 19,091 (2,181 ) Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) $ 768,485 $ 687,739 $ 80,746\nSource:Sysco Corporation",
