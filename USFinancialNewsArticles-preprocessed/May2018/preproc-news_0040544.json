(the \"Company\" or \"MamaMancini's\") (OTCQB: MMMB), a marketer of specialty pre-prepared, frozen and refrigerated all-natural food products (as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018, ended January 31, 2018.\nFiscal Year Highlights:\nFiscal year 2018 revenue increased 53% to $27.5 million compared to fiscal 2017 revenue of $18.0 million. Fiscal year 2018 gross margin was 34%, impacted by product mix to larger customers (with resulting lower operating expenses), one-time integration issues, and commodity prices, compared to 40% in 2017. Total operating expenses for the fiscal year 2018 increased 21% versus the comparable fiscal 2017. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased to 29.8% of net sales from 37.4% in fiscal 2017. Income from operations for fiscal 2018 improved to $1.063 million versus $456,000 in the prior year; an increase of approximately $620,000. Placements on grocer's shelves increased at the end of the fiscal 2018 to 43,800, up from 38,700 as of January 31, 2017. Sales per placement per retail food shelf location increased 35% from prior year. EBITDA for fiscal 2018 was $1.601 million compared to $ 0.898 million in fiscal 2017. Net Income for fiscal year 2018 was $319,740, compared with a net loss of $301,080 in fiscal 2017. Net income available to common stockholders for fiscal year 2018 was $228,175 or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $506,001, or $(0.02) per diluted share, in fiscal 2017. Cash Flow from Operations was $1,315,240 the year vs. $357,234 for the prior year.\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nFourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 revenue increased 45% to $7.8 million compared to $5.4 million in prior year period. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 33%, compared to an estimated 40% for fiscal 2017. The gross margin percentage of sales decrease in this fiscal year was mainly due to a change in product mix to larger accounts which resulted in lower marketing, merchandising, freight, sales commissions, and promotional expenses than smaller accounts. Gross margin is expected to increase as a percentage of sales to 38% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due to better cost management and production efficiencies after the integration of Joseph Epstein Foods Enterprises, Inc. (JEFE). Net income was $113,591 and net income available to common stockholders was $113,591, or $0.00 per diluted share, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 are unaudited and subject to final review and are not included in the fourth quarter comparisons above.\nCarl Wolf, Chief Executive Officer of MamaMancini's, commented, \"In terms of financial and operating results, we had a very solid year in fiscal 2018. Revenue for the year increased 53% to $27.5 million versus $18 million in fiscal 2017. Income from operations increased significantly on a year-over-year basis to $1.1 million from $0.5 million in the previous fiscal year. Net income available to common shareholders for fiscal 2018 was $228,175, or $0.01 per fully diluted share, compared to a net loss of $506,001, or $(0.02) per fully diluted share, in fiscal 2017. We are pleased with the traction that we are continuing to achieve on our strategic business plan.\nWhile product mix to larger accounts during the year and integration of the Joseph Epstein Foods Enterprises (“JEFE”) acquisition impacted our gross margin, which came in at 34% versus 40% last year, we see this as a temporary impact and expect fiscal 2019 gross margin to be more in line with our historical levels of around 38%. With the JEFE acquisition now fully integrated, we are looking forward to consistent operational efficiencies going forward.”\nMr. Wolf concluded, “As we go through fiscal 2019, we will continue to focus on selling our products into the food service area, on the perimeter of the retail grocery store, where fresh, minimally or non-processed, healthy foods are offered, and where the superior revenue and margin opportunities exist. We will continue to develop new products that will meet the needs of the rapidly growing sector of consumers that seek superior nutritional profiles, with all-natural ingredients and minimal prep time to serve their families. We believe this strategy will enable MamaMancini’s to continue to attract new large national accounts, and to gain a substantial number of new customers around the country.”\nThe Company’s strategy of developing larger customers and exiting underperforming accounts that do not generate attractive returns has achieved improving operating results. The Company expects some seasonality in sales growth in summer months, but a continuation of significant revenue growth on a yearly basis for the foreseeable future as it continues to develop larger accounts and introduce new product lines. As a result, the company is anticipating fiscal 2019 revenues and operating results to increase significantly over prior year and report continued increased profitability.\nConference Call\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, May 16, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET, to review the results of fiscal year 2018.\nInterested parties may participate on the conference call by dialing (844) 889-4326 or (412) 317-9264.
