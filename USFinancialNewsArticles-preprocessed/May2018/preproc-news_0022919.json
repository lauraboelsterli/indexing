    "text": "SAINT LAURENT, Quebec, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IntelGenx Technologies Corp. (TSX-V:IGX) (OTCQX:IGXT) (the “Company” or “IntelGenx”) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. All dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. currency and results are reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles except where noted otherwise.\n2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights:\nTotal revenue was $239,000, which reflected decreases in deferred and upfront revenues of $922,000 and 408,000, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.8 million), compared to adjusted EBITDA of ($117,000) in the same period last year. Cash and short-term investments totalled $2.4 million as at March 31, 2018, which did not include gross proceeds of $3.2 million raised by the Company in its May 2018 unit offering.\nRecent Developments:\nPresented overviews of the Company’s business at the 10 th Annual Biotech Showcase in January 2018 and at the Bloom Burton & Co. Healthcare Investor Conference in May 2018. Initiated Phase 2a proof of concept Montelukast VersaFilm™ clinical trial in Alzheimer’s patients, following clearance of the Clinical Trial Application by Health Canada. IntelGenx retained the services of Cogstate and JSS Medical Research as the Contract Research Organizations to support the Montelukast VersaFilm™ study. Patient screening is expected to begin in Q2 2018.\n“With the completion of the private placement offering earlier this week, we now have sufficient financial resources to support our Montelukast Phase 2a clinical trial and to continue advancing the rest of our product pipeline toward commercialization,” commented Dr. Horst G. Zerbe, President and CEO of IntelGenx.\nFinancial Results:\nTotal revenues for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $239,000, compared to $1.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. The decrease for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to the last year’s corresponding period is mainly attributable to a decrease in deferred revenues on monetization of $922,000 and a decrease in upfront revenues of $408,000, partially offset by an increase in Research and Development revenues of $218,000.\nOperating costs and expenses were $2.3 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, versus $1.8 million for the corresponding quarter in 2017. The increase for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 is mainly attributable to a $153,000 increase in Research and Development expenses and a $376,000 increase in mostly non-recurring Selling, General and Administrative expenses.\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company had an operating loss of $2.0 million, compared to an operating loss of $457,000 for the comparable period of 2017.\nNet comprehensive loss was $2.3 million, or $0.03 on a basic and diluted per share basis, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net comprehensive loss of $468,000, or $0.01 on a basic and diluted per share basis, for the comparable period of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s cash and short-term investments totalled $2.4 million, which did not include gross proceeds of $3.2 million raised in its May 2018 unit offering.\nConference Call Details:\nIntelGenx will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results today, May 10, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET.
