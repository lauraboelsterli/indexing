LOUIS, Mo. and MOORESTOWN, N.J., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tabula Rasa HealthCare (NASDAQ:TRHC), a healthcare technology company offering comprehensive data-driven software solutions and services for healthcare organizations, today announced it has acquired Peak PACE Solutions, the leading health plan management solutions and services provider in the PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) market. Peak PACE Solutions will become Peak Health Plan Management Services, and operate as a service of Capstone Performance Systems , a subsidiary of TRHC.\n“Capstone’s mission is to help our client organizations succeed fiscally in a compliant manner,” said Capstone CEO Richard Schamp, MD. “We do this by delivering meaningful analysis to understand the complexities of Medicare risk adjustment, optimizing compliance and revenue. Having worked for years collaboratively with Peak, we look forward to integrating with Peak Health Plan Management Services and further enhancing TRHC value to PACE organizations.”\nPACE is a federal program, with 250 centers located in 31 states serving a growing number of eligible Medicare and Medicaid participants. Peak performs back-office functions for PACE organizations, including acting as a Third Party Administrator (TPA) to manage claims from healthcare providers. The company is noted for its staff expertise in the PACE market, including several executive-level staff who previously worked in PACE organizations.\n“We’re excited to have the opportunity to join the TRHC family and work alongside Capstone, which shares our commitment to the PACE market,” said Patty Bailey, CEO of Peak Health Plan Management Services. “Our services are complementary, and as one company we can offer a full range of solutions backed by our extensive experience in PACE.”\nPeak PACE Solutions was founded in 2009 by David Reyes and Ronda Hackbart. Upon making the decision to retire, Reyes and Hackbart indicated their desire to sell Peak to a company familiar with and respectful of PACE. In addition to Capstone, TRHC’s CareKinesis provides pharmacy services to PACE plans across the country.\nAbout Tabula Rasa HealthCare\nTRHC (NASDAQ:TRHC) is a leader in providing patient-specific, data-driven technology and solutions that enable healthcare organizations to optimize medication regimens to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, lower healthcare costs and manage risk.
