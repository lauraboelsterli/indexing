    "text": "May 26, 2018 / 5:21 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Rugby-Saracens just too good, says beaten Exeter coach Mitch Phillips 4 Min Read\nLONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - “Too good”: Exeter coach Rob Baxter became the latest in a long line of losing coaches who found himself forced to concede that his team had simply come up against a superior force after Saracens triumphed 27-10 in the Premiership final on Saturday.\nAfter Saracens crushed Wasps 57-33 in the semi-final, losing captain Joe Launchbury admitted: “We just couldn’t handle them,” and Baxter was singing from the same hymn sheet on Saturday after the defending champions were outplayed in just about every department other than effort and commitment.\n“Fair play to Saracens, they did a better job than us today,” said Baxter. “I don’t think it was our best performance, but it would be churlish to focus on that as today was more about Saracens and the pressure they created that we didn’t really deal with.\n“We matched them physically but moment to moment they came up with so many more things. We went off script a bit at times but you have to credit the opposition for knocking us out of our stride.\n“It’s been a good season but this leaves a bitter taste in the mouth and that’s great –- we need to feel that, the players need to feel that, so we can build a team that will challenge.”\nThey are not that far away, of course, and beat Saracens in last year’s semi-finals but, freed from the distraction of a European final for the first time in three seasons, the London club really did look like they were on another level on Saturday.\nOnly in the opening 12 minutes, when Exeter’s trademark pick-and-go approach had them 3-0 up and with Saracens barely touching the ball, did it feel like a contest.\nWithin seven minutes of the second half Sarries were 19-3 up after two tries for departing winger Chris Wyles and one for Billy Vunipola and then they backed their defence, which has been the best in Europe for three years and was extraordinary on Saturday.\nOnly when down to 14 men after a yellow card for Schalk Brits were they pierced by Gavin Steenson and, stung by the affront, they roared back and had the last word through Nathan Earle. “That was an absolutely brilliant performance — the effort the players put in was extraordinary,” said Saracens director or rugby Mark McCall after the team’s third win in four years. “We were very good with the ball and we kept them away from our 22 for the most part. I think that’s our best performance in a final because of the effort the players put in. “\nIn a team oozing experience and trophy-winning pedigree, barely a player put a foot wrong defensively but, leading by example as ever, was Brad Barritt, who was absolutely immense.\n“The beauty of this group is that we don’t make it about the championships, we make it about the process,” said the former England centre. “It’s all about collective leadership. We all feed off each other and inspire each other.\n“I’ve no doubt next season the boys will come back as hungry as they have been in the last five.” (Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Clare Fallon)",
