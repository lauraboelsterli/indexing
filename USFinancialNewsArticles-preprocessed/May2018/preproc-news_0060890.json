    "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Strategic private security firm 360 Group International, Inc. today announced that Lorenzo Robert Savage III, a retired senior executive with the U.S. Secret Service, has been named CEO of the company effective immediately. Bill Kirkpatrick, founder of 360 Group and former CEO, will remain President of the firm.\nKirkpatrick said bringing Savage to the company “represents a key strategic development in advancing and expanding the mission of 360 Group International. The company’s ongoing growth and strength of reputation is the result of acquiring some of the most senior-level and experienced security experts in the world combined with best-in-class service to our customers.”\nUnder Mr. Savage’s leadership, 360 Group International is expanding or enhancing its capabilities in many security areas, including cybersecurity assessment and threat analysis. In his prior role, Mr. Savage oversaw the multi-jurisdictional Los Angeles Electronic Crimes Task Force.\n“During a time when demands are increasing for comprehensive security and protection for events, individuals and corporations, I can’t think of a better person than Mr. Savage to lead 360 Group International,” Kirkpatrick said.\nMr. Savage most recently served as Special Agent in Charge of the Los Angeles Field Office after being appointed to the Senior Executive Service. In this role, he oversaw all Secret Service protective, investigative and intelligence investigations, tactical operations, and administrative programs while maintaining optimal security and safety levels for the third largest of the Secret Service’s 42 field offices. Mr. Savage began his Secret Service career in 1993 as a special agent assigned to the Washington Field Office and since then has steadily risen through the ranks. He has served in numerous managerial assignments, including directing the inner security perimeter for President George W. Bush. Mr. Savage received the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary’s Award of Excellence as the event coordinator for the 2011 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders’ Meeting comprised of 21 World Leaders, including the President of the United States, held in Hawaii.\nBased in Beverly Hills, 360 Group International is considered a premier protection and security agency. The company’s senior leadership team includes some of the country’s most experienced and respected law enforcement and security professionals, many of whom have been involved in international diplomatic security, federal law enforcement task forces, surveillance and counter-intelligence operations and other high-level security matters. The company consistently tailors its risk assessment programs to accommodate and forecast its clients’ security concerns.\nSpecialized, coordinated risk assessments by 360 Group International help identify, understand, and counter threats to corporate entities, executives and high net worth individuals and families. The company is proud of its highly-trained security personnel and the ability to provide the highest caliber of service to clients worldwide. They provide services to domestic and international organizations that require either operational security services or individually tailored training packages.\nMr. Kirkpatrick’s leadership contributed to 360 Group’s significant growth in recent years. Separating the CEO and President responsibilities will allow Mr. Savage to focus on strategic initiatives and expansion of services. As President, Mr. Kirkpatrick will work closely with Mr. Savage to further expand the company’s strategic capabilities. Mr. Kirkpatrick will continue to direct key staff and assignments for threat assessment analysis, investigations, rapid response reaction and event security. During his tenure, Mr. Kirkpatrick routinely coordinated with the U.S. Secret Service, military and law enforcement officials, as well as foreign government agencies that protect heads of state and other officials. He managed thousands of protective details for the world’s most prominent public figures.\nAbout 360 Group International\n360 Group International is an elite security firm providing corporate and executive protection, event security, threat assessments and security consulting to individuals, companies and government agencies around the world. The team includes former law enforcement professionals, military specialists and members of the intelligence community with the experience, international resources and training for current and emerging areas of security.
