Tennis - ATP World Tour Masters 1000 - Italian Open - Foro Italico, Rome, Italy - May 14, 2018 Serbia's Novak Djokovic in action during his first round match against Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov REUTERS/Max Rossi\nDjokovic has struggled to rediscover his best form since returning from a troublesome elbow injury and has not reached the quarter-finals of a tournament since last year’s Wimbledon.\nThe Serb was beaten by Briton Kyle Edmund in the second round of the Madrid Open last week, but turned in a convincing display to see off Dolgopolov in under an hour in Rome, returning deep and controlling play from the baseline.\nDjokovic plunged to 18th in the latest world rankings released on Monday, but is optimistic he can go deep in this year’s tournament, where he finished runner-up last year.\n“Today’s match encourages me to move forward and hopefully I can get a few more matches in Rome than I have in the last couple months,” said the four-times Italian Open champion.
