Meetings, off-sites, conferences, launches, presentations, group calls—gatherings are what organizations do. The problem is that too many of these events are an ineffective use of people’s time.\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way. A few small changes can have an enormous effect on how people feel about meetings, how they interact at them and what they take away. Some years ago, as part of my advisory work, I set out to learn the secrets of the most transformative gatherings. I interviewed dozens of organizers—including a choreographer from Cirque du Soleil, a Japanese tea ceremony master, a director of an Arab-Israeli summer camp and a conference curator—to understand how they create galvanizing, generative moments. Here are a few of those lessons:\nSet the stage. Whether it’s your weekly meeting or your annual off-site, the culture of a gathering takes shape early, often well before the event. Give your gathering a fresh, specific name. Is it a sales meeting, or a How to Crush It This Quarter Meeting? Language and tone give people cues about what to expect.\nAnd try to prime attendees for any special expectations right from the outset. If you are planning a session on mentorship in your firm and you need people to show up with their guards down, send out an email ahead of time that includes real, heartfelt testimonials from three senior leaders sharing specific examples of how a mentor helped them.\nLet everyone see and be seen. In high-pressure environments, people often want to get right to business. Many surgeons, for instance, want to start operating immediately, skipping over formalities like introducing themselves to their team. Yet a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine a decade ago found that when surgical teams took time to do such things as greeting each other and sharing their concerns about what might go wrong, the likelihood of complications and deaths fell by 35%.\nYour meeting may not have life-or-death stakes, but it’s still helpful for everyone to see who’s in the room and to know why. Set a norm that everyone in attendance is supposed to be there and has an equal right to speak. For meetings of 10 or fewer, give everyone a chance to address the whole room early on, by sharing their name and perhaps some personal information relevant to the business at hand. When a global health-care company that a friend of mine worked with hosted a meeting to review a maternal mortality initiative, the organizers asked each of the participants to share one unexpected thing about their own mothers.\nMore Essays\nGive Processed Food a Break May 4, 2018 We’ve Got to Stop Meeting Like This: Tips for Better Workplace Gatherings May 4, 2018 The Danger of Constant Impeachment Talk May 4, 2018 The Teenage Social-Media Trap May 4, 2018 A #MeToo Divorce Debate in the Philippines April 27, 2018 Issue pop-up rules. Creative or even amusing rules that apply to a particular event can change how people interact and what they create. Consulting for a company in Asia, I found that executives were calling clients during the breaks in an all-day meeting, re-entering the meeting late and disrupting everyone. So I instituted a rule: Anyone coming back late had to do 10 push-ups on the spot. It was a stunt, but the bigger point was to encourage the executives to start taking their obligations to their colleagues as seriously as they took their duties to their clients.\nCause good controversy. One of the biggest problems with business meetings is that all the risk has been wrung out of them. The responsible harnessing of good controversy—handling with care the hot-button issues that we prefer to avoid—is one of the most difficult and important duties of a leader. But good controversy rarely happens organically. It needs to be engineered.\nA few years ago, I facilitated a gathering for an architecture firm that needed to make a tough long-term choice: to remain a traditional creator of buildings, or to change its focus to “experience design,” that is, how people navigate through a space. But the firm’s culture was so polite that no one would debate the issue. So I set up a cage match: We threw towels around two architects and asked them to argue each side. Everyone else had to choose their preferred side. This helped the firm get closer to a decision. It also helped the team see how a peace-at-all-costs culture made them ambivalent, and how learning to be more (respectfully) argumentative could be healthy.\nIn the end, changing the way a company gathers can go beyond just that meeting or event. It can help change the larger culture: If it can be done in one gathering, why not across the whole enterprise?\n—Ms. Parker is the founder of Thrive Labs, an advisory firm, and author of “The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters,” to be published by Riverhead on May 15.\nRelated reading\nNetworking for Actual Human Beings How to Succeed in Business?
