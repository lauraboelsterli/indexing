(Nasdaq:HBIO), or the Company, a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of solutions to advance life science, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are excited with the results we announced today, starting the year off on a positive note,” said Jeffrey A. Duchemin, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our topline and bottomline growth was driven by DSI and the performance of our electrophysiology product lines. We have begun realizing revenue and cost synergies between DSI and the legacy Harvard Bioscience business, and are excited about the progress we’ve made to date and the prospects of synergies and cross-selling opportunities in the future.”\nFirst Quarter Results\nRevenue, as measured under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $26.8 million, an increase of approximately 48.0%, or $8.7 million, compared to revenue of $18.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nRevenue, on a non-GAAP basis, which includes revenue generated by Denville Scientific, Inc., or Denville, for the periods presented prior to its sale, and excludes purchase accounting adjustments, was $27.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of approximately 15%, or $3.5 million, compared to revenue of $24.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue and changes in revenues, refer to Exhibit 4 below.\nNet loss, as measured under GAAP, was $4.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a loss of $1.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2017. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was comprised of a $5.9 million loss from continuing operations and $1.8 million income from discontinued operations. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was comprised of a $0.7 million loss from continuing operations and a $0.3 million loss from discontinued operations.\nIncluded in the GAAP net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are purchase accounting expenses related to the Data Sciences International, or DSI, acquisition, transaction costs related to the DSI acquisition and Denville sale, all of which are partially offset by the gain on sale of Denville reported in discontinued operations.\nNet income, on a non-GAAP basis, was $0.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP net income, and between GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, refer to Exhibits 7 and 8 below, respectively.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nAs of today, the Company is amending its financial guidance for full year 2018 by tightening the expected ranges for both revenue and diluted earnings per share. The Company now expects 2018 revenue to be between $120 million and $123 million. This compares to the Company’s prior guidance of between $118 million and $123 million, which was previously issued on January 22, 2018 and reaffirmed on March 1, 2018.\nThe Company now expects to report full-year 2018 GAAP diluted loss per share of approximately $0.10 to $0.13 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.20 to $0.23. This compares to the Company’s prior guidance of full-year 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.03 to $0.07 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.19 to $0.23, which was previously issued on January 22, 2018 and reaffirmed on March 1, 2018.\nThe Company may incur charges, realize gains, or experience other events in 2018 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance. Refer to Exhibit 9 below for a reconciliation between the GAAP diluted loss per share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance.\nWebcast and Conference Call Details\nHarvard Bioscience will be hosting a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 pm ET.
