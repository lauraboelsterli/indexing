The stock jumped 6.1 percent on Sunday, after announcing an agreement with Albilad Capital to sell 90 housing units for 1.1 billion riyals ($293 million).\nAl Rajhi Bank slipped 0.6 percent to 82.8 riyals ($22.1). Morgan Stanley cut the bank’s price target to 90.5 riyals from 92 riyals, keeping its overweight rating.\nPetrochemical giant SABIC lost 0.6 percent, following Tuesday’s gain of close to 3 percent, as oil prices dropped on the possibility of higher OPEC output.\nNational Commercial Bank, the largest bank in the kingdom by assets, jumped 1.6 percent and Dar Al Arkan gained 1.8 percent after it said on Monday it had repaid a 1.7 billion riyal ($450 million) sukuk issue, which is due on Thursday.\nShares in Saudi Arabian appliance maker and distributor Shaker climbed 3.6 percent to 11.1 riyals. Its trading volume was the highest since March 2017.\nThe company said its energy efficiency solutions subsidiary Energy Services Co signed a memorandum of understanding with Signify, formerly known as Philips Lighting, to conduct efficiency studies and retrofitting across Saudi Arabia, with a focus on LED lighting.\nThe Dubai index lost 0.9 percent, as profit taking ended a two-day rally that had been supported by a government decision to grant residency visas of up to 10 years to investors and specialists.\nEmaar Properties fell 1.5 percent to 5.2 dirhams. Property stocks had enjoyed a particular boost from the decision on residency visas.\nEmirates NBD lost 1.9 percent, following nearly 7 percent gains a day earlier after announcing it had agreed to buy Turkish lender Denizbank for $3.2 billion.\nIn Abu Dhabi, the index rose 1.3 percent on a 4.3 percent jump by First Abu Dhabi Bank and a 2.2 percent increase by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.\nEmirates Telecom and Aldar Properties lost 0.9 percent and 1.4 percent respectively.\nIn Qatar, the index was flat. Qatar Islamic Bank rose 1.5 percent and Industries Qatar added 0.2 percent.\nEgypt’s main index closed flat to high, after wide declines on Monday. The Index has lost 9.3 percent since hitting a record high on April 26. SAUDI ARABIA\n* The index shed 0.1 percent to 8,039 points. DUBAI\n* The index lost 0.9 percent to 2,947 points. ABU DHABI\n* The index rose 1.3 percent to 4,586 points. QATAR\n* The index inched up 0.1 percent to 9,000 points. KUWAIT\n* The index was down 0.7 percent to 4,718 points. BAHRAIN\n* The index was up 0.1 to 1,267 points. OMAN\n* The index was down 0.5 percent to 4,557 points. EGYPT\n* The index was flat closing at 16,663 points. $1 = 3.6728 UAE dirham $1 = 3.75 Saudi riyals Reporting by Marwa Rashad; Editing by Davide Barbuscia and David Stamp",
