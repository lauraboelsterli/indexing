Activists from Congress party hold a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder as they shout slogans during a protest against the rise in fuel prices, in Mumbai, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\nPrices of diesel and petrol in India have surged to a record high, stoking opposition criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration for causing hardship to ordinary people.\nRising global crude oil prices are largely behind the surge, but fuel is also heavily taxed by India’s state and central authorities, accounting for about 40-50 percent of the retail cost of petrol and diesel.\nIn Delhi, petrol costs 77.47 rupees ($1.13) a litre and diesel sells at 68.53 rupees a litre.\n($1 = 68.3850 Indian rupees)",
