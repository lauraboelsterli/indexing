    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday gave the green light to his ally the League to try to form a government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, but said his own party would not support the coalition.\nForza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi smiles as League party leader Matteo Salvini (not seen) speaks following a talk with Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale palace in Rome, Italy, April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi His announcement could open the way for a new government to take office within days, ending nine weeks of political stalemate in Italy following inconclusive March elections.\n5-Star has offered to forge a coalition with the far-right League on condition it abandons its long-time partner Berlusconi. League leader Matteo Salvini has refused to do that without the approval of his veteran ally.\n“It certainly won’t be us who imposes vetoes,” Berlusconi said in a statement, adding that although he would not support this new coalition in parliament, his partnership with the League would still continue at a local level.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer\n ",
