    "text": "PRINCETON, N.J., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mikros Systems Corporation (OTCQB:MKRS), an advanced technology company specializing in electronic systems technology for advanced maintenance in military, industrial and commercial applications, today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2,490,660 compared to $1,754,973 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $735,687, or 42%. The increase was due primarily to increased revenue from engineering contracts, and the receipt of additional contracts for engineering services, support, repairs and calibration services.\nCosts of sales were $1,177,032 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $651,536 in the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $525,496, or 81%. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales increased to 47% as compared to 37% during the three months ended March 31, 2017, due primarily to a change in the mix of costs in 2018, specifically increases in direct labor, material and subcontract costs related to engineering service contracts. Engineering costs increased 24% to $451,678 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $408,903 in the first quarter of 2017 due to increases in salaries, recruiting costs, and incentive compensation incurred in connection with the growth of the engineering department. General and administrative expenses increased 10% to $451,678 in the first quarter of 2018 from $408,903 in first quarter of 2107 due primarily to increased bid and proposal costs, insurance costs, and professional fees.\nMikros reported net income of $153,305 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 representing a 70% increase over first quarter 2017 net income of $62,998.\nDuring the quarter, the Company continued to hire additional engineers. The Mikros Manufacturing and Depot Center in Largo, FL expanded operations and is operating at near full capacity servicing ADEPT units cycling through the U.S. Navy fleet.\n“After a very successful 2017, we maintained our momentum and delivered another very strong quarter for our stockholders,” stated Chief Executive Officer Tom Meaney. “For the fourth straight quarter, we reported increased revenues and profits over the comparable period of the prior year. During the quarter, we increased our cash reserves by 20% and generated multiple orders under our $80 million of IDIQ contracts with the Department of Defense. After completing the expansion of our research and development office in Fort Washington, PA and bulking up our engineering and project management staffs, we are well positioned to take operations to the next level during the remainder of 2018.”\nMikros President Mark Malone added, “We continue to see opportunities to expand our business in both the defense and commercial markets. In this regard, we have expanded our bid and proposal capabilities and have allocated additional R&D resources to develop commercial applications of our core technology.”\nAdditional information regarding the Company’s financial data may be found in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
