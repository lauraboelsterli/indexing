In this role, Bain will focus on building and expanding partnership across the industry. Prior to joining ParkMobile, Bain served as the Chief Operating Officer of Parking Panda, where he was instrumental in building the business and the integration of the company with SpotHero, following its acquisition in 2017. Bain was also named one of the \"40 Under 40\" by the National Parking Association. Brad Goldman takes on the role of Vice President of Analytics and Insights. Goldman will focus on leveraging the data from ParkMobile's +60 million annual transactions to provide actionable insights for clients and do deeper analysis into key market trends. Goldman joins ParkMobile from Cox Automotive where he spent 16 years in a variety of data and analytics leadership roles.\nAdditionally, the team is continuing to enhance its Sales and Account Management organization under the leadership of David Hoyt, Senior Vice President of Sales and Account Management. David Holler is being promoted to Vice President of Sales and Brooke Feldman to Director of Account Management. The sales organization has also added two new experienced leaders to the team:\nAndrew Harman joins the company as Vice President of Sales and will be responsible for expanding the footprint of the ParkMobile reservations platform. Harman brings over 17 years of industry experience to ParkMobile. Prior to joining the company, Harman worked for T2 Systems where he was the Director of National Accounts and Channel Partnerships. Zachary Cook joins ParkMobile as Regional Sales Manager. Prior to ParkMobile, Cook held senior positions at iParq, WinPark and Arizona State University. He also serves as the Director of the Southwest Parking & Transportation Association (SWPTA).\nThese new hires and promotions come after a successful Q1 for ParkMobile that saw the company grow 60% year-over-year and expand into 700 new locations across the country. In the first two months of Q2, this strong momentum has continued with the expansion of the ParkMobile service into several large markets including the City of Berkeley, CA and Montgomery County, MD.\n\"2018 has been a great year for ParkMobile and there are no signs of slowing,\" said Jon Ziglar, CEO of ParkMobile. \"These key new hires and promotions will help us effectively scale the business for future growth. It's great to see that we are able to consistently attract top talent from inside and outside the parking industry. I'm excited to welcome James, Brad, Andrew and Zachary to our team.\"\nParkMobile will be exhibiting June 3-6 at the 2018 IPI Conference & Expo in Orlando, FL.
