The new facility also extends our geographical reach and accelerates our market penetration beyond our established Northeast base, evidenced by our strong and consistent growth from Southwest, Central, North and South China.\"\n\"The Sichuan facility substantially expands the footprint of our auto business in China and while we expect that automotive applications will continue to be our core business, the new facility includes precision equipment which will enable us to diversify our product platform into such high-growth verticals as ships, high-speed rail, airplanes, bio-degradable materials, medical-grade materials, food packaging, electronic equipment, electrical products, alternative energy applications and power devices, which will help to propel the Company's growth.\"\n\"Our new facility in Dubai also extends our specialized high-tech products into an important new market. We are planning to complete installing 45 production lines with 12,000 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of May 2018, and an additional 50 production lines with 13,000 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of 2018. This will bring the total installed production capacity in our Dubai facility to 25,000 metric tons. The Dubai facility will target high-end products for the overseas market and will ultimately enable more active inroads into the markets of Europe, the Middle East, Russia and other international regions with several global top customers in automotive sector.\"\n\"China XD continues to value our deep working relationships with our customers above all, and is committed to creating value with our culture of hard work and innovation. We anticipate that the continued execution of our strategic plan supported by an increase in our production capacity, our entry into new markets, a diversified customer base and a diversification with international sales will help to generate business growth for years to come. For fiscal 2018, we are reiterating our financial guidance of between $1.2 and $1.4 billion in revenue, $90 and $110 million in net income \", Mr. Han concluded.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues were $310.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $237.8 million for the same period of 2017, representing an increase of $72.7 million, or 30.6%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase of 24.4% in sales volume, a depreciation of USD against RMB by 8% and offset by a decrease of 3% in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared with those of last year.\nPRC domestic revenues increased by $72.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period of 2017, as a result of an increase of 24.4% in sales volume, a depreciation of USD against RMB by 8%and offset by a decrease of 3% in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared with those of last year. According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, automobile sales in China increased by 2.8% for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017. An improvement in macroeconomic conditions since 2017 has improved business conditions and eased pricing pressures. Driven by accelerating growth of 7.6% in Northeast China, 184% in Central China, 124% in South China, 89% in Southwest China, 26% in North China, and 22% in East China, our domestic sales during the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by 30.5% as compared to the same period of the prior year. As for the RMB selling price, the Company also implemented a marketing strategy of offering lower-end products with lower RMB pricing to further penetrate the new regional markets in Central China and Southwest China.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, revenues from overseas market was US$54,854 as compared to nil of that in 2017.The Company has tried to develop new customers overseas besides the existing oversea customer. The sales with this customer was suspended due to account receivable balance overdue situation. As of March 31, 2018, the customer has an outstanding balance of US$48.3 million, including US$5.8 million was 3-6 month past due, US$32.4 million was overdue for less than 3 month. The customer expected to pay off the outstanding balance by June 2018. As the account receivable balance was overdue, the Company suspended sales to the customer in 2018.\nPremium products (PA66, PA6, Plastic Alloy, PLA, POM and PPO) in total accounted for 81.1% of revenues in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 81.3% for the same period of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company continued to shift production mix from traditional lower-end products to higher-end products such as PA66, PA6, Plastic Alloy, and PLA, primarily due to (i) greater growth potential of advanced modified plastics in luxury automobile models in China, (ii) the stronger demand as a result of promotion by the Chinese government for clean energy vehicles and (iii) better quality from end consumer recognition of higher-end cars made by automotive manufacturers from Chinese and Germany joint ventures, and U.S. and Japanese joint ventures, which manufacturers tend to use more and higher-end modified plastics in quantity per vehicle in China.\nGross profit was $53.9 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $34.8 million in the same period of 2017, representing an increase of $19.1 million, or 54.9%. Our gross margin increased to 17.4% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 14.6% for the same quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher gross margin of higher-end products in domestic market for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to that of the prior year.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were US$ 8.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to US$7.1 million in the same period in 2017, representing an increase of 25.4%, or US$1.8 million. This increase is primarily due to the increase of US$0.9 million salary and welfare which was due to the increase in the number of management and general staff from supporting departments and the increase of US$0.9 million in professional fee.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $5.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $5.9 million for the same period of 2017, representing a decrease of $0.9 million, or 15.3%. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of raw materials used by HLJ Xinda Group. As of March 31, 2018, the number of ongoing research and development projects was 326.\nOperating income was $38.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $21.3 million for the same period of 2017, representing an increase of $17.6 million, or 82.6%.This increase is primarily due to increased gross profit, lower research and development expenses, partially offset by a higher G&A expenses and selling expenses.\nNet interest expense was $10.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net interest expense of $8.8 million for the same period of 2017, representing an increase of $1.8 million, or 20.5%. This increase is primarily due to (i) the increase of average short-term and long-term loan balance in amount of US$854.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to US$785.4 million for the same period in 2017, partially offset by (ii) the decrease of interest expense resulting from the average loan interest rate decreased to 4.72% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4.77% of the same period in 2017 ; (iii) the increase of average deposit balance in amount of US$626.8 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to US$485.3 million for the same period in prior year ; (iv) the increase of interest income resulting from the average deposit interest rate increased to 1.5% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 1.2 % of the same period in 2017.\nIncome tax expense was $6.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, representing an effective income tax rate of 24.5%, compared to income tax expense of $3.6 million in the same period of 2017, representing an effective income tax rate of 26.4%. The effective income tax rate reduced from 26.4% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 to 24.5% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018is primarily due to the decrease of continuous operating loss occurred in oversea subsidiaries, and partially offset by the decrease of Sichuan Xinda's profit before tax (\"PBT\")ratio. The effective income tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 differs from the PRC statutory income tax rate of 25% primarily due to Sichuan Xinda's preferential income tax rate and R&D 50% additional deduction of the major PRC operating entities.\nNet income was $19.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $9.9 million for the same period of 2017, representing an increase of $9.2 million, or 92.9%. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 were $0.29, compared to $0.15 per basic and diluted share for the same period of 2017. The average number of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share in the current quarter was 49.7 million compared to 49.5 million shares for basic and diluted earnings per share in the prior year period.\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $49.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $34.0 million for the same period of 2017, representing an increase of $15.6 million, or 45.9%. For a detailed reconciliation of EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to its nearest GAAP equivalent, please see the financial tables at the end of this release.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $564.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and time deposits, a decrease of $43.3 million or 7.1% as compared to $608.1 million as of December 31, 2017. As of the March 31, 2018, working capital was $110.1 million (current assets minus current liabilities) and the current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) was 1.1, as compared to the current ratio of1.0 as of December 31, 2017. Stockholders' equity as of March 31, 2018 was $761.6 million, an increase of $48.8 million or 6.8% as compared to $712.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAccounts receivable decreased by 36.3% or US$108.6 million due to the management efforts to collect outstanding balances due from the domestic customers. Inventories increased by 32.1% as a result of more purchases of the raw materials and the Company's strategy to stock up the finished goods for the upcoming orders. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by 22.5% or US$32.5 million as Sichuan Xinda received the refund of prepayment from an equipment supplier in January 2018. Prepayments to equipment and construction suppliers increased by 17.9% or US$34.2 million because HLJ Xinda Group prepaid to an equipment supplier for purchase equipment for the industrial project of upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics. The aggregate short-term and long-term bank loans decreased by 7.9% due to the repayments of the loans. We define the manageable debt level as the sum of aggregate short-term and long-term loans, and notes payable over total assets. We expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations, capital expenditures and other commitments in the next 12 months primarily with our cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and bank borrowings.\nFinancial Guidance and Business Outlook\nThe Company reiterates its financial guidance for fiscal 2018 to range between $1.2 and $1.4billion in revenue. Gross margin in fiscal 2018 is expected to remain stable as compared to that of fiscal 2017. The Company project net income to range between $90and$110million.
