The utility’s installed capacity rose 3 percent from a year earlier.\nIn Portugal, EDP incurred losses from a government-imposed reduction in the final compensation paid to the former monopoly for giving up some long-term power-purchase deals, an increase of clawback tax in August 2017, and higher costs of the so-called social tariff for low-income households.\nWithout these effects, EBITDA would have risen 2 percent, the company said.\nEDP said EBITDA at its Brazilian unit rose 18 percent in local currency, but fell 1 percent in euros due to a sharp depreciation of the Brazilian real.\nOn Wednesday, EDP’s wind energy subsidiary EDP Renewables posted a 39 percent rise in quarterly profit thanks to some asset sales, but its revenues remained flat.\nEDP shares closed 1 percent higher on Thursday before the results were announced, outperforming the broader market in Lisbon, up 0.2 percent.\n$1 = 0.8403 euros Reporting by Andrei Khalip; Editing by Mark Potter\n ",
