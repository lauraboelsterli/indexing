    "text": "Washington right-hander Max Scherzer went seven innings for his major league-leading seventh victory and Trea Turner and Anthony Rendon homered as the Nationals beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-1 at Chase Field on Friday.\nScherzer (7-1) gave up four hits and one run, and he retired the final 15 he faced after David Peralta homered to lead off the third inning. Scherzer struck out 11 and did not walk a batter as the Nationals won for the 11th time in 13 games.\nPeralta had two of Arizona’s five hits, but the Diamondbacks got only one runner on base after Peralta’s homer. Sean Doolittle pitched around a one-out single in the ninth inning by Paul Goldschmidt for his eighth save.\nThe Diamondbacks have lost three in a row and six of nine and are in danger of losing their first series of the season after dropping the first two games of this four-game set. They are 10-0-2 in series.\nArizona right-hander Matt Koch (2-1) gave up seven hits and three runs in eight innings, the longest start of his career. Koch has faced Clayton Kershaw, Justin Verlander and Scherzer is his last three starts. Arizona won the first two.\nTurner hit the eighth pitch of the game for his seventh career leadoff homer to give the Nationals a 1-0 lead.\nPeralta singled and Jarrod Dyson beat out a bunt single, and the runners took second and third on a throwing error by Scherzer with no outs in the first inning, but Scherzer got out of it with two strikeouts and a popout.\nKetel Marte tripled with one out in the second before Scherzer struck out the final two batters of the inning.\nPeralta tied it at 1 with his leadoff homer in the third inning.\nScherzer gave himself a 2-1 lead with a two-out, ground-rule double in the fourth inning after Andrew Stevenson was hit by a pitch and Pedro Severino singled.\nArizona announced right-hander Troy Scribner will be purchased from Triple-A Reno to oppose Washington right-hander Stephen Strasburg on Saturday. Scribner was 2-1 with a 5.68 ERA in five starts at Reno. He made 10 appearances with the Angels last season.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
