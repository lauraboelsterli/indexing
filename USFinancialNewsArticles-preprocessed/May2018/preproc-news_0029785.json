    "text": "EDGEWOOD, N.Y., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (“CPI Aero®” or the “Company”) (NYSE American:CVU) today announced financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018.\nNote: Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) using the modified retrospective method. Revenue recognition on all of the Company’s contracts did not change materially as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.\nFirst Quarter 2018 vs. First Quarter 2017\nRevenue of $18.2 million compared to $20.0 million; Gross profit of $4.0 million compared to $4.5 million; Pre-tax income of $1.6 million compared to $2.0 million; Net income of $1.3 million compared to $1.2 million; Earnings per diluted share of $0.14 compared to $0.14; and Total backlog at $373.3 million with multi-year defense contracts comprising 78%.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nAnnounced acquisition of Welding Metallurgy, Inc. (“WMI”); Strengthened senior management team with addition of former Northrop Grumman Senior Director of Business Development to lead Company’s defense market strategy and business development; Received a contract extension on the AH-1Z aerostructures program from Bell; and Received new awards from Northrop on structural kits for E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes for Japan.\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company received a commitment letter from BankUnited to amend the BankUnited facility, extending the term of the revolving loan for an additional two years to May 31, 2021, as well as amending the payments under the term loan through May 31, 2021. In addition, BankUnited has agreed to finance the Company’s acquisition of WMI through a new term loan. The amendments to the BankUnited Facility are subject to the lenders’ due diligence and the preparation and execution of formal documentation.\n“We delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of profitability on the strength of strong operational performance and continued cost control,” stated Douglas McCrosson, president and CEO of CPI Aerostructures. “As expected, revenue declined year-over-year and was attributable to lower revenue from F-16 wing components and E-2D outer wing panel kits that offset higher revenue from our Next Generation Jammer pod program with Raytheon and our T-38 Pacer Classic III prime contracts with the U.S. Air Force. The decrease in F-16 program revenue is a timing issue and we expect revenue from this program to grow in fiscal 2018. Revenue for our E-2D wing panel kit program experienced a decline as we transition from one multi-year contract to an anticipated new multi-year contract expected later this year.\n“During the quarter we moved forward with our acquisition of WMI and expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2018,” continued Mr. McCrosson. “Our mutual customers have reacted very positively to the news and we are already developing a business development pipeline that reflects our combined technical capabilities. We remain focused on long-term growth opportunities and expanding our backlog of defense orders that, with our efficient infrastructure, keep us on a trajectory for top-line growth and profitability.”\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss these results as well as recent corporate developments.
