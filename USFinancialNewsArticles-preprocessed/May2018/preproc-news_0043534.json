    "text": "PHOENIX, May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Paul Sorkin, COO and General Counsel of Alliance Creative Group, Inc (OTC Pink:ACGX) (the “Company”) was recently interviewed on Uptick Newswire’s “Stock Day” podcast.\nMr. Sorkin described Alliance Creative Group as a team of experts who have come together to create a full-service product development agency. “If it’s on a shelf or a hook, give us a look,” was Sorkin’s catchy slogan, further explaining that the company primarily designs, creates, and sells boxes, bags, clamshells, blister packs, and other packaging materials for a vast array of products and clients. Over the years, the company has developed a shared resources foundation to help create higher quality product in more efficient ways.\nThe company is currently working on completing 2 years of full financial PCAOB audits. Their growth and revenue increase has made this process more difficult, as they have seven third-party warehouses and almost 20 million dollars per year in revenue and limited resources, but the ultimate result will be more transparency for shareholders and the public. In addition, auditing will allow for larger potential acquisitions or mergers. Alliance Creative Group has hired Brio Financial to help them prepare for 2 years of PCAOB audits, and will hire an audit firm soon. The company’s long term goal is to uplist to a larger exchange, and leave the OTC Markets completely. “Our goal is to be as transparent as possible with these audits, continue to grow, and improve the company so we can take away the shorter’s scare tactics.”\nAccording to Everett Jolly, CEO of Uptick Newswire and host of the “Stock Day” podcast, Alliance Creative Group is the most undervalued company on the OTC Markets. Sorkin was quick to agree, commenting that he hears similar claims regularly. “People don’t take us seriously as a penny stock.” Sorkin believes that joining a higher exchange or merging with a larger company could help give the company some more clout.\nWhen asked about the company’s future, Mr. Sorkin replied, “ We believe that we’ve built a great foundation with a great team. Our philosophy has always been to bring together a team of experts and leverage the shared resources ecosystem, so everyone can focus on their strengths... We greatly appreciate all the support we get from our long-term shareholders.”\nTo hear more Alliance Creative Group, Inc’s auditing process, their major PeopleVine investment, and plans for the future, listen to the full interview at the link address below.\nhttps://upticknewswire.com/interview-ceo-paul-sorkin-of-alliance-creative-group-inc-otcpink-acgx/\nAbout Alliance Creative Group, Inc.\nAlliance Creative Group, Inc.
