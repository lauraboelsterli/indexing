    "text": "WALL, N.J., BIO-key International, Inc. (NASDAQ:BKYI), an innovative provider of biometric authentication and security solutions, today reported results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (Q1’18) and will host a conference call tomorrow, May 16th at 10:00 a.m. EDT (details below) to review its results and outlook.\nHighlights:\nRegional bank selected BIO-key to enable biometric-based employee access to network resources via shared workstations Molding & tool manufacturer secured factory floor and administrative network with BIO-key’s fingerprint biometric solutions Industrial engineering / manufacturing firm deployed BIO-key solution following password-sharing security breach Government defense ministry implemented BIO-key solutions that integrate with Microsoft Active Directory to strengthen network access and reporting Introduced OmniPass Consumer , a password management solution that interoperates with BIO-key fingerprint readers to enable secure, one-touch sign-in to websites and apps. OmniPass is available for/bundled with all BIO-key fingerprint reader models.\nBIO-key's CEO Michael DePasquale commented, \"We continue to see solid growth opportunities across our software, hardware and consumer hardware product lines. However, as we have indicated and expected, BIO-key’s quarterly performance will continue to fluctuate based on the timing of larger software and hardware agreements, creating variability in our year over year and sequential quarterly comparisons as we saw in Q1 2018. For this reason, we continue to focus investors on full year results and provide financial guidance for full year revenue as we believe this longer-term measure presents a more relevant performance metric for our business.\n“We are working on a range of customer opportunities, partnerships and expanded distribution relationships, with a particular focus on opportunities across Asia, all of which support our positive outlook and guidance. Thus, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance in the range of $8M - $12M.\n“In summary, we are experiencing increasing enterprise engagement for the security, convenience, risk and reporting benefits of our biometric solutions. While sales cycles can remain lengthy with certain larger procurements, we are also seeing deployments being fast-tracked as a result of a data breach or a change in senior management priorities. We are active on a range of current opportunities while we continue to invest in new innovative applications for our technology – initiatives that we believe further expand our reach and revenue potential.”\nQ1 2018 Results\nQ1’18 total revenue declined by $577,000 to $841,000 from $1,418,000 in Q1’17, principally due to lower software license and hardware reader revenue, partially offset by a $151,000 contribution from our new line of Bluetooth and Biometric-enabled locks.\nGross margin was negative 40% in Q1’18 compared to 53% in Q1’17, due principally to an increase in non-cash software license amortization to $660,000 in Q1’18 compared to $390,000 in Q1’17. Q1’18 operating expenses decreased 12% due to overhead reduction initiatives as well as reduced R&D expense due principally to the reallocation of certain R&D costs to cost of revenue.\nBIO-key's Q1’18 net loss available to common stockholders was ($2,348,000), or ($0.30) per basic share, compared to ($1,557,000), or ($0.26) per basic share, in Q1’17. Per share results in 2018 and 2017 are based on a weighted average of 7.851 million and 6.095 million basic shares outstanding, respectively, reflecting the impact of the Company’s 1-for-12 reverse split effected in December 2016.\nAt March 31, 2018, BIO-key’s cash and cash equivalents improved to $1.3 million compared to $0.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Guidance:\nBased on specific opportunities in discussion; product development, sales & marketing, partner and distribution initiatives; and recurring anticipated revenue streams, BIO-key is reiterating its full year revenue guidance of $8M-12M. Within this guidance range, BIO-key would expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the full year 2018.\nConversion of Preferred Stock into Common at $3.60 Per Share\nThe following table outlines Q1 and year to date conversions of convertible preferred stock into common stock. BIO-key views these conversions as supportive, positive developments for the Company as they eliminate future convertible preferred dividend requirements on converted shares, enhance BIO-key’s financial strength, and streamline the Company’s capital structure.\n# Conv.\nShares\nConverted to\nCommon Accrued Conv.\nDividends\nConverted into\nCommon Conversion\nPrice Common\nShares\nIssued Date Reduction in\nAnnual\nDividends Series B-1 2.5% Convertible Preferred 60,420 $3.60 1,678,334 3/23/2018 $151,050 Accrued Series B-1 dividends $417,084 $3.60 115,857 3/23/2018 Series A-1 6% Convertible Preferred 39,088 $3.60 1,085,778 4/3/2018 $234,528 Accrued A-1 dividends $330,552 $3.60 91,820 4/3/2018 Totals $ 747,636 2,971,789 $ 385,578\nThe foregoing conversions increased BIO-key’s issued and outstanding common shares by 2.97 million shares to approximately 10.7 million, reduced accrued dividends totaling nearly $750,000, and reduced future annual dividend payments by approximately $386,000.\nConference Call and Webcast Replay\nDate/Time: Wednesday, May 16, 2018 at 10 am ET Dial-In number: 877-418-5460 U.S. or 412-717-9594 (Intl.)
