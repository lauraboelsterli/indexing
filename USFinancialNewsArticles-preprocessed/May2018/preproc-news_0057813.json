    "text": "(Adds share price, compares with estimates)\nMay 23 (Reuters) - Synopsys Inc reported second-quarter revenue on Wednesday that beat analysts' estimates, driven by higher demand from semiconductor clients for its chip design software.\nThe Mountain View, California-based company's shares were up nearly 1 percent in extended trading.\nThe company gets more than half of its revenue from supplying electronic design automation software to chipmakers, which they use to design and test chips.\n\"With the clear drive towards growing artificial intelligence applications and the resulting need for increased data capacity, semiconductor and systems companies are making substantial investments,\" said Aart de Geus, co-CEO of Synopsys.\nSynopsys also forecast third-quarter revenue between $760 million and $785 million, above analysts' estimate of $700.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet income rose to $102.5 million, or 67 cents per share, in the second quarter ended April 30, from $53.3 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.08 per share, matching the analysts' average estimate of $1.08.\nTotal revenue rose 14.2 percent to $776.8 million, beating estimates of $775.6 million.
