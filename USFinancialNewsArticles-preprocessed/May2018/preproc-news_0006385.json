Net income available to common shareholders of $86.4 million, or $1.06 per diluted common share. Non-GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $93.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted common share. Record client assets of $274.7 billion, increased 9% compared with the year-ago quarter and 1% sequentially. Completed the acquisition of Ziegler Wealth Management. Repurchased approximately $2.8 million of the Company’s common stock during the first quarter of 2018. Increase in quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.12 per common share during the first quarter of 2018.\nST. LOUIS, April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stifel Financial Corp. (NYSE:SF) today reported net income available to common shareholders of $86.4 million, or $1.06 per diluted common share on net revenues of $750.4 million March 31, 2018, compared with net income available to common shareholders of $63.2 million, or $0.78 per diluted common share, on net revenues of $675.5 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported non-GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $93.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted common share. The Company’s reported GAAP net income March 31, 2018 was primarily impacted by merger-related expenses. Details discussed below and in the “Non-GAAP Financial Matters” section.\nChairman’s Comments\n“Our first quarter revenue represented the strongest first quarter performance in Stifel’s history, as net revenue of $750 million increased by 11% from the same quarter a year ago. We continue to benefit from growth in recurring revenues, which represented 41% of total revenue in the first quarter, as bank revenue and asset management & service fee revenue were both quarterly records. We also generated 39% growth in investment banking revenue as our advisory revenue nearly doubled and equity underwriting revenue was up nearly 50% from the first quarter of 2017. As a result of our revenue growth and focus on expense management, our non-GAAP pre-tax margins improved to 17.3% from 14.9% a year ago. We continue to have a positive outlook for our business as economic growth continues to accelerate and the operating environment remains solid despite increased volatility. Given the increased diversity of our business model, we believe Stifel remains well positioned for continued growth,” stated Ronald J. Kruszewski, Chairman & CEO of Stifel.\nFinancial Highlights (Unaudited) Three Months Ended (in 000s, except per share data) GAAP\n3/31/18 GAAP\n3/31/17 %\nChange GAAP (1)\n12/31/17 %\nChange Non-\nGAAP (2)\n3/31/18 Non-\nGAAP (2)\n3/31/17 %\nChange Net revenues $ 750,358 $ 675,531 11.1 $ 804,085 (6.7 ) $ 750,549 $ 677,515 10.8 Net income/(loss) $ 88,761 $ 65,512 35.5 $ (1,988 ) n/m $ 96,147 $ 61,806 55.6 Preferred dividend 2,344 2,344 — 2,344 — 2,344 2,344 — Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders $ 86,417 $ 63,168 36.8 $ (4,332 ) n/m $ 93,803 $ 59,462 57.8 Earnings per diluted common share $ 1.09 $ 0.81 34.6 $ (0.03 ) n/m $ 1.18 $ 0.77 53.2 Earnings per diluted common share available to common shareholders $ 1.06 $ 0.78 35.9 $ (0.06 ) n/m $ 1.15 $ 0.74 55.4 Compensation ratio 61.0 % 64.6 % 77.1 % 60.5 % 62.3 % Non-compensation ratio 23.0 % 23.7 % 23.0 % 22.2 % 22.8 % Pre-tax operating margin (3) 16.0 % 11.7 % (0.1 )% 17.3 % 14.9 % Brokerage Revenues\nBrokerage revenues, defined as commissions and principal transactions, were $263.6 million, a 9.8% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 0.9% decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThree Months Ended (in 000s) 3/31/18 3/31/17 % Change 12/31/17 % Change Global Wealth Management $ 162,734 $ 171,494 (5.1 ) $ 163,421 (0.4 ) Institutional brokerage: Equity capital markets 48,085 53,820 (10.7 ) 49,628 (3.1 ) Fixed income capital markets 52,738 66,817 (21.1 ) 52,961 (0.4 ) Total institutional brokerage 100,823 120,637 (16.4 ) 102,589 (1.7 ) Total brokerage revenues $ 263,557 $ 292,131 (9.8 ) $ 266,010 (0.9 ) Global wealth management brokerage revenues were $162.7 million, a 5.1% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 0.4% decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInstitutional equity brokerage revenues were $48.1 million, a 10.7% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 3.1% decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Institutional fixed income brokerage revenues were $52.7 million, a 21.1% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 0.4% decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInvestment Banking Revenues\nInvestment banking revenues were $176.4 million, a 39.0% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 24.2% decrease compared with record investment banking revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThree Months Ended (in 000s) 3/31/18 3/31/17 % Change 12/31/17 % Change Capital raising: Global Wealth Management $ 7,688 $ 11,854 (35.1 ) $ 8,899 (13.6 ) Equity capital markets 52,707 35,981 46.5 57,800 (8.8 ) Fixed income capital markets 18,294 26,081 (29.9 ) 42,820 (57.3 ) Institutional Group 71,001 62,062 14.4 100,620 (29.4 ) Total capital raising (4) 78,689 73,916 6.5 109,519 (28.2 ) Advisory fees (4) 97,673 52,936 84.5 123,227 (20.7 ) Total investment banking $ 176,362 $ 126,852 39.0 $ 232,746 (24.2 ) Global wealth management capital raising revenues were $7.7 million, a 35.1% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 13.6% decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Institutional equity capital raising revenues were $52.7 million, a 46.5% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017 and an 8.8% decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Institutional fixed income capital raising revenues were $18.3 million, a 29.9% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 57.3% decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Advisory fee revenues were $97.7 million, an 84.5% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 20.7% decrease compared with record advisory fee revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides accounting guidance on the recognition of revenues from contracts and requires gross presentation of certain costs that were previously offset against revenue. This change was applied prospectively from January 1, 2018 and there is no impact on our previously presented results. The adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in a reduction of beginning retained earnings of $3.9 million after-tax as a cumulative effect of adoption of an accounting change.\nThe impact of adoption is primarily related to investment banking revenues that were previously recognized in prior periods, which would have been deferred as of December 31, 2017 under the new revenue standard.\nWith our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, capital raising and advisory fee revenues are no longer presented net of the related out-of-pocket deal expenses. As a result, capital raising and advisory fee revenues and other operating expenses are higher in the first quarter of 2018 by an identical $8.6 million, with no impact to net income.\nAsset Management and Service Fee Revenues\nAsset management and service fee revenues were a record $195.8 million, a 20.3% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 5.0% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from the comparative period in 2017 is primarily attributable to the growth in the value of fee-based accounts and an increase in interest rates. See asset management and service fee break-down below.\nNet Interest Income\nRecord net interest income of $111.3 million, a 30.8% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 4.2% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInterest income was $137.7 million, a 36.4% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017 and an 8.8% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest expense was $26.5 million, a 66.4% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017 and a 33.2% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compensation and benefits expenses were $457.9 million, which included $3.7 million of merger-related and severance expenses (non-GAAP adjustments). This compares with $436.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $620.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the non-GAAP adjustments, compensation and benefits as a percentage of net revenues were 60.5% in the first quarter of 2018 (non-GAAP measure).\nThree Months\nEnded 3/31/18 Three Months\nEnded 3/31/17 GAAP compensation and benefits $ 457,893 $ 436,387 As a percentage of net revenues 61.0 % 64.6 % Non-GAAP adjustments: (5) Merger-related (3,453 ) (9,805 ) Severance (286 ) (4,535 ) (3,739 ) (14,340 ) Non-GAAP compensation and benefits $ 454,154 $ 422,047 As a percentage of non-GAAP net revenues 60.5 % 62.3 % Non-Compensation Operating Expenses\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, non-compensation operating expenses were $172.9 million, which included merger-related expenses (non-GAAP adjustments) of $6.0 million. This compares with $160.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $184.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the non-GAAP adjustments, non-compensation operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were 22.2% (non-GAAP measure).\nThree Months\nEnded 3/31/18 Three Months\nEnded 3/31/17 GAAP non-compensation expenses $ 172,911 $ 160,125 As a percentage of net revenues 23.0 % 23.7 % Non-GAAP adjustments: (5) Merger-related (6,023 ) (5,325 ) Non-GAAP non-compensation expenses $ 166,888 $ 154,800 As a percentage of non-GAAP net revenues 22.2 % 22.8 % Provision for Income Taxes\nThe GAAP effective income tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was25.8%. This compares with an effective income tax rate of 17.1% for the first quarter of 2017 and (142.4%) for the fourth quarter of 2017. The adjusted non-GAAP effective income tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 25.8%.\nThe provision for income taxes March 31, 2018 was primarily impacted by the tax reform enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 that, among other things, lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the adoption of new accounting guidance during 2017 associated with stock-based compensation.\nThree Months\nEnded 3/31/18 Three Months\nEnded 3/31/17 GAAP provision for income taxes $ 30,793 $ 13,507 GAAP effective tax rate 25.8 % 17.1 % Non-GAAP adjustments: (5) Merger-related and severance 2,712 8,412 Other (145 ) — Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation — 16,943 2,567 25,355 Non-GAAP provision for income taxes $ 33,360 $ 38,862 Non-GAAP effective tax rate 25.8 % 38.6 % Conference Call Information\nStifel Financial Corp. will host its first quarter 2018 financial results conference call on Monday, April 30, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.

Specifically, the Company believes that the non-GAAP measures provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating results and business outlook. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures will allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of the business and facilitate a meaningful comparison of the Company’s results in the current period to those in prior and future periods. Reference to these non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance. The non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or as being superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures primarily exclude expenses which management believes are, in some instances, non-recurring and not representative of on-going business.\nA limitation of utilizing these non-GAAP measures is that the GAAP accounting effects of these charges do, in fact, reflect the underlying financial results of the Company’s business and these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing its financial results. Therefore, the Company believes that GAAP measures and the same respective non-GAAP measures of the Company’s financial performance should be considered together.\nThe following table provides details with respect to reconciling net income and earnings per diluted common share on a GAAP basis March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2017 to net income and earnings per diluted common share on a non-GAAP basis for the same period.\nThree Months Ended (in 000s) 3/31/18 3/31/17 12/31/17 GAAP net income/(loss) $ 88,761 $ 65,512 $ (1,988 ) Preferred dividend 2,344 2,344 2,344 Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders 86,417 63,168 (4,332 ) Non-GAAP adjustments: Merger-related (16) 9,667 17,114 9,447 Severance 286 4,535 1,432 Tax reform (17) — — 135,525 Litigation-related (18) — — 15,961 Provision for income taxes (19) (2,567 ) (25,355 ) (37,408 ) Total non-GAAP adjustments 7,386 (3,706 ) 124,957 Non-GAAP net income available to common shareholders $ 93,803 $ 59,462 $ 120,625 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 81,789 80,695 82,267 GAAP earnings per diluted common share (1) $ 1.09 $ 0.81 $ (0.03 ) Non-GAAP adjustments 0.09 (0.04 ) 1.52 Non-GAAP earnings per diluted common share $ 1.18 $ 0.77 $ 1.49 GAAP earnings per diluted common share available to common shareholders (1) $ 1.06 $ 0.78 $ (0.06 ) Non-GAAP adjustments 0.09 (0.04 ) 1.53 Non-GAAP earnings per diluted common share available to common shareholders $ 1.15 $ 0.74 $ 1.47 Footnotes\n(1) GAAP earnings per share December 31, 2017 is calculated using the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding, not fully dilutive shares, as they are anti-dilutive in periods a loss is incurred.\n(2) Reconciliations of the Company’s GAAP results to these non-GAAP measures are discussed within and under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(3) Non-GAAP pre-tax margin March 31, 2018 of 17.3% is calculated by adding merger-related non-GAAP adjustments of $10.0 million to our GAAP income before income taxes of $119.6 million and dividing it by non-GAAP net revenues for the quarter of $750.5 million. Reconciliations of the Company’s GAAP results to certain non-GAAP measures is discussed within and under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(4) Excludes revenue included in the Other segment.\n(5) See further discussion of non-GAAP adjustments under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(6) Computed by dividing annualized net income by average common shareholders’ equity or, in the case of non-GAAP return on common equity, computed by dividing non-GAAP net income by average common shareholders’ equity.\n(7) Computed by dividing annualized net income by average tangible shareholders' equity or, in the case of non-GAAP return on tangible common equity, computed by dividing non-GAAP net income by average tangible shareholders' equity. Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total common shareholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\n(8) Capital ratios are estimates at time of the Company’s earnings release.\n(9) Includes 109, 121, and 112 independent contractors at March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2017, respectively.\n(10) Includes client margin balances held by our broker-dealer subsidiaries and securities-based loans held at Stifel Bank.\n(11) Includes Private Client Group and Trust Business.\n(12) Includes fund networking fees, retirement fees, transaction/handling fees, and ACAT fees.\n(13) Asset management assets included in Private Client Group or Trust accounts.\n(14) Return on assets is calculated based on prior period-end balances for Private Client Group, period-end balances for Asset Management, and average quarterly balances for individual Program Banks.\n(15) Includes net interest, asset management and service fees, and other income.\n(16) Primarily related to charges attributable to integration-related activities, signing bonuses, amortization of restricted stock awards and promissory notes issued as retention, professional fees, and amortization of intangible assets acquired. These costs were directly related to acquisitions of certain businesses and are not representative of the costs of running the Company’s on-going business.\n(17) Primarily related to actions taken by the Company in response to the Tax Legislation that was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 to maximize tax savings.\n(18) Primarily related to costs associated with the Company’s previously disclosed legal matters.\n(19) Primarily related to 1) actions taken by the Company in response to the Tax Legislation that was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 to maximize tax savings; 2) the favorable impact of the adoption of new accounting guidance during 2017 associated with stock-based compensation; and 3) the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets as a result of the enacted Tax Legislation.\nMedia Contact: Neil Shapiro (212) 271-3447\nInvestor Contact: Joel Jeffrey (212) 271-3610\nwww.stifel.com/investor-relations\nSource:Stifel Financial Corp.",
