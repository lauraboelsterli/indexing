May 14, 2018; Detroit, MI, USA; Detroit Tigers right fielder Niko Goodrum (28) hits a three run home run in the eighth inning against the Cleveland Indians at Comerica Park. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\nGoodrum, a rookie utility player, hit a two-run shot off Cleveland starter Carlos Carrasco and added a three-run blast. Goodrum doubled his homer total for the season.\nJose Iglesias had two hits and a run, and John Hicks scored twice for Detroit, which has won three of its past four. The Tigers had lost their past 11 games to their division rival.\nMike Fiers (4-2) held the Indians to one run on three hits with five strikeouts in six innings.\nMariners 1, Twins 0\nDee Gordon scored the lone run and Jean Segura rapped two hits as Seattle notched a victory over Minnesota in Minneapolis.\nAn eighth-inning throwing error by Twins first baseman Logan Morrison on Segura’s sacrifice bunt allowed Gordon to score the decisive run.\nFour Seattle pitchers combined on a four-hitter to send Minnesota to its second straight setback.\nRays 2, Royals 1\nMatt Duffy provided the offense, and Ryan Yarbrough, with support from the bullpen, delivered on the mound as Tampa Bay opened a three-game series with a win at Kansas City.\nDuffy had a pair of RBI singles, driving home C.J. Cron in the first inning and bringing home Adeiny Hechavarria for the go-ahead run in the sixth inning.\nYarbrough allowed one run on five hits and three walks with four strikeouts in five innings. Chaz Roe, Jonny Venters, Sergio Romo, Jose Alvarado and Alex Colome combined to throw four scoreless innings in relief.

Mandatory Credit: Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports\nA’s 6, Red Sox 5\nSean Manaea gave up four runs (three earned) while striking out four over six innings to help Oakland snap a two-game skid with a win at Boston.\nManaea (5-4) pitched the first no-hitter against the Red Sox in 25 years in his last start against them at home on April 21, striking out 10 batters in a 3-0 victory.\nMatt Joyce (2-for-4), Matt Olson (2-for-4) and Khris Davis (2-for-4) each slugged solo homers, and Jonathan Lucroy drove in two runs for Oakland. The Athletics had dropped five of their previous six games. The Red Sox had their two-game winning streak snapped.\nBraves 6, Cubs 5\nOzzie Albies had three hits, including one of Atlanta’s three home runs, to help the Braves earn the victory at Chicago, extending their winning streak to four games.\nAlbies went 3-for-5 to pace a nine-hit Atlanta attack and help the Braves win for the 11th time in their last 12 road games. He led off the game with a solo homer, his 13th, and added a single and a double.\nAtlanta’s other home runs came from Tyler Flowers, a two-run shot in the third, and Jose Bautista, a two-run homer in the fifth.\nBrewers 7, Diamondbacks 2\nLate lineup addition Jonathan Villar contributed a homer, two singles and three runs, Tyler Saladino had an inside-the-park homer, and Christian Yelich hit a tiebreaking single in the seventh inning of Milwaukee’s victory over Arizona in Phoenix. Slideshow (6 Images)\nVillar, added when Ryan Braun was scratched due to right mid-back tightness, homered in the ninth inning after singling and scoring in the second and seventh innings. He helped the Brewers win for the fourth time in five games and the fifth time in seven.\nSaladino homered with one out in the ninth inning, a play on which Arizona center fielder A.J. Pollock dived for the ball but could not get it as it rolled to the fence. Pollock, who ranks second in the NL with 33 RBIs, left the game with an apparent wrist injury.\nAngels 2, Astros 1\nAndrew Heaney allowed one run in eight innings of four-hit pitching, and Justin Upton singled in the game-winner in the sixth inning as Los Angeles outlasted Houston in Anaheim, Calif.\nHeaney (2-2) allowed one run, struck out 10 and walked just one while throwing 100 pitches. He posted four three-up, three-down innings.\nJustin Anderson, who inherited the closer role for Los Angeles when Keynan Middleton hurt his right elbow, gave up two singles in the ninth inning sandwiched around a double play to earn his first major league save.\nRockies 6, Padres 4\nGerardo Parra broke a 3-3 tie with a three-run homer off submarining Japanese reliever Kazuhisa Makita (0-1) in the sixth inning, leading Colorado to a victory at San Diego.\nMakita, who returned from Triple-A El Paso two days ago, gave up back-to-back line-drive singles to Ian Desmond and Chris Iannetta with one out, followed by Parra’s second homer of the season — a 363-foot drive pulled into the right field stands.\nThe blast made a winner of left-handed starter Tyler Anderson (3-1), who allowed the Padres four runs (three earned) on seven hits and a walk with three strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings. Wade Davis earned his 15th save.\nGiants 10, Reds 7\nBrandon Belt contributed a single, a double and a home run to a 14-hit attack that sent San Francisco to a victory over Cincinnati, snapping the Reds’ six-game winning streak.\nBelt singled to open a two-run third, smacked a two-RBI double in a three-run sixth and capped the Giants’ big offensive night with his seventh home run of the season, a solo shot, in the eighth inning.\nGiants starter Chris Stratton (4-3), who worked five innings, benefitted from the offensive assault. He allowed four runs and nine hits, including home runs by Tucker Barnhart, his third, and Scott Schebler, his fifth.\n—Field Level Media",
