    "text": "Reports $2.7M Net Income\nAdjusted EBITDA Year-over-Year Growth Exceeds 100%\nWALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Care.com (NYSE:CRCM), the world's largest online destination for finding and managing family care, today is announcing financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We had a strong first quarter of 2018, with both revenue and EBITDA exceeding our expectations – and generated an incremental $5 million in cash,” said Sheila Lirio Marcelo, Founder, Chairwoman and CEO of Care.com. “As we look ahead to 2018, we will continue to focus on initiatives that we expect will drive long-term profitable growth, with the goal of accelerating our top line in 2019 and beyond.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $47.3 million, an increase of 9% from $43.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue attributable to the US Consumer offering totaled $37.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 5% from $35.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue attributable to the Care@Work and other B2B Offerings, as well as our services in our international markets, totaled $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 24% from $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net income was $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, an improvement of $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, an improvement of $3.6 million. GAAP EPS (Diluted) was $0.05 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.01 in the first quarter of 2017. Q1 GAAP EPS (Diluted) was based on 33.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding versus 31.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP EPS (Diluted) was $0.19 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.07 in the first quarter of 2017. Note that Non-GAAP EPS excludes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation, adjustments relating to preferred stock and other non-recurring items, such as M&A expenses and restructuring costs. The Company ended the quarter with $107.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nBusiness Highlights\nOur total members grew 18% to 28.4 million at the end of Q1 FY’18, compared to 24.0 million in the same period of 2017. Total families grew to 16.2 million at the end of Q1 FY’18, an increase of 19% over the same period of 2017, and total caregivers grew to 12.2 million at the end of Q1 FY’18, an increase of 17% over the same period of 2017.\nFinancial Expectations\nQ2 2018 Guidance Full Year 2018 Guidance Revenue $ 45.7 - $ 46.0 $ 191.0 - $ 193.0 Adjusted EBITDA $ 5.0 - $ 5.3 $ 31.0 - $ 32.0 Non-GAAP EPS ~$0.10 $ 0.65 - $ 0.67 Figures in millions except for Non-GAAP EPS Q2 Non-GAAP EPS based on approximately 38 million weighted average dilutive shares\nFY'18 full year Non-GAAP EPS based on approximately 40 million weighted average diluted shares\nFuture GAAP Net Income and GAAP EPS may be significantly affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, and may also be affected by non-recurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, which we are not able to estimate and which therefore are excluded in the calculation of the Company’s non-GAAP EPS guidance as described in this press release. Due to the nature of any such items, we are not able to estimate their significance, and it is therefore currently not practical to reconcile adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS guidance to the most comparable GAAP measure.\nEarnings Teleconference Information\nThe Company will host a conference call at 8:00 AM ET today to discuss these results. The conference call will be accessible at (877) 407-4018 or (201) 689-8471 (International). The call will also be broadcast simultaneously at http://investors.care.com .

Words such as “plan,” \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"hope,\" \"target,\" \"project,\" \"goals,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" “designed,” variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond the Company's control. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: our ability to grow our membership while leveraging our investment in sales and marketing, our success in converting non-paying members to paying members and extending the length of time that paying members continue to pay for our services, our ability to cross-sell new and existing products and services to our members and to develop new products and services that members consider valuable, our ability to protect our brand and maintain our reputation among our members, and other risks detailed in the Company's other publicly available filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The forward-looking statements included in this press release represent the Company's views as of the date of this press release. The Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its views to change. The Company undertakes no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in the Company’s press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”).\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of the Company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company’s financial statements. The Company provides certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to its operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of the Company’s liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare the Company’s performance to that of other companies.\nThe Company has presented: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. We define adjusted EBITDA as income, which excludes the accretion of preferred stock dividends and issuance costs, as well as: federal, state and franchise taxes, other income (expense), net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, accretion of contingent consideration, merger and acquisition related costs, and other unusual or non-cash significant adjustments, such as impairment and restructuring charges. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, which is based on the Company's estimate of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets. We define non-GAAP net income as income which excludes the accretion of preferred stock dividends, plus stock-based compensation, accretion of contingent consideration, merger and acquisition related costs, and other unusual or non-cash significant adjustments such as impairment and restructuring charges. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, using the treasury stock method.\nThe Company believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of the Company's core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation. Care.com’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company’s operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the Company’s business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results, and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company’s operating performance.\nCare.com, Inc.
