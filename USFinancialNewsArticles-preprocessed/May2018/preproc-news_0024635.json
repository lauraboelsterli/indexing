    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling bounced on Friday as a weak dollar helped the pound recover losses suffered when the Bank of England held rates and cut its economic growth projections.\nFILE PHOTO: British Pound Sterling banknotes are seen in a box at the Money Service Austria company's headquarters in Vienna, Austria, November 16, 2017.REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger The BoE held interest rates steady as expected on Thursday but cut its growth and inflation projections for this year and next.\nThe decision saw sterling fall close to a four-month low against the dollar and left traders sceptical about whether the central bank will hike rates at all this year.\nMarkets a month ago had foreseen a 90 percent chance of a May rate hike but those expectation were dashed by weaker-than-expected data.\n“Looking ahead, I can see potential for volatility on the interest rate front as opinions on the next hike are divided now,” said London-based FX strategist Jane Foley at Rabobank.\n“We know the Bank of England will be very dependent on data and we’re likely to see more Brexit news in months ahead,” Foley said.\nThe pound had rallied in 2018 on the back of optimism that Britain could secure itself a transition deal for when it leaves the European Union next year.\nBut bad weather earlier in the year, which hurt economic momentum, and a bounce in the dollar have reversed sterling’s run higher.\nThe British currency tumbled to $1.35 in recent weeks from its post-Brexit vote highs of close to $1.44.\nAt GMT 1700 the pound was up 0.3 percent at $1.3554 and had increased 0.1 percent against the euro to 88.11 pence.\nFriday’s rise leaves the pound on track for a small weekly rise after three consecutive weeks of falling.\nBoE Governor Mark Carney told BBC television on Thursday that interest rates were likely to rise by the end of this year.\nAnalysts remain wary, though.\n“Our view is that inflation will continue to fall over the reminder of this year and eventually end the year below the two percent target, which will close the door for a rate hike,” said Felix Ewert, forex analyst at SEB.\nOther analysts said that doubts over the BoE’s message would fade if data in the next months showed the British economy gaining momentum.\n“We fully expect the current scepticism of the BoE’s guidance to ebb away, which will provide increased support for the pound as we advance towards the next key policy meeting on 2nd August,” said Lee Hardman, FX strategist at MUFG.\nEditing by William Maclean\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
