You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as \"aim,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"outlook,\" \"potential,\" \"project,\" \"projection,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"seek,\" \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"can,\" \"can have,\" \"likely,\" the negatives thereof and other words and terms.

You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. See \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about the date hereof, for a discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Townsquare Media, Inc. assumes no responsibility to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Definitions\nIn this press release, we refer to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Less Interest, Capex and Taxes, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss Per Share and Adjusted Segment Operating Income which are financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\").\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before the deduction of income taxes, other expense (income) net, interest expense, net, transaction costs, stock-based compensation, net loss (gain) on sale and retirement of assets, business realignment costs, goodwill and other intangible impairment charges, net (loss) income on discontinued operations, net of income taxes, impairment of long lived and intangible assets and . Adjusted EBITDA Less Interest, Capex and Taxes is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less net cash interest expense, capital expenditures and cash paid for taxes. Adjusted Net Loss is defined as net (loss) income before the deduction of income taxes, transaction costs, business realignment costs, impairment of long lived and intangible assets, goodwill and other intangible impairment charges, net loss (gain) on sale and retirement of assets, and net (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Adjusted Net Loss Per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Loss divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted Segment Operating Income is defined as segment operating income before the deduction of , stock-based compensation, impairment of long lived and intangible assets, business realignment costs and goodwill and other intangible impairment charges. These measures do not represent, and should not be considered as alternatives to, net income (loss), segment operating income or cash flows from operations, as determined under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth in the tables below.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), taxation and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense), which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. We use Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share to assess total company operating performance on a consistent basis. We use Adjusted Segment Operating Income to evaluate the operating performance of our business segments. We believe that these measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends, by excluding the effects of transaction costs, net loss (gain) on sale and retirement of assets, business realignment costs, certain impairments, and net (loss) income from discontinued operations. Further, while discretionary bonuses for members of management are not determined with reference to specific targets, our Board of Directors may consider Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Less Interest, Capex and Taxes, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss Per Share and Adjusted Segment Operating Income when determining discretionary bonuses.\nInvestor Relations\nClaire Yenicay\n(203)
